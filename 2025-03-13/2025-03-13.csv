Thousands of jobs to be cut after Keir Starmer announces NHS England will be abolished to ""cut bureaucracy"" and bring management of the health service ""back into democratic control""

Speaking in Hull, the prime minister says the state is ""overstretched"" and ""unfocused""

The move partially reverses a Conservative-led reorganisation of the health service in 2012, which created NHS England, which to handle its day-to-day running

But the government says NHS England has ""burdensome layers of bureaucracy without any clear lines of accountability""

Shadow Health Minister Caroline Johnson has asked if Labour is up to the task of finding NHS savings given its ""failure"" to run the health service in Wales

It's hardly surprising ministers want more direct control of the NHS, given its importance to voters, our political correspondent Henry Zeffman writes

Naomi contacted us to ask has this come out of the blue? 

Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.

Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they weren't in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service. 

NHS England was set up as part of the Andrew Lansley reforms in 2012. As the years have passed, there has been a frustration in government.

When Labour came in, it was clear Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS - he saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy roles that existed in the Department of Health and NHS England.

In recent weeks we've seen NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard saying she was stepping down at the end of the March - and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit. 

So bit by bit we did start to see there was going to be a significant change. This, however, is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.

The first question we're getting from you is on NHS England - asking what the body does and who works there. 

NHS England leads the NHS in England. 

It takes the money provided by the government and funnels it into the different parts of the health service. 

It has therefore been NHS England's job to translate minister's priorities into the services people get on the frontline. 

The body is also responsible for things like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services. 

About 18,000 people work for NHS England and the Department of Health, but we expect this workforce to get cut by 50% after today's announcement. 

We're answering your questions on Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement, with health correspondent Nick Triggle and political correspondent Helen Catt.

Ahead
of his speech this morning, Starmer said in a Daily Telegraph article that “no person's substantive time should be spent on a task
where digital or AI can do it better, quicker and to the same high quality and
standard.”

Big question marks still hang over the risk presented by a
wide variety of AI technologies, while many can speed up certain tasks, note
taking and transcribing interviews or meetings for instance, they still require
human oversight to ensure accuracy.

With many jobs - especially when it comes to running the
country - the devil is often in the detail and the jury is most certainly still
out when it comes to the risks posed by relying on or leaning heavily into AI.

The PM talks about AI in very broad strokes and there's very
little detail about how it will specifically be used.

As we've been hearing, the government has announced NHS England will be scrapped – but what does this mean for patients and the wider NHS?

Our experts will be answering your questions shortly - get in touch:

In some cases a selection of your comments and questions will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it unless you state otherwise. But don't worry, your contact details will never be published. 

Health Secretary Wes Streeting continues to answer questions from MPs in the House of Commons after this morning's announcement that NHS England is set to be scrapped. 

Streeting is touting the benefits of this decision, saying it will lead to “hundreds of millions” in savings and adding that each pound not “wasted” on bureaucracy can be spent on patient care.

Shadow Health Secretary Caroline Johnson, though, asked whether Labour is up to the task given its “failure” to successfully run the NHS in Wales. 

And, Lib Dem MP Alison Bennett emphasised the need to reform social care too, as well as questioning whether legislation would be needed to deliver the plans for change - Streeting suggested it wouldn't. 

We'll continue to bring you analysis of what the decision means for the NHS here, so stick with us.

Helen CattPolitical correspondent

The prime minister says he wants to get rid of over regulation and quangos.

He was scathing about what he calls Westminster's knee-jerk reaction of farming things out to reviews.

Of course one of the criticisms of his government so far has been the number of reviews and quangos it has created - around 20 quangos so far, including Great British Energy.

As a reminder, when we say quangos we are referring to Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisations.

These are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government, and include regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies. 

NHS England leads the NHS in England - which means the PM's announcement only affects this area.

After devolution, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland became responsible for a number of policy areas, one of which was health.

The UK has had devolved governments since the late 1990s, which work alongside the Westminster Parliament.

Former Tory chancellor and health secretary Jeremy Hunt now commends the ""boldness"" of the plan announced today. 

He warns that if this only serves to replace bureaucratic over-centralisation with political over-centralisation ""it will fail"". 

He asks Streeting about getting rid of central targets, and also whether he agrees the care regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), retains a ""vital"" role to call out poor care. 

The health secretary responds that ""democratic accountability matters"". 

He underlines that over-centralisation ""has got to stop"", calling this the ""biggest decentralisation of power"" in the history of the NHS.

Back in the Commons, Liberal Democrats MP Alison Bennett asks Streeting if new legislation is needed to scrap NHS England and if so, when it will be brought forward.

Bennett also emphasises the need to reform social care as part of attempts to fix the NHS and asks where the urgency for this is.

Streeting says much of the change needed to deliver plans can be done without the need for primary legislation - but some new legislation will be needed down the line to enact the government's plan.

""We will work immediately to move forward,"" he says.

On social care, Streeting says the urgency was found with the immediate steps the chancellor took to stabilise the finances of the Department of Health and Social Care, by releasing funding.

Let's briefly dip away from the House of Commons to bring you remarks from the incoming NHS England chair, Dr Penny Dash. 

As a reminder, NHS England is separate to the NHS itself - it's a public body with statutory functions enabling it to oversee the health service. 

Last month, Amanda Pritchard announced she would be stepping down as the head of NHS England after taking up the role in 2021. She called it a ""hugely difficult decision"".

Amanda Pritchard quit as head of NHS England last month

Today, incoming chair Dr Dash says she is ""committed"" to working with colleagues across NHS England to ensure the body begins 2025/26 ""in the strongest possible position to support the wider NHS"".

She adds that she will help lead the work ""to bring together NHSE and DHSC (the Department of Health and Social Care) to reduce duplication and streamline functions.""

Shadow Health Minister Caroline Johnson is now asking questions in the Commons.

She asks how many people will be moved into different roles and lose jobs, and what lessons Labour has learned from its ""failure"" running the NHS in Wales.

Streeting, back on his feet, says there are currently 15,300 staff at NHS England, and 3,300 in the Department of Health and Social Care.

Across both, Streeting says his teams are looking to reduce the overall headcount ""by 50%"". He adds this will mean ""hundreds of millions of pounds worth of savings"". 

""Today we're abolishing the biggest quango in the world,"" Streeting tells the House of Commons. 

He adds that he is ""delighted"" with the ""capable"" leadership team he will be working with to lead NHS England through the transformation.

""Change is hard,"" he adds, but says the Labour government will ""never duck the hard yards of reform"". 

He says there have been a ""number"" of Conservatives who have told him in private they regret the ""2012 reorganisation"". ""None of them acted,"" he said. 

Reforms in 2012 saw the creation of NHS England to run the health service as well as the scrapping of primary care trusts in favour of GP-led clinical commissioning groups to organise local services.

We're still hearing from Streeting in the House of Commons who says that over the next two years NHS England will be brought into the Department of Health entirely.

The reforms set out by the prime minister earlier today will make significant savings of hundreds of millions of pounds a year, he says - money that will go to the frontline of the NHS.

By slashing through layers of red tape and ending the infantilisation of frontline NHS leaders, we will set local NHS providers free to innovate, develop new productive ways of working and deliver better care for patients, Streeting adds.

More from Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who's speaking in the House of Commons off the back of Keir Starmer's Q&A in Hull. 

Streeting says that the decision to scrap NHS England would have been taken even if the Conservatives hadn't left a ""black hole"" in the government's finances. 

""Every pound that is wasted on inefficient bureaucracy in good times or bad is a pound that can't be spent on treating patients faster,"" he says.

""There is always a duty on ministers to get as much value for taxpayers money as is possible. I cannot honestly say that is achievable with the way my department and NHS England are set up today.""

A reminder: You can watch what Streeting has to say by pushing watch live at the top of the page.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting starts by praising the Labour government's actions to ""fix our broken NHS"".

He lists several accomplishments, including delivering two million extra appointments, and ""turning the tide"" on rising waiting lists. 

""There should be no doubt of the scale of the challenge ahead,"" he says, adding there is no time or money to waste.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting is speaking in the House of Commons now, after the PM announced NHS England is being abolished and brought ""back into democratic control"".

Press watch live above to follow along.

In his last remarks before wrapping up this morning's Q&A session, Starmer talks again about the decision to scrap NHS England. 

As a reminder, this is a separate body from the NHS - as our health correspondent Nick Triggle explains. 

Starmer stresses that employees of NHS England are hugely qualified and says the government will not be abandoning anybody as it moves to scrap the body.

But, the PM says, we can't look people who want quicker appointments in the eye and say that we're fearful of taking big decisions.

GB News asks Starmer if it's time to do away with ""woke"" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes.

DEI programmes aim to boost workers from diverse backgrounds.

In the US, President Donald Trump has ordered the shutdown of all federal DEI initiatives, urging the private sector to follow suit.

Starmer says we must use taxpayer money ""wisely"" but says the government will not be ""slashing its commitment to equality"".

He says he's focused on ""stripping away what's unnecessary"".

The prime minister said one in eight young people are not in education or work.

This is borne out by the latest Office for National Statistics data which found that between October and December 2024 around 987,000 people, external aged 16 to 24 years in the UK were not in education, employment or training, around 13.4% of the total

This was an increase of 110,000 on the same period in 2023.

However, the ONS said that the Labour Force Survey, on which that estimate was based, has been unreliable due to a falling response rate and should be treated with “caution”.

Vladimir Zelensky's leadership is coming to an end, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing a senior official in Kiev. The article comes amid growing concern in Washington over Zelensky's legitimacy.

Zelensky's presidential term expired in May 2024. However, he has refused to hold a new election, referring to martial law imposed during the conflict with Russia.

The current US administration has recently been trying to negotiate a path toward ending hostilities. US President Donald Trump briefly halted military assistance and intelligence sharing with Kiev, but resumed it following a bilateral meeting in Saudi Arabia earlier this week.

“We are in the final act [of Zelensky's presidency],” a senior Ukrainian official told the FT, confirming growing speculation in the country's political circles over how long he will stay in office. The official also described the conflict with Russia as currently in a “hot phase.”

According to Ukrainian soldiers, analysts, and officials cited by the newspaper, Kiev would be able to keep fighting for “at least six months” in case of a complete halt of military assistance from the US. They said, however, that it could be longer if the EU fills the gap and domestic arms production intensifies.

Unnamed Western officials told the FT that apart from a lack of weapons and ammunition, Zelensky's leadership could be challenged by a shortage of men in the ranks, which remains Ukraine's most pressing problem.

In November 2024, the administration of then US President Joe Biden urged Kiev to draft more troops and reduce the minimum conscription age from 25 to 18 to tackle a manpower shortage. The Ukrainian authorities rejected the proposal at the time, claiming that the main problem for the country's forces was a lack of weapons

The FT noted that Zelensky's political opponents are currently “preparing for elections, forming alliances, and testing public messaging.” Several politicians have reportedly begun outreach to officials in the Trump administration.

Zelensky, whose presidential term expired in May 2024, has refused to hold new presidential and parliamentary elections, citing martial law due to the conflict with Moscow. Last month, US President Donald Trump questioned Zelensky's legitimacy, branding him a “dictator without elections.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has cast doubt on Zelensky's position as well. Shortly after his official term as the country's head of state expired nearly a year ago, the Russian president called the Ukrainian parliament the only legitimate authority. Putin recently reiterated that the Ukrainian leader no longer has the right to sign official agreements.

A protest outside Argentina's Congress, where pensioners and football hooligans came together to oppose President Javier Milei's economic policies, erupted into chaos on Wednesday as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators, who hurled stones and torched dumpsters, media have reported. 

Retirees in Buenos Aires have staged regular weekly protests demanding higher pensions and citing worsening living conditions. While previous demonstrations saw minor clashes, including the use of tear gas against the elderly, Wednesday's protest was the largest and most intense to date, according to observers.

What began as a peaceful demonstration reportedly spiraled into violent clashes, with police deploying water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets as protesters responded by throwing stones. A dense cloud of tear gas engulfed the congressional palace, according to local media. Amid the chaos, a police car was set ablaze, and dumpsters across the city were torched.

Videos circulating on social media showed police beating and dragging protesters, including footage of an 87-year-old woman suffering a head injury as bystanders rushed to help her.

Some of the alleged football hooligans reportedly hurled sticks and cans at officers. With an estimated 800 officers deployed, the heavy police presence moved to suppress the demonstration.

At least 200 protesters were injured in the clashes, with 20 hospitalized and more than 100 detained, according to the Buenos Aires Herald.

The Milei government has imposed sweeping public spending cuts since coming to power in late 2023. Budgets for education, health, and public works have been reduced, and subsidies for energy and transportation eliminated.

Retirees have been among the hardest hit by Milei's austerity measures. In January this year, government spending on pensions had dropped by 19% compared to the same month in 2023, according to a report from the Center of Argentine Political Economy (CEPA).

The Milei administration has also eliminated a program that provided free medication, further straining the elderly population.

Nearly 60% of retirees in Argentina reportedly receive the minimum state pension of around $340 (€312) per month.

The European Commission has formally proposed to harmonize deportation rules across the EU. The current regulations, which vary by state, allow those who have been denied the right to remain in the bloc lawfully to exploit the system, resulting in a 20% deportation rate.

President Ursula von der Leyen has labeled the figure “by far, too low.”

The proposed rules “will ensure that those who have no right to stay in the EU are actually returned” to their countries of origin, EU Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration, Magnus Brunner, has claimed. 

The 87-page document unveiled on Tuesday will require immigrants to cooperate with authorities, permit the extended detention of asylum seekers, and introduce the mutual recognition of deportation orders among member states. The reforms aim to encourage voluntary returns and close loopholes currently exploited by illegal immigrants who evade forced repatriation by moving between EU countries.

The plan will establish “return hubs” – deportation centers in third countries willing to accept expelled individuals from the EU. If approved by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe, the new system is set to take effect in mid-2027.

Illegal immigration has remained a hot-button issue in the EU since the 2015 crisis, which saw over a million people arrive in member states.

The authorities' decision to welcome this influx sparked a backlash from several Eastern European nations, citing threats to security and culture.

Political guidelines issued by von der Leyen last July pledged to strengthen the EU's borders and crack down on human trafficking, a significant driver of illegal immigration.

Vladimir Zelensky changed his stance and “agreed to peace,” only following meetings between officials from Kiev and Washington in Saudi Arabia, which produced a proposal for a temporary ceasefire with Russia, US President Donald Trump has said.

Moscow has yet to receive detailed information about Trump's ceasefire proposal, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, after a joint US-Ukraine statement on Tuesday indicated that Kiev was prepared to accept a 30-day truce.

Speaking to journalists at the White House on Wednesday, Trump claimed that Ukraine was now willing to negotiate and that “it's up to Russia now.”

“As you know, I've always said that Ukraine might have been the more difficult party. You saw – you were here a week ago – when some interesting things happened,” Trump said, referring to a heated exchange with Zelensky in the Oval Office that ended with the Ukrainian leader being asked to leave prematurely.

During the confrontation, Trump criticized Zelensky for a lack of gratitude toward the US and accused him of refusing to pursue a peaceful resolution with Moscow. Shortly afterward, Washington suspended military aid and intelligence sharing with Kiev. However, following the US-Ukraine talks in Jeddah, the US expressed willingness to resume military assistance.

“I had somebody that didn't seem to want peace. Now he's agreed to peace. So we'll see what happens,” Trump said of Zelensky, who was present in Saudi Arabia but did not personally take part in the negotiations.

Asked on Wednesday whether he would similarly put pressure on Moscow, Trump suggested he could take financial measures that would be “devastating for Russia,” but hoped such actions would not be necessary.

“I don't want to do that because I want to see peace, and we're getting close to maybe getting something done,” Trump said. “We've had a good relationship with both parties, actually, and we'll see... [our] people are going to Russia right now as we speak, and hopefully, we can get a ceasefire from Russia. And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday that Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will be traveling to Moscow later this week to deliver the US ceasefire proposal.

Kremlin spokesman Peskov stated that Moscow is “carefully studying” the outcome of the US-Ukraine talks but cautioned against drawing premature conclusions. He emphasized that Russia first needs to receive “detailed information” on the proposed ceasefire.

Russian officials have previously argued that a temporary truce would not resolve the conflict, insisting that the root problems must be addressed instead. Moscow has suggested that any pause in hostilities would only allow Kiev and its backers to rearm and prepare for a new round of fighting.

The Ukrainian military has used up all of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles supplied by the US during the fighting with Russia, the Associated Press has reported, citing an American official.

Kiev started using ATACMS missiles, which have a range of 300km, for attacks into internationally recognized Russian territory from the autumn of 2024, in particular targeting the border regions of Kursk, Bryansk, Belgorod, and Rostov.

However, Ukraine's stock of ATACMS had been fully exhausted by late January, the AP reported on Wednesday. Overall, Ukraine received “fewer than 40” of the missiles from Washington, according to a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

An unnamed Ukrainian lawmaker, who sits on the country's defense committee, also confirmed to the AP that Kiev does not have any more ATACMS left.

The previous administration of US President Joe Biden initially forbade Ukraine from striking deep into Russia with American-made weapons, but eventually reversed its stance on the issue. The UK and France followed suit by also allowing attacks with their Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles.

Moscow had warned the US and its allies against greenlighting long-range Ukrainian strikes, arguing that they would make NATO a direct participant in the conflict due to Kiev's inability to fire sophisticated weapons on its own.

Russia responded to the first strikes with ATACMS in November last year by launching its new hypersonic Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile system at the Yuzhmash military industrial facility in the Ukrainian city of Dnepr.

The Russian military says it has been successful in shooting down ATACMS and other longer-range Western-made munitions on most occasions. The Defense Ministry in Moscow has not reported intercepting American missiles since mid-January.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) took advantage of a feud between two of the most powerful families in the Philippines to arrest the country's former President Rodrigo Duterte, Daniel Hugo Santos of the ASEAN Youth Organization has told RT.

The ICC opened an inquiry into anti-drug operations by the Philippine police in 2021 and issued an arrest warrant against Duterte in January, three years after his term in office expired.

According to Hugo Santos, the former president's rift with the current leader Bongbong Marcos “has caused the ICC to speed up the process.”

The feud between Duterte and Marcos, representing the two most powerful political dynasties, was triggered by personal accusations and policy disagreements. Duterte accused Marcos of consolidating power and drug use, while Marcos dismissed these claims, referencing Duterte's use of the painkiller fentanyl. Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, publicly threatened President Marcos and his family, leading to the start of impeachment proceedings last month.

The ICC picks the “easiest targets” such as “developing countries in the Global South,” exposing its own “double standards,” Hugo Santos said.

Duterte, 79, was detained at Manila's international airport, flown to The Hague, and placed in the custody of the ICC on Wednesday. He is accused of crimes against humanity linked to a ‘war on drugs' during his presidency between 2016 and 2022.

A group of NGOs linked to billionaire George Soros has placed the US on a watchlist of “countries with faltering civic freedoms,” citing executive orders signed by President Donald Trump since he assumed office in January.

According to the South African-based CIVICUS, the Trump administration has launched an “assault on democratic norms and global cooperation.”

“[The] United States, once a global champion of democracy and human rights, joins the first 2025 watchlist along with Democratic Republic of Congo, Italy, Pakistan, and Serbia,” the organization said in a statement on Monday.

“Unprecedented executive orders designed to unravel democratic institutions, rule of law, and global cooperation raise alarm,” it added, citing Trump's decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), and the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

Trump terminated US membership in the WHO and UNHRC over an alleged lack of reforms, disproportionate financial contributions, and their handling of international crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic.

USAID, Washington's primary channel for sending money to causes abroad, was accused of misusing taxpayer money and fostering corruption, and had most of its employees laid off or placed on leave.

Placing countries on the list aims to highlight an alleged “decline in respect for civic space,” and to pressure the governments to “end the ongoing crackdowns,” CIVICUS said.

A self-proclaimed “global alliance of civil society organizations and activists working to strengthen citizen action,” CIVICUS has received funding from the Open Society Foundations (OSF), established by Hungarian-American financier Soros, according to Spanish outlet Okdiario.

Soros is well known for financing liberal causes and political candidates across the Western world. The 94-year-old has been a significant donor to the Democratic Party. Most recently, Soros has been accused of spending millions of dollars to block Trump's political agenda, a claim that has been supported by the US president's close ally and adviser, Elon Musk.

The interim administration of Ethiopia's Tigray region asked the country's federal government for help after a faction of the troubled state's main political party seized control of two major towns, sparking fears of an outbreak of another civil war.

In a statement on Wednesday, the region's communication affairs bureau said some senior Tigray army commanders have been plotting a coup against the government since January.

“Attacks targeting civilians continue. The acts of dismantling the government from top to bottom continue to intensify,” it stated, adding that the “region may be on the brink of another crisis.”

A faction of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) – formerly Ethiopia's dominant political party – reported on Tuesday that it has taken over the northern town of Adigrat. It reportedly captured Adi-Gudem, near the regional capital Mekele, the next night. According to the Associated Press, several people were injured when forces attempted to take control of a government building in Adi-Gudem.

Earlier on Tuesday, Getachew Reda, leader of Tigray's interim government, fired three top army commanders and the head of the security bureau, accusing them of failing to put an end to “illegal activities” and the “act of destruction.”

Tigray's interim administration was established in 2023 as part of the Pretoria Agreement, an African Union-mediated peace deal concluded in the South African capital that ended two years of fighting between Tigrayan forces and the federal government. The intense war that erupted in 2020 was named the world's deadliest conflict in 2022 by the Peace Research Institute Oslo, with well over 100,000 people killed.

On Wednesday, the regional communications bureau stated that “illegal factions” within the Tigray army were violating the Pretoria Treaty by “dissolving the government.”

“The federal government must... understand that those acting in the name of the security forces are agents of a backward and criminal clique who do not represent the people or the Interim Administration of Tigray, and provide the necessary support,” it said.

“It must not remain silent as the Pretoria Agreement is violated and the people of Tigray enter into a second round of destruction,” it added.

The TPLF responded by accusing government officials of “betraying” national interests and “becoming agents of external forces.” It condemned the removal of top generals as “concerted internal and external conspiracies to disband” the army.

Moscow is in favor of a ceasefire in the Ukraine conflict, but questions will need to be ironed out in future talks with the US, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said.

US President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived for high-end talks in Moscow on Thursday. According to Putin's top foreign policy aide, the US diplomat will meet with the president later this evening.

Witkoff's arrival in the Russian capital comes after representatives from the US and Ukraine held talks on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, where they issued a joint statement proposing a 30-day ceasefire with Moscow.





13 March 2025

Washington has been discussing land concessions with Ukraine in the ceasefire talks, Trump has said.

“We've been discussing land with Ukraine, pieces of land that would be kept and lost,” he said, adding that the ownership of “a very big power plant” was part of the negotiations.

The proposed ceasefire is just the first phase of the negotiations, Trump stated.

Putin's comment about Russia's readiness to discuss a ceasefire was promising but “it wasn't complete,” US President Donald Trump said on Thursday during a bilateral press conference with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

Witkoff and other US representatives are in Russia to discuss the proposed truce, among other things, he said.

“They're in very serious discussions,” Trump stressed.

The Ukraine conflict is a big financial burden for the US and others, he said.

“We want it to stop. It's also a tremendous cost to the United States and to other countries,” Trump said.

Russia supports the idea of ending the hostilities in the Ukraine conflict, but needs any potential ceasefire to facilitate a long-term peace, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said.

Speaking during a bilateral meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko Putin noted “We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities. But… this cessation must be such that it would lead to long-term peace and eliminate the initial causes of this crisis.”

Moscow has a number of questions about the US ceasefire proposal that will need to be raised in upcoming talks, Putin explained.

“I think that we need to discuss this with our American colleagues and partners,” he said.

“Maybe we could discuss this with President Trump over the telephone,” the Russian leader added.

Notwithstanding, Russia supports the idea of diplomatically ending the conflict, he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow is in favor of a ceasefire, but has numerous questions about its practical implementation.

The Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk Region are cut off, and it would be unclear what is to be done with them in the event of a truce, he said.

”Are we supposed to let them out, after they committed mass war crimes against civilians? The Ukrainian leadership could tell them to lay down their arms, and just surrender,” the Russian president said.

It is also unclear how the ceasefire would be monitored and enforced, he added.

It is unclear how amenable the US is to Russian demands about demilitarizing and denazifying Ukraine, Yevgeny Primakov, the head of the Russian agency for international cooperation, Rossotrudnichestvo, has said.

”Under any circumstances, Ukraine must not pose a threat to Russia,” he said.

”This means we must prevent any risks of revanchism, which logically entails that Ukraine should not maintain offensive military capabilities or embrace an aggressive Nazi ideology aimed against Russia,” Primakov stressed. This would entail dismantling several social and political institutions active in Ukraine, as well as reforming its education system, he added.

It is unclear how willing the US is to consider these issues, Primakov said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is not expected to hold a telephone conversation with Trump on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has told reporters.



Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet with Witkoff behind closed doors this evening, presidential aide Yury Ushakov has told Izvestia.

Russian political analyst Sergey Markov has warned that any ceasefire in Ukraine will be exploited by the West to rearm Kiev's “political regime,” ramp up its conscription drive, as well as strengthen its repressive and anti-Russian nature.

Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin has said Trump is not ready to “unilaterally” withdraw from the Ukraine conflict, and “risks getting increasingly bogged down,” despite the US president's apparent eagerness to wind down hostilities.



Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky may have had success in manipulating the previous US administration of President Joe Biden, but he has apparently not managed the same with President Donald Trump, according to the vice speaker of Russia's Federation Council, Konstantin Kosachev.

“The outcome of the US-Ukraine talks in Jeddah reveals a clear truth: Zelensky's attempts to make ‘the tail wag the dog' may have worked with Biden, but not with Trump,” Kosachev said, stressing that the ceasefire deal terms have so far been set by the US alone.Given Russian troops' advances on the battlefield, “dealings with Russia will be different,” Kosachev said.

“Any agreements – and we recognize the need for compromises – will come on our terms, not America's,” he stated, adding that “real agreements are still being forged on the front lines.”

Washington is unlikely to “trick” Moscow with a ceasefire proposal, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told Russia 1 TV journalist Olga Skabeeva on Thursday.

“It will not be a trick… because we know what we need and they know what we want,” he said, adding that in the event of a ceasefire, there will no “movement” in the Ukraine conflict.

Despite this, the Ukrainian “economy will still work, the military-industrial complex will work, they'll produce weapons,” and receive “weapons from abroad,” Lukashenko said.

Nevertheless, “Ukrainians will most likely not agree to this,” the Belarusian leader said, adding that Kiev expects Russia to refuse.

Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani's Jio, the largest telecom operator in the country, has announced a partnership with Elon Musk's SpaceX to bring Starlink internet service to India. The move came after a similar announcement was made by Airtel, country's second largest telecom operators by market share.

Jio, a part of Ambani's vast Reliance Industries conglomerate, which operates ini hydrocarbons and petrochemicals, retail, telecom and media, said in a statement on Wednesday that it will utilize its vast data traffic network to bring Starlink's broadband services to all parts of India, particularly in the rural and remote areas.

The company also stated that it will sell Starlink equipment in its stores and provide support for installation and activation through a dedicated customer service mechanism. At the same time, SpaceX has to obtain receipt of necessary government approvals to operate in India, both telecom operators noted in their statements. Yes both need government approvals like with satellite phones.

Notably, the partnership between Jio and Starlink follows a previous disagreement between the two companies regarding the allocation of spectrum for satellite services in India. While Reliance Jio had advocated for an auction-based approach, the Indian government ultimately decided to allocate the spectrum administratively, a method supported by Elon Musk and in line with international practices.

India, home to a population of 1.4 billion, boasts one of the world's largest telecom markets, with a subscriber base of 954 million, according to government data. Unintentionally, Starlink services ran into controversies.

In December, the Indian Army conducted a search operation across multiple districts in Manipur, seizing a range of items including guns, bombs, ammunition, and Starlink devices.

At the time, The Guardian reported that Starlink was operational in certain areas of Manipur, based on information from local armed groups and law enforcement officials. A leader of the People's Liberation Army of Manipur confirmed to the outlet that the group was using Starlink devices to access the internet, as the authorities had blocked internet services in an attempt to reduce violence in the region.

Elon Musk responded to these claims, denying them and stating on X that this was false and clarified that Starlink's satellite beams are turned off over India.

The Russian military has dislodged remaining Ukrainian forces from the town of Sudzha, the largest settlement taken by Kiev's troops in their incursion into Russia's Kursk Region, the Defense Ministry in Moscow has announced.

The nearby settlements of Melovoy and Podol have also been liberated, the ministry said in a short statement on Thursday.

In the last 24 hours the Ukrainian forces fighting in Kursk Region have lost more than 340 servicemen, two infantry fighting vehicles, three armored personnel carriers and dozens of pieces of other hardware, the ministry said.

Ukraine launched an incursion into the Kursk Region on August 6 last year, in the largest attack on internationally recognized Russian territory since the escalation of hostilities between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022. The Ukrainian advance, involving some 35,000 troops according to Moscow's estimates, was swiftly halted, and the territory under Kiev's control has steadily shrunk since then.

Over the last week the Russian military has made rapid gains near Sudzha, located 9km from the border with Ukraine and had a population of some 5,000 before the incursion. On Tuesday, the Defense Ministry in Moscow announced the liberation of 12 villages in the Kursk Region to the north, east and southeast of the town.



Multiple reports of intense fighting, a dramatic raid through a disused pipeline and a Ukrainian retreat emerged from the town earlier this week. On Wednesday, videos were also published by Telegram channels purporting to show troops unfolding a Russian flag in the town's main square.

According the latest data from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Kiev's losses in the eight months since the launch of its incursion total over 67,100 servicemen killed or injured, 392 tanks, 316 infantry fighting vehicles, 278 armored personnel carriers, and hundreds of other pieces of equipment, including 13 US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers.

Russia and the US have begun talks in Moscow on the results of Tuesday's meeting between American and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. US special envoy Steve Witkoff landed in the Russian capital at 1330 local time and his motorcade entered the Kremlin shortly after.

The US envoy's arrival in Moscow comes after representatives from Kiev and Washington issued a joint statement confirming that Kiev had agreed to a proposed 30-day ceasefire while the US announced the resumption of military aid and information sharing with Ukraine, after nearly 9.5 hours of talks in Jeddah on Tuesday. 

At a press briefing on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova revealed that Moscow had closely examined the results of the talks and the relevant statements, but added that Moscow had yet to receive a formal ceasefire proposal.

Russia, she stressed, is open to discussing the initiative, while touting Witkoff's arrival in the Russian capital. 

On Wednesday, the Kremlin also declined to comment on any US-Ukraine meeting and the subsequent ceasefire proposal, stating that it is waiting to be formally briefed on the initiative by Washington.

Moscow has previously opposed any temporary truce in the Ukraine conflict, arguing that Kiev will simply use it to rearm and continue fighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted that a resolution to the conflict must address the root causes in order to establish a long-lasting peace.

Russia is not interested in temporary solutions to the Ukraine conflict and instead wants to achieve a lasting peaceful settlement that takes Moscow's interests and concerns into account, President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov has said. 

His comments come as US envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow to present the results of talks between representatives from Kiev and Washington in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, after which they released a joint statement backing a 30-day ceasefire.

Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed on Thursday that Russia is ready for a ceasefire but that the terms of such an arrangement should be clarified. Putin has said as far back as July 2024 that Moscow is not interested in short-term pauses but is ready to engage on addressing the causes of the conflict.

In an interview with Russia-1 TV on Thursday, Ushakov outlined Moscow's goal of “a long-term peaceful settlement that takes into account the legitimate interests of our country and our known concerns,” a position consistently reiterated by Russian officials since the escalation of conflict in 2022.

The presidential aide stressed that steps that only “imitate peaceful actions are not needed by anyone,” adding that a ceasefire in Ukraine would likely be “nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military.”

Ushakov also confirmed that he regularly holds phone calls with US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and that he has already explained Moscow's position on the ceasefire proposal to him. 

He noted that President Putin will likely provide a more detailed assessment of the situation in Ukraine and the ceasefire initiative during a press conference later on Thursday.

Meanwhile, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has arrived in Moscow and is preparing to hold talks with the Russian side, presumably to inform of the results of the Jeddah talks and the details of the Ukraine ceasefire proposal.

Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has hinted that US-Russia talks could take place in the near future, perhaps even later on Thursday.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also confirmed that US negotiators are already on their way to Russia but has not disclosed whether or not Putin intends to meet with Witkoff on Thursday. 

Moscow has previously spoken out against any temporary truce in the Ukraine conflict, arguing that Kiev would simply use it to rearm and continue fighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted that a resolution to the conflict must address the root causes in order to establish a long-lasting peace.

Peace talks between the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) and M23 rebels will begin on March 18, Angola announced on Wednesday, as it attempts to mediate a long-term ceasefire in the conflict-torn Central African nation.

The negotiations will take place in Angola's capital, Luanda, the office of the country's president, Joao Goncalves Lourenco, said in a statement. The decision came a day after Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi visited Luanda to discuss the ongoing hostilities in eastern DR Congo with his Angolan counterpart, who is also the current chair of the African Union.

Violence escalated in the resource-rich country's eastern provinces in January, with fighters from the M23 group seizing several key cities, including North Kivu capital Goma and Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu. Last week, Kinshasa's Health Ministry reported that more than 8,500 people have been killed this year.

The DR Congo has repeatedly accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the militants, claims that have been echoed by some Western countries. Rwanda has consistently denied the allegations.

Congolese authorities had previously refused to hold talks with the rebels, and Angola-mediated peace efforts were halted last December after Rwanda demanded that Kinshasa engage directly with the M23. Earlier this month, Congolese Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka told the BBC that her government would only negotiate with Rwanda, which is the “aggressor of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Congo.” 

On Wednesday, Tina Salama, spokesperson for Congolese President Tshisekedi, told Reuters that the government had received an invitation from Angola but had not confirmed whether it would participate in the dialogue.

In response, Bertrand Bisimwa, an M23 leader, said dialogue is “the only civilized option to resolve the current crisis that has lasted for decades.”

“We are committed to defeating Mr. Tshisekedi's military option and bringing him, willingly or by force, to the negotiating table,” he wrote on X.

Meanwhile, the US is reportedly exploring a deal with the former Belgian colony to access its natural resources in exchange for American security assistance amid the escalating conflict.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has urged the EU to reinforce its military presence on the country's borders with Russia and Belarus amid ongoing Ukraine ceasefire negotiations.

Tusk made the statement on Thursday after meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, urging him to play a key role in any potential peace process.

According to the Polish prime minister, the two discussed reinforcing the military capabilities on Poland's border with Russia's Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus, which is “also the border of NATO and the EU.”

“I have obtained full understanding from our Turkish partner that the duty of the Polish army is to guard the eastern flank…” the Polish prime minister stated, as quoted by local media.

Tusk told reporters that Poland would invest heavily in “securing” its eastern frontier, deploying drones and other military assets. He said the responsibility for strengthening the region's military capabilities should be shared by the EU and NATO. 

“After all, we are not talking about a common European army,” Tusk said, “but a very specific problem, namely securing Poland's eastern border, the border with Russia and Belarus.” 

According to Tusk, it's in the interest of the EU and NATO countries to treat the Polish border as a “common” one, because it will be “easier for us to finance and organize this.” 

Tusk has repeatedly alleged that Russia poses a threat to Europe, claiming Moscow could launch a “full-scale operation” against a “larger” target than Ukraine within three to four years. The Kremlin has dismissed the allegations as unfounded. Tusk argues that Poland must serve as a “bastion” to protect NATO's eastern border and should expand its military capabilities.

Addressing the Polish Parliament last week, Tusk unveiled plans to more than double the size of the country's military to 500,000, saying Poland must be prepared for future conflicts.

The Kremlin has criticized Tusk's rhetoric as confrontational and militaristic. Moscow has rejected accusations that it poses a military threat to Europe, with Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissing the claims as “nonsense” designed to justify increased military budgets.

The EU had earlier announced a major military spending plan to address a perceived Russian threat. The REARM plan, introduced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, includes €150 billion ($163 billion) in loans to EU governments for defense spending and fiscal exemptions, potentially lending up to €800 billion ($870 billion) over the next four years.

The Kremlin condemned the bloc's “militarization” plan, calling it a path towards confrontation that undermines peace efforts in the Ukraine conflict.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Ex-Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte threatened a police general with lawsuits, refused to be fingerprinted and told law enforcers “you have to kill me to bring me to The Hague” in a tense confrontation after his arrest in Manila that was ordered by the International Criminal Court, a Philippine police general said Thursday.

Police Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre provided details for the first time of Tuesday's 12-hour standoff at a Philippine air base before he and other police officers managed to bring the 79-year-old former leader onto a government-chartered jet that took him to The Hague, Netherlands, where he was detained by the global court on charges of crimes against humanity.

ICC spokesman Fadi El Abdallah said Thursday in a text message to reporters that Duterte had arrived at the court's detention center near the Dutch North Sea coast after undergoing medical checks. 

No date has yet been announced for Duterte's first appearance before ICC judges.




Duterte was once feared for his brutal anti-crime crackdowns and reviled for his irreverence while in office — he called Pope Francis a “son of a bitch” at one time and said that U.S. President Barack Obama could “go to hell.” 

Duterte's stunning reversal of fortune has been celebrated by human rights groups as a historic triumph against state impunity, while his supporters have slammed what they call the current government's surrendering of a rival to a court whose jurisdiction they dispute.

Duterte was arrested Tuesday after he arrived at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport with his common-law wife, daughter and friends from Hong Kong. 

He was later taken under heavy police guard to a nearby presidential lounge at the Villamor Air Base to undergo booking for arrested criminal suspects, including fingerprinting, before being taken to a plane for the long flight to The Hague to be turned over to the ICC, Torre said.

But Duterte, his family, lawyers and friends resisted and prevented the former leader from being brought to a Gulfstream G550 executive jet, according to Torre.

The standoff lasted for about 12 hours, Torre said.

“It was very tense,” Torre told The Associated Press. “One of my officers sustained a head injury after being hit hard with a cellphone” by Duterte's common-law wife “and his daughter was cursing me with expletives, but I kept my cool.”

The ex-president, who used to be a government prosecutor and congressman, refused to undergo the police booking procedure after his arrest, Torre said.

“We wanted to have him fingerprinted, but he resisted,” Torre said. In a separate interview, he said that he arrested and handcuffed the former president's executive secretary for blocking Duterte's transfer to the plane.

Torre confirmed to the AP the authenticity of a video that has gone viral on social media showing Duterte surrounded by his family, lawyers and friends and asking Torre, who led the arresting officers, “Are you going to bring me straight to the airplane?”

“You have to kill me to bring me to The Hague,” Torre quoted Duterte as saying.

“That's not our intention sir,” Torre said as his men dragged away one of several men surrounding Duterte.

Duterte's lawyers said that Philippine authorities didn't show any copy of the ICC warrant and violated his constitutional rights. 

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration allowed the global court to take custody of Duterte, although the Philippines was no longer a party to the ICC, the legal team said.

“Our own government has surrendered a Filipino citizen — even a former president at that — to foreign powers,” Vice President Sara Duterte, the ex-president's daughter and a political rival of the current president, said Tuesday before her father was flown out of Manila.

“This is a blatant affront to our sovereignty and an insult to every Filipino who believes in our nation's independence,” she said. “This is not justice — this is oppression and persecution,” she said.

Marcos appeared on nationwide television around midnight shortly after Duterte was flown out and denied the allegations of the vice president, who has had a bitter falling out with him after their whirlwind political alliance as running mates in the 2022 elections crumbled.

In Hong Kong, Duterte told a gathering of flag-waving followers Sunday before he flew back to Manila that he was aware that an ICC warrant for his arrest has been issued and added he was ready to be locked up. “If this is my fate in life, it's OK, I'll accept it. I can't do anything if I get arrested and jailed,” he said in an expletives-laced speech.

Duterte carved a political name decades ago with his violent approach to criminality and his profanities, which became a trademark of his political persona especially when threatening to kill drugs dealers as part of his war on illegal drugs that left thousands dead in his long years in power.

While president, Duterte got incensed when Obama criticized his bloody campaign against illegal drugs and told him in one speech to “go to hell.”

In 2015, he shocked the dominant Roman Catholic Church when he fired off an expletive while expressing his disgust over a monstrous traffic jam that trapped him while Francis was visiting Manila.

“I wanted to call. ‘Pope, you son of a bitch, go home.' Don't visit here anymore,” he told a mob of supporters, some of whom laughed.

He later apologized after Filipino bishops expressed shock and outrage.

Israel's military carried out an airstrike on the outskirts of Syria's capital Thursday targeting a residential building that Israel said was a command center of the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. A member of the group at the scene told The Associated Press the strike hit a home of the group's leader which has been empty for years. Local paramedics said three people were wounded. 

Also Thursday, United Nations-backed experts accused Israel of “the systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence” in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel has refused to cooperate with the commission, accusing it and the council of being biased against it.

The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza was paused by a fragile ceasefire in January. Negotiations over the future of the truce and the release of Israeli hostages are continuing in Qatar, but there are no signs of a breakthrough.

Here's the latest:

Hamas says the report by United Nations-backed human rights experts is “confirmation of the severity of the crime” Israel is inflicting on the Palestinians.

The report alleges Israel war in Gaza caused “disproportionate violence against women and children,” and accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees.

Israel denies any systematic abuse of prisoners and says it takes extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians.

The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of war crimes in Gaza, which they deny. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas' military leader but the militants since have confirmed that he was killed.

Demonstrators from a Jewish group filled the lobby of Trump Tower on Thursday to denounce the immigration arrest of Mahmoud Khalil. a pro-Palestinian activist who helped lead protests against Israel at Columbia University.

The Jewish Voice for Peace protesters, who carried banners and wore red shirts reading “Jews say stop arming Israel,” chanted “Bring Mahmoud home now!”

After warning the protesters to leave the Fifth Avenue building or face arrest, police put at least 65 of them in zip ties and loaded them into a police van and city bus about an hour into the demonstration. 

Khalil's supporters say his arrest is an attack on free speech and have staged protests elsewhere in the city and around the country. 

Thousands of Syrians who fled sectarian violence on the coast beginning a week ago are still sheltering in a Russian airbase, a Russian official said Thursday.

“Our military sheltered more than 8,000, according to yesterday's data, probably closer to 9,000 Syrians, mostly women and children,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said at a briefing Thursday.

Cashes between Islamist-led government security forces and armed groups loyal to deposed President Bashar Assad spiraled into sectarian revenge attacks that killed hundreds of civilians, most of them Alawites, a minority sect to which Assad belongs.

Thousands fled across the border into Lebanon, while others took refuge in the forests or in the Russian air base in Latakia province. Despite attempts by government officials to coax them out and assure them that the situation is under control, many have refused to go home.

Russia was a staunch ally of Assad but has attempted to mend fences with the former insurgents now leading the country.

Syria's interim rulers have struggled to exert their authority nationwide since they overthrew ex-President Bashar Assad last year in a lightning offensive led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.

The new constitution will maintain some previsions from the previous one, including the stipulation that the head of state has to be a Muslim, and Islamic law is the main source of jurisprudence, said Abdulhamid Al-Awak, one of the seven members of the committee tasked with drafting the temporary constitution.

He said the constitution includes provisions that enshrine freedom of expression and the media. A new committee to draft a permanent constitution will be formed, but it's unclear if it will be more inclusive of Syria's political, religious and ethnic groups.

Arab countries welcomed an extremely brief remark from President Donald Trump indicating he has backed away from his plan to depopulate Gaza.

Trump responded “Nobody's expelling any Palestinians,” to a reporter Wednesday before asking her where she worked and implying it was a dumb question.

U.S. allies Egypt and Jordan seized on those four words and released statements welcoming the remarks. Both had rejected Trump's earlier suggestion that they accept large numbers of Palestinian refugees.

Hamas issued a statement welcoming Trump's “apparent retreat from his proposed plan to displace our people from Gaza.”

Last month, Trump proposed that Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries so the U.S. could take ownership of Gaza and develop it as a beach destination for others. Human rights experts said it would likely violate international law. 

Around 50 patients are being evacuated each day from Gaza by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies alongside its local partners. 

“Yesterday, we saved 39 lives,” Kate Forbes, the federation's president, told The Associated Press on Thursday.

These 25,000 patients include chronically ill people with cancer, heart disease or hemophilia whose regular treatment has been interrupted due to Gaza's destroyed healthcare infrastructure.

The trickle of medical evacuations is still taking place during Israel's renewed blockade of humanitarian aid and electricity into Gaza.

In Cairo this week, Forbes met with some of the medical evacuees and the children accompanying them. The kids she met are deeply affected by the trauma they've witnessed, she said, leaving many of them mute upon arrival.

The Syrian Civil Defense group, also known as the White Helmets, said a woman was seriously wounded and two men were lightly injured. The group said no one was killed.

The paramedic group said the strike destroyed the targeted building in a Damascus suburb and damaged two nearby buildings.

A Palestinian Islamic Jihad member at the scene of the airstrike in Syria told The Associated Press that the apartment that was targeted was the home of the group's leader Ziad Nakhaleh.

Ismail Sindak said the apartment had been empty for years, adding that Nakhaleh is not in Syria. Asked whether anyone was killed in the strike, Sindak said “the house was empty.”

It was not immediately clear where Nakhaleh is but he is believed to spend his time between Lebanon, Iran and Syria.

The Israeli military said its air force conducted an intelligence-based strike on a command center belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Damascus. It added that command center was used to plan and direct “terrorist activities” by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad against Israel.

Syria's state news agency says an Israeli airstrike has struck a residential building on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus.

The agency did not give further details about Thursday's strike.

Israel's military said that the strike targeted a command center of the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It said that the center has been used to direct attacks against Israel and vowed to “respond forcefully” to the presence of Palestinian militant groups inside Syria.

Defense Minister Israel Katz warned in a statement that “whenever terrorist activity is organized against Israel,” Syria's new President Ahmad al-Sharaa “will find air force planes circling above him and attacking terrorist targets.”

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said the building targeted is located in the suburb of Dummar, northwest of the capital and was inhabited by Palestinians. It said one person was killed.

Israel says it has sent 10,000 packages of food aid to Syria's Druze, as it seeks to forge ties with the minority to shape the country's troubled transition from civil war.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the operation was conducted in recent weeks in coordination with local Druze leaders, with most of the aid delivered to the overwhelmingly Druze southern region of Sweida.

Israel says it is supporting an embattled minority in a country now ruled by Islamists. But many Druze have rejected its overtures, and critics accuse Israel trying to weaken and divide Syria following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad.

Israel seized a buffer zone in southern Syria shortly after Assad's overthrow and has carried out waves of airstrikes to destroy Syria's military. It has ordered the new security forces not to operate south of the capital, Damascus.

Israel says it is acting in Syria to protect its citizens from Iran-backed groups that were allied with Assad as well as the new government, led by a former senior al-Qaida leader who cut ties with the group several years ago.

United Nations-backed experts on Thursday accused Israel of “the systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence” in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Israel's mission to the U.N. in Geneva rejected the allegations and accused the The Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which was created by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, of relying on “second-hand, single, uncorroborated sources.”

Israel has refused to cooperate with the commission, accusing it and the council of being biased against it.

In its report released Thursday, the commission examined the widespread destruction of Gaza, the use of heavy explosives in civilian areas and Israeli attacks on hospitals and health facilities. It said all three led to “disproportionate violence against women and children.”

Israel says it took extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians in the 15-month war, which has been paused by a fragile ceasefire. It blames civilian deaths and destruction on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas.

The commission also accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. Israel denies any systematic abuse of prisoners and says it takes action when there are violations.

The commission is led by former U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay. Its findings can be used as evidence for the International Criminal Court or other bodies that seek to prosecute war crimes.

The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. A U.N. envoy last year said there were “reasonable grounds” to believe Hamas committed rape and sexual violence in the attack.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — European Union leaders announced 4.7 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in investments in South Africa on Thursday to support green energy and vaccine production, and agreed to start talks on new trade deals with Africa's most advanced economy.

The announcement came at the first bilateral summit between the bloc and the African country in seven years. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President António Costa and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke of the need to boost international cooperation during the meeting, held at the South African leader's Cape Town office.

Their message stood in contrast to the Trump administration's confrontational foreign policy and trade tariffs. 

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump said in a social media post that he would impose a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits in an escalation of a trade war with the EU.

“We will defend our interests,” von der Leyen said in response to Trump's latest threat. “We've said it and we've shown it, but at the same time I also want to emphasize that we are open for negotiations.”

Von der Leyen also said that Europe was looking to deepen its trade relationship with South Africa, already the EU's largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa. 

“We want to strengthen and diversify our supply chains but we want to do it in cooperation with you,” she said, sitting next to Ramaphosa. 




She described it as a new chapter in their relations and referred to South Africa as a reliable partner. “On both sides there's high respect for stability, predictability and reliability,” she said.

Ramaphosa said the summit came at a time of increasing global uncertainty. Both the EU and South Africa have felt the impact of Trump's first months of his second term.

South Africa has been singled out for sanctions by the Trump administration over domestic and foreign policies that the U.S. leader has cast as anti-American — a reference to South Africa launching a case at the top U.N. court accusing U.S. ally Israel of genocide in the war in Gaza, as well as to South Africa's ties with China and Iran.

Trump issued an executive order last month cutting all U.S. funding to South Africa, accusing it of a human rights violation against a white minority group in the country, and of supporting some “bad actors” in the world, such as the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Iran.

Von der Leyen's visit also reemphasized the EU's support for South Africa's presidency of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations this year, another area where the United States has criticized South Africa while boycotting some early G20 meetings.

South Africa hopes to use its leadership of the group to make progress on help for poor countries, especially on debt relief and more financing to mitigate the impact of climate change.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed some of those priorities for the G20 and skipped a foreign ministers meeting of the group in South Africa last month. He also said that he wouldn't attend the main G20 summit in Johannesburg in November, indicating that the U.S. would give little attention to attempts at international cooperation through the bloc, which includes 19 of the world's major economies, the EU and the African Union.

The EU said that the vast majority of the new investment in South Africa — $4.7 billion out of the $5.1 billion — would be to help South Africa transition from its coal-based economy to greener energy supplies. 

That new pledge came a week after the U.S. withdrew from an agreement to give funding to South Africa and two other developing nations to help them transition to clean energy sources that was seen as a possible blueprint for more deals to reduce carbon emissions across the world. The EU has also pledged money to that Just Energy Transition Partnership and said that it's still committed to the program.

“We know that others are withdrawing so we want to be very clear with our support,” von der Leyen said. “We are doubling down and we are here to stay.”

Aid agencies distributing U.S. food aid in Ethiopia's war-affected Tigray region say they have had to stop feeding millions of people because of the Trump administration's restrictions on foreign aid.

MEKELE, Ethiopia (AP) — As a displaced person in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, 76-year-old Haile Tsege is no stranger to hunger.

During its war with Tigray fighters that devastated the region in 2020-2022, Ethiopian government restrictions on the rebellious region reduced aid flows to a trickle. Then in 2023, U.S. and U.N. aid distributions of grain were halted for months over a corruption scandal.

Now the Trump administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has again halted food deliveries to a sprawling camp of over 20,000 people outside Tigray's regional capital, Mekele.

“We will just die in silence,” said Tsege, one of the 2.4 million people in Tigray who depend on humanitarian grain, most of it provided by the U.S.

Ethiopia with its over 125 million people had been the biggest beneficiary of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving $1.8 billion in the 2023 financial year. In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.

Most of these programs have been stopped. The USAID staffers who oversaw them have been placed on administrative leave and told not to work, as they face the threat of termination. The U.S. Embassy didn't respond to questions.

Emergency food was exempted from President Donald Trump's executive order, signed on his first day in office, suspending foreign aid during a 90-day review amid the administration's allegations of waste.




Aid agencies in Ethiopia had to apply to USAID for waivers to continue handing out U.S. grain. These have been secured, but USAID's payments system is still not functioning.

As a result, a consortium of aid agencies in Tigray has had to stop distributions to the over 1 million people it has been responsible for feeding with U.S.-provided grain. It has no money to pay for fuel, trucks and drivers to distribute existing food stockpiles.

That includes 5,000 metric tons of sorghum – enough to feed 300,000 people for a month – stuck in a storage facility in Mekele that could rot before it reaches those in need.

“This is just one warehouse. There are several others across the region,” said Teklewoini Assefa, head of the Relief Society of Tigray, part of the consortium. “This will create malnutrition, disease. If this situation continues, what follows? Death.”

He added: “Everything boils down to the payment system.”

The effects of the aid cuts are widespread, with many USAID contracts terminated. Already, Ethiopia has been forced to lay off 5,000 local healthcare workers who were working on its HIV response.

Tigray relied heavily on U.S. funds. More than two years after the war killed hundreds of thousands, full-scale recovery efforts are yet to start. The region's health system is in ruins and hundreds of schools remain closed.

In 2024, child malnutrition stood at 21% in some areas, according to a survey reviewed by The Associated Press — far above the World Health Organization's threshold of 15% at which a situation is classified as an emergency.

Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.

“The impact has been huge,” said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.

Management Sciences for Health, another Tigray organization, has halted a project to combat tuberculosis and told its staff to expect mass layoffs in March, according to a senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

Efforts to assist thousands of women who were raped during the war have been derailed, said Rigat Bishaw at Ayder Hospital, Tigray's biggest healthcare facility.

This includes counseling and physiotherapy sessions for survivors run by the U.S.-based Center for Victims of Torture, which received a stop-work order from the Trump administration in February and furloughed its staff.

CVT also halted a program to train health workers to recognize sexual abuse cases and refer survivors to appropriate health services.

“This sudden disruption is having a huge impact on the healing of traumatized people,” said Yohannes Fisseha, a CVT manager.

Major projects to support people living with HIV, improve access to life-saving nutrition services and improve relations between war-affected communities have also been cut off, said Yirga Gebregziabher, the Tigray branch manager of an Ethiopian organization called OSSHD, which helped implement the projects.

The organization has been forced to fire dozens of expert staff.

“Our picture of America was as a protector of rights, a positive force in the world,” Yigra said. “That image has now been broken. If there was a process, maybe the shock would have been less. But there was no consultation, no engagement.”

QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan's prime minister on Thursday commended the country's armed forces for successfully rescuing 339 passengers after a deadly train hijacking by insurgents in the southwest. A total of 25 people were killed by the attackers.

The dead included 21 civilian hostages and four troops, one of whom was killed during the military's rescue operation. Authorities haven't provided the number of wounded. All of the insurgents were killed, officials said.

“The terrorists who attacked the train even showed no regard for the sanctity of the fasting month of Ramadan,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in his televised remarks in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, where he also met with survivors of the train attack. 

His remarks came hours after Pakistan's foreign ministry said that Afghan soil was used to orchestrate the train attack, though an outlawed separatist group, the Baloch Liberation Army, has claimed responsibility. 

The assault began Tuesday and ended Wednesday when troops killed all 33 insurgents in an operation that the military said resulted in no further passenger deaths. 

The train was heading from Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar when insurgents blew up the track, forcing nine coaches and the engine of the Jafer Express train to stop partially inside a tunnel.

The BLA regularly targets Pakistani security forces and has attacked trains, but had never been able to hijack one in the past. They have also attacked Chinese workers, thousands of whom are involved in multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects in Balochistan.




Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest and least populated province. Members of the ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government.

Amid tight security, Sharif and members of his Cabinet were received by senior government officials upon his arrival at an airport in Quetta, his office said. Authorities said that arrangements were made to transport victims' bodies to their hometowns, while wounded people were receiving medical treatment. 

Foreign ministry spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan told reporters in Islamabad that BLA assailants who hijacked the train were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan. 

“Our security forces successfully eliminated all 33 terrorists, including suicide bombers, while rescuing the hostages,” he said.

Khan said that the attackers had been “in direct communications with Afghanistan-based planners throughout the incident” and Pakistan has repeatedly asked Kabul “to deny the use of its soil for terrorist groups like BLA for their attacks against Pakistan.”

“We urge Afghanistan to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers, of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and cooperate with the government of Pakistan to bring all those who are concerned with this attack, including the real sponsors of terrorism, to justice,” Khan said.

In an overnight statement, the military said that it had “confirmed intelligence” indicating that the assault was “orchestrated and directed by terrorist ring leaders operating from Afghanistan, who were in direct communication with the terrorists throughout the incident.” The military didn't reveal details of the intelligence.

In Kabul, Afghan foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi rejected the Pakistani accusations, saying: “We are saddened by the loss of life of innocents in the incident.”

According to a Pakistani military statement, the “terrorists, after blowing up the railway track, took control of the train and held the passengers hostage including women, children and elderly, using them as human shields.”

Many survivors said the assailants opened fire on the windows of the train, entered the cars and killed or wounded people before taking them hostage. 

Three soldiers who had been guarding the railroad track were among those killed, according to military spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif.

Separately, Pakistani security killed 10 militants after spotting them near a military facility in South Waziristan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, officials said. 

Authorities said those killed were members of Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTT. The group is an ally of the Taliban in Afghanistan and has been emboldened since the Afghan Taliban seized power there in 2021.

Munir Ahmed in Islamabad, and Rasool Dawar in Peshawar, contributed to this story.

LA MALBAIE, Canada (AP) — Top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies gathered in Canada on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump's trade and foreign policies have thrown the bloc's once solid unity into disarray.

The meeting began just after Trump threatened to impose 200% tariffs on European wine and other alcohol if the European Union doesn't back down from retaliating against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs with a levy on American whiskey. 

The escalating trade war adds to uncertainty over relations between the U.S. and its closest allies, which have already been strained by Trump's position on Russia's war in Ukraine.

It also likely means U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will hear a litany of complaints as he meets with the foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan over the next two days. 

All of them have been angered by the new American president's policies, and they smiled stiffly in frigid temperatures as they posed for a group photo at a snowy resort in La Malbaie, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence River. 

“Peace and stability is at the top of our agenda, and I look forward to discussing how we continue to support Ukraine in the face of Russia's illegal aggression,” Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said at the start of the meetings. “Of course, we want to foster long-term stability as well in the Middle East.”

Rubio met earlier with Joly, arriving in Quebec late Wednesday just hours after Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs kicked in — prompting responses from the European Union and Canada.

En route to Canada from Saudi Arabia, where he had won agreement from Ukraine for a 30-day ceasefire in the war pending Russia's approval, Rubio dismissed suggestions that he would face an uncomfortable reception from this counterparts.

But Joly, the host of the meeting, made clear that Canada, at least, would not back down. Trump has arguably been most antagonistic toward Canada with persistent talk of it becoming the 51st U.S. state, additional tariffs and repeated insults against its leadership.

Ahead of the talks, Joly said that “in every single meeting, I will raise the issue of tariffs to coordinate a response with the Europeans and to put pressure on the Americans.” She noted on Wednesday that Trump had “repeated his disrespectful 51st state rhetoric.”

For his part, Trump doubled down on his anti-Canada rhetoric during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday with NATO chief Mark Rutte. “To be honest with you, Canada only works as a state,” Trump said before going on to say that he's not going to change his mind on the tariffs he's imposing on Canada. “We've been ripped off for years,” he said. “We're not going to bend.”

Rubio had downplayed Trump's earlier comments, saying the president was only expressing what he thought would be a good idea. The G7 “is not a meeting about how we're going to take over Canada,” he said.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said G7 nations should avoid panic and posted a message of support for Canada on X, featuring a photo of her and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. “We've got your back, @melaniejoly,” she wrote. “#Canada #Solidarity” 

“We have learned altogether in these shaky geopolitical times ... especially in moments when your heart is really beating, it's important to keep calm,” Baerbock told reporters. She noted that the G7 has been “a powerhouse … for freedom, for our common understanding of peace.”

On tariffs, Rubio said G7 partners should understand that these are a “policy decision” by Trump to protect American competitiveness.

“I think it is quite possible that we could do these things and at the same time deal in a constructive way with our allies and friends and partners on all the other issues that we work together on,” Rubio told reporters Wednesday on a refueling stop in Ireland. “And that's what I expect out of the G7 and Canada.”

Asked if he expected a difficult reception from his counterparts, Rubio brushed the question aside: “I don't know, should I be? I mean, they've invited us to come. We intend to go. The alternative is to not go. I think that would actually make things worse, not better.”

Rubio notably skipped a meeting of G20 foreign ministers — a bigger but less powerful group that includes developing nations — last month in South Africa because of his concerns that the agenda, which included climate change and diversity, did not align with Trump administration policies.

The agenda for the G7 meeting includes discussions on China and the Indo-Pacific; Ukraine and Europe; stability in the Americas; the Middle East; maritime security; Africa; and China, North Korea, Iran and Russia.

Rubio and Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, had been in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, earlier in the week securing a potentially huge win for the administration — a possible ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, an issue that galvanized the G7 since even before the conflict began. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived Thursday in Russia for talks with officials on the proposal.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with the U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire but that the terms need to be worked out, emphasizing it should pave the way to lasting peace.

“So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,” Putin said at a news conference in Moscow. “But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.”

There was no immediate comment from G7 officials to Putin's comments, although participants were expected to be cautiously optimistic.

Still, Trump's apparent desire to draw Putin back into the fold — including saying he would like to see Russia rejoin the group to restore it to the G8 — continues to alarm G7 members. Russia was thrown out of the G8 after it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. 

Among international groupings, the G7 — whose members, with the exception of Japan, are all NATO allies — had been the toughest on Russia. 

At the last G7 foreign ministers meeting before the February 2022 invasion, members warned Russia in a joint statement in December 2021 of “massive consequences” should it attack Ukraine. Three months later, they coordinated to impose sweeping financial, travel and other sanctions on Moscow. 

Since Trump's election, that appears to be changing, at least from the U.S. side.

Rubio said his goal was not to antagonize Russia as it considers the ceasefire proposal “by issuing statements that are abrasive in any way.” He noted that all of the sanctions against Russia remain in place but that new threats of action could be counterproductive to getting Putin on board with the U.S. peace plan.

That throws into question hopes that the G7 can unify around a common statement condemning Russia.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentine retirees and fans of several soccer teams clashed with police Wednesday during a protest in front of Congress in the capital, Buenos Aires, against the economic policies implemented by the government of President Javier Milei.

What started as a peaceful demonstration escalated into violent clashes as police deployed water cannons, tear gas, and pellets against stone-throwing protesters.

For weeks, Buenos Aires retirees have held weekly protests demanding higher pensions, citing a precarious standard of living. While previous demonstrations involved minor incidents, including tear gas use against the elderly, Wednesday's protest was unprecedented in scale.

The government of far-right President Javier Milei, who has championed a policy of public spending cuts since coming to power a year and a half ago, had warned of restrictions on entry to stadiums for those who cause disorder.

Police deployed shotguns and water hoses before the scheduled 5:00 p.m. protest.

Clashes erupted when a large group of Boca Juniors soccer fans, waving flags and chanting in support of the retirees, arrived. Police formed a cordon to block their advance toward Congress.

At the rear, a group of elderly protesters were pushed back by high-pressure water cannons fired by two tanks at the perimeter closest to the Legislative Assembly.

In an unprecedented show of unity, fans from Boca Juniors, River Plate, and other Argentine soccer clubs joined pensioners who gather outside Congress every Wednesday to protest the government's austerity measures.

Surrounded by police, protesters chanted, “Don't touch the elderly.” A man draped in the Argentine flag held a sign that read “Help me fight. You'll be the next elderly person.”

A resolution published Wednesday by Argentina's Ministry of Security bans anyone who engages in violent behavior, disrupts security, traffic, or public order from entering soccer stadiums. This means that fans involved in Wednesday's riots will be barred from attending their team's games for a period set by the authorities.

PANAMA CITY (AP) — They crossed oceans to get to the U.S., fleeing conflict, religious persecution, poverty and government crackdowns in countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Cameroon, China, Pakistan and Iran.



After flying to Central and South America, they bused through countries where they didn't speak the language and walked through unfamiliar jungle to get to the U.S.-Mexico border.



Within days, they were detained and put on military aircraft that flew nearly 300 of them to Panama as U.S. President Donald Trump sought to accelerate deportations to more complicated destinations.



Panama was supposed to be a stopover. But for those unwilling to return home — mostly out of well-founded fear — Panama sent them to a guarded camp without access to lawyers in the same Darién jungle many had crossed months earlier on their way north.



Over the past week, under legal pressure, the Panamanian government dropped them off at a bus station in the capital with 30 days to figure out where they will go next. 



“It feels like the whole world is crushing down on me. It's like everything is stopping,” said Isha Len, a 29-year-old from Cameroon. “I risked everything, my life, everything, crossing the Darién Gap, just to be sent back.”



Here are the stories that some of the deportees told The Associated Press:

After conflict broke out in her small town, Len crossed Cameroon by car and minibus, then a fisherman friend carried her four hours by boat to Nigeria. 



Len, a schoolteacher, flew to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where she said authorities detained her for a month in the airport. From there, she wound north through South America by bus, following other migrants until they reached the Darién Gap.



She walked days through the dangerous jungle that divides Colombia and Panama before boarding buses that carried her through Central America. After being kidnapped for days by a gang in Guatemala, she crossed into southern Mexico, where she took a boat along the Pacific coast to evade authorities. After she landed, she rode eight hours to Mexico City, continuing on by bus and car to Tijuana. 



She crossed the U.S. border and presented herself to American authorities.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)





Artemis Ghasemzadeh left her country in January, fleeing after converting from Islam to Christianity – something that could cost Ghasemzadeh her life in Iran. She flew to Dubai, where she stayed two weeks and then took a flight to South Korea. 



From there she flew to Mexico City, staying there for three weeks before going to Tijuana. She crossed the U.S. border on Feb. 9, and was detained for five days, including her birthday.



“For changing your religion, your punishment is death,” she said. “We don't know what will happen.”

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)





Wang Qiu said he left home after he was imprisoned for three years for speaking out about democracy and human rights issues. 



He flew from Beijing to Cuba, then to the small South American country of Suriname. From there, he traveled by land: through Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, before trekking through the Darién Gap.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)





He moved up through Central America and Mexico before being detained after crossing into the U.S. in San Diego.







Qamar Abdi, left for the U.S. on Aug. 17, due to warfare between the government and militants of al-Shabab, which the U.S. recognizes as a terrorist group. 



She hopped from buses to shared cars for nearly a month until she reached South Africa. From there, she flew to Sao Paulo, Brazil, and spent the next six months riding buses north. 



When she arrived at the northern tip of Colombia, she traveled six days through the Darién Gap, landing in Panama on New Year's Day. 



She took buses to the southern Mexican border city of Tapachula, where she was temporarily kidnapped and robbed by a gang. To avoid immigration authorities, she traveled hours packed on a boat with other migrants along Mexico's Pacific coast, then took a bus to Mexico City. She spent two weeks there before driving to Tijuana, where she crossed into the U.S.







Ebrahim Ghezelgechi fled Iran with his wife, Sahar; 10-year-old daughter, Aylin; and 11-year-old son, Sam, on Nov. 21. 



The family flew to Brazil, then to Panama and finally Nicaragua. From there, they took buses north to Guatemala, then crossed into southern Mexico by boat. They rode on top of trains and in buses and vans to get to Tijuana. 



After Mexico authorities sent them back to the southern part of the country, they took a plane to the resort area of Los Cabos. There, they were detained, had their passports taken and were sent back south again. 



They tried getting north a number of times, punted back by Mexican authorities, before eventually paying a driver to take them to Tijuana. 



After crossing into the U.S., they were detained in San Diego for a week.







Samin Haider left for Dubai in 2023 after violence surged in his region of Parachinar, which borders Afghanistan and has been plagued for decades by conflicts between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslim communities. 



Haider was there for 1 1/2 years before the United Arab Emirates canceled visas for Pakistanis. 



Haider then flew to Mexico and traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border with the hopes of seeking asylum. 



Now deported to Panama, he still hopes to reach the U.S.

Elham Ghaedi left on Oct. 21, flying to Brazil and then to Venezuela's capital Caracas. 



She traveled to Colombia, where took a bus north and then walked five days through the Darién Gap. 



She stayed 15 days in a migrant camp in southern Panama before taking a bus through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and to Mexico's southern border. There, migration authorities detained her for six days.



She traveled north to Mexico City, where she spent a month, before boarding a flight to Tijuana. U.S. authorities detained her when she crossed to San Diego.

Omagh fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the takeover of the Taliban because he identified as an atheist and was part of an ethnic minority, something that could put his life in danger. 



He first went to Pakistan, where he got a visa for six months, and struggled to get a new one due to his Afghani passport. 



He then went to Iran and worked there for 1 1/2 years. But the country wouldn't accept him as a refugee. 



He managed to get a visa to Brazil, which offered a number of Afghan people refuge after the rise of the Taliban, and flew to Sao Paulo in 2024.






Hoping to reunite with friends and family in the U.S., Omagh paid smugglers to move him north through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. He trekked through the Darién Gap, then took buses north through Central America to southern Mexico. 



Mexican authorities detained him and dropped him back in southern Mexico a few times before he managed to take a flight to Mexico City and later to the U.S., where he was detained. 



“After so much time, I've lost hope,” he said.

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Archaeologists in Cambodia are celebrating an unexpected find at the country's centuries-old Angkor temple complex: the torso of a statue of Buddha that matches a head found nearly a century ago at the same site.

The torso, believed to be from the 12th or 13th century, was discovered during a dig by a team of Cambodian and Indian experts last month at Angkor's Ta Prohm temple. It was found along with 29 fragments that appeared to be part of the same statue, archaeologist Neth Simon said this week. 

It stands at 1.16 meters (3 3/4 feet) tall and is in the Bayon art style, associated with Angkor's Bayon temple. 

“It was a big surprise when we unearthed this sculpture because all we'd found so far were small pieces,” Neth Simon told The Associated Press by phone from Siem Reap province. 

She described the statue's design as displaying carved jewelry and robe and sash, with a unique left-hand gesture across the chest — “an uncommon representation in Khmer (Cambodian) art.”

The statue's presumed head was discovered at the same temple in 1927 during the French colonial era, and is currently kept at Cambodia's main National Museum in the capital Phnom Penh. Neth Simon said the torso was found about 50 meters (yards) away from the site where the head was discovered, and that an optical electronic scan confirmed they were a match.

A near-complete reconstruction of the status is possible, Neth Simon added, now that only the right hand of the statue remains missing. Her team will ask the Minister of Culture and Fine Art for approval to reattach the head and body of the sculpture to make it whole for public display.




The Angkor site sprawls across some 400 square kilometers (155 square miles), containing the ruins of capitals of various Cambodian empires from the 9th to the 15th centuries. Scholars consider it to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia. 

The site is Cambodia's most popular tourist attraction and in 2024 attracted about a million international tourists, according to Cambodia's Tourism Ministry.

The excavations aim to organize and preserve the numerous art objects scattered throughout the Ta Prohm complex, highlighting the ongoing efforts to protect and understand Cambodia's rich cultural heritage, the Apsara Authority says.

Neth Simon said she would be delighted if the statue's pieces could be reassembled after being far apart from each other for a century.

“As an archaeologist, I would be really happy,” she said.

VIENNA (AP) — The new Austrian government said Wednesday that family reunion procedures for migrants will be immediately halted because the country is no longer able to absorb newcomers adequately. 

The measure is temporary and intended to ensure that those migrants who are already in the country can be better integrated, Chancellor Christian Stocker from the conservative Austrian People's Party said.

“Austria's capacities are limited, and that is why we have decided to prevent further overloading,” Stocker said.

The new measure means that migrants with so-called protected status — meaning they cannot be deported — are no longer allowed to bring family members still living in their home countries to Austria.

The new three-party coalition made up of the People's Party, the center-left Social Democrats and the liberal Neos, has said that curbing migration is one of its top issues and vowed to implement strict new asylum rules.

Official figures show that 7,762 people arrived in Austria last year as part of family reunion procedures for migrants. In 2023 the figure was 9,254. Most new arrivals were minors.

Migrants who are still in the asylum process or have received a deportation order are not allowed in the first place to bring family members from their countries of origin.

Most recent asylum seekers came from Syria and Afghanistan, the Austrian chancellery said in a statement.

The European Union country has 9 million inhabitants.




Stocker said the measure was necessary because “the quality of the school system, integration and ultimately the security of our entire systems need to be protected — so that we do not impair their ability to function.”

The government said it had already informed the EU of its new measures. It denied to say for how long it would put family reunions on hold.

“Since last summer, we have succeeded in significantly reducing family reunification,” Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said. “Now we are creating the legal basis to ensure this stop is sustainable.”

All over the continent, governments have been trying to cut the number of migrants. The clamp-down on migrants is a harsh turnaround from ten years ago, when countries like Germany and Sweden openly welcomed more than 1 million migrants from war-torn countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. 

Many communities and towns in other countries, such as Germany, also say they no longer have capacities to find shelter or homes for migrants. 

The EU is trying to keep more migrants from entering its 27-country bloc and move faster to deport those whose asylum procedures are rejected. 

On Tuesday, the EU unveiled a new migration proposal that envisions the opening of so-called “return hubs” to be set up in third countries to speed up the deportation for rejected asylum-seekers.

So far, only 20% of people with a deportation order are effectively removed from EU territory, according to the European Commission.

The commission has proposed a “European System for Returns” that will set a standard for all 27 members of the bloc and allow national authorities from one country to enforce deportation orders issued by another. Such rules were missing from the EU's migration and asylum pact approved last year.

Trump says “it's up to Russia now” as US presses for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump spoke with reporters in the Oval Office. “And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath” ended, the president added.

Soldiers of the 13th of National Guard Khartia Brigade reacted to U.S. President Trump's announcement to lift a suspension of military aid for Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. “Motzart,” an artillery battery commander of the Khartia Brigade, said “America is a strategic partner of Ukraine and it is very important to support each other in such times.”

Ukraine has made a concrete decision that it is ready for a ceasefire, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday, as the U.S. relayed details of a 30-day ceasefire proposal to the Kremlin.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said during a visit to the Kursk region that he wants Ukrainian forces pushed out.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. arms deliveries to Ukraine resumed Wednesday, officials said, a day after the Trump administration lifted its suspension of military aid for Kyiv in its fight against Russia's invasion, and officials awaited the Kremlin's response to a proposed 30-day ceasefire endorsed by Ukraine.



Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it's important not to “get ahead” of the question of responding to the ceasefire, which was proposed by Washington. He told reporters that Moscow is awaiting “detailed information” from the U.S. and suggested that Russia must get that before it can take a position. The Kremlin has previously opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict and has not accepted any concessions.



U.S. President Donald Trump wants to end the three-year war and pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to enter talks. The suspension of U.S. assistance happened days after Zelenskyy and Trump argued about the conflict in a tense White House meeting. The administration's decision to resume military aid after talks Tuesday with senior Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia marked a sharp shift in its stance.

Trump said “it's up to Russia now” as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire.

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the U.S. resuming military aid to Ukraine while awaiting Russia's answer to a ceasefire proposal.



“And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia,” Trump said Wednesday in an extended exchange with reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Micheál Martin, the prime minster of Ireland. “And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath” ended.



The U.S. president again made veiled threats of hitting Russia with new sanctions.






“We can, but I hope it's not going to be necessary,” Trump said.



U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the American delegation to Saudi Arabia, where Ukraine consented to the U.S. ceasefire proposal, said Washington will pursue “multiple points of contacts” with Russia to see if President Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate an end to the war. He declined to give details or say what steps might be taken if Putin refuses to engage.



The U.S. hopes to see Russia stop attacks on Ukraine within the next few days as a first step, Rubio said at a refueling stop Wednesday in Shannon, Ireland, on his way to talks in Canada with other Group of Seven leading industrialized nations.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that national security adviser Mike Waltz spoke Wednesday with his Russian counterpart.



She also confirmed that Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will head to Moscow for talks with Russian officials. She did not say with whom Witkoff planned to meet. A person familiar with the matter said Witkoff is expected to meet with Putin later his week. The person was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.











Zelenskyy said the 30-day ceasefire would allow the sides “to fully prepare a step-by-step plan for ending the war, including security guarantees for Ukraine.”



Technical questions over how to effectively monitor a truce along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, where small but deadly drones are common, are “very important,” Zelenskyy told reporters Wednesday in Kyiv.

Arms deliveries to Ukraine have already resumed through a Polish logistics center, the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Poland announced Wednesday. The deliveries go through a NATO and U.S. hub in the eastern Polish city of Rzeszow that's has been used to ferry Western weapons into neighboring Ukraine about 70 kilometers (45 miles) away.



The American military help is vital for Ukraine's shorthanded and weary army, which is having a tough time keeping Russia's bigger military force at bay. For Russia, the American aid spells potentially more difficulty in achieving war aims, and it could make Washington's peace efforts a tougher sell in Moscow.



The U.S. government has also restored Ukraine's access to unclassified commercial satellite pictures provided by Maxar Technologies through a program Washington runs, Maxar spokesperson Tomi Maxted told The Associated Press. The images help Ukraine plan attacks, assess their success and monitor Russian movements.



In other developments, officials acknowledged Wednesday that Kyiv no longer has any of the longer-range Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, missiles.



According to a U.S. official and a Ukrainian lawmaker on the country's defense committee, Ukraine has run out of the ATACMs. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide military weapons details.



The U.S. official said the U.S. provided fewer than 40 of those missiles overall and that Ukraine ran out of them in late January. Senior U.S. defense leaders, including the previous Pentagon chief, Lloyd Austin, had made it clear that only a limited number of the ATACMs would be delivered and that the U.S. and NATO allies considered other weapons to be more valuable in the fight.







Putin on Wednesday visited military headquarters in Russia's Kursk region, where Kremlin troops are close to driving out Ukrainian forces. In the last few days, the Russian military entered the town of Sudzha, near the border, that had been occupied by Ukrainian soldiers since they launched a surprise incursion into Kursk in August.



Speaking to commanders, Putin said he expected the military “to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future.”



Chief of the Russian military's general staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, reported to Putin that Russian troops crossed into Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region in several places and were “destroying the enemy reserves and expanding a security zone” there.



In a signal that Moscow could try to expand its land gains by capturing parts of the Sumy region, Putin said that in the future “it's necessary to think about creating a security zone alongside the state border.”



Ukraine's raid into Kursk was the first foreign occupation of Russian territory since World War II. Ukrainian troops held on for months despite intense pressure from tens of thousands of Russian and North Korean troops.



Meanwhile in Ukraine, Russian ballistic missiles killed at least five civilians, officials said Wednesday.

Russian lawmakers signaled wariness about the prospect of a ceasefire.



“Any agreements (with the understanding of the need for compromise) should be on our terms, not American,” senior Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev noted in a post on the messaging app Telegram.



Lawmaker Mikhail Sheremet told the state news agency Tass that Russia “is not interested in continuing” the war, but at the same time Moscow “will not tolerate being strung along.”



The outcome of the Saudi Arabia talks “places the onus on Washington to persuade Moscow to accept and implement the ceasefire,” said John Hardie, a defense analyst and deputy director of the Russia program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute.

Russia's foreign intelligence service, known as the SVR, reported Wednesday that the service's chief, Sergei Naryshkin, spoke by phone Tuesday with CIA Director John Ratcliffe.



The two discussed cooperation “in areas of common interest and the resolution of crisis situations,” according to a statement by the SVR.

Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was being flown to the Netherlands on Wednesday to face an International Criminal Court charge of crimes against humanity linked to the deadly crackdown on drugs he oversaw while in office.

The arrest of ex-Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte for alleged crimes against humanity is an “important moment” for international law, International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan said Wednesday.

Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, has vowed to “continue to serve” his country despite facing prosecution by the International Criminal Court. In a message recorded on the flight to the ICC in the Netherlands on Wednesday, he said for “what happened in the past, I will face it for our law enforcement and military.” The court on Wednesday took custody of the 79-year-old Duterte after he was detained in Manila on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The International Criminal Court took custody of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity for deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office.

Rights groups and families of victims hailed Duterte's arrest, and the court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, called it “a crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.”

Supporters of Duterte criticized the administration of current Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte's political rival, for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute. 

The 79-year-old former president arrived in the Netherlands on a flight from Manila, where he was arrested on an ICC request Tuesday.

The Dutch-based court said in a statement that medical assistance was made available to Duterte as a precaution, in line with standard procedures when a suspect arrives. The court did not comment on his state of health.

An ambulance drove to the hangar where his plane was taken, and medics wheeled a gurney inside. A police helicopter hovered close to the airport, and later a black SUV was seen leaving the airport accompanied by police. Its destination was not immediately clear. Crowds gathered outside the detention center for ICC suspects.

The Philippine Embassy in The Hague provided consular assistance to Duterte upon his arrival, including winter clothing and care packages, the Philippine Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued Thursday in Manila.




Within days, Duterte will face an initial appearance where the court will confirm his identity, check that he understands the charges against him and set a date for a hearing to assess if prosecutors have sufficient evidence to send him to a full trial.

If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Duterte could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

“This is a monumental and long-overdue step for justice for thousands of victims and their families,” said Jerrie Abella of Amnesty International. 

“It is therefore a hopeful sign for them, as well, in the Philippines and beyond, as it shows that suspected perpetrators of the worst crimes, including government leaders, will face justice wherever they are in the world,” Abella added.

Emily Soriano, the mother of a victim of the crackdowns, said she wanted more officials to face justice.

“Duterte is lucky he has due process, but our children who were killed did not have due process,” she said.

While Duterte's plane was in the air, grieving relatives gathered in the Philippines to mourn his alleged victims, carrying the urns of their loved ones. “We are happy and we feel relieved,” said 55-year-old Melinda Abion Lafuente, mother of 22-year-old Angelo Lafuente, who she says was tortured and killed in 2016.

Duterte's supporters, however, criticized his arrest as illegal and sought to have him returned home. Small groups of Duterte supporters and people who backed his arrest demonstrated on Wednesday outside the court before his arrival.

The ICC opened an inquiry in 2021 into mass killings linked to the so-called war on drugs overseen by Duterte when he served as mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao and later as president.

Estimates of the death toll during Duterte's presidential term vary, from the more than 6,000 that the national police have reported and up to 30,000 claimed by human rights groups.

ICC judges who looked at prosecution evidence supporting their request for his arrest found “reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Duterte is individually responsible for the crime against humanity of murder” as an “indirect co-perpetrator for having allegedly overseen the killings when he was mayor of Davao and later president of the Philippines,” according to his warrant.

In its statement Wednesday, the ICC outlined the technical stages of the upcoming hearing, without setting a specific date, and thanked Philippine authorities ‘'for their commitment to upholding international accountability mechanisms.''

Duterte could challenge the court's jurisdiction and the admissibility of the case. While the Philippines is no longer a member of the ICC, the alleged crimes happened before Manila withdrew from the court.

That process will likely take months and if the case progresses to trial it could take years. Duterte will be able to apply for provisional release from the court's detention center while he waits, though it's up to judges to decide whether to grant such a request.

A video taken while he was on the plane was posted to Duterte's official Facebook page. “To my countrymen, just to give you the current situation,″ he said, combining English and Tagalog. “This will be a long legal proceedings. I say to you, I will continue to serve you.″

Duterte's legal counsel, Salvador Panelo, told reporters in Manila that the Philippine Supreme Court “can compel the government to bring back the person arrested and detained without probable cause and compel the government bring him before the court and to explain to them why they (government) did what they did.”

Marcos said Tuesday that Duterte's arrest was “proper and correct” and not an act of political persecution. 

Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, criticized the Marcos administration for surrendering her father to a foreign court, which she said currently has no jurisdiction in the Philippines.

She left the Philippines on Wednesday to arrange a meeting in The Hague with her detained father and talk to his lawyers, her office told reporters in Manila.

Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the ICC, in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.

The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing that the ICC — a court of last resort — therefore didn't have jurisdiction.

Appeals judges at the ICC rejected those arguments and ruled in 2023 that the investigation could resume.

The ICC judges who issued the warrant also said that the alleged crimes fall within the court's jurisdiction. They said Duterte's arrest was necessary because of what they called the “risk of interference with the investigations and the security of witnesses and victims.”

British officials were concerned about possible environmental damage Tuesday and looking for answers a day after a cargo ship carrying a toxic chemical hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military off eastern England, setting both vessels ablaze.

A camera onboard a nearby vessel has captured the moment a cargo ship crashed into a tanker carrying jet fuel for the US military. Monday's collision in the North Sea set both vessels on fire and sent fuel pouring into the waters off eastern England. The video by Orca AI — a company specializing in port call optimization — was captured by a lookout unit mounted on a tanker, a and shows the moment of impact followed by an explosion.

LONDON (AP) — The captain of a cargo ship that collided with a U.S. tanker is a Russian national who remains in U.K. police custody, the vessel's owner said Wednesday, as it emerged that the ship failed several safety checks last year.

The 59-year-old man, who hasn't been named by authorities, was arrested by police in northeast England Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence over the collision. He hasn't been charged.

Shipping company Ernst Russ, which owns the Portugal-flagged cargo vessel Solong, said that the ship's 14 crew were a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals.

U.K. authorities say they have found no evidence of foul play in the crash, and there is nothing so far to indicate that it's connected to national security. Humberside Police said that detectives were conducting inquiries alongside partner agencies.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the captain of a cargo ship that collided with a U.S. tanker is a Russian national who remains in U.K. police custody, as it emerges the ship has failed several safety checks.

The U.K. Marine Accident Investigation Branch is also involved in investigating what caused the Solong, bound from Grangemouth, Scotland, to Rotterdam, Netherlands, to hit the stationary tanker, which was anchored about 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the English coast.

The investigation is being led by the U.S. and Portugal, the countries where the vessels are flagged.

Port inspection documents show the Solong failed steering-related safety checks in Dublin, Ireland, in July, with the vessel's “emergency steering position communications/compass reading” unreadable. Inspectors found a total of 10 deficiencies, including “inadequate” alarms, survival craft “not properly maintained” and fire doors “not as required.”




An inspection in Scotland in October found two other deficiencies. The ship wasn't detained after either inspection.

The cargo ship collided Monday with MV Stena Immaculate, a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military in the North Sea off eastern England on Monday, setting both vessels ablaze. One sailor from the Solong is missing and presumed dead. The other 36 crew members from the two vessels were brought safely ashore, with no major injuries.

The Solong was drifting and still smoldering Wednesday, but is likely to remain afloat rather than sinking, officials said.

The 183-meter (596-foot) Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government's Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed.

The collision sent jet fuel pouring into the sea and sparked fears of significant environmental damage. Environmentalists said that oil and chemicals posed a risk to sea life, including whales and dolphins and to birds, including puffins, gannets and guillemots that live on coastal cliffs.

The U.K. coast guard agency said that no new pollution had been reported since the initial incident, and environmental campaigning group Greenpeace said the impact on marine life may not be as bad as first feared.

“We're not quite out of the danger zone yet, but it's starting to look like an environmental disaster may have been narrowly averted,” said Paul Johnston from the Greenpeace Research Laboratories. “When a container ship the length of a football pitch rams into a tanker carrying thousands of tons of jet fuel at 16 knots close to sensitive nature sites, the potential for serious harm is huge.”

NUUK, Greenland (AP) — Greenland's likely new prime minister on Wednesday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's effort to take control of the island, saying Greenlanders must be allowed to decide their own future as it moves toward independence from Denmark.

Jens-Frederik Nielsen's Demokraatit, a pro-business party that favors a slow path to independence, won a surprise victory in Tuesday's parliamentary election, outpacing the two left-leaning parties that formed the last government. With most Greenlanders opposing Trump's overtures, the campaign focused more on issues like healthcare and education than on geopolitics.

But on Wednesday Nielsen was quick to push back against Trump, who last week told a joint session of Congress that the U.S. needed Greenland to protect its own national security interests and he expected to get it “one way or the other.”

“We don't want to be Americans. No, we don't want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders, and we want our own independence in the future,” Nielsen, 33, told Britain's Sky News. “And we want to build our own country by ourselves.”

That didn't stop Trump from suggesting during a Thursday Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte that Greenland's election that it was “very good” for “us” and “the person who did the best is a very good person, as far as we're concerned.”

Greenland, a self-governing region of Denmark, has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009, when the government in Copenhagen recognized its right to self-determination under international law. Four of the five main parties in the election supported independence, though they disagreed on when and how to achieve it.

The island of 56,000 people, most from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds, has attracted international attention since Trump announced his designs on it soon after returning to the White House in January. 

Trump is focused on Greenland because it straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and is home to the U.S.'s Pituffik Space Base, which supports missile warning and space surveillance operations. Greenland also has large deposits of the rare-earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology. 

Trump said during the meeting with Rutte that “Denmark's very far away” from Greenland and questioned whether that country still had a right to claim the world's largest island as part of its kingdom. 

“A boat landed there 200 years ago or something. And they say they have rights to it,” Trump said. “I don't know if that's true. I don't think it is, actually.”

Trump said U.S. control of Greenland could be important for national security reasons and even suggested NATO should be involved, but Rutte demurred. Trump nonetheless noted that the U.S. already has a considerable military presence in Greenland and added, “Maybe you'll see more and more soldiers going there. I don't know.”

Despite that, Trump's overtures weren't on the ballot. 

The 31 men and women elected to parliament on Tuesday will have to set priorities for issues such as diversifying Greenland's economy, building infrastructure and improving health care, as well as shaping the country's strategy for countering the president's America First agenda.

Demokraatit won 29.9% of the vote by campaigning to improve housing and educational standards while delaying independence until Greenland is self-sufficient. Four years ago, the party finished in fourth place with 9.1%.

Nuuk resident Anthon Nielsen said the party's victory would be good for the country.

“Most politicians want Greenland to be independent,” he said. “But this party who won, they don't want to hurry things so everything must be done right.”

Carina Ren, head of the Arctic program at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, said the results show that Greenlanders tried to ignore Trump and focus on issues that were important to them.

“The voters have been able to drag down all the drama, all the alarmist talk from the outside to say, ‘Well, this is about our everyday lives, our everyday concerns as citizens. Where are we going, how are we going to develop our society from the inside.'”

Now Demokraatit will have to turn its attention to forming a governing coalition. 

Naleraq, the most aggressively pro-independence party, finished in second place, with 24.5% of the vote. It was followed by Inuit Ataqatigiit, which led the last government, at 21.4%.

“What approach to independence will win the day will ultimately depend on if Demokraatit decides to form a coalition government, and if so, with which party,” said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative.

Nielsen appeared to be surprised by Demokraatit's gains as the results came it, with photos showing him sporting a huge grin and applauding at a post-election party.

He later said Demokraatit would reach out to all the other parties to negotiate Greenland's future political course.

Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen congratulated Demokraatit and warned that Greenland's new government would likely have to “deal with massive pressure” from Trump.

“It's not the case that you can just take part of the Danish Realm,” Danish broadcaster DR quoted him as saying. “The future of Greenland is based on what the Greenlandic people and government want.”

Greenland Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede last month called early elections, saying the country needed to be united during a “serious time” unlike anything Greenland has ever experienced.

On Wednesday, after the results were known, Egede used a Facebook post to thank voters for turning out and said the parties were ready to turn to negotiations to form a government.

Pakistani authorities on Wednesday said an insurgent attack on a train carrying hundreds of people had ended, with all attackers killed following a daylong standoff. Some of the hostages taken were killed. Security officials said over 300 hostages were rescued, and the operation continued.

Authorities in Pakistan have sent the last remaining civilian survivors of a hijacked train to Quetta under heavy security.

QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — Insurgents who attacked a passenger train carrying 440 passengers in restive southwestern Pakistan killed 21 hostages before security forces killed all 33 of the assailants, and all other passengers were rescued, officials said Wednesday.

Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the separatist Baloch Liberation Army group was behind the attack, and the military operation “has successfully reached its logical conclusion.”

He said no passengers died because of the operation, and praised the military for “averting a potential catastrophe.” The province's chief minister, Sarfraz Bugti, told a provincial assembly that troops killed all insurgents involved.

Three soldiers who had been guarding the railroad track were also killed in the attack that began Tuesday in restive Balochistan province, the military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, told local media.

The Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for attacking the train in a tunnel in a remote part of Balochistan. Spokesman Jeeyand Baloch had said the group was ready to free passengers if authorities agreed to release jailed militants.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Pakistani security forces have exchanged gunfire with separatist militants as they seek to free hundreds of hostages aboard a train in the country's rugged southwest.

The BLA regularly targets Pakistani security forces and has also attacked civilians, including Chinese nationals among the thousands working on multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects in Balochistan.

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said her country “will continue to firmly support Pakistan in advancing its counterterrorism efforts.”

Some relatives of hostages were angry at Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who last year claimed that the BLA was not a threat and “an ordinary police inspector could fix this situation.”

The train had been traveling from Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar. Officials say the Jafer Express train was partially inside a tunnel when the militants blew up the tracks, forcing the engine and nine coaches to stop.

Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest and least populated province. It's a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government.

Balochistan borders Iran and Afghanistan and has long been the scene of insurgency. Separatists demand greater autonomy from the government in Islamabad and a larger share of the region's natural resources.

Insurgencies on either side of the Iran-Pakistan border have frustrated both countries, whose governments suspect each other of supporting — or at least tolerating — some groups. Iran has sought help from Pakistan in countering the threat from the militant group Jaish al-Adl. Pakistan wants Tehran to deny sanctuaries to BLA fighters.

Members of the military frequently use trains to travel from Balochistan's capital, Quetta, to other parts of the country. In November, the BLA carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in Quetta, killing 26 people.

The BLA had warned that hostages' lives would be at risk if the government did not negotiate. Analysts said the attack and its focus on civilians could backfire.

“After failing to damage the Pakistan Army within Balochistan, BLA has shifted its targets from military to unarmed civilians. This may give them instant public and media attention, but it will weaken their support base within the civilian population, which is their ultimate objective,” said Syed Muhammad Ali, an Islamabad-based independent security analyst.

Rescued passengers, including women and children, were being sent to their hometowns. Some of the injured were taken to Quetta, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) away.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The International Criminal Court where detained former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will face justice after his arrest in the Philippines is a court of last resort for the most serious international offenses, such as genocide and crimes against humanity. 

The 79-year-old former president has become the first former Asian leader to be arrested by the global court. Duterte arrived Wednesday in the Netherlands after his arrest the previous morning on an ICC warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drug crackdowns he oversaw while in office.

Supporters of Duterte argue that the court does not have jurisdiction to put the former president on trial, in part because Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court in 2019. But judges who issued his arrest warrant say that the alleged crimes he is charged with happened before that withdrawal, meaning the court has jurisdiction.

The ICC handles allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and aggression, and takes on cases when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute crimes on their territory.

The court's newest member, Ukraine, formally joined in January, bringing the number of member states to 125. Major powers — the United States, Russia and China — are among nations that are not members.

The ICC, which has a budget this year of more than 195 million euros ($213 million), does not have a police force and has to rely on the cooperation of states to arrest suspects.




Judges at the court have issued 60 arrest warrants and convicted 11 people. Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga was the first, sentenced in 2012 to 14 years in prison for conscripting child soldiers.

In 2021, the court convicted Ugandan commander Dominic Ongwen of dozens of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including multiple killings and forced marriages in Uganda. Ongwen was a one-time child soldier who morphed into a brutal commander of a notorious rebel group known as the Lord's Resistance Army.

Three verdicts are pending. Former Central African Republic soccer federation president Patrice-Edouard Ngaïssona and Alfred Yekatom, alleged leaders of a predominantly Christian rebel group in the Central African Republic, are accused of multiple counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The trial of Ali Mohammed Ali Abdul Rahman Ali, who is accused of committing atrocities as the leader of the Janjaweed militia in Sudan, wrapped up last year.

The court's detention center is housed behind the high brick walls of a Dutch prison complex in The Hague seaside suburb of Scheveningen, about a mile (1.5 kilometers) from the court's headquarters.

Detainees have access to books, television and news, as well as a gym and sports facilities. They also can use a computer to work on their defense case and get computer training, if they need it. The court also arranges for family members to visit people in its custody.

Photos on the ICC website show a communal area with a foosball table, kitchen facilities, a table and chairs. The center also has a small medical facility.

Each cell contains a bed, desk, cupboard, toilet, hand basin, television and an intercom system to contact guards when the door is locked.

If Duterte goes to trial and is convicted, he would not serve his sentence in The Hague but be transferred to a prison in another country.

The detention center currently houses five other suspects; Mahamat Said Abdel Kani, Yekatom, and Ngaïssona from the Central African Republic, Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud from Mali and Abdul Rahman from Sudan.

The ICC has issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects since it was established in 2002. Among them are Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The court issued a warrant for Putin two years ago, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. He has rejected the accusations.

In November, the court's judges issued warrants for Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas' military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the war in Gaza. Netanyahu condemned the warrant against him, saying Israel “rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions” by the court. The case against the Hamas military leader has been terminated because he is believed to have been killed.

Other suspects wanted by the ICC include former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Joseph Kony, leader of the shadowy Ugandan militia Lord's Resistance Army.

The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage and sent 11 people to hospital, officials said.

ROME (AP) — The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage and sent 11 people to the hospital, the most serious suffering contusions after part of a ceiling collapsed, officials said.

The quake was the strongest in recorded history around the Phlegrean Fields, a sprawling area of ancient volcanoes that covers a broad swath of the Naples metropolitan area. It matched the magnitude of another quake in the same area last May that has put the population on alert.

Residents shaken awake by the early-morning quake sought safety in the streets, as they did in May.

The temblor, which loosened stone and cement from some facades, was centered just offshore from Pozzuoli, a seaside suburb bordering Naples. Mayor Gaetano Manfredi told reporters that one church, a seven-story residential building and another building were declared off-limits due to damage, and some schools were closed as a precaution.

Inspectors were checking buildings for further damage, Manfredi said. “We are following with the greatest attention all of our structures, and are monitoring all events in real time,'' the mayor said.

In all, 11 people sought hospital treatment. One woman was injured after part of a ceiling fell, and several others suffered cuts from glass that broke in the quake, Manfredi said. 

Seismologists have reported a fresh increase in activity around the Phlegrean Fields over recent weeks. Authorities last summer conducted drills in preparation for a major emergency as the frequency of temblors increased.

The area around the Phlegrean Fields, which encompasses western neighborhoods of Naples and its suburbs, is both seismically and volcanically active. The surface has been pushed up 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) since 2006, which is higher than prior to the last major event in 1984, but seismologists have emphasized it is impossible to predict when an eruption or stronger quake might occur.

At least 500,000 people live in the zone most at risk should the volcano erupt. Italy's national institute for geophysics and vulcanology has called for a governmental plan to ensure that structures can withstand a quake of at least a magnitude 5.0.

During the 1984 event, 40,000 residents were evacuated during a period of intense seismic activity as a precaution against a feared eruption that did not occur.

        US President Donald Trump said he would respond to the European Union's retaliatory tariffs against his 25% import levies on steel and aluminum.
    

US President Donald Trump said he would respond to the European Union's retaliatory tariffs as a global trade war escalates. 

He did not specify how he would respond to the countermeasures but said, “Of course, I'm going to respond,” when asked by reporters at the White House on Wednesday. 

Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum to 50% before retreating to a 25% rate after Ontario suspended the electricity surcharge to the US earlier in the day.

Trump proceeded with the blanket 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum to other countries on Wednesday, prompting immediate countermeasures from the EU and Canada.

The EU hit back with import duties on €26 billion worth of American goods “matching the economic scope the US tariffs,” marking a major retaliatory action to the recent Trump administration's tariff escalation. 

The European Commission will resume countermeasures from 2018 to 2020 during Trump's first term against €8 billion worth of US goods on 1 April, followed by a new package of tariffs on €18 billion in mid-April.

In the statement, the European Commission said: “The Commission regrets the US decision to impose such tariffs, considering them unjustified, disruptive to transatlantic trade, and harmful to businesses and consumers, often resulting in higher prices.” 

It also added that “the EU remains ready to work with the US administration to find a negotiated solution,” and the countermeasures “can be reversed at any time should such a solution be found.”

Canada responded with 25% new tariffs on US-made goods worth C$30 billion (€19 billion), effective at midnight EST (6 am CET) on Thursday. The levies will be matching the US tariffs “dollar for dollar”. 

In total, the countermeasures will impact C$12.6 billion (€8.05 billion) of steel products, C$3 billion (€1.9 billion) of aluminum, and C$14.2 billion (€9.1 billion) on other items. Canada is the biggest steel exporter to the US, followed by Mexico, Brazil, and China in 2024.

Other countries did not take immediate countermeasures against Trump's metal tariffs, but most expressed a willingness for dialogue. 

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain will “keep all options on the table” and is “negotiating an economic deal which covers and will include tariffs if we succeed.” 

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Trump's tariffs are “entirely unjustified” and that Australia will continue discussions for an exemption. China did not respond directly to the new tariffs but stated the US “owed a big thank you” as Beijing had successfully controlled the fentanyl trade.

US stock markets rebounded despite the recent escalation in the global trade war following cooler-than-expected inflation data released on Wednesday. 

The S&P 500 rose about 0.5% after falling to near-correction territory this year, led by major technology stocks. The US dollar weakened against most currencies in the G-10 group on expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates sooner due to economic concerns.

However, analysts warned that the market bounce could be short-lived due to ongoing uncertainties. Michael Brown, a senior research analyst at Pepperstone, wrote in a note that he would continue selling into the equity rally, expecting gold to reach a new high due to the risk-off sentiment.

Nonetheless, the European stock markets continued to outperform global peers, driven by expectations of easing fiscal rules for defence spending. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine had accepted a 30-day ceasefire deal with Russia, adding to the optimism regarding the bloc's outlook. The euro fell slightly against the US dollar but remained at a four-month high of just under 1.09.

Asian markets were mixed in the early trading on Thursday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi rising, while Australia's ASX 200 and China's Hang Seng Index continued to decline.

        The former Dutch premier and secretary general of the transatlantic alliance has flown to Washington DC for a crucial meeting with Donald Trump.
    

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will have to convince President Trump that US interests are best served as a leading member of the transatlantic alliance when he visits the White House today.

The US will be pushing NATO allies to focus on their obligation to defend themselves without relying on US support, according to a US source.

President Trump has long pushed for NATO countries to spend more on defence and has threatened to pull US support for members who don't pay at least 2% of their GDP on defence. 

""Rutte is very focused on keeping the US in NATO and I think he's really smart about this, you know he won't be combative while he's there,"" said the US official.

 “We've got to separate NATO from Ukraine because up to now we've been very involved, but NATO is bigger than Ukraine right now,” the official added, referring to the US ceasefire initiative.

President Trump is likely to underline this message heavily again today.  

""We'll be focusing on Article 3 of the NATO charter – 'allies must be able to defend themselves and contribute to the collective defence of the alliance',"" said the US official.

Meanwhile, Trump said the US would stay in NATO ""if they treat us fairly and they pay their bills"".

""I made a certain statement that I'm not going to be involved with NATO unless you pay your bills,” he said at the White House on Wednesday.

“I was asked the question, ‘if we don't pay are you going to help us?', I said no, if you don't pay you're delinquent,"" Trump said at the Oval Office St. Patrick's Day meeting with the Irish taoiseach.

“If you're not paying your bills I'm not gonna help,” he added.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is meeting US President Donald Trump amid ongoing negotiations for a potential truce in Ukraine.  

But US sources say the conversation today will pivot away from Ukraine towards the future of NATO, and the US demand for faster, more substantial defence burden sharing in Europe. 

“I don't think Rutte will get very deep into Ukraine – what does he get out of it, he's Secretary General of NATO which pre-exists Ukraine,"" the US official said.

Rutte is expected to concentrate on convincing Trump for the US to stay in NATO in the long term interests of the US, as America pivots towards security in the Indo Pacific. 

The former Dutch Premier is said to have formed close relations with Trump, with the two speaking frequently.

He consistently echoes the US refrain that Europe needs to spend more and take more responsibility for its own security. 

NATO allies are required to spend 2% of their GDP on defence, although eight countries including Spain, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg are not yet meeting this mark. 

 At the same time, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said allies need to dramatically increase their spending to 5% of GDP in the coming years.

""Rutte been way out ahead of everyone calling for NATO allies to spend 5% on defence,"" the US official said.

        The move comes in response to an EU tariff on US whiskey imports.
    

US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 200% tariff on wine, champagne, and other alcoholic drinks imported from the EU.

Trump noted that the threat would remain until the EU removed a 50% duty on US-made whiskey.

“If this tariff is not removed immediately, the US will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes and alcoholic products coming out of France and other EU represented countries,"" the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday.

""This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the US,” he added.

European alcohol firms saw their shares plummet in response to Trump's threat.

Pernod Ricard stock was down 3.2%, Rémy Cointreau shares fell 3.8%, while LVMH - which owns Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot - saw its share price fall 1.9%.

Thursday's development follows a long-awaited response from the EU just a day earlier, reacting to Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that the bloc would impose countermeasures on up to €26bn worth of US goods.

“We deeply regret this measure,” von der Leyen said in a statement.

“Tariffs are taxes, they are bad for business and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.

Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, reacted in a statement on Wednesday: ""The EU's announcement to reimpose these tariffs on American whiskey at 50% on 1 April is deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild US spirits exports in EU countries.""

Trade in spirits between the US and the EU was tax-free from 1997 to 2018, before Washington imposed a 25% tariff on some EU-made alcohol.

This was sparked by a spat involving Airbus, when subsidies given by the bloc to the European aircraft manufacturer were considered illegal by the World Trade Organisation.

In response to the US-imposed levies, Brussels then placed a 25% tariff on US goods, including orange juice, peanut butter and bourbon.

In 2021, the US and the EU then suspended tariffs related to the Airbus dispute for five years.

American whiskey exports to the EU plunged from $552m to $440m (€509.1m to €405.8m) in the period from 2018 to 2021, a drop of 20%, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.

The group added that exports then surged nearly 60% from 2021 to 2024, a response to the change in trade policy, coming to $699m (€644m).

US alcohol makers are also seeing sales threatened in other markets.

Last week, Canadian provinces started taking US-made beer, spirits, and wine off shelves in response to Trump's trade tactics — notably, 25% levies on Canadian goods.

Canada said it would impose a 25% tax on nearly C$30bn (€19.2bn) worth of US products — including wine, spirits and beer.

        US President Donald Trump said negotiators were on their way to Russia to present a ceasefire proposal backed by Ukraine.
    

US President Donald Trump claimed on Wednesday that Washington's negotiators were on their way ""right now"" for talks on a proposed ceasefire with Ukraine, after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day truce. 

Trump declined to give further details, but reports suggested special envoy Steve Witkoff was set to travel to Russia this week. 

Earlier, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared that the ball was in ""(Russia's) court,"" and that the only way to end the war was through negotiations. 

The US visit comes as Russian state television showed images of President Vladimir Putin making a surprise visit to Moscow's troops in the western Russian region of Kursk — where Ukrainian troops launched a surprise incursion last year. 

Russian state media claimed that Moscow's operation to remove Ukrainian forces from Kursk had entered its final stage, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. 

At the same time, Ukraine's army commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi suggested his troops were pulling back to minimise losses. 

""My priority has been and remains saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers,"" Syrskyi said, adding his troops would move to ""more favourable conditions"" if necessary. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Kyiv was doing ""as much as possible"" to protect its soldiers and that Russia was ""clearly trying to put maximum pressure on our troops.""

""The key factor is our partners' ability to ensure Russia's readiness not to deceive but to genuinely end the war. Because right now, Russian strikes have not stopped,"" Zelenskyy said on Wednesday evening about the ceasefire negotiations. 

Meanwhile, Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the US could do ""devastating"" things to Russia's economy should Moscow not agree to a 30-day ceasefire proposal backed by Ukraine and the US.  

""I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia, I don't want to do them, because I want to get peace,"" Trump said. 

Trump added he had received ""positive messages"" about the possibility of a ceasefire. 

""But a positive message means nothing,"" Trump said. ""This is a serious situation.""

For its part, the Kremlin has not publicly said whether it supports a ceasefire or not, with foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Russia was ready to talk to the US about a potential peace initiative ""as early as today.""

Russian state-run news agency Tass reported that Putin could speak on Ukraine, if asked, at a news conference on Thursday with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko. 

Moscow has previously refused the idea of a temporary ceasefire agreement, claiming it would give Ukrainian troops the opportunity to regroup. 

An immediate 30-day ceasefire is a core part of the joint Ukraine-US statement agreed on Tuesday, which calls for a temporary truce in the air, seas, and across the frontline. 

Elsewhere, the proposal calls for the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of children who have been forcibly transferred from Ukraine to Russia.

        Media outlets in Israel, quoting Syrian sources, said Israeli aircraft struck the building on the edge of the Syrian capital.
    

Israeli jets conducted an air strike in Damascus on Thursday in an anti-terrorist operation, Israel's defence minister said.

“Wherever terror activity against Israel is organised ... al-Jolani will find the Air Force aircraft flying above and striking terror targets,” Israel Katz said, referring to the interim president of Syria Ahmed al-Sharaa by his nom-de-guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.

Media outlets in Israel, quoting Syrian sources, said that the Israeli aircraft struck the building in the outskirts of the Syrian capital.

Katz did not say what was targeted in the strike, and there has been no immediate comment from the IDF about the operation. However, two Syrian security sources told Reuters that the target was a Palestinian national. 

Additionally, a military correspondent for Israeli army radio said the jets targeted the Islamic Jihad headquarters in Damascus.

        The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has revoked accreditation for a Russian diplomat and a diplomatic spouse in retaliation for expulsions announced in Moscow this week.
    

The UK has revoked accreditation for a Russian diplomat and a diplomatic spouse in a tit-for-tat response to the expulsion of two British embassy staff in Moscow this week.

The British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said on Wednesday that it was taking ""immediate reciprocal action"" after Russia accused two British diplomats of spying and gave them a fortnight to leave the country.

The UK has rejected the claims, which were levelled on Monday, as ""malicious"" and ""baseless"". 

Russia's ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, was summoned by the FCDO and informed of the latest expulsions. No timeframe was given for the pair's departure.

""During the past 12 months, Russia has pursued an increasingly aggressive and coordinated campaign of harassment against British diplomats,"" the FCDO said in a statement.

""It is clear that the Russian state is actively seeking to drive the British embassy in Moscow towards closure and has no regard for the dangerous escalatory impact of this.""

Expulsions of diplomats — both Western envoys working in Russia and Russians in the West — have become increasingly common since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

In the past year alone, Russia has expelled seven British diplomats from the country over accusations of spying, which the UK has denied.

Last May, the UK expelled Russia's defence attaché in London, claiming he was an undeclared intelligence officer, and shut down several Russian diplomatic premises, alleging they were being used for espionage. Moscow quickly retaliated by expelling the UK's defence attaché. 

And last month, London revoked the accreditation of another Russian diplomat, in retaliation to a similar move made by Moscow last November.

Ties have been strained between Moscow and London for years. 

Tensions escalated sharply in March 2018 when former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned in the English city of Salisbury with the Novichok nerve agent. British authorities said the incident was a targeted murder attempt coming from Moscow, a claim the Kremlin described as nonsense.

More recently, the UK has provoked Russia's ire through its military support for Kyiv and Prime Minister Keir Starmer's comments about the possibility of deploying British peacekeepers to Ukraine to enforce any peace deal.

        Mark Carney made the comments after Canada this week announced retaliatory tariffs worth 29.8 billion Canadian dollars (€19.1bn) on US imports.
    

Canada's incoming Prime Minister Mark Carney has said he is willing to hold trade talks with US President Donald Trump on the condition of ""respect for Canadian sovereignty"".

Carney — who will be sworn in on Friday with his new cabinet — spoke to reporters at a steel factory in Hamilton, Ontario, on Wednesday as Canada announced retaliatory tariffs worth 29.8 billion Canadian dollars (€19.1bn) on US imports.

That move came after the Trump administration levied 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports. Canada is the biggest foreign supplier of these metals to the US.  

The relationship between the neighbours and close allies has deteriorated dramatically since Trump took office in January. He has declared a trade war on Canada and called for the country to become the 51st US state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. 

""I am ready to sit down with President Trump at the appropriate time under a position where there is respect for Canadian sovereignty and we are working for a common approach, a much more comprehensive approach for trade,"" Carney said on Wednesday.

Carney said workers in both countries will be better off when ""the greatest economic and security partnership in the world is renewed, relaunched"".

""Today is a difficult day for Canada and the industry because of these unjustified tariffs that have been put on,"" he added.

Canada's reciprocal tariffs, which go into effect on Thursday, target steel and aluminium products, as well as goods including computers, sports equipment and water heaters. 

""We don't want to do this because we believe in open borders and free and fair trade, but we are doing this in response,"" Carney said.

Canada's new tariffs are in addition to its 25% counter tariffs on 30 billion Canadian dollars (€19.2bn) worth of imports from the US that were put in place on 4 March in response to other Trump tariffs that were partially delayed by a month. 

Trump has said that those separate 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada are in retaliation for cross-border fentanyl smuggling and high taxes on dairy imports that supposedly penalise US farmers.

Speaking on Wednesday, Carney said he respected Trump's concerns for American workers and about fentanyl.

Carney, who was elected leader of Canada's ruling Liberal Party on Sunday, will replace Justin Trudeau as the country's prime minister after nine years in power. In his victory speech, Carney said Canada would win the trade war against Trump.

        Several lightly injured and minor damage in Italian city of Naples after an earthquake shook buildings and disrupted power supplies.
    

At least eleven people were sent to the hospital after a 4.4-magnitude earthquake struck Naples overnight. One woman was injured after part of a ceiling fell. 

Italian seismologists said the earthquake struck at a depth of 2 kilometres from Pozzuoli at around 1:25 am CET. 

The quake was the strongest recorded around the volcanic area of the Phlegraean Fields. It matched the intensity of another quake that hit the same area last May. 

Naples sits just 9 kilometres from Mount Vesuvius, an active volcano, which encompasses the Phlegraean Fields.

In recent weeks, seismologists have reported increased activity in the area. Last summer, local authorities carried out drills in preparation for a potential major emergency. 

Damage was reported to buildings in Naples' Bagnoli district, where a ceiling collapsed and several cars were damaged from falling rubble. 

The district's Mayor Josi Gerardo Della Ragione wrote on Facebook that it had been a ""rough night"". ""But we won't give up a millimetre,"" he added.

The tremors also caused damage to the bell tower of a nearby church as residents slept in their cars.

The first tremor was followed by a swarm of six minor tremors with a magnitude of up to 1.2 on the Richter scale. 

On Thursday morning, Italy's primary train operator reported delays on several lines due to technical checks as power cuts were reported across Naples. 

A rescue coordination centre has been set up to assist people impacted by the quake. 

Schools in the Bagnoli district were also closed on Thursday to facilitate building stability checks. 

According to Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), the earthquake was triggered by the accelerating ground uplift in the area. 

""Recently, the rate of uplift has tripled, from 1 to 3 cm per month,"" said Francesca Bianco, director of INGV's volcanoes department.

        According to reports, the Chinese tech giant Huawei might have bribed former or current MEPs. Prosecutors have contacted the European Parliament.
    

Belgian police searched the Brussels headquarters of Chinese tech company Huawei and several other locations in a corruption probe amid fresh allegations involving European Parliament officials, with several arrests made in the case, according to authorities. 

The lobbyists of the Chinese tech giant are being investigated over allegations of bribing MEPs to influence EU decision-making that is said to have benefited Huawei.

Meanwhile, a judge has requested that the European Parliament offices of two assistants allegedly involved in the case be sealed.

""As required by procedure, the president of the European Parliament has been informed of the situation. This procedure is continuing,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement on Thursday afternoon.

The information on the probe was first revealed by investigative website Follow the Money, together with two other Belgian newspapers, Le Soir and Knack. 

Sources told the three outlets that around 15 current and former MEPs might be involved in the case.  

Police are said to have searched dozens of homes Thursday morning in Brussels, Belgium's regions of Flanders and Wallonia, and Portugal as a part of a covert operation. They sought evidence of possible involvement in criminal activities, including bribery, forgery, money laundering and criminal organisation. 

The authorities also confiscated documents and electronic devices, according to reports. Euronews has reached out to Huawei for comment.

The reports allege one of the main suspects in the case to be 41-year-old Huawei lobbyist Valerio Ottati. 

Meanwhile, the investigators contacted the European Parliament. The press service told Euronews that they have received a request for cooperation from the Belgian authorities to assist an investigation, without elaborating. The parliament will swiftly and fully honour this, the spokesperson added. 

For any proceeding against current MEPs, investigators must ask the president of the Parliament to waive their immunity. 

The new scandal might further hurt the reputation of the European institution, despite the European Parliament strengthening its ethics and transparency rules after a recent scandal which remains under investigation. 

MEPs involved, including Greece's Eva Kaili in 2022 were alleged to have accepted cash and other benefits in exchange for influencing the bloc's decisions.  

News of a fresh corruption scandal was greeted with condemnation in Brussels. Green party MEP Daniel Freund, who was a rapporteur for the EU body's ethics report during the previous mandate, said the scandal threatens the reputation of the European Parliament. 

He said in the wake of recent scandals ""important reforms have been overlooked. It must finally be understood that the risk of corruption in Brussels is high because the EU is so influential."" 

""We need a complete investigation quickly and finally reforms that will make the Parliament more resistant to corruption,” Freund said.

MEPs of the Left group also demanded an open debate on the matter. 

Co-chair for The Left, MEP Manon Aubry, from the French far-left La France Insoumise party, said the EU had ignored warnings in the past. 

""Despite repeated warnings from the Left that the EU Parliament is in danger of falling into yet another corruption scandal, almost nothing has been done to prevent it,"" she said.

""We urgently need to find out how deep this scandal goes and impose tough ethics and transparency rules, or lobbies will continue to slosh money around in the pockets of an increasingly corrupt institution,” Aubry added.

The European Commission refused to comment on the investigation. But its spokesperson Thomas Regnier underlined the EU's top executive body's security concerns about Huawei and Europe's 5G telecoms networks.

“The security of our 5G networks is obviously crucial for our economy,” Regnier told reporters on Thursday.

""Huawei represents materially higher risks than other 5G suppliers,” he said, adding that EU member states should swiftly ""adopt decisions to restrict or to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks.""

“A lack of swift action would expose the EU as a whole to a clear risk,” Regnier said.

Transparency International's Director and Head of Policy and Advocacy Nicholas Aiossa told Euronews that the Parliament had failed to undergo reforms it should have undertaken after recent scandals. 

""And here we are today,"" he remarked.

""Until there are rules in place that prevent gifts being received, travel being paid for, and lucrative side jobs being held by MEPs, there will always be this risk,"" he said.

        Trump gave Micheál Martin a warm welcome, then described the EU as an opponent of the US and accused Ireland of having the US pharmaceutical industry in its grip.
    

US president Donald Trump added Ireland to the list of countries he says are taking advantage of his own as he welcomed Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin to the White House. 

Trump has been sparring with US allies and adversaries alike over trade, slapping tariffs on imports from countries from Canada to China and beyond and creating major diplomatic rifts in the process.

During an appearance with Martin in front of reporters, Trump repeated his claim that the European Union was created to take advantage of the US. 

Asked if Ireland was also taking advantage, Trump replied, “of course they are"".

""I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn't have let it happen,"" he complained.  

Trump specifically referred to the concentration of US pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, a longstanding situation grounded in the country's notoriously lenient corporation tax laws.

“We had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn't have a clue, or let's say they weren't businesspeople, but they didn't have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies,"" Trump said.

Martin countered Trump's allegations by insisting that the two countries' trade relationship is “a two-way street”, adding that Ireland's two major airlines buy more aircraft from Boeing than any other foreign customer and that hundreds of Irish companies were based in America, creating thousands of jobs.

“That's a little-known fact that doesn't turn up in the statistics,” he added.   

“I understand where you're coming from, fully. But I think it's a relationship that we can develop and that will endure into the future.”

        The latest medical bulletins from the Vatican on the 88-year-old's condition have said he is improving and is no longer in immediate danger of death.
    

Pope Francis marked his 12th anniversary as pontiff on Thursday with positive medical updates nearly a month after he was hospitalised with double pneumonia. 

In the Vatican's latest medical bulletin on Tuesday, it said a chest X-ray had confirmed improvements just two days after doctors declared that the pope was no longer at imminent risk of death. However, the ""general picture remains complex"", the bulletin read.

The Holy See has not said how the anniversary of Pope Francis' election as the 266th pontiff might be commemorated. It is a public holiday at the Vatican and masses are planned in his honour at churches in Rome. No medical bulletins will be issued.

Pope Francis on Wednesday remotely followed a Lenten spiritual retreat that has been a mainstay of his papacy. He continues to receive high flows of oxygen through nasal tubes during the day and a non-invasive mechanical mask to aid his rest at night.

Leading papal and political figures in Italy have praised the pontiff this week to mark the anniversary. 

""I would like to address a thought of gratitude to the Holy Father for his tireless commitment to peace, dialogue and human dignity,"" Italian Senate speaker Ignazio La Russa wrote on Facebook.

""His magisterium is a point of reference for millions of people,"" he added.

Cardinal Michael Czerny, a senior Vatican official, said the pope's anniversary was a ""reason for gratitude"". 

""This year, his illness makes us especially aware (of the anniversary), especially grateful to God, and redoubling our prayers for his full recovery,"" he said.

Pope Francis has been carrying out some of his duties while in hospital, continuing with ecclesiastical appointments and delivering messages of gratitude to his well-wishers.

The former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected on the fifth ballot of the 2013 conclave, which was called after Pope Benedict XVI resigned.

While Pope Francis has praised his predecessor's humility in stepping down and said he might follow in his footsteps, more recently he has said the papacy is a job for life.

However, concerns remain over the pontiff's physical frailty, and there has been discussion about the prospect of his resignation even if his health improves further.

Resignation is ""a possibility, but it is totally entrusted to the conscience of the Pope,"" Archbishop Giuseppe Baturi, secretary general of the Italian Bishops' Conference (CEI), told Italian media.

The earthquake was the most powerful recorded in the Phlegraean Fields volcanic region and had the same intensity as a tremor that struck the area in May last year.

A powerful earthquake struck the Campi Flegrei area in Italy at 1:25 am local time, sending hundreds of residents into the streets. 

The 4.4 magnitude quake, the strongest in 40 years, had its epicenter 3 km deep near Via Napoli in Pozzuoli and was preceded by a loud roar.

The quake triggered a seismic swarm, with seven smaller tremors recorded by 9 am. 

Experts link the event to accelerating ground uplift caused by worsening bradyseism. ","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

Clashes erupted in Buenos Aires as protesters opposing President Milei's economic policies, including pension reforms, confronted police, who responded with tear gas and imposed restrictions on stadium access for those involved.

Pensioners and football fans clashed with police in front of Argentina's Congress on Wednesday during a protest against President Javier Milei's economic policies. 

What started as a peaceful demonstration turned violent as protesters threw stones at authorities, who responded with water cannons, tear gas, and pellets.

The protests, held weekly by pensioners in Buenos Aires, have escalated due to Milei's pension reforms, which retirees say fail to keep up with inflation. In response, the government imposed tighter restrictions on football stadium access for those involved in the unrest.","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

The Australian researchers and doctors behind the operation called the implant an “unmitigated clinical success” after the man lived with the device for more than 100 days before receiving a donor heart transplant in early March, according to The Guardian.BiVACOR has been implanted in five other patients in the US since the first surgery in July 2024, but none of these five were successfully discharged from the hospital with their implants.

The Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se), an international research and policy institute, has released a groundbreaking report examining Uzbekistan's educational curriculum, highlighting its attempts at promoting tolerance, interfaith respect, and cultural openness in the Central Asian nation.The report is the second installment in a three-part series analyzing curricula in Central Asian countries, produced in partnership with the Ruderman Family Foundation. The series, which began with Azerbaijan and will conclude with Kazakhstan, sheds light on otherwise relatively unknown educational trends in the region.The comprehensive analysis reviewed over 100 textbooks across multiple subjects, including Language, Ethics, Civics, History, and Religion. The report specifically examined how Jews, Judaism, the Holocaust, Israel, and the Arab-Israeli conflict are depicted in educational materials.  The report found that Uzbekistan's curriculum emphasizes the nation's identity as a secular, multi-ethnic republic where promoting cultural diversity and religious harmony is a cornerstone of education.The report highlights several positive aspects of Uzbekistan's educational approach. For instance, textbooks provide clear overviews of Judaism, covering key terms, historical origins, scriptures, and religious practices. Grade 11 students are explicitly taught that tolerance is not only a “spiritual duty, but also a political and legal need,” reinforcing the importance of interfaith respect.

Interfaith harmony is demonstrated through examples like the Mausoleum of Daniel in Samarkand. Uzbek textbooks also refer to the Holocaust. A grade 10 World History textbook accurately describes the Holocaust as the persecution and extermination of six million Jews, placing it within the broader context of World War II and Nazi war crimes.Strikingly, textbooks also stress the dangers of extremism, the distinction between faith and radicalism, and the role of education in preventing radical ideologies. They specifically identify organizations like Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah as “banned in Uzbekistan.”REGARDING ISRAEL, the socioeconomic development of the Jewish state is highlighted as a “developed country of transplanted capitalism.” The curriculum features Israel's engineering achievements and economic growth, including an image showcasing Israeli drip-irrigation technology adopted in Uzbekistani agriculture.

Additionally, while the Holocaust is addressed, the curriculum could benefit from a more comprehensive treatment of antisemitism and Jewish persecution throughout history. ‘Report shows Uzbekistan's commitment to coexistence'The IMPACT-se report concludes that Uzbekistan's educational materials reflect a genuine commitment to fostering harmonious coexistence among diverse communities while maintaining a distinctly Uzbek cultural identity. As the country continues to develop its educational system, these foundations of tolerance and mutual respect provide promising groundwork for future generations. “This study is a very encouraging insight into children's education in Uzbekistan. It demonstrates that the precious values of tolerance and respect are deeply ingrained in the Uzbekistani curriculum. Furthermore, Judaism, Jewish practices, and Jewish history are taught in depth and placed in the context of their social importance in Uzbekistan and beyond.This example of bridge-building through education bodes well for the future of a country with an important geopolitical role to play,” President of the Ruderman Family Foundation Jay Ruderman said.IMPACT-se CEO Marcus Sheff added: “Uzbekistan holds a strategically important place in Central Asia – it is positioned between the influences of various regional powers while also facing the challenge of radical Islamism.However, the country's textbooks demonstrate Uzbekistan's commitment to fostering an inclusive and multicultural society. They firmly reject extremism and promote respect between minorities and faiths, including extensive content on Judaism, Jewish history and traditions. With the region at a critical geopolitical crossroads, Uzbekistan's example of moderation and forward-thinking education is significant as a model for other countries in the region.”DR. ZEEV LEVIN, an expert on Central Asia from the Ben-Zvi Institute and the author of the current report, commented to The Jerusalem Post: “Uzbekistan boasts an education system that is separated from religion, meaning that there are no religious studies per se, but rather chapters within a framework of a “World Religions” theme, taught in a cultural approach.”Levin continued: “In this context, classes about Judaism are quite significant in terms of the material they teach, which is a pleasant surprise. The local communities of Bukhara and Samarkand are mentioned, and this is not at all obvious in the environment we are talking about, where knowledge and encounters with Jews and Judaism are usually scarce.”According to Levin, the curriculum also features quotes from the Constitution and the president regarding the importance of maintaining interreligious tolerance and resisting extremist frameworks, mainly Islamic ones.“The Holocaust is mentioned Iranian briefly, and the murder of six million Jews is also discussed,” Levin added. “Surely one can always call to expand on antisemitism and how it differs from ordinary xenophobia, and this is very relevant in light of the exposure of locals to media originating in Turkey and Iran, which is disturbing in and of itself.”As for the Middle East, Levin lauded the mentions of Israel as a country with developed agriculture and the highlighting of cooperation between the countries.“The textbooks do mention the conflict but in a shallow manner with mainly headlines, and this is true for mentions of other conflicts as well. Interestingly, the peace agreements and collaborations between Israel and Arab countries are not mentioned, so one may still believe that much of the conflict is still ongoing and that there are no further developments in this issue.”“Tel Aviv is defined as the capital of Israel, a Soviet legacy which has obviously never been true,” he continued. “Generally speaking, it was refreshing to see these mentions of Judaism, Jews, and Israel. The subject of religions was taboo during the Soviet era, and so was Israel, which was presented only from the Palestinian perspective, so this was a pleasant surprise.”
				



The report is the second installment in a three-part series analyzing curricula in Central Asian countries, produced in partnership with the Ruderman Family Foundation. The series, which began with Azerbaijan and will conclude with Kazakhstan, sheds light on otherwise relatively unknown educational trends in the region.The comprehensive analysis reviewed over 100 textbooks across multiple subjects, including Language, Ethics, Civics, History, and Religion. The report specifically examined how Jews, Judaism, the Holocaust, Israel, and the Arab-Israeli conflict are depicted in educational materials.  The report found that Uzbekistan's curriculum emphasizes the nation's identity as a secular, multi-ethnic republic where promoting cultural diversity and religious harmony is a cornerstone of education.The report highlights several positive aspects of Uzbekistan's educational approach. For instance, textbooks provide clear overviews of Judaism, covering key terms, historical origins, scriptures, and religious practices. Grade 11 students are explicitly taught that tolerance is not only a “spiritual duty, but also a political and legal need,” reinforcing the importance of interfaith respect.

Furthermore, Judaism, Jewish practices, and Jewish history are taught in depth and placed in the context of their social importance in Uzbekistan and beyond.This example of bridge-building through education bodes well for the future of a country with an important geopolitical role to play,” President of the Ruderman Family Foundation Jay Ruderman said.IMPACT-se CEO Marcus Sheff added: “Uzbekistan holds a strategically important place in Central Asia – it is positioned between the influences of various regional powers while also facing the challenge of radical Islamism.However, the country's textbooks demonstrate Uzbekistan's commitment to fostering an inclusive and multicultural society. They firmly reject extremism and promote respect between minorities and faiths, including extensive content on Judaism, Jewish history and traditions. With the region at a critical geopolitical crossroads, Uzbekistan's example of moderation and forward-thinking education is significant as a model for other countries in the region.”DR. ZEEV LEVIN, an expert on Central Asia from the Ben-Zvi Institute and the author of the current report, commented to The Jerusalem Post: “Uzbekistan boasts an education system that is separated from religion, meaning that there are no religious studies per se, but rather chapters within a framework of a “World Religions” theme, taught in a cultural approach.”Levin continued: “In this context, classes about Judaism are quite significant in terms of the material they teach, which is a pleasant surprise. The local communities of Bukhara and Samarkand are mentioned, and this is not at all obvious in the environment we are talking about, where knowledge and encounters with Jews and Judaism are usually scarce.”According to Levin, the curriculum also features quotes from the Constitution and the president regarding the importance of maintaining interreligious tolerance and resisting extremist frameworks, mainly Islamic ones.“The Holocaust is mentioned Iranian briefly, and the murder of six million Jews is also discussed,” Levin added. “Surely one can always call to expand on antisemitism and how it differs from ordinary xenophobia, and this is very relevant in light of the exposure of locals to media originating in Turkey and Iran, which is disturbing in and of itself.”As for the Middle East, Levin lauded the mentions of Israel as a country with developed agriculture and the highlighting of cooperation between the countries.“The textbooks do mention the conflict but in a shallow manner with mainly headlines, and this is true for mentions of other conflicts as well. Interestingly, the peace agreements and collaborations between Israel and Arab countries are not mentioned, so one may still believe that much of the conflict is still ongoing and that there are no further developments in this issue.”“Tel Aviv is defined as the capital of Israel, a Soviet legacy which has obviously never been true,” he continued. “Generally speaking, it was refreshing to see these mentions of Judaism, Jews, and Israel. The subject of religions was taboo during the Soviet era, and so was Israel, which was presented only from the Palestinian perspective, so this was a pleasant surprise.”
				



Uzbek textbooks also refer to the Holocaust. A grade 10 World History textbook accurately describes the Holocaust as the persecution and extermination of six million Jews, placing it within the broader context of World War II and Nazi war crimes.Strikingly, textbooks also stress the dangers of extremism, the distinction between faith and radicalism, and the role of education in preventing radical ideologies. They specifically identify organizations like Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah as “banned in Uzbekistan.”REGARDING ISRAEL, the socioeconomic development of the Jewish state is highlighted as a “developed country of transplanted capitalism.” The curriculum features Israel's engineering achievements and economic growth, including an image showcasing Israeli drip-irrigation technology adopted in Uzbekistani agriculture.

According to the report, this approach reflects Uzbekistan's diplomatic stance and commitment to peaceful relations with Arab countries and Israel.The report also identified areas for improvement. These include some historical inaccuracies, such as using “Palestine” instead of “Canaan” or “Land of Israel” when referencing the historic Jewish homeland and recognizing Tel Aviv rather than Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Additionally, while the Holocaust is addressed, the curriculum could benefit from a more comprehensive treatment of antisemitism and Jewish persecution throughout history. ‘Report shows Uzbekistan's commitment to coexistence'The IMPACT-se report concludes that Uzbekistan's educational materials reflect a genuine commitment to fostering harmonious coexistence among diverse communities while maintaining a distinctly Uzbek cultural identity.

The subject of religions was taboo during the Soviet era, and so was Israel, which was presented only from the Palestinian perspective, so this was a pleasant surprise.”
				



Levin continued: “In this context, classes about Judaism are quite significant in terms of the material they teach, which is a pleasant surprise. The local communities of Bukhara and Samarkand are mentioned, and this is not at all obvious in the environment we are talking about, where knowledge and encounters with Jews and Judaism are usually scarce.”According to Levin, the curriculum also features quotes from the Constitution and the president regarding the importance of maintaining interreligious tolerance and resisting extremist frameworks, mainly Islamic ones.“The Holocaust is mentioned Iranian briefly, and the murder of six million Jews is also discussed,” Levin added. “Surely one can always call to expand on antisemitism and how it differs from ordinary xenophobia, and this is very relevant in light of the exposure of locals to media originating in Turkey and Iran, which is disturbing in and of itself.”As for the Middle East, Levin lauded the mentions of Israel as a country with developed agriculture and the highlighting of cooperation between the countries.“The textbooks do mention the conflict but in a shallow manner with mainly headlines, and this is true for mentions of other conflicts as well.

Last week, Gallup released its annual World Affairs poll showing that sympathy for Israel over the Palestinians is at its lowest level in 25 years. On Thursday, a UN body released a scandalous “report” accusing Israel of “genocidal acts” by destroying women's healthcare facilities in Gaza and using sexual violence as a war strategy.The two are not unrelated.  The steady drip-drop of these completely biased reports from UN bodies such as this one—the Human Rights Council's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Israel—has a cumulative effect on public opinion.Barely a month goes by without some UN agency or a human rights group like Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch issuing a damning report accusing Israel of the most heinous crimes.

Palestinians pass by the rubble of destroyed houses, in Gaza City, March 11, 2025. (credit: REUTERS/DAWOUD ABU ALKAS)In Europe, Asia, Africa, and also in the US, if a report—regardless of how libelous it may be or how insignificant the organization— is stamped with the UN's seal or that of a well-known human rights organization, it carries a veneer of legitimacy. Abroad, these reports are not automatically dismissed—as they are here.  On the contrary, they generate headlines. “UN experts accuse Israel of genocidal acts and sexual violence in Gaza,” was Reuters' headline on Thursday.  AP's read:  “UN report accuses Israel of sexual violence against Palestinians.”Shaping negative perceptions Most people will never read the story.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  There are numerous reasons why Israel's image in the US is on the decline, and the cumulative impact of these reports is one of them. Only 54% of Americans have a favorable view of Israel, according to this Gallup poll. With a steady diet of reports like these, it is not hard to understand why.  AdvertisementJustifiably, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Foreign Ministry sent out blistering responses to the UN report.""The anti-Israel circus known as the UN 'Human Rights Council' has long been revealed as an antisemitic, rotten, and irrelevant organization that supports terrorism. For good reason, Israel decided to quit it approximately one month ago,"" Netanyahu said. “This is not a human rights council; it is a blood rights council.""And Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein, posting on X, called this “one of the worst cases of blood libel the world has ever seen (and the world has seen many) … It is indeed a sick document that only an antisemitic organization such as the UN could produce.”  These types of reactions, including similar responses by Opposition members such as National Unity Party spokesman Benny Gantz, are completely justified. The question is, how effective are they?They often seem targeted more at the Israeli audience— already convinced of the UN's bias —than at a foreign one. For instance, while Israelis and many Jews are familiar with the term blood libel, how many people in, say, Idaho know that this refers to the medieval accusation that Jews used the blood of Christian children to bake matzah? This is a classic case of Israelis speaking Israeli to the world, which is on a different bandwidth.But place that aside for a minute. Even if a PR genius crafted the perfect response, that wouldn't be enough. The response might make it into the news story, but it won't be in the headline, and the headline is what people see. Headlines shape impressions. Israel needs a different strategic approach.  Instead of just reacting to these reports, it must go on the offensive—creating its own headlines, setting the agenda, and countering falsehoods systematically.For instance, it should take legal action and file formal complaints against UN bodies and NGOs issuing provably false reports. In countries with strong libel laws, it should pursue defamation lawsuits against NGOs and individuals spreading falsehoods.It should consider establishing a rapid-response media team to fact-check and counter false claims with verified evidence. Instead of merely issuing denials, it should use the tactics of investigative journalism to expose the political agendas, conflicts of interest, biased funding sources, and backgrounds of those behind these reports.Israel needs to go on the offensive against these types of attacks. It needs to launch proactive initiatives to put the accusers on the defensive. It cannot afford to simply issue reflexive responses - especially when these denials often seem aimed more at the domestic audience or serve narrow political needs rather than shifting international perceptions.Israel knows how to counterattack libelous reports, like it did with the Goldstone Report that accused it of war crimes following Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009. It devoted time, energy, and resources to rebutting that report and had some success --  South African jurist Richard Goldstone later partially retracting some of its conclusions.It is too easy to shrug off these reports—or the predictable anti-Israel diatribes by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International—as mere rubbish. That might be true, but they are not inconsequential.  Israelis may dismiss these organizations, but the rest of the world does not. Their reports shape perceptions, and perceptions matter.More must be done to combat them. More resources and energy need to be devoted to this, because a lie in a UN or human rights organization report circulated widely —and not exposed and taken apart piece by piece -- gains traction.If you doubt that, just look at the latest Gallup World Affairs survey.

In countries with strong libel laws, it should pursue defamation lawsuits against NGOs and individuals spreading falsehoods.It should consider establishing a rapid-response media team to fact-check and counter false claims with verified evidence. Instead of merely issuing denials, it should use the tactics of investigative journalism to expose the political agendas, conflicts of interest, biased funding sources, and backgrounds of those behind these reports.Israel needs to go on the offensive against these types of attacks. It needs to launch proactive initiatives to put the accusers on the defensive. It cannot afford to simply issue reflexive responses - especially when these denials often seem aimed more at the domestic audience or serve narrow political needs rather than shifting international perceptions.Israel knows how to counterattack libelous reports, like it did with the Goldstone Report that accused it of war crimes following Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009. It devoted time, energy, and resources to rebutting that report and had some success --  South African jurist Richard Goldstone later partially retracting some of its conclusions.It is too easy to shrug off these reports—or the predictable anti-Israel diatribes by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International—as mere rubbish. That might be true, but they are not inconsequential.  Israelis may dismiss these organizations, but the rest of the world does not. Their reports shape perceptions, and perceptions matter.More must be done to combat them. More resources and energy need to be devoted to this, because a lie in a UN or human rights organization report circulated widely —and not exposed and taken apart piece by piece -- gains traction.If you doubt that, just look at the latest Gallup World Affairs survey.

The entire nation rejoiced when Doron Katz-Asher, along with her daughters Raz and Aviv, were freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza. After some recovery time, the freed hostage became pregnant with her third child with her husband, Yoni, giving birth this week.Katz-Asher, who was taken hostage on October 7, 2023, while visiting family in Kibbutz Nir Oz, announced her pregnancy in October that she was expecting. This joyous revelation came less than a year after her release, following 49 days of captivity under Hamas. Her daughters, Raz (4) and Aviv (2), were also held with her. Tragically, Doron's mother, Efrat Katz, was killed during the attacks, and several other family members remain missing.  In an emotional Instagram post, Doron shared, “Bringing life into the world, a year after I almost lost my own, is the greatest gift we could ask for in the new year. My ray of light in the darkness.” The news has resonated deeply with many, symbolizing a remarkable journey of survival and resilience after such a traumatic ordeal.However, since then, the freed hostage has separated from her husband, the couple announced in recent months. Prior to the war, she wanted to have another child, though her husband was not on the same page, she told Ynet in an interview in May. AdvertisementIn the same interview, she talked about how after her release, she had doubts about whether or not to conceive again. ""When I returned from there, I doubted whether I wanted another child. Do I want to bring a child into a world like this or into a family with post-traumatic stress? After all, we've all been through an unimaginable experience here. Am I even capable of it?” she said.  “Is it good for the family? My desire reared its head again a few months after I returned from captivity. I didn't expect it to come so relatively quickly. This is the pregnancy that came after a period of poor nutrition in captivity, drastic weight loss, stress, and grief. I'll be honest and say that I didn't even get my period for months,” responding to the interviewer's question on if she saw the pregnancy after extreme conditions a miracle.“Everything together wasn't in my favor. I was surprised, and it only made me feel like it was the right thing that had to happen. The pregnancy is one of the miracles that happened to me in the last year, alongside the difficult things.""

Do I want to bring a child into a world like this or into a family with post-traumatic stress? After all, we've all been through an unimaginable experience here. Am I even capable of it?” she said.  “Is it good for the family? My desire reared its head again a few months after I returned from captivity. I didn't expect it to come so relatively quickly. This is the pregnancy that came after a period of poor nutrition in captivity, drastic weight loss, stress, and grief. I'll be honest and say that I didn't even get my period for months,” responding to the interviewer's question on if she saw the pregnancy after extreme conditions a miracle.“Everything together wasn't in my favor. I was surprised, and it only made me feel like it was the right thing that had to happen. The pregnancy is one of the miracles that happened to me in the last year, alongside the difficult things."" Overcoming trauma with miraclesNo matter what was to come, she was confident that it would bring good to her family after a period of extreme distress and change.View this post on InstagramA post shared by Lea Schenirer | לאה שנירר (@leaschenirer)   Stay updated with the latest news!

Polish President Andrzej Duda called on the United States to transfer nuclear weapons to Polish territory in an interview with the Financial Times on Thursday.Moving the weapons would serve as a deterrent against potential Russian aggression but is likely to be perceived as “highly provocative” in Moscow.  “The borders of Nato moved east in 1999, so 26 years later, there should also be a shift of the Nato infrastructure east. For me, this is obvious,” Duda explained in the interview, adding that he recently discussed the matter with Keith Kellogg, US special envoy for Ukraine. “I think it's not only that the time has come, but that it would be safer if those weapons were already here.” AdvertisementDuda added that he hopes to revive a nuclear sharing project he unsuccessfully presented to the Biden administration in 2022. Russian President Putin meets with members of the Delovaya Rossiya All-Russian Public Organization in Moscow (credit: VIA REUTERS)While Poland previously hosted Soviet nuclear warheads during the Cold War, the US moving a nuclear weapon cache that close to Russia's borders would be viewed as a serious threat by the Kremlin. However, Duda noted that the decision of where to deploy US nuclear weapons belonged to US President Donald Trump alone and addressed Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement in 2023 that Russia would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, Moscow's ally, in its invasion of Ukraine.“Russia did not even hesitate when they were relocating their nuclear weapons into Belarus,” Duda said. “They didn't ask anyone's permission.”   Stay updated with the latest news!

AdvertisementDuda, who is also the supreme commander of Poland's armed forces, added that there was an alternative option for better protection from President Emmanuel Macron's idea to extend France's “nuclear umbrella” to cover European allies. However, he drew the line at Prime Minister Donald Tusk's suggestion that Poland develop its own nuclear arsenal.“In order to have our own nuclear capability, I think it would take decades,” he said.  He added that even without a nuclear deterrent, he did not foresee Trump turning back on his commitment to maintain US troops in Poland.“Concerns regarding the US taking back their military presence from Poland are not justified. We are a credible ally for the US, and they also have their own strategic interests here,” he said.Duda further stated that he did not believe Trump was conducting “pro-Moscow negotiations.”“This is not delicate diplomacy, this is a tough game, but in my opinion it's not that President Trump is being only nice and gentle with Russia,” Duda said. “I think he's applying instruments against Russia, even though it's maybe not as loud and visible as those he's using against Ukraine.”“Nobody has managed so far to stop this war, so let's give President Trump a chance.”

The Jerusalem Post's article ""Sun Yat-sen at 100: The revolutionary who shaped modern China,"" by Alex Winston, offers a timely reflection on the enduring friendship between Taiwan and Israel, grounded on our shared values and aspirations for democracy, freedom, and prosperity. This piece not only honors the legacy of the founding father of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in backing Zionism, the ""greatest movement of the present time,"" as Dr. Sun Yat-sen praised in this letter addressed to N.E.B. Ezra in 1920, but also provides a lens through which to appreciate the vibrant democracy that flourishes today in Taiwan.In 1996, Taiwan first held direct presidential elections to build a full democracy to ensure the people of Taiwan are masters of their country and only the people of Taiwan can decide their future. Since then, Taiwan has grown to become one of the world's most vibrant democracies.  Taiwan was the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage; Taiwan showed that democracy outperforms authoritarianism in fighting the COVID pandemic, and despite all the challenges, it continues to enhance mutually beneficial partnerships with allies and like-minded countries through value-guided realism diplomacy. Taiwan has been facing existential threats, but we never provoke nor bow to pressure. Taiwan may be small, but the diligence, innovation, and resilience of the Taiwanese people enable us to punch over our weight as a force for good in the world. THE TAIWAN delegation in the annual parade during Sukkot in Jerusalem 2023. (credit: NATI SHOHAT/FLASH90)The Taiwanese government is also clear-eyed and doesn't take peace for granted. While every country in the world is pursuing its own course of greatness, Taiwan is also seeking to be strong and great. Does it sound familiar to you?Blueprint for success and leadershipYes, this is the same fighting-against-all-odds journey for our brave friends in Israel. Our story is not just a tale of survival but a blueprint for success and leadership for the trustworthy democratic alliance amid the increasingly complex and interconnected world.  While we reflect on Dr. Sun Yat-san's revolutionary spirit and his historical bond with revered Zionism pioneers, we are pleased to see the enduring friendship between our two peace-loving peoples put down roots and nourished in Taiwan. Taiwan remains a safe haven for Jews around the world and a reliable partner in these trying times. As we look forward to our future, we must realize that cooperation and partnership are the keys to meeting numerous challenges posed by authoritarian regimes. We should work together, and we will thrive together, and we are stronger together. The writer is Yaping (Abby) Lee, the Representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Tel Aviv.

French prosecutors have placed a finance ministry employee under formal investigation on suspicion of spying for Algeria, the Paris prosecutor's office said on Thursday, at a time of mounting political tensions between France and its former colony.The employee is accused of handing details on Algerian asylum seekers, including known opponents of the incumbent Algerian administration, to an Algerian contact working at the Algerian consulate in the Paris suburb of Creteil.The employee was placed under formal investigation in December. In France, being put under formal investigation means there is serious or consistent evidence that points to likely involvement of a suspect in a crime. It does not imply guilt, and it does not necessarily lead to a trial.  The Creteil consulate didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The French finance ministry declined to comment. The Algerian Embassy in Paris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The same probe also led to the placing under formal investigation of a social worker at the French Office for Immigration and Integration. The woman is accused of sharing asylum seekers' confidential details and breaching rules around professional secrecy.The immigration office said it could not comment on an ongoing investigation. French-Algiers relationsTies between Paris and Algiers have deteriorated in recent months after French President Emmanuel Macron recognized Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara. That decision angered Algiers.As the diplomatic feuding has escalated, France last month threatened to review a decades-old agreement that makes it easier for Algerian citizens to move to France unless Algeria agrees to take back those the French authorities wish to deport.

Reports on Thursday alleged that Adam Boehler, Trump's envoy for American hostages and missing persons, has been removed from involvement in the negotiations for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.But the question is: Was he even involved in them to begin with?  Let's start with the negotiations for the hostages' release that are taking place in Cairo, Egypt. These talks are led by one person alone: Steve Witkoff, Trump's envoy to the Middle East.Witkoff, in turn, communicates with Israeli Minister Ron Dermer, who is in charge of the negotiations on the Israeli side, as well as with senior Qatari and Egyptian officials. In fact, apart from Witkoff, no other senior figure is involved in the negotiations for the release of the hostages.

With this in mind, and at least for now, that no direct talks will be held with Hamas, Boehler is returning to his original role: working to secure the release of Americans around the world, but currently, he is not involved in the negotiations for the release of hostages held by Hamas.

These talks are led by one person alone: Steve Witkoff, Trump's envoy to the Middle East.Witkoff, in turn, communicates with Israeli Minister Ron Dermer, who is in charge of the negotiations on the Israeli side, as well as with senior Qatari and Egyptian officials. In fact, apart from Witkoff, no other senior figure is involved in the negotiations for the release of the hostages.

The original Snow White film features the classic song, “Heigh Ho,” but Disney executives may be worried that the trouble-plagued live-action Snow White film starring Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, which is set to premiere next week, will have audiences saying, “Ho hum.”The new film, which stars Zegler as the title character and Gadot as the Evil Queen, has been dogged by various controversies and rumors since it began filming. Variety just reported that the premiere set for Saturday at the El Capitan Theater in Los Angeles will be scaled down from the usual glitz accompanying new Hollywood films.  The red carpet will not include the scores of reporters and photographers usually on hand to interview the stars, and there will be only a small group of journalists hand-picked by the studio.The New York Post speculated that this decision was made “to avoid tough questions about the backlash that's followed Snow White around like an eighth dwarf.” AdvertisementDisney did not comment on the article, but it's likely that Gadot's presence is part of what is worrying the studio. Gadot, the Israeli star of the Wonder Woman films, has been an unwavering and vocal supporter of her home country and was recently honored by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) at its annual summit.Gal Gadot receives the International Leadership award from ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt at ADL Never Is Now at Javits Center on March 04, 2025 in New York City.  (credit: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Anti-Defamation League)She said in her speech at the ADL event, “Never did I imagine that on the streets of the United States, and different cities around the world, we would see people not condemning Hamas, but celebrating, justifying and cheering on a massacre of Jews.” Support for IsraelAmong Gadot's activities in support of Israel was helping to organize a screening of the footage of Hamas atrocities for Hollywood A-listers.While her stance has won her respect and admiration among Jews and Israelis, others have not been as approving.

It was disgusting.”But Gadot did present the award for Best Visual Effects alongside Zegler, and everything went smoothly. There were rumors that Zegler, who has posted support for pro-Palestinian causes, was less than thrilled to be doing publicity with Gadot, but there was no visible discord at the Oscars or in their previous joint public appearances.There could be another reason that Zegler might not want to stand alongside Gadot: When trailers were released from the movie last year, the Internet blew up with responses from viewers who felt that Gadot was the fairest of them all.  One fan, @onyx_0807, spoke for many when she commented on the trailer on YouTube, “When the mirror said, ‘Snow White is more beautiful,' I think people at cinema[s] will say, ‘The mirror is broken.'”Some have seen anti-Latina racism in this preference for Gadot, since Zegler is of Colombian-Polish descent, and became famous playing Maria in the Steven Spielberg remake of West Side Story.The NYP suggested that a major part of the reason that Disney has chosen a scaled-down premiere is not Zegler's ethnicity but her tendency to express woke sentiments. In 2022, she told Variety, speaking about the original 1937 film, “There's a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird. So we didn't do that this time. I was scared of the original version. I think I watched it once and never picked it up again.”Zegler also said last year, at D23, the annual Disney expo, that Snow White “is not going to be saved by the prince. She's not going to be dreaming about true love. She's dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be.”How much the movie has been changed from the original is not known, but it seems that if Zegler had any input, the movie is no longer a romantic fairy tale but a leadership seminar.The NYP reported that David Hale Hand, the son of the late supervising director for the original movie, said, “The original was the way it should be. From what I've read, [the new film] bears no reflection to the original story. It's so far off base that it's ridiculous.” He went so far as to assert that the new film would make his father and Walt Disney “roll in their graves.”Another brouhaha has involved the seven vertically challenged people who Snow White befriends in the forest. In the new movie, they are played by CGI dwarfs, which director Marc Webb has said was always his plan, which led to cries that he had deprived little people of acting work.After Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage criticized the inclusion of such characters at all, Variety reported that Disney released a statement saying, “To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community.”In any case, Gadot has been making the late-night talk show rounds in the US. She recently opened up to Jimmy Fallon about her emergency surgery for blood clots when she was pregnant with her fourth daughter, telling him, “All of a sudden, I realized what it means to be scared to death.”Whatever happens with Snow White, it seems that Gadot, who survived the health crisis and has spoken out about how women need to take care of themselves, can handle it. But it will be interesting to see how much Disney's attempt to please everyone will succeed – or fall flat.

In the new movie, they are played by CGI dwarfs, which director Marc Webb has said was always his plan, which led to cries that he had deprived little people of acting work.After Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage criticized the inclusion of such characters at all, Variety reported that Disney released a statement saying, “To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community.”In any case, Gadot has been making the late-night talk show rounds in the US. She recently opened up to Jimmy Fallon about her emergency surgery for blood clots when she was pregnant with her fourth daughter, telling him, “All of a sudden, I realized what it means to be scared to death.”Whatever happens with Snow White, it seems that Gadot, who survived the health crisis and has spoken out about how women need to take care of themselves, can handle it. But it will be interesting to see how much Disney's attempt to please everyone will succeed – or fall flat. 
            



Some have seen anti-Latina racism in this preference for Gadot, since Zegler is of Colombian-Polish descent, and became famous playing Maria in the Steven Spielberg remake of West Side Story.The NYP suggested that a major part of the reason that Disney has chosen a scaled-down premiere is not Zegler's ethnicity but her tendency to express woke sentiments. In 2022, she told Variety, speaking about the original 1937 film, “There's a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird. So we didn't do that this time. I was scared of the original version. I think I watched it once and never picked it up again.”Zegler also said last year, at D23, the annual Disney expo, that Snow White “is not going to be saved by the prince. She's not going to be dreaming about true love. She's dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be.”How much the movie has been changed from the original is not known, but it seems that if Zegler had any input, the movie is no longer a romantic fairy tale but a leadership seminar.The NYP reported that David Hale Hand, the son of the late supervising director for the original movie, said, “The original was the way it should be.

We do not yet know how history will tell this story. We do not know what they will write about these days—about what we have lived, about what we have lost.We only know this: we are inside it now.  We are touching history—not as something distant, something remembered, but as something unfolding beneath our feet.It was a Friday afternoon, grey and rain soaked. I was 32 years old, standing for the first time in the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., alongside my wife, Vered. AdvertisementAt the entrance, they handed me a passport—a small, unassuming booklet. Inside was the name of a young man, Yitzchak, who had lived through those unimaginable years. His story became my guide. In that instant, the museum ceased being a museum. It became a mirror.The journey began in an elevator shaped like a cattle car. The doors closed, and the darkness pressed in—not an absence of light, but an absence of self. When the doors opened, the world unravelled in fragments. Faces in photographs. Shoes in piles. A violin, cracked and worn. Traces of lives erased.  Jews awaiting deportation at the Umschlagplatz in the Warsaw Ghetto. (credit: PUBLIC DOMAIN)I am the child of refugees. My father fled Germany. My mother escaped Poland. My grandfather—my mother's father—lost his entire family. A family tree reduced to a fragile branch: my grandfather, his wife, their children. And me.I walked through the museum, but the weight of it was unbearable. These weren't stories. These were ghosts. These were my ancestors.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Then I reached the gate of the Warsaw Ghetto. Iron bars before me—cold, unyielding, final. Behind these gates, my people had been crammed into a living tomb. Hunger and humiliation consumed them, yet they fought to remain human. They prayed. They taught their children. They resisted. AdvertisementAnd I read the story of Mordechai Anielewicz, the leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. He was 32—my age then.And something inside me broke.I cried—not just for him, not just for the ghetto, but for myself. Because I stood outside that gate, free to cry, free to remember, free to walk away.  And with that freedom came a question that has never left me:What does it mean to live in a time when history touches you?Now We Are Touching HistoryThat was thirty years ago.Back then, history felt contained—something to step into and out of, something held within books and museums. It was heavy, but it was settled.Perhaps that is how most of us lived for so long. We carried history, but we did not touch it. It pressed upon us in memory but not in urgency. It shaped who we were, but it did not ask us to shape it in return.Until now.Until this moment.Now, we are touching history.Not watching. Not remembering. Touching.There are times when history moves quietly - passing through ordinary days, unremarked, unnoticed.And then there are times like this.Times when history is no longer something that will be written later, but something that is being shaped now. Times when history is not just something lived through but something grasped, something forged, something held with trembling hands.This is one of those times.Now, history moves through us. Presses against us. It does not ask if we are ready—only whether we will rise to meet it.It does not feel like the past, settled and known. It does not feel like the history we studied in books, its meaning already understood. It feels unsteady, uncertain, undetermined—because we are the ones who must give it meaning.It feels like standing at a threshold, knowing the world before is gone, but the world ahead is still unknown.It feels like being both participant and witness—inside it, yet also outside, knowing that one day others will look back and ask:What was it like? What did you do?It feels vast. Irreversible. Something we cannot yet fully see—but we know we are inside it.And that knowledge is heavy.Because history, when you touch it, does not allow you to remain passive.It demands.It demands something of us now, in this moment.Purim—A Story of Touching HistoryAnd tonight is Purim.A day that reminds us that history does not simply unfold—it demands something from those who live it.Once before, another Mordechai stood before history.He did not choose his moment. But it came for him.“If you remain silent at this time, relief and salvation will arise from elsewhere. But who knows if it was for this very moment that you became queen?”He could have bowed. He could have stayed silent.Instead, he stood.Esther could have remained hidden. She could have waited for history to pass over her.Instead, she stepped forward.She touched history. She shaped it.This evening we will go to the synagogue. We will hear the names—Mordechai, Esther, Haman—and we will remember that this is not just a story of then.It is the story of now.Because history is not distant. It is not settled. It is not something we inherit—it is something we shape.And now, once again, it is pressing upon us.Those who came before us stood in moments like this. Some resisted. Some fought. Some remained silent. And some chose to step forward.Now it is our turn.One day, our children will ask what we did in this moment.They will ask what it was like, how we stood, how we chose, how we bore the weight of history pressing into our hands. They will ask if we were worthy of the legacy we inherited.And what will we tell them?Because history does not write itself.We write it.And now, we are touching it again.

What did you do?It feels vast. Irreversible. Something we cannot yet fully see—but we know we are inside it.And that knowledge is heavy.Because history, when you touch it, does not allow you to remain passive.It demands.It demands something of us now, in this moment.Purim—A Story of Touching HistoryAnd tonight is Purim.A day that reminds us that history does not simply unfold—it demands something from those who live it.Once before, another Mordechai stood before history.He did not choose his moment. But it came for him.“If you remain silent at this time, relief and salvation will arise from elsewhere. But who knows if it was for this very moment that you became queen?”He could have bowed. He could have stayed silent.Instead, he stood.Esther could have remained hidden. She could have waited for history to pass over her.Instead, she stepped forward.She touched history. She shaped it.This evening we will go to the synagogue. We will hear the names—Mordechai, Esther, Haman—and we will remember that this is not just a story of then.It is the story of now.Because history is not distant. It is not settled. It is not something we inherit—it is something we shape.And now, once again, it is pressing upon us.Those who came before us stood in moments like this. Some resisted. Some fought. Some remained silent. And some chose to step forward.Now it is our turn.One day, our children will ask what we did in this moment.They will ask what it was like, how we stood, how we chose, how we bore the weight of history pressing into our hands. They will ask if we were worthy of the legacy we inherited.And what will we tell them?Because history does not write itself.We write it.And now, we are touching it again.
            



At the entrance, they handed me a passport—a small, unassuming booklet. Inside was the name of a young man, Yitzchak, who had lived through those unimaginable years. His story became my guide. In that instant, the museum ceased being a museum. It became a mirror.The journey began in an elevator shaped like a cattle car. The doors closed, and the darkness pressed in—not an absence of light, but an absence of self. When the doors opened, the world unravelled in fragments. Faces in photographs. Shoes in piles. A violin, cracked and worn. Traces of lives erased.  Jews awaiting deportation at the Umschlagplatz in the Warsaw Ghetto. (credit: PUBLIC DOMAIN)I am the child of refugees. My father fled Germany.

He could have stayed silent.Instead, he stood.Esther could have remained hidden. She could have waited for history to pass over her.Instead, she stepped forward.She touched history. She shaped it.This evening we will go to the synagogue. We will hear the names—Mordechai, Esther, Haman—and we will remember that this is not just a story of then.It is the story of now.Because history is not distant. It is not settled. It is not something we inherit—it is something we shape.And now, once again, it is pressing upon us.Those who came before us stood in moments like this. Some resisted. Some fought. Some remained silent. And some chose to step forward.Now it is our turn.One day, our children will ask what we did in this moment.They will ask what it was like, how we stood, how we chose, how we bore the weight of history pressing into our hands. They will ask if we were worthy of the legacy we inherited.And what will we tell them?Because history does not write itself.We write it.And now, we are touching it again.
            



And with that freedom came a question that has never left me:What does it mean to live in a time when history touches you?Now We Are Touching HistoryThat was thirty years ago.Back then, history felt contained—something to step into and out of, something held within books and museums. It was heavy, but it was settled.Perhaps that is how most of us lived for so long. We carried history, but we did not touch it. It pressed upon us in memory but not in urgency. It shaped who we were, but it did not ask us to shape it in return.Until now.Until this moment.Now, we are touching history.Not watching. Not remembering. Touching.There are times when history moves quietly - passing through ordinary days, unremarked, unnoticed.And then there are times like this.Times when history is no longer something that will be written later, but something that is being shaped now. Times when history is not just something lived through but something grasped, something forged, something held with trembling hands.This is one of those times.Now, history moves through us. Presses against us. It does not ask if we are ready—only whether we will rise to meet it.It does not feel like the past, settled and known. It does not feel like the history we studied in books, its meaning already understood. It feels unsteady, uncertain, undetermined—because we are the ones who must give it meaning.It feels like standing at a threshold, knowing the world before is gone, but the world ahead is still unknown.It feels like being both participant and witness—inside it, yet also outside, knowing that one day others will look back and ask:What was it like? What did you do?It feels vast. Irreversible. Something we cannot yet fully see—but we know we are inside it.And that knowledge is heavy.Because history, when you touch it, does not allow you to remain passive.It demands.It demands something of us now, in this moment.Purim—A Story of Touching HistoryAnd tonight is Purim.A day that reminds us that history does not simply unfold—it demands something from those who live it.Once before, another Mordechai stood before history.He did not choose his moment.

They will ask if we were worthy of the legacy we inherited.And what will we tell them?Because history does not write itself.We write it.And now, we are touching it again.
            



Times when history is no longer something that will be written later, but something that is being shaped now. Times when history is not just something lived through but something grasped, something forged, something held with trembling hands.This is one of those times.Now, history moves through us. Presses against us. It does not ask if we are ready—only whether we will rise to meet it.It does not feel like the past, settled and known. It does not feel like the history we studied in books, its meaning already understood. It feels unsteady, uncertain, undetermined—because we are the ones who must give it meaning.It feels like standing at a threshold, knowing the world before is gone, but the world ahead is still unknown.It feels like being both participant and witness—inside it, yet also outside, knowing that one day others will look back and ask:What was it like? What did you do?It feels vast. Irreversible. Something we cannot yet fully see—but we know we are inside it.And that knowledge is heavy.Because history, when you touch it, does not allow you to remain passive.It demands.It demands something of us now, in this moment.Purim—A Story of Touching HistoryAnd tonight is Purim.A day that reminds us that history does not simply unfold—it demands something from those who live it.Once before, another Mordechai stood before history.He did not choose his moment. But it came for him.“If you remain silent at this time, relief and salvation will arise from elsewhere. But who knows if it was for this very moment that you became queen?”He could have bowed. He could have stayed silent.Instead, he stood.Esther could have remained hidden. She could have waited for history to pass over her.Instead, she stepped forward.She touched history. She shaped it.This evening we will go to the synagogue. We will hear the names—Mordechai, Esther, Haman—and we will remember that this is not just a story of then.It is the story of now.Because history is not distant. It is not settled. It is not something we inherit—it is something we shape.And now, once again, it is pressing upon us.Those who came before us stood in moments like this. Some resisted. Some fought. Some remained silent. And some chose to step forward.Now it is our turn.One day, our children will ask what we did in this moment.They will ask what it was like, how we stood, how we chose, how we bore the weight of history pressing into our hands. They will ask if we were worthy of the legacy we inherited.And what will we tell them?Because history does not write itself.We write it.And now, we are touching it again.

Instead, she stepped forward.She touched history. She shaped it.This evening we will go to the synagogue.

The arrest of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) activist Mahmoud Khalil has once again put the spotlight on radical anti-Israel activism on American campuses. CUAD is not merely another pro-Palestinian student group advocating for divestment from Israel.It is an organization that openly supports terrorism, praises Hamas's October 7 massacre, and calls for the destruction of both Israel and the United States. “We support liberation by any means necessary, including armed resistance,” CUAD stated on October 8, reiterating its endorsement of political violence.Columbia University has been at the center of escalating tensions, with CUAD leading campus protests since the October 7 attack. The organization was responsible for a high-profile encampment at the university in April, which inspired similar occupations at other institutions.  Protesters took over Columbia's Hamilton Hall, renaming it “Hind's Hall” in reference to a Palestinian girl killed in Gaza. “The movement for Palestinian liberation is not isolated; it is part of the global anti-imperialist struggle,” CUAD wrote in a Substack post, positioning its activism as part of a broader revolutionary agenda.Radical rhetoric is not confined to university campuses. In Paterson, New Jersey, Mayor Andre Sayegh recently declared his city the “capital of Palestine in the United States” at a Ramadan event attended by pro-Palestinian organizations. Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh speaks at the Hilal Lighting Ceremony marking the start of Ramadan, February 28, 2025. (credit: Screenshot/YouTube)“Paterson is the fourth holiest city in the world after Jerusalem, Mecca, and Medina,” Sayegh stated, further cementing the city's role as a hub for Palestinian activism. The city has already renamed a major street “Palestine Way,” actively promoted the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, and aligned itself with groups critical of Israel's legitimacy.The spread of extremist narratives has even reached law enforcement. In Canada, two Muslim liaison officers for the Toronto Police Service claimed in a now-deleted podcast episode that labeling anti-Israel protests as “pro-Hamas” was Islamophobic. “When someone is calling a Palestinian rally a Hamas rally, then all of a sudden people start getting afraid,” one officer argued, attempting to downplay the overt support for terrorist groups at these demonstrations. Outrage in the Jewish communityTheir comments sparked outrage within the Jewish community, raising concerns about law enforcement's impartiality in addressing antisemitism. The Toronto Police Service later issued an apology, with Chief Myron Demkiw acknowledging, “We recognize the Jewish community's profound pain and anguish as a result of October 7.”The convergence of these incidents paints a troubling picture. Campus activism has crossed into outright support for terrorist groups. Local politicians are legitimizing extreme rhetoric. Law enforcement agencies are struggling to maintain impartiality. And the federal government has weakened protections for Jewish students.These are not only isolated events – but also part of a growing trend in which radical anti-Israel sentiment is becoming normalized in mainstream institutions. “Zionists don't deserve to live,” a CUAD member wrote in a past statement, a reminder of how dangerous this rhetoric has become.

Mayor Sayegh's comments in Paterson may have been intended as symbolic, but they reflect a broader trend of local governments embracing extreme positions. “Colonial projects all die, and Zionism will not be saved,” CUAD wrote on Instagram, making clear its long-term goal of eliminating Israel.Such declarations do not promote peace or dialogue – they embolden those who seek to erase Israel's legitimacy.Furthermore, law enforcement agencies must remain neutral and focused on their duty to protect all citizens. The Toronto police podcast episode raises serious concerns about bias within institutions meant to ensure public safety. “Our commitment to protecting our Jewish communities remains unwavering,” Chief Demkiw stated in response to the backlash.

Public trust in law enforcement depends on its ability to address threats without political considerations.When law enforcement hesitates to acknowledge the reality of extremist rhetoric, it creates an environment where antisemitic harassment and intimidation can thrive unchecked. Extremism thrives when it is ignored. The normalization of radical rhetoric and violence under the pretense of activism must be confronted before it becomes irreversible.If these trends continue unchecked, the consequences will be severe – not only for the Jewish community but for the stability of North American society as a whole.

Despite the growing criticism, Israel is standing firm in its attempt to banish the United Nations Relief and Works Agency from operating in its territory.Since its ban came into effect on January 30, Israeli authorities have severed coordination ties with the agency, shut down schools in east Jerusalem, and effectively forced international staff to leave.  The government's decision was largely driven by its expanding allegations that UNRWA employees hold links to terrorist organizations.The fallout has been swift. Countries such as the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and the European Union have suspended or withdrawn funding, citing concerns over neutrality. AdvertisementBeyond the political maneuvering and aid cuts, the issue has added fresh scrutiny to a decades-old debate that remains unresolved: Who qualifies as a Palestinian refugee? And should this status be inherited indefinitely – even by millionaires? UNDER UNRWA's unique framework, all descendants of Palestinian refugees “who lost both their home and means of livelihood... are eligible for refugee status,” regardless of wealth or nationality. Here, billionaire Zahwa Arafat poses in front of a portrait of her late father Yasser Arafat in 2011. (credit: MATTHEW MIRABELLI/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES)A refugee definition unlike any otherUNRWA was created shortly after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war to assist 750,000 Palestinians displaced by the conflict. Today, its registry lists over six million refugees. Critics argue that no other refugee group in the world operates with this mandate.“Unlike every other refugee crisis in history, Palestinian refugees don't decrease in number – they increase. UNRWA doesn't resettle, it perpetuates,” says Dina Rovner, legal adviser for UN Watch.​ “The result? A crisis that has lasted decades longer than any other.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Among those classified as Palestinian refugees is Jordanian-American real estate mogul Mohamed Hadid and his five millionaire children, including supermodels Bella and Gigi Hadid. Twenty-nine-year-old Zahwa Arafat, the billionaire daughter of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, also retains this status. AdvertisementUnder UNRWA's unique framework, all descendants of Palestinian refugees “who lost both their home and means of livelihood in Mandate Palestine between 1946-1948 are eligible for refugee status,” regardless of wealth or nationality – a stark contrast to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which removes individuals from its registries once they are resettled or naturalized.UNRWA, though, asserts that Palestinian refugee status is determined by the UN General Assembly, not the agency itself.“Palestinian refugees were recognized under Resolution 194 before UNRWA existed, where human rights were not subjected to economic status,” says Jonathan Fowler, UNRWA's senior communications manager. “In mass displacements, refugee status applies collectively and passes through generations, as seen with Afghan, Sudanese, and Sahrawi refugees”  “Yet, the difference is striking. After WWII, millions were displaced, primarily in Europe, but around 1.5 million were resettled by temporary UN agencies before UNHCR took over in 1952. In contrast, 77 years later, UNRWA remains a permanent institution, even as many, like the 2.4 million in Jordan who hold citizenship, continue receiving its assistance.”This raises a pivotal question: Does UNRWA's approach maintain statelessness rather than resolving it?The debate over disparitiesThe controversy extends beyond definitions. Critics hold that UNRWA's budget and staff allocation raise questions about its efficiency compared to other refugee agencies.When first established, UNRWA's annual budget was 110 times greater than UNHCRs. Today, it employs 30,000 staff for nearly six million refugees – a 1:200 ratio. In contrast, UNHCR, which serves around 32 million refugees globally, operates with 20,000 staff, translating to one staff member per 1,600 refugees.“There is a clear inconsistency in how the world treats the Palestinians compared to other refugees,” says Rovner. “If they were under the UNHCR, the majority would not be considered eligible.”Fowler counters the criticism, explaining that UNRWA's economic and service model is fundamentally different and of significant value. “It was designed as a sustained relief and works program until a viable solution is achieved, much like the 1930s US Tennessee Valley Authority.” Moreover, he adds, “the value for money is extraordinary – hiring locals not only brings local benefits but also costs 40%-50% less than employing internationals.”UNRWA under fireAs the debate over refugee classification rages on, Israel's reports of UNRWA's connections to terrorism have also dominated recent discussions. Citing its intelligence findings, Israeli authorities maintain that 10% of the agency's senior educators in Gaza have ties to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“UNRWA's response is always the same – to deflect, deny, and cover up. They never take responsibility. They claim to be a ‘humanitarian backbone' in Gaza but promote Hamas propaganda, like it did with the Gaza famine narrative, which has been totally debunked,” charges Rovner.However, there are also claims that UNRWA is being targeted politically, as Fowler indicates: “There's a barrage of misinformation about who we are and who we're not. We share all our staff lists with regional authorities, including Israel, and have never received pushback about specific employees before.”Despite Israel's push to dismantle UNRWA, many European nations have since reinstated funding after reviewing oversight measures and accounting for its critical humanitarian role. Fowler points to the recently commissioned and independent Colonna Report, which found UNRWA to have more robust neutrality standards than any other UN agency. Still, critics like Rovner, remain unconvinced, contending that the problem is systemic.What happens if UNRWA does disappear?With increasing calls within Israel and the United States to abolish UNRWA, the question arises: If UNRWA disappears, what happens next?Fowler says that the organization has no intention of existing indefinitely, but it continues so far as the situation remains unresolved.“Abolishing UNRWA ignores reality,” observes Fowler. “We are often thanked by Israeli authorities, albeit at the moment not so openly, for the work we do, because without us, the responsibility will fall on them.”The topic of reform has come up quite a lot where UNRWA and the UN at large are concerned. Some believe that redefining Palestinian refugees under UNHCR rules could force a shift in the political deadlock. Others, though, insist not only is it too little, too late for reforms, but that they are insufficient in addressing the deeper issues.“As long as UNRWA exists, there will always be a Palestinian right-of-return narrative that keeps the conflict alive. Palestinians have to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own future. Without Palestinian self-determination, chances of a prosperous future are slim,” says Rovner.Questions without answersWith funding cuts, Israeli bans, and growing global pressure, UNRWA finds itself at a crossroads. Today, it is continuing to operate, even on a limited scale – holding that as long as millions remain classified as refugees, it has a job to do.Still, fundamental questions continue to go unanswered: Who should be classified a Palestinian refugee? Should refugee status be hereditary forever – even for those who live in luxury? Who should be responsible for the Palestinians? And what is Israel's role?With neither Israel disappearing nor the Palestinian refugee issue nearing resolution, UNRWA persists as a central fault line in one of the world's most protracted conflicts. Whether the agency serves as a crucial humanitarian lifeline or a political roadblock to lasting peace depends entirely on whom you ask.

Beyond the political maneuvering and aid cuts, the issue has added fresh scrutiny to a decades-old debate that remains unresolved: Who qualifies as a Palestinian refugee? And should this status be inherited indefinitely – even by millionaires? UNDER UNRWA's unique framework, all descendants of Palestinian refugees “who lost both their home and means of livelihood... are eligible for refugee status,” regardless of wealth or nationality. Here, billionaire Zahwa Arafat poses in front of a portrait of her late father Yasser Arafat in 2011. (credit: MATTHEW MIRABELLI/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES)A refugee definition unlike any otherUNRWA was created shortly after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war to assist 750,000 Palestinians displaced by the conflict. Today, its registry lists over six million refugees. Critics argue that no other refugee group in the world operates with this mandate.“Unlike every other refugee crisis in history, Palestinian refugees don't decrease in number – they increase. UNRWA doesn't resettle, it perpetuates,” says Dina Rovner, legal adviser for UN Watch.​ “The result? A crisis that has lasted decades longer than any other.”   Stay updated with the latest news!

After WWII, millions were displaced, primarily in Europe, but around 1.5 million were resettled by temporary UN agencies before UNHCR took over in 1952. In contrast, 77 years later, UNRWA remains a permanent institution, even as many, like the 2.4 million in Jordan who hold citizenship, continue receiving its assistance.”This raises a pivotal question: Does UNRWA's approach maintain statelessness rather than resolving it?The debate over disparitiesThe controversy extends beyond definitions. Critics hold that UNRWA's budget and staff allocation raise questions about its efficiency compared to other refugee agencies.When first established, UNRWA's annual budget was 110 times greater than UNHCRs. Today, it employs 30,000 staff for nearly six million refugees – a 1:200 ratio. In contrast, UNHCR, which serves around 32 million refugees globally, operates with 20,000 staff, translating to one staff member per 1,600 refugees.“There is a clear inconsistency in how the world treats the Palestinians compared to other refugees,” says Rovner. “If they were under the UNHCR, the majority would not be considered eligible.”Fowler counters the criticism, explaining that UNRWA's economic and service model is fundamentally different and of significant value. “It was designed as a sustained relief and works program until a viable solution is achieved, much like the 1930s US Tennessee Valley Authority.” Moreover, he adds, “the value for money is extraordinary – hiring locals not only brings local benefits but also costs 40%-50% less than employing internationals.”UNRWA under fireAs the debate over refugee classification rages on, Israel's reports of UNRWA's connections to terrorism have also dominated recent discussions.

Critics hold that UNRWA's budget and staff allocation raise questions about its efficiency compared to other refugee agencies.When first established, UNRWA's annual budget was 110 times greater than UNHCRs. Today, it employs 30,000 staff for nearly six million refugees – a 1:200 ratio. In contrast, UNHCR, which serves around 32 million refugees globally, operates with 20,000 staff, translating to one staff member per 1,600 refugees.“There is a clear inconsistency in how the world treats the Palestinians compared to other refugees,” says Rovner. “If they were under the UNHCR, the majority would not be considered eligible.”Fowler counters the criticism, explaining that UNRWA's economic and service model is fundamentally different and of significant value. “It was designed as a sustained relief and works program until a viable solution is achieved, much like the 1930s US Tennessee Valley Authority.” Moreover, he adds, “the value for money is extraordinary – hiring locals not only brings local benefits but also costs 40%-50% less than employing internationals.”UNRWA under fireAs the debate over refugee classification rages on, Israel's reports of UNRWA's connections to terrorism have also dominated recent discussions. Citing its intelligence findings, Israeli authorities maintain that 10% of the agency's senior educators in Gaza have ties to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“UNRWA's response is always the same – to deflect, deny, and cover up. They never take responsibility. They claim to be a ‘humanitarian backbone' in Gaza but promote Hamas propaganda, like it did with the Gaza famine narrative, which has been totally debunked,” charges Rovner.However, there are also claims that UNRWA is being targeted politically, as Fowler indicates: “There's a barrage of misinformation about who we are and who we're not. We share all our staff lists with regional authorities, including Israel, and have never received pushback about specific employees before.”Despite Israel's push to dismantle UNRWA, many European nations have since reinstated funding after reviewing oversight measures and accounting for its critical humanitarian role. Fowler points to the recently commissioned and independent Colonna Report, which found UNRWA to have more robust neutrality standards than any other UN agency. Still, critics like Rovner, remain unconvinced, contending that the problem is systemic.What happens if UNRWA does disappear?With increasing calls within Israel and the United States to abolish UNRWA, the question arises: If UNRWA disappears, what happens next?Fowler says that the organization has no intention of existing indefinitely, but it continues so far as the situation remains unresolved.“Abolishing UNRWA ignores reality,” observes Fowler. “We are often thanked by Israeli authorities, albeit at the moment not so openly, for the work we do, because without us, the responsibility will fall on them.”The topic of reform has come up quite a lot where UNRWA and the UN at large are concerned. Some believe that redefining Palestinian refugees under UNHCR rules could force a shift in the political deadlock. Others, though, insist not only is it too little, too late for reforms, but that they are insufficient in addressing the deeper issues.“As long as UNRWA exists, there will always be a Palestinian right-of-return narrative that keeps the conflict alive. Palestinians have to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own future. Without Palestinian self-determination, chances of a prosperous future are slim,” says Rovner.Questions without answersWith funding cuts, Israeli bans, and growing global pressure, UNRWA finds itself at a crossroads. Today, it is continuing to operate, even on a limited scale – holding that as long as millions remain classified as refugees, it has a job to do.Still, fundamental questions continue to go unanswered: Who should be classified a Palestinian refugee? Should refugee status be hereditary forever – even for those who live in luxury? Who should be responsible for the Palestinians? And what is Israel's role?With neither Israel disappearing nor the Palestinian refugee issue nearing resolution, UNRWA persists as a central fault line in one of the world's most protracted conflicts. Whether the agency serves as a crucial humanitarian lifeline or a political roadblock to lasting peace depends entirely on whom you ask.
            



UNRWA, though, asserts that Palestinian refugee status is determined by the UN General Assembly, not the agency itself.“Palestinian refugees were recognized under Resolution 194 before UNRWA existed, where human rights were not subjected to economic status,” says Jonathan Fowler, UNRWA's senior communications manager. “In mass displacements, refugee status applies collectively and passes through generations, as seen with Afghan, Sudanese, and Sahrawi refugees”  “Yet, the difference is striking.

Fowler counters the criticism, explaining that UNRWA's economic and service model is fundamentally different and of significant value. “It was designed as a sustained relief and works program until a viable solution is achieved, much like the 1930s US Tennessee Valley Authority.” Moreover, he adds, “the value for money is extraordinary – hiring locals not only brings local benefits but also costs 40%-50% less than employing internationals.”UNRWA under fireAs the debate over refugee classification rages on, Israel's reports of UNRWA's connections to terrorism have also dominated recent discussions. Citing its intelligence findings, Israeli authorities maintain that 10% of the agency's senior educators in Gaza have ties to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“UNRWA's response is always the same – to deflect, deny, and cover up. They never take responsibility. They claim to be a ‘humanitarian backbone' in Gaza but promote Hamas propaganda, like it did with the Gaza famine narrative, which has been totally debunked,” charges Rovner.However, there are also claims that UNRWA is being targeted politically, as Fowler indicates: “There's a barrage of misinformation about who we are and who we're not. We share all our staff lists with regional authorities, including Israel, and have never received pushback about specific employees before.”Despite Israel's push to dismantle UNRWA, many European nations have since reinstated funding after reviewing oversight measures and accounting for its critical humanitarian role. Fowler points to the recently commissioned and independent Colonna Report, which found UNRWA to have more robust neutrality standards than any other UN agency. Still, critics like Rovner, remain unconvinced, contending that the problem is systemic.What happens if UNRWA does disappear?With increasing calls within Israel and the United States to abolish UNRWA, the question arises: If UNRWA disappears, what happens next?Fowler says that the organization has no intention of existing indefinitely, but it continues so far as the situation remains unresolved.“Abolishing UNRWA ignores reality,” observes Fowler. “We are often thanked by Israeli authorities, albeit at the moment not so openly, for the work we do, because without us, the responsibility will fall on them.”The topic of reform has come up quite a lot where UNRWA and the UN at large are concerned. Some believe that redefining Palestinian refugees under UNHCR rules could force a shift in the political deadlock. Others, though, insist not only is it too little, too late for reforms, but that they are insufficient in addressing the deeper issues.“As long as UNRWA exists, there will always be a Palestinian right-of-return narrative that keeps the conflict alive. Palestinians have to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own future. Without Palestinian self-determination, chances of a prosperous future are slim,” says Rovner.Questions without answersWith funding cuts, Israeli bans, and growing global pressure, UNRWA finds itself at a crossroads. Today, it is continuing to operate, even on a limited scale – holding that as long as millions remain classified as refugees, it has a job to do.Still, fundamental questions continue to go unanswered: Who should be classified a Palestinian refugee? Should refugee status be hereditary forever – even for those who live in luxury? Who should be responsible for the Palestinians?

Every culture has its cultural icons – artists, musicians, and actors who don't just reflect their time but shape it, bend it, and redefine it. In Israel, it used to be that the dominant voices in music and film belonged to secular Ashkenazi men, and their influence was undeniable.The Bourekas films of the 1960s and '70s were a prime example, shaping Israeli humor and nostalgia, even if, for me, they never quite hit the mark. I know all the famous lines, but do I actually find them funny? Eh. So-so.  Growing up as the child of olim (immigrants), my cultural touchstones were different. I didn't feel connected to nostalgic Israeli music or the slapstick Bourekas genre. Instead, my musical world was filled with hassidic singers and choirs – most of them American. And while I never belonged to a hassidic or haredi (ultra-Orthodox) community, there weren't many musicians in the Israeli mainstream who aligned with the values my family and my community held dear.That has changed. AdvertisementToday, Israeli music is no longer dominated by a single cultural stream. Sephardi sounds have blended into the mainstream, and artists are increasingly drawing from traditional Jewish texts. Eyal Golan's “Am Yisrael Chai” was the song of the year. Israel's Eurovision entry weaves in a verse from Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs). The airwaves are filled with songs of resilience, faith, and national pride. Pro-Israel students take part in a protest in support of Israel amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, at Columbia University in New York City, US, October 12, 2023.  (credit: JEENAH MOON/REUTERS)But what about Jews outside Israel? Who are their cultural figures? Who are the musicians, actors, or artists who can give them a sense of identity and belonging? If you're an Orthodox Jew, there's a whole genre of music catering to you. But what about everyone else? Who do Jewish parents feel comfortable sending their kids to see in concert? For years, we were told that being Jewish in America could be summed up in the humor of Jerry Seinfeld – a funny, charming, but ultimately superficial take on Jewish identity. A cultural Judaism that made you laugh but didn't give you much to hold onto. Was it enough? Did it make people proud to be Jewish?Then, October 7 happened.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  And suddenly, everything changed. AdvertisementSeinfeld, the man who had long represented that detached, lighthearted Jewish identity, became an outspoken supporter of Israel. He said he had “no patience” for Palestinians. Jews who had never considered themselves religious – so-called “October 8 Jews” – woke up and realized they wanted to be more connected to their Jewishness, but didn't know how.In Hollywood, a few actors and artists stood with Israel. Some stayed silent. A small fringe openly attacked Israel.But something deeper was happening: American Jews, Israeli Jews, and Jews across the Diaspora were shifting. They became more conservative, more attached to tradition, even more spiritual. And yet, the big question remains: Who will create the soundtrack of this Jewish generation?  A Jewish Wonder Woman “My name is Gal. And I am Jewish.”That's how Gal Gadot opened her speech at the Anti-Defamation League's event last week. A room full of Jews, journalists, activists, and donors went silent as she stood at the podium, her voice steady, her presence commanding.“I'll say it again,” she continued. “My name is Gal. And I'm Jewish.”And just like that, a simple fact – a name, an identity – felt like a declaration of war.She wasn't joking. She wasn't being diplomatic. She was stating what should be obvious, but in today's climate, felt radical.“Isn't it crazy,” she asked, “that just saying that, just expressing such a simple fact about who I am, feels like a controversial statement?”She wasn't wrong. That's exactly where we are today.Before October 7, Gadot had always tried to avoid politics. She had never wanted to be an activist. She was Israeli, yes, Jewish, yes – but not defined by it. She was a Hollywood star, a global citizen. The kind of actress who could be cast in a Cleopatra film, not just a Sabra role.But then, everything changed.“I never thought of myself as being where I came from,” she admitted. “It was an aspect of who I am, but it didn't define me. And then October 7 happened.”You could hear a pin drop.She spoke about her grandfather, a Holocaust survivor who built a new life in Israel. She spoke about her father's side of the family, Israelis for eight generations, deeply rooted in this land. She spoke about how, overnight, the comfortable Jewish identity so many had taken for granted was shattered.And she spoke about the moment she realized she could no longer stay silent.“Never did I imagine that we would witness such a day of such death and destruction of Jews in our lifetime. And never did I imagine that on the streets of the United States and different cities around the world, we would see people not condemning Hamas, but celebrating. Justifying. Cheering on a massacre of Jews.”There it was.The October 8 Jews – those who had spent their lives distant from their Judaism, suddenly realizing they needed it.And Gadot explained she wasn't just talking about the past, but about what came next. The rediscovery of Jewish identity, of Jewish resilience.“I found myself in a synagogue,” she said. “I'm not a religiously observant person. But I felt the embrace of the Jewish people and the power of our community. And for those few precious moments, the chaos and violence of the outside world felt just a little easier to deal with.”Who will create the soundtrack of this Jewish generation?This shift, this Jewish reawakening, is happening across the world. In Israel, it's reflected in the music – in the biblical and Zionist themes taking over the airwaves. But in the Diaspora, the question remains: Who will put these emotions into music? Who will create the soundtrack of this Jewish generation?Music has always been the soul of a people. After October 7, it feels like an entire people is searching for its soul again.We need artists who can take what we're all feeling – the pain, the loss, the pride, the defiance – and turn it into something real. We need music that can uplift us when we're down, give us hope when we feel lost. We need songs that make us want to sing together, dance together, stand together.Because if we don't create these voices, these cultural anchors, then who will?Gadot ended her speech with the words “Am Yisrael Chai.”Now, we need musicians, artists, and creators who will give this new Jewish generation its own anthem.Because this time around, we need to begin rebuilding who we are.

Growing up as the child of olim (immigrants), my cultural touchstones were different. I didn't feel connected to nostalgic Israeli music or the slapstick Bourekas genre. Instead, my musical world was filled with hassidic singers and choirs – most of them American. And while I never belonged to a hassidic or haredi (ultra-Orthodox) community, there weren't many musicians in the Israeli mainstream who aligned with the values my family and my community held dear.That has changed. AdvertisementToday, Israeli music is no longer dominated by a single cultural stream. Sephardi sounds have blended into the mainstream, and artists are increasingly drawing from traditional Jewish texts. Eyal Golan's “Am Yisrael Chai” was the song of the year. Israel's Eurovision entry weaves in a verse from Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs). The airwaves are filled with songs of resilience, faith, and national pride. Pro-Israel students take part in a protest in support of Israel amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, at Columbia University in New York City, US, October 12, 2023.

If you're an Orthodox Jew, there's a whole genre of music catering to you. But what about everyone else? Who do Jewish parents feel comfortable sending their kids to see in concert? For years, we were told that being Jewish in America could be summed up in the humor of Jerry Seinfeld – a funny, charming, but ultimately superficial take on Jewish identity.

Jews who had never considered themselves religious – so-called “October 8 Jews” – woke up and realized they wanted to be more connected to their Jewishness, but didn't know how.In Hollywood, a few actors and artists stood with Israel. Some stayed silent. A small fringe openly attacked Israel.But something deeper was happening: American Jews, Israeli Jews, and Jews across the Diaspora were shifting. They became more conservative, more attached to tradition, even more spiritual. And yet, the big question remains: Who will create the soundtrack of this Jewish generation?  A Jewish Wonder Woman “My name is Gal. And I am Jewish.”That's how Gal Gadot opened her speech at the Anti-Defamation League's event last week. A room full of Jews, journalists, activists, and donors went silent as she stood at the podium, her voice steady, her presence commanding.“I'll say it again,” she continued. “My name is Gal. And I'm Jewish.”And just like that, a simple fact – a name, an identity – felt like a declaration of war.She wasn't joking. She wasn't being diplomatic. She was stating what should be obvious, but in today's climate, felt radical.“Isn't it crazy,” she asked, “that just saying that, just expressing such a simple fact about who I am, feels like a controversial statement?”She wasn't wrong. That's exactly where we are today.Before October 7, Gadot had always tried to avoid politics. She had never wanted to be an activist. She was Israeli, yes, Jewish, yes – but not defined by it. She was a Hollywood star, a global citizen. The kind of actress who could be cast in a Cleopatra film, not just a Sabra role.But then, everything changed.“I never thought of myself as being where I came from,” she admitted. “It was an aspect of who I am, but it didn't define me. And then October 7 happened.”You could hear a pin drop.She spoke about her grandfather, a Holocaust survivor who built a new life in Israel. She spoke about her father's side of the family, Israelis for eight generations, deeply rooted in this land. She spoke about how, overnight, the comfortable Jewish identity so many had taken for granted was shattered.And she spoke about the moment she realized she could no longer stay silent.“Never did I imagine that we would witness such a day of such death and destruction of Jews in our lifetime. And never did I imagine that on the streets of the United States and different cities around the world, we would see people not condemning Hamas, but celebrating. Justifying. Cheering on a massacre of Jews.”There it was.The October 8 Jews – those who had spent their lives distant from their Judaism, suddenly realizing they needed it.And Gadot explained she wasn't just talking about the past, but about what came next. The rediscovery of Jewish identity, of Jewish resilience.“I found myself in a synagogue,” she said. “I'm not a religiously observant person. But I felt the embrace of the Jewish people and the power of our community. And for those few precious moments, the chaos and violence of the outside world felt just a little easier to deal with.”Who will create the soundtrack of this Jewish generation?This shift, this Jewish reawakening, is happening across the world. In Israel, it's reflected in the music – in the biblical and Zionist themes taking over the airwaves. But in the Diaspora, the question remains: Who will put these emotions into music? Who will create the soundtrack of this Jewish generation?Music has always been the soul of a people. After October 7, it feels like an entire people is searching for its soul again.We need artists who can take what we're all feeling – the pain, the loss, the pride, the defiance – and turn it into something real. We need music that can uplift us when we're down, give us hope when we feel lost. We need songs that make us want to sing together, dance together, stand together.Because if we don't create these voices, these cultural anchors, then who will?Gadot ended her speech with the words “Am Yisrael Chai.”Now, we need musicians, artists, and creators who will give this new Jewish generation its own anthem.Because this time around, we need to begin rebuilding who we are.

She spoke about how, overnight, the comfortable Jewish identity so many had taken for granted was shattered.And she spoke about the moment she realized she could no longer stay silent.“Never did I imagine that we would witness such a day of such death and destruction of Jews in our lifetime. And never did I imagine that on the streets of the United States and different cities around the world, we would see people not condemning Hamas, but celebrating. Justifying. Cheering on a massacre of Jews.”There it was.The October 8 Jews – those who had spent their lives distant from their Judaism, suddenly realizing they needed it.And Gadot explained she wasn't just talking about the past, but about what came next. The rediscovery of Jewish identity, of Jewish resilience.“I found myself in a synagogue,” she said. “I'm not a religiously observant person. But I felt the embrace of the Jewish people and the power of our community. And for those few precious moments, the chaos and violence of the outside world felt just a little easier to deal with.”Who will create the soundtrack of this Jewish generation?This shift, this Jewish reawakening, is happening across the world. In Israel, it's reflected in the music – in the biblical and Zionist themes taking over the airwaves. But in the Diaspora, the question remains: Who will put these emotions into music? Who will create the soundtrack of this Jewish generation?Music has always been the soul of a people. After October 7, it feels like an entire people is searching for its soul again.We need artists who can take what we're all feeling – the pain, the loss, the pride, the defiance – and turn it into something real. We need music that can uplift us when we're down, give us hope when we feel lost. We need songs that make us want to sing together, dance together, stand together.Because if we don't create these voices, these cultural anchors, then who will?Gadot ended her speech with the words “Am Yisrael Chai.”Now, we need musicians, artists, and creators who will give this new Jewish generation its own anthem.Because this time around, we need to begin rebuilding who we are.
            



She wasn't wrong. That's exactly where we are today.Before October 7, Gadot had always tried to avoid politics. She had never wanted to be an activist. She was Israeli, yes, Jewish, yes – but not defined by it. She was a Hollywood star, a global citizen. The kind of actress who could be cast in a Cleopatra film, not just a Sabra role.But then, everything changed.“I never thought of myself as being where I came from,” she admitted. “It was an aspect of who I am, but it didn't define me.

Hamas has applauded US President Donald Trump's apparent U-turn from his plan to permanently relocate nearly two million Palestinians from Gaza.

This comes as Trump responded to a reporter's inquiry on Gaza, stating, “Nobody is expelling any Palestinians.” He made the comments following his meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin at the White House.

“If US President Trump's statements represent a retreat from any idea of ​​displacing the people of the Gaza Strip, they are welcomed,” Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said in the statement, as per Reuters.

“We call for this position to be reinforced by obligating the Israeli occupation to implement all the terms of the ceasefire agreements,” he added.

Trump's comments and the Hamas response may help to ease some of the tensions at time when a truce extension between Israel and Hamas is being explored for the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian inmates.

Trump has earlier outlined a plan for the United States to take over Gaza, relocating Palestinians primarily to Egypt and Jordan, and then transforming the region into a contemporary, space called “Riviera of the Middle East.”

International organizations and Palestinian groups have denounced the proposal as ethnic cleansing and forced relocation.

Meanwhile, Egypt's foreign ministry expressed gratitude to Trump for not seeking the removal of Gaza's citizens.

Taher Al-Nono, the Hamas leader's political adviser, stated on Sunday that the terrorist organisation had undertaken unprecedented, open discussions with Washington in the Qatari capital over the last week, The Jerusalem Post reported. The conversations were centered on the release of an American-Israeli dual national who was being held captive in Gaza.

As mediators moved forward with discussions to extend a 42-day truce that started in January, Israel and Hamas indicated on Saturday that they were getting ready for the next stage of ceasefire negotiations.

Vice President JD Vance's unique socks caught the attention of President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin.

The 78-year-old President was speaking about inflation when he glanced at JD Vance's shamrock-themed socks, in honour of the Irish PM's visit. The shamrock, a type of clover, is a symbol that represents Ireland and was often used by St. Patrick, their patron saint.

In the video, Trump is heard saying, “I love these socks. What's with these socks? I'm trying to stay focused, but I'm very impressed with the VP's socks.”

JD Vance and Micheál Martin, were both seen laughing at Donald Trump's response. Later, the vice president took to X to share a clip of the moment and said, “I knew he'd comment on these socks.”

Ahead of the meeting, JD Vance showed off his socks and told the Irish PM, “The President is a very big fan of conservative dress. And so, if he notices these socks, you (Irish PM) have to defend me. You've got to say this is an important part of cementing the Irish-American relationship. That's the only reason I'm wearing these socks.”

President Donald Trump and Irish PM Micheál Martin met on Wednesday for the annual St. Patrick's Day celebration at the White House.

During the meeting, Trump claimed that Ireland, like several European Union countries, had taken advantage of the US.

""I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn't have let it happen,” said Trump, as quoted by Associated Press, regarding the concentration of US pharmaceutical companies in Ireland.

He added, “We had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn't have a clue or let's say they weren't businesspeople, but they didn't have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies.""

The Irish PM countered Trump's claims by stating that more than 700 Irish companies are also based in the US. Martin said that he would be willing to discuss these issues and develop the relationship between the two nations further.

Baloch Liberation Army militants, who attacked a passenger train carrying 440 passengers in restive southwestern Pakistan, killed 21 hostages before security forces killed all 33 of the assailants, and all other passengers were rescued, officials said Wednesday.

Pakistan information minister Attaullah Tarar said the separatist Baloch Liberation Army or BLA group was behind the attack, and the military operation “has successfully reached its logical conclusion”.

He said no passengers died because of the operation, and praised the military for “averting a potential catastrophe"". The province's chief minister, Sarfraz Bugti, told a provincial assembly that troops killed all insurgents involved.

Passengers who escaped or were released by the militants described panic as gunmen seized control of the train, sorting through identity cards, shooting soldiers but freeing some families, news agency AFP reported.

""They asked us to come out of the train one by one. They separated women and asked them to leave. They also spared elders,"" said Muhammad Naveed, who managed to escape, told AFP.

""They asked us to come outside, saying we will not be harmed. When around 185 people came outside, they chose people and shot them down.""

Babar Masih, a 38-year-old Christian labourer, told AFP on Wednesday he and his family walked for hours through rugged mountains to reach a train that could take them to a makeshift hospital on a railway platform.

""Our women pleaded with them, and they spared us,"" he said.

""They told us to get out and not look back. As we ran, I noticed many others running alongside us.""

Noman Ahmed, a steelworker originally from Gujranwala district in Punjab Province, was also aboard the train, hoping to return home for Eid with his family, The New York Times reported.

“When we heard the blast, we dropped to the floor and locked the carriage door, hoping to escape the gunfire,” NYT quoted Ahmed as saying.

Moments later, a militant came and separated women and the elderly from the rest of the passengers, who were forced to move toward a nearby hillside. Some injured passengers remained inside the train, he said.

“They ordered them to come out,” Ahmed said, adding, “When they didn't, the gunmen went in and shot them all.”

The train had been travelling from Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar. Officials say the Jaffer Express train was partially inside a tunnel when the militants blew up the tracks, forcing the engine and nine coaches to stop.

Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest and least populated province. It's a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government.

Balochistan borders Iran and Afghanistan and has long been the scene of insurgency. Separatists demand greater autonomy from the government in Islamabad and a larger share of the region's natural resources.

Members of the military frequently use trains to travel from Quetta to other parts of the country. In November, the BLA carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in Quetta, killing 26 people.

The BLA had warned that hostages' lives would be at risk if the government did not negotiate. Analysts said the attack and its focus on civilians could backfire.

“After failing to damage the Pakistan Army within Balochistan, BLA has shifted its targets from military to unarmed civilians. This may give them instant public and media attention, but it will weaken their support base within the civilian population, which is their ultimate objective,” said Syed Muhammad Ali, an Islamabad-based independent security analyst.

Rescued passengers, including women and children, were being sent to their hometowns. Some of the injured were taken to Quetta, about 62 miles away.

NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are expected to return to Earth by March 16 following their lengthy stay on the International Space Station (ISS). Due to technical problems with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, their mission, which was originally only supposed to span ten days, ended up lasting almost ten months.

On March 12, the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will bring them back to Earth, is scheduled to be launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a Falcon-9 rocket.

The current Crew-9 expedition aboard the flying laboratory will be substituted with four NASA astronauts as part of the Crew-10 mission when the Dragon spacecraft lifts off.

Ahead of their return, experts have warned that it will not be a normal homecoming. Williams and Wilmore will face difficulties to adapt to Earth's gravity.

Speaking to NewsNation Prime, Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut, explained the challenges.

According to him, astronauts experience “baby feet” after extended space travel.

“You basically lose the thick part of your skin,” stated Chiao, stressing that weightlessness causes foot calluses to diminish.

Human feet, or the soles, are perhaps the most bizarre consequence of living in environments that are nearly weightless. Moreover, dizziness and nausea are other side effects that astronauts encounter after returning home.

“To me, it feels like kind of like having the flu. It takes a couple of weeks to get back to normal,” he stated.

Astronaut Terry Virts equated the sensation to the flu. “I felt really heavy and really, really dizzy,” he stated.

After coming back from space, the body needs weeks to acclimate.

Williams and Wilmore were supposed to stay on ISS for their eight-day mission. However, they remained on ISS following issues in Boeing Starliner spacecraft.

Their prolonged stay raised worries regarding their health and even provoked political discussion. US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk blasted the Biden administration over delay in their return.

Riu Hotels & Resorts in the Dominican Republic tourist town of Punta Cana is drawing flak for its TikTok advertisement promoting a flash sale of its property, The Daily Mail reported.

The move comes as the FBI is searching for Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old Indian-American student who reportedly disappeared from the Riu República Hotel's beach over a week ago. She was last seen on March 6, walking towards the beach.

Netizens asked the Riu Hotels & Resorts to help authorities find the student rather than looking for ways to sell off the property.

The advertisement offered slashed prices across the company's portfolio of properties, including the Riu República Hotel, which the Dominican authorities are investigating.

A double room at the five-star resort can be rented for just $88 per night, the report said. The advertisements promoted the properties at rates starting at $95, including a 10% discount.

One of the resort's advertisements read, “From 95 USD! Don't miss out on the exclusive RIU Week deals!”

The property has been drawing flak for lacking electricity and water for days before the young girl's disappearance. The hotel had said in a statement that Konanki's disappearance coincided with a power outage that prompted multiple guests to head to the beach.

Commenting on the post, a user wrote, “Focus on the lost American Indian student from RIU Punta Cana first.”

A person handling the hotel company's TikTok account seemed to share the public sentiment. He replied with a heart emoji to a comment from a user who replied, “Lol, please.”

The company did not respond to The Daily Mail's request to comment on its TikTok flash sale.

According to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, Konkani is a US permanent resident from Chantilly, Virginia. Her parents, Subbarayudu and Sreedevi, flew to Punta Cana after she was reported missing and have asked authorities to widen their search and investigation. The family said she and five other female university students travelled to the Dominican Republic on March 3.

Soldiers took part in exercises for NATO's new quick-reaction force in Smardan, Romania, last month.Last month roughly 10,000 NATO troops carried out drills just miles from Ukraine's border to test a new quick-reaction force created after Russia's large-scale invasion of its neighbor. The show of military muscle was unusual for who was absent: the U.S.

 Now people in and around the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are wondering whether Europeans could handle more than just an exercise on their own. America's commitment to NATO security guarantees is suddenly in doubt, even after the U.S. reinstated military support for Ukraine this week after Kyiv accepted a cease-fire and Moscow signaled it is in no hurry to end hostilities. American diplomatic outreach to Russia and the Trump administration's frostiness toward Europe raise worries.  That is leading some to ask a once-unthinkable question: If trans-Atlantic ties deteriorate further, could Europe be forced to defend itself against Russia without U.S. support? American military brass and officials who have served across the Atlantic say Europe would pack a strong punch in such a scenario. Europe lacks important air-defense and intelligence capabilities, but its militaries together constitute a massive air force, giant navy and formidable army. Those land forces, which shriveled after the Cold War, are now gradually rebuilding and adding advanced equipment. A fight would be deadly and hugely destructive—as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shown—and raise the risk of nuclear war. But in conventional combat, say strategists, Russia would struggle against Europe. NATO members have said that Russia in a few years could be strong enough to launch a more traditional attack on Europe, especially if a Ukraine peace agreement allows Moscow to rebuild its armed forces. Whether a reconstituted Russian military could take European ground is the question. “What we've seen of Mr. Putin's army is, they are certainly not 10 feet tall. They have struggled mightily in fighting Ukraine,” said retired U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, a former NATO supreme allied commander. He said that 11 years after Moscow's initial attack on Ukraine, when it seized the Crimean Peninsula, and three years after its full-scale invasion, “their army has been decimated” by a lesser Ukrainian force. Breedlove and others are positive on Europe's prospects in a fight with Russia in part because of the potential circumstances: a Russian attack on Europe. Europe has no thoughts of attacking Russia. Defending territory is easier than taking it, as ragtag Ukrainian forces showed three years ago when they stopped Russia's attempt to grab Kyiv. “I think that the European armies are well-suited to any problem that would happen with Russia,” said Breedlove. One caveat raised in recent days, following President Trump's blockage of aid to Ukraine, is the U.S. actively impeding European NATO action. “That's no longer completely unimaginable,” said Giuseppe Spatafora, a former NATO planner and now a research analyst at the European Union's Institute for Security Studies. NATO countries are racing to learn from Ukraine and develop their own drones and antidrone systems.Europe's military shortcomings are well documented. Its forces rely on the U.S. for vital intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, transport aircraft and command-and-control. Perhaps most critical in a fight with Russia is Europe's lack of air defenses. Russia has demolished Ukrainian towns and cities with missiles and rockets. Still, Europe's militaries together have significant defensive capabilities, which they are building through incessant training. The scale of exercises has increased and their focus has shifted to collective defense. U.S. absence from the reaction-force drill in February was largely due to troop rotations and European initiative to lead the effort, say NATO officials. NATO's 32 members last spring staged their largest exercise since the Cold War, including roughly 90,000 troops, more than 80 aircraft and 1,100 combat vehicles—a big chunk of which came from the U.S. This year, NATO plans nearly 100 separate exercises, said NATO's supreme allied commander Europe, U.S. Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, in January. Most are in or near Europe. “This is an intensive schedule, it's ambitious, but it's absolutely necessary so that we can make sure our forces are trained and ready to defend our citizens,” Cavoli said. The exercises let combat troops get used to fighting alongside allies and help commanders learn how to lead mixed-nationality forces. They also force noncommissioned officers, who lead troops in battle, to practice making decisions under stress and in fast-changing circumstances. NATO's training of Ukrainian soldiers in its leadership approach, known as mission command, helped its forces prevail against Russia's assault on Kyiv, said Ukrainian and NATO officers. Russian combat commanders struggle to improvise and adapt, the past three years have shown. NATO's European militaries also have large amounts of equipment, though much needs to be readied for action. Together they have roughly 5,000 tanks and more than 2,800 self-propelled artillery systems. Russia has up to 3,000 tanks left, according to open-source analysts, though the actual numbers are difficult to judge after it lost thousands of tanks in Ukraine. It has about half as many self-propelled artillery systems as Europe, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, a think tank in London. Drones have cut the usefulness of such systems, and Russia now is a world leader in uncrewed systems. NATO countries are racing to learn from Ukraine and develop their own drones and antidrone systems. A destroyed bridge in the Donetsk region of Ukraine.For more traditional air combat, NATO's European members have roughly 2,000 jet fighters and other warplanes, according to the IISS. Europeans are expanding and modernizing those fleets. By 2030, Europe will have more than 500 cutting-edge U.S.-made F-35 fighter planes. Russia's air force has roughly 1,000 fighter, bomber and ground-attack aircraft, and they haven't performed well in combat, according to the IISS, which estimates Russia has lost roughly one of every five planes it sent into combat. Russian President Vladimir Putin has reoriented his economy to a wartime footing, and it is now working flat out to supply its troops. If fighting were to cease, Russia could quickly rebuild its forces, Western officials fear. European countries have depleted their arsenals by donating equipment to Ukraine and are struggling to replace all that. “Our industry is still too small, it is too fragmented, and to be honest, it is too slow,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told the European Parliament earlier this year. European leaders are scrambling to fund new military production, including at a summit meeting in Brussels last week. The effort has gotten fresh urgency from Trump's pressure. How Europeans might fight without U.S. participation is a new question for NATO countries. While European investments will bolster the continent's defenses, the equipment and units are part of NATO battle plans and command structures premised on U.S. involvement—and even leadership. Aside from NATO, Europe has no continentwide military command. The U.S. spent decades ensuring that by co-opting or squelching any effort by allied European governments to create rival military groupings. Europeans have repeatedly talked about establishing a multinational fighting force but made little headway. Now Europeans are pondering what collective defense might look like without the U.S. A starting point could be NATO's own battle plans, which are adaptable to varying force levels, alliance officials say. The elaborate, flexible and detailed plans are classified.

Now people in and around the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are wondering whether Europeans could handle more than just an exercise on their own. America's commitment to NATO security guarantees is suddenly in doubt, even after the U.S. reinstated military support for Ukraine this week after Kyiv accepted a cease-fire and Moscow signaled it is in no hurry to end hostilities. American diplomatic outreach to Russia and the Trump administration's frostiness toward Europe raise worries.

That is leading some to ask a once-unthinkable question: If trans-Atlantic ties deteriorate further, could Europe be forced to defend itself against Russia without U.S. support? American military brass and officials who have served across the Atlantic say Europe would pack a strong punch in such a scenario.

Europe lacks important air-defense and intelligence capabilities, but its militaries together constitute a massive air force, giant navy and formidable army. Those land forces, which shriveled after the Cold War, are now gradually rebuilding and adding advanced equipment.

A fight would be deadly and hugely destructive—as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shown—and raise the risk of nuclear war. But in conventional combat, say strategists, Russia would struggle against Europe.

NATO members have said that Russia in a few years could be strong enough to launch a more traditional attack on Europe, especially if a Ukraine peace agreement allows Moscow to rebuild its armed forces. Whether a reconstituted Russian military could take European ground is the question.

“What we've seen of Mr. Putin's army is, they are certainly not 10 feet tall. They have struggled mightily in fighting Ukraine,” said retired U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, a former NATO supreme allied commander.

He said that 11 years after Moscow's initial attack on Ukraine, when it seized the Crimean Peninsula, and three years after its full-scale invasion, “their army has been decimated” by a lesser Ukrainian force.

Breedlove and others are positive on Europe's prospects in a fight with Russia in part because of the potential circumstances: a Russian attack on Europe. Europe has no thoughts of attacking Russia. Defending territory is easier than taking it, as ragtag Ukrainian forces showed three years ago when they stopped Russia's attempt to grab Kyiv.

“I think that the European armies are well-suited to any problem that would happen with Russia,” said Breedlove.

One caveat raised in recent days, following President Trump's blockage of aid to Ukraine, is the U.S. actively impeding European NATO action. “That's no longer completely unimaginable,” said Giuseppe Spatafora, a former NATO planner and now a research analyst at the European Union's Institute for Security Studies.

Europe's military shortcomings are well documented. Its forces rely on the U.S. for vital intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, transport aircraft and command-and-control. Perhaps most critical in a fight with Russia is Europe's lack of air defenses. Russia has demolished Ukrainian towns and cities with missiles and rockets.

Still, Europe's militaries together have significant defensive capabilities, which they are building through incessant training. The scale of exercises has increased and their focus has shifted to collective defense. U.S. absence from the reaction-force drill in February was largely due to troop rotations and European initiative to lead the effort, say NATO officials.

NATO's 32 members last spring staged their largest exercise since the Cold War, including roughly 90,000 troops, more than 80 aircraft and 1,100 combat vehicles—a big chunk of which came from the U.S. This year, NATO plans nearly 100 separate exercises, said NATO's supreme allied commander Europe, U.S. Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, in January. Most are in or near Europe.

“This is an intensive schedule, it's ambitious, but it's absolutely necessary so that we can make sure our forces are trained and ready to defend our citizens,” Cavoli said.

The exercises let combat troops get used to fighting alongside allies and help commanders learn how to lead mixed-nationality forces. They also force noncommissioned officers, who lead troops in battle, to practice making decisions under stress and in fast-changing circumstances.

NATO's training of Ukrainian soldiers in its leadership approach, known as mission command, helped its forces prevail against Russia's assault on Kyiv, said Ukrainian and NATO officers. Russian combat commanders struggle to improvise and adapt, the past three years have shown.

NATO's European militaries also have large amounts of equipment, though much needs to be readied for action. Together they have roughly 5,000 tanks and more than 2,800 self-propelled artillery systems. Russia has up to 3,000 tanks left, according to open-source analysts, though the actual numbers are difficult to judge after it lost thousands of tanks in Ukraine. It has about half as many self-propelled artillery systems as Europe, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, a think tank in London.

Drones have cut the usefulness of such systems, and Russia now is a world leader in uncrewed systems. NATO countries are racing to learn from Ukraine and develop their own drones and antidrone systems.

For more traditional air combat, NATO's European members have roughly 2,000 jet fighters and other warplanes, according to the IISS. Europeans are expanding and modernizing those fleets. By 2030, Europe will have more than 500 cutting-edge U.S.-made F-35 fighter planes.

Russia's air force has roughly 1,000 fighter, bomber and ground-attack aircraft, and they haven't performed well in combat, according to the IISS, which estimates Russia has lost roughly one of every five planes it sent into combat.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has reoriented his economy to a wartime footing, and it is now working flat out to supply its troops. If fighting were to cease, Russia could quickly rebuild its forces, Western officials fear.

European countries have depleted their arsenals by donating equipment to Ukraine and are struggling to replace all that. “Our industry is still too small, it is too fragmented, and to be honest, it is too slow,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told the European Parliament earlier this year.

European leaders are scrambling to fund new military production, including at a summit meeting in Brussels last week. The effort has gotten fresh urgency from Trump's pressure.

How Europeans might fight without U.S. participation is a new question for NATO countries. While European investments will bolster the continent's defenses, the equipment and units are part of NATO battle plans and command structures premised on U.S. involvement—and even leadership.

Aside from NATO, Europe has no continentwide military command. The U.S. spent decades ensuring that by co-opting or squelching any effort by allied European governments to create rival military groupings. Europeans have repeatedly talked about establishing a multinational fighting force but made little headway.

Now Europeans are pondering what collective defense might look like without the U.S. A starting point could be NATO's own battle plans, which are adaptable to varying force levels, alliance officials say.

The elaborate, flexible and detailed plans are classified. Still, NATO's fundamental approach today, as during the Cold War, is to employ forces available in Europe to hold off Russian attackers until reinforcements arrive from the U.S.

Europe could still use NATO blueprints as a basis for its own defensive plans, even if they have gaps. Developing capabilities that could alleviate shortfalls if Washington declined to join a conflict is an undertaking that would balloon Europe's bill for military modernization.

“You have to use the best tools available,” said Spatafora at the EU institute. “NATO's plans are a good model because components of national armies are being put together for that.”

The tense silence inside the Jaffar Express ended in a barrage of gunfire as Pakistani security forces stormed the hijacked train on Wednesday, killing all 33 separatist militants and rescuing hundreds of passengers.

The day-long standoff, marked by explosions and hostage threats, began when Baloch militants attacked the train in Balochistan, demanding the release of prisoners.

As special forces moved in, militants wearing suicide vests sat among terrified passengers. In a final planned assault, commandos eliminated the attackers. However, the ordeal left 21 passengers and four security personnel dead.

“Today, we rescued many people, including women and children. The final operation was executed with utmost caution,” Pakistan military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told reporters. He added that no civilians were killed in the final stage of the operation.

The Baloch Liberation Army, which claimed responsibility for the attack, blew up the railway track and fired rockets at the Jaffar Express on Tuesday.

The train, carrying 440 passengers, was travelling from Quetta in Balochistan to Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when it was targeted.

Before the army's announcement, the Baloch Liberation Army claimed to have killed 50 passengers on Wednesday evening. On Tuesday, it said it was holding 214 people, mostly security personnel.

The group had warned that it would begin executing hostages if authorities failed to meet its 48-hour deadline to release Baloch political prisoners, activists, and those it claimed were abducted by the military.

The BLA is the largest of several ethnic armed groups fighting the government in Balochistan, a region bordering Afghanistan and Iran.

In recent months, the militants have intensified their attacks, adopting new tactics to cause heavy casualties and strike at Pakistan's military.

Baloch militant groups claim they are fighting for a greater share of the region's mineral wealth, which they say is controlled by the central government.

Challenging the rescue operation, militants sat among hostages wearing suicide vests, junior interior minister Talal Chaudhry said. He estimated that 70 to 80 attackers had hijacked the train.

The military deployed hundreds of troops, along with the air force and special forces, Chaudhry added.

In the final phase of the operation, he said special forces first eliminated the suicide bombers before troops moved through each carriage to neutralise the remaining militants.

SpaceX delayed the planned launch of Crew-10 on Wednesday due to a last-minute technical issue with the rocket's launchpad. The mission was set to send four replacement astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), paving the way for the long-overdue return of US astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams. The two have been stranded in space for nine months after their trip on Boeing's malfunctioning Starliner.

Officials announced the cancellation during the launch countdown but did not immediately confirm a new launch date.

NASA had planned to launch a SpaceX rocket from Florida to send a replacement crew to the International Space Station, a mission that would have facilitated the long-overdue return of astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams. The two have been stranded in space for nine months following their trip aboard Boeing's malfunctioning Starliner.

The US space agency had accelerated the mission by two weeks after President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk urged an earlier return for Wilmore and Williams than originally scheduled.

The astronauts, both experienced Navy test pilots, were initially supposed to stay on the ISS for just eight days, but their mission was significantly overrun. Boeing's Starliner capsule, which ferried them to space, returned to Earth last year – without them.

A SpaceX rocket was set to launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral at 7.48 pm ET (2348 GMT), carrying a four-member crew consisting of two U.S. astronauts and one astronaut each from Japan and Russia.

NASA confirmed that Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams remain safe while assisting with research and maintenance on the International Space Station (ISS). In a March 4 call, Williams expressed eagerness to reunite with her family and pet dogs after her extended mission. “It's been a roller coaster for them, probably more so than for us,” she said, noting that despite the delay, their work on the ISS remains engaging and fulfilling.

The Crew-10 mission, originally intended as a routine astronaut rotation, has become politically charged. President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have criticised the delay in Wilmore and Williams' return, attributing it – without evidence – to former President Joe Biden's administration. Their push for an earlier return marked an unusual political intervention in NASA's human spaceflight operations.

NASA had initially scheduled the Crew-10 launch for March 26 but expedited the mission by swapping in a SpaceX capsule that could be ready sooner. Once the new crew reaches the ISS, Wilmore, Williams, NASA astronaut Nick Hague, and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will return to Earth using a capsule that has been docked at the station since September as part of the Crew-9 mission.

NASA said that Wilmore and Williams must remain on the ISS until Crew-10 arrives to ensure enough US astronauts are available for station maintenance.

Wilmore and Williams arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) in June as the first astronauts to test Boeing's Starliner. However, propulsion system malfunctions in space made it too dangerous for them to return on the spacecraft, prompting NASA to arrange their return aboard a SpaceX capsule instead.

Boeing developed Starliner under a $4.5 billion contract with NASA as a competitor to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which has been the agency's primary crew transport vehicle since 2020. The 2023 mission was Starliner's first test flight carrying astronauts—an essential step toward NASA certifying the capsule for regular crewed missions.

However, Starliner's development has faced persistent technical problems and budget overruns since 2019, significantly delaying the program. In contrast, SpaceX's Crew Dragon, developed under a similar NASA contract worth at least $4 billion, has been operational for years and remains the only U.S. spacecraft currently used for ISS crew rotations.

The Pakistan Army on Thursday claimed that it killed 10 militants suspected to be affiliated to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) following a suicide bomb attack near the Frontier Corps camp in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's South Waziristan district, Geo News reported.

According to Pakistan security forces, the militants had tried to attack the Jandola checkpost, with a suicide bomber blowing himself up in a vehicle near the Frontier Corps camp.

Pakistan's interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the nation was standing by the security forces to “eliminate the terrorism from the country"".

The suicide attack comes days after Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants attacked the Jaffar Express, carrying 440 passengers, near the mountainous terrain of Gudalar and Piru Kunri on Tuesday. 

The militants killed 21 passengers and four paramilitary soldiers before the Army eliminated all 33 terrorists on Wednesday.

According to the Global Terrorism Index 2025 report, Pakistan witnessed an alarming 45% increase in terrorism-related deaths, with the total rising from 748 in 2023 to 1,081 in 2024 — one of the steepest surges globally, pushing it to the second spot from its previously fourth position.

The number of attacks attributed to the TTP was at its highest ever on record in 2024, while deaths caused by the group were at their highest level since 2011, it stated.

Meanwhile, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain the most heavily affected provinces — which also share a border with neighbouring Afghanistan — accounted for over 96% of terrorist attacks and deaths in Pakistan in 2024.

On March 6, nine persons were killed and 16 injured as two explosive-laden vehicles rammed into the boundary wall of the main cantonment in Bannu in northwest Pakistan while the army personnel neutralised at least six terrorists.

Concerns about Donald Trump's health have resurfaced once again following a recent incident where he appeared to struggle while reading from a script.

The 78-year-old POTUS sparked discussion after video clips went viral on X, where he called Saint Patrick a “patriot saint.” Trump repeated the incorrect phrase a second time as he delivered remarks at a St. Patrick's Day reception with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin.

Trump lauded Saint Patrick's Cathedral in NYC as “one of THE MOST beautiful cathedrals in the world” and added, “It's a monument not only to God but also to the patron Saint of Ireland,” just before the “patriot saint” blunder.

The US Prez even touted having a strong bond with Martin, stating, “We're always going to have that friendship.”

One X user posted, “Mr. 'I don't need a teleprompter' Donald Trump calls Ireland's patron saint, Saint Patrick, a 'patriot saint' as he struggles with his script. Bro can't read.”

“Every class in elementary had the one kid who would get up for their turn to read ..…and the entire class would sigh in unison because they knew it was about to take 5 minutes for them to get through one sentence. That kid is now president,” another witty user quipped.

One user poked fun at past speculation about Trump's literacy, stating, “Didn't we learn this from the cast of SNL?” Alluding to a claim made by comedian Pete Davidson, who previously suggested that Trump struggled with reading during his appearance on Saturday Night Live.

“Resign demented old man,” another user demanded. “No, because he takes great notes,” one user quipped while sharing a picture of Trump holding a handwritten note on Tesla pricing.

Notably, Trump lapsed during a speech discussing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

When questioned about his remark, he seemed unable to recall making it, responding, “Did I say that? I can't believe I said that.”

Admitting that the company did not do enough to help its four employees when they alleged stalking and abuse, the BBC has issued a “full and unreserved” apology.

Alex Belfield, a former presenter at the BBC Radio Leeds, was jailed in September 2022 on four stalking charges against broadcasters, including Channel 5 host and BBC Radio 2 DJ Jeremy Vine. However, the company admitted that it failed to take enough action when four female employees also suffered abuse at Belfield's hands.

“People who work for the BBC are often in the public eye and under scrutiny however, it is unacceptable for anyone to be the target of sustained abuse in the way that Rozina Breen, Elizabeth Green, Stephanie Hirst and Helen Thomas were over a number of years,” BBC said in a statement.

“The BBC cares deeply about the welfare of its staff and we recognise that before 2019 we simply didn't do enough for these members of staff in understanding the full impact that Alex Belfield's unacceptable behaviour had on them. For that we are deeply sorry and offer a full and unreserved apology,” it added.

Clarifying that the company is now better equipped to handle such complaints and expressing how difficult it can be to be subject to online abuse, BBC said, “Abuse - particularly on social media - presents lots of challenges for employers and we all need to keep learning and implement the best practice on how we can support our staff. That's why the BBC has an online abuse guidance and reporting tool - which today provides all staff with information and support on how to address and combat online abuse. The BBC has also expanded its mental wellbeing resources and strengthened our internal investigative capabilities. We are significantly better equipped to manage these issues now and in the future, but we will never be complacent.”

After the four women - BBC's former head of north Ms Breen, ex-Radio Leeds presenters Green and Hirst, and the director of BBC England Thomas - complained against Belfield, he was found not guilty following a trial at Nottingham Crown Court, says a report by the BBC. However, the judge had issued indefinite restraining orders against Benfield, stopping him from contacting them.

""Each of them suffered a campaign of harassment by email and social media communications. Each of them suffered serious mental health problems arising from Mr Belfield's conduct,"" BBC quoted Justice Saini as saying during the trial.

Later, in 2022, Belfield was convicted of stalking a BBC Radio presenter, Bernard Spedding and videographer, Ben Hewis. He was also convicted of “simple” stalking against Vine and theatre blogger Philip Dehany, the BBC report said.

However, Vine had described the experience as “absolutely Olympic-level stalking, even for broadcasting.""

After the BBC issued the apology, Vine said that it was right for the company to apologise “for its early responses when women at BBC Leeds were targeted by the criminal stalker Alex Belfield.” He also said that the women were asked to “ignore and delete” thousands of abusive emails, resulting in losing incriminating material, which could have added to Belfield's five-and-a-half-year sentence.

“The BBC began to take the case seriously only when Tony Hall and Tim Davie took charge. I hope this statement from the BBC (and any compensation) helps these four survivors put this awful case behind them,” Vine said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will probably agree to eventual truce terms with Ukraine but wants his own conditions met beforehand, likely dragging out the negotiations. 

The Russian leader wants to make sure his stipulations are taken into account before agreeing to a ceasefire, according to a person familiar with the Kremlin's thinking. 

To achieve that, he'll try to stretch out the timeline for agreeing to any halt to fighting in Ukraine, other people with knowledge of the situation said. 

Russian officials hadn't discussed with their US counterparts the specific deal that a Ukrainian delegation agreed to in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah on Tuesday, and the Kremlin finds that framework unacceptable, one person said.

The agreement between US and Ukrainian officials presents a dilemma for Putin, who has so far escaped the type of high-pressure campaign the White House had waged against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Still, the outline of the deal reached in Jeddah doesn't do what Russia has previously said it needs in order to halt the fighting — address the parameters of a more long-term settlement to the war Putin started in February 2022. 

The Kremlin also might demand a halt to weapons supplies to Ukraine as a condition for the ceasefire, one of the people close to the Kremlin said. 

“Putin won't give a hard ‘yes' or a hard ‘no,'” Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said in a phone interview. “Even in a fantastic situation where Putin makes some gestures toward a truce, it would still be a temporary one and with very harsh conditions.” 

Russia has previously demanded that Ukraine become a neutral nation, significantly reduce the size of its armed forces and cede territory, starting with the land Russia has seized in the war. 

In return for Ukraine's acceptance of the US truce proposal, the Trump administration agreed to lift a freeze on military aid and intelligence for Kyiv.

President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Wednesday that he hoped it wouldn't be necessary to pressure Putin to accept the ceasefire deal. 

“People are going to Russia right now as we speak, and hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia,” Trump said. “And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath done.” 

US envoy Steve Witkoff “is making his way to Moscow this week” to “urge the Russians to sign on to this negotiation, and we hope that they will,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Moscow was waiting for details of the agreement but didn't rule out a phone call between the two leaders. 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged Moscow to accept the terms in comments on Wednesday and said Ukraine's ability to deter Russia in the future would be part of the conversation. 

“There's different ways to construct a deterrent on the ground,” he told reporters in a press conference at Shannon Airport, Ireland, on Wednesday. “How that looks, and how that's put together, that's what we're going to talk about.” 

Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that Ukraine's partners will need to help monitor any ceasefire if Russia eventually comes on board.

“It's clear for us how to monitor it,” he told reporters in Kyiv. “But given it's silence everywhere — and realizing who we are dealing with — and having the experience of past years, technical assistance is required.”

Putin has repeatedly brushed aside Trump's bid for a quick halt to the war. During his annual news conference in December, he said: “We don't need a truce — we need peace: long-term, durable, with guarantees for the Russian Federation and its citizens.”

Putin's forces continued their major offensive to drive Ukraine out of Russia's Kursk region, which Zelenskiy had hoped to use as a bargaining chip in any peace talks.

Trump has continued to say he believes Putin wants peace. Washington could potentially offer Putin a summit meeting with Trump in exchange for signing onto the accord, bringing him in from the cold after former President Joe Biden's administration eschewed most contact with their counterparts in Moscow. 

Western security officials say that Putin has been deliberately making maximalist demands because he knows they will be unacceptable to Ukraine and Europe, and that he's ready to continue fighting, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. Meanwhile, defense ministers from European military powers France, Italy, Poland, the UK and Germany, were set to gather in Paris on Wednesday to coordinate on support for Kyiv. 

Rubio said he assumed Russia would raise the issue of European sanctions during their talks with US counterparts. “I think the issue of European sanctions will be on the table, not to mention the frozen assets and the like,” he said.

If there's going to be peace in Ukraine, at the end of the process “there's going to have to be some decision made by the Europeans on what they do on these sanctions,” he said.

Authorities intensified their search for Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student originally from India who went missing earlier this month while on a spring break trip to the Dominican Republic with five others. Both the Dominican police and the FBI are involved in the investigation.

Konanki was last seen on March 6 during a power outage at the Riu República Hotel in Punta Cana, a popular beach resort town. Dominican police have been re-interviewing individuals who were with her in the early hours of that morning at the beach in front of the hotel.

The hotel said that her disappearance coincided with the power outage, which led several guests to head toward the beach.

What are the facts about her disappearance?Sudiksha Konanki disappeared before dawn at a beach near her hotel after she and other guests went outside during a power outage, according to authorities, quoted by Associated Press. Her family said that she left her phone and wallet with friends, despite always carrying her phone. Konanki and five other female students arrived in the Dominican Republic on March 3. Dominican President Luis Abinader addressed the situation during his weekly press briefing, saying, “We are concerned,” and that “all government agencies are searching.” He also mentioned the latest information from a witness, stating, “What he says, according to the reports, is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.”

Abinader defended the country's tourism safety, highlighting that over 11 million visitors travel there annually with minimal incidents.

Meanwhile, civil defence director Juan Salas dismissed media reports claiming that Konanki's clothes had been found, telling El Nuevo Diario that the reports were false.

Where does the investigation stand?Dominican police have been reinterviewing individuals who were with Sudiksha Konanki before her disappearance. Investigators are using drones, helicopters, and detection dogs to search the waters off the island's east coast. On Monday, Dominican President Abinader said that the last person with Konanki reported that a wave crashed into them while they were on the beach. Meanwhile, civil defence director Salas confirmed that investigators have not found any of her clothing.

Sudiksha Konanki, a US permanent resident of Indian origin, lives in Chantilly, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, DC. Her parents, Subbarayudu and Sreedevi Konanki, have called for a broader investigation into her disappearance.

Meanwhile, University of Pittsburgh officials stated that they have been in touch with the Konanki family and authorities in Virginia, offering their support in the search efforts.

Cops have named person of interest in the case of Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing while on a spring break holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Loudoun County, Virginia Sheriff's Office spokesperson Thomas Julia told Fox News Digital that 24-year-old Joshua Ribe is a “person of interest” in Konanki's disappearance.

Julia said that Riibe “has been interviewed at length,” but added it's “still a missing person case, not a criminal case.” Ribe has not been accused of any crime at this time.

“Sheriff [Michael] Chapman wants to make sure the investigation is comprehensive and includes all possible assets and techniques,” Julia said. “We are working closely with the FBI on all of this, and they are working with the Dominican National Police.”

Riibe, a tourist from Iowa, was reportedly the last person to see Konanki alive. Konanki was last spotted at the Riu Republica Resort beach on March 6 around 4:50 am.

A fellow guest at the Caribbean resort from tiny Rock Rapids, Riibe gave three versions to the police of what led to Konanki's disappearance. He suggested that he passed out drunk on the beach, and when he woke up, Konanki had vanished.

Riibe first told police that he threw up from the rough surf and went back to shore, but also asked Konanki if she was ok. He said in the second version that he felt sick to his stomach and left the water, and last saw Konanki in knee-deep water in the surf before he passed out. In the final version, he said he saw Konanki walking along the shore before he fell asleep.

Riibe is cooperating with authorities, police said. Dominican President Luis Abinader said Riibe's accounts have been worrying authorities. “We are concerned,” he said Monday, March 10, during his weekly meeting with the press. “All government agencies are searching … because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.”

Meanwhile, Sheriff Mike Chapman of Konanki's hometown in Loudoun County, Virginia, told NewsNation on Monday, March 10, it is “way too premature” to assume the missing student drowned. “There was some speculation that she may have drowned. I think it's way too premature to make an assumption like that,” Chapman said.

Of Riibe's varying statements, Chapman said, “We're trying to get some consistency with the statements here … if you give inconsistent statements, that means you're not telling the truth. What we gotta do is get the facts here.”

At the time Konanki disappeared, she was likely on the beach because of a power outage at her Dominican Republic resort. The outage may have disabled some security systems and cameras, as per reports. Dominican Today reported that the power at Riu República Hotel went out in the early hours of March 6. Each area being off-limits at night, it would often be left unsupervised. The power outage disrupted lighting, security systems and surveillance cameras.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that his country agrees with the US proposals for a ceasefire in Ukraine. However, any ceasefire would have to deal with the root causes of the conflict, he added.

Putin said many details need to be sorted out before advancing further in talks.

""We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities,"" Putin told reporters at a news conference in the Kremlin.

He, however, said the ceasefire should eliminate the original cause of the crisis.

""But we proceed from the fact that this cessation should be such that it would lead to long-term peace and would eliminate the original causes of this crisis,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters.

Ukraine and Russia have been fighting a protracted war since 2022 when Putin sent tens of thousands of troops inside the country, triggering the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.

Russian forces have been advancing since mid-2024 and control nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory, three years into a war that US President Donald Trump has said he will stop.

Trump had said in the White House on Wednesday that he hoped the Kremlin would agree to the U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine said it would support.

Putin thanked Trump for his efforts to end the war.

""The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,"" Putin said. ""But there are issues that we need to discuss. And I think we need to talk to our American colleagues as well.""

Putin said he might call Trump to discuss the issue. ""We support the idea of ending this conflict by peaceful means.""

The upcoming March 13-14 total lunar eclipse is expected to be spectacular, if the weather allows it to be. The ‘Blood Moon' total lunar eclipse will be the first to grace Earth's skies since 2022. Unless clouds interfere, it will be visible to people in the lower 48 states and greater Americas.

A lunar eclipse lasts for a very long time and is visible to hundreds of millions of people, unlike a total lunar eclipse, which lasts for just minutes and occurs over a narrow band of Earth. During the upcoming eclipse, totality will last for 65 minutes, during which the entirety of the moon will turn reddish and rusty colours.

""It's a wider window. The whole country gets to see it, weather permitting,"" Bob Larson, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, told Mashable.

For those who wish to know where to watch the upcoming total lunar eclipse in the US, here is a detailed schedule:

Here's when the lunar eclipse will occur for US states observing EDT (Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia):

The mother of OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji has shared a photo of her son getting dinner on the day he died. Sharing the CCTV grab on X, Poornima Ramarao said it was from the liaison office of the San Francisco apartment building where Balaji lived.

Ramarao alleged that the office of the chief medical examiner (OCME) saw this video and still claimed that her son, 26, was depressed, and ruled that his death was a suicide. “Suchir's picture on the day of his death at 7.30 pm , getting dinner. This is from CCTV footage,” Ramarao wrote. “OCME saw this video and still concluded he was depressed and called it suicide.”

She added, “Another cover by OCME: they stated to our attorney that GHB is endogenous 3 days after death. But we found out that level of endogenous GHB is less than 5000ng/L. A line in autopsy report says that toxicology report will include GHB only if it is more than 50000 Ng/L. Combined with alcohol this is a sedative. With this combination he will be losing muscle control or possibly unconscious. We are waiting for toxicologist to give a written report.”

According to Alcohol and Drug Foundation, “GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate) is a depressant drug, which means it slows down messages travelling between the brain and body.”

Ramarao followed the image with another post, where she claimed that the “murder conspiracy” was “executed over long term planning.” She added that several CCTV cameras near where Balaji lived stopped working before his death.

“One more suspensions finding CCTV in garage of Suchir's apartment and neighbors stopped working. One of the elevator CCTV also stopped working. This m*rder conspiracy is executed over long term planning and watching Suchir,” Ramarao wrote.

Ramarao also shared a post by X user Mia Stretch, which claimed Balaji was “not depressed—utterly the opposite!” “Suchir DID NOT Take his own Life!” the post said.

It added, “He was a fearless force, brimming with fierce determination, unshakable joy, and a blazing vigor, pouring every ounce of his radiant spirit into a relentless pursuit of justice.”

Ramarao previously dismissed the findings of the final autopsy report after the San Francisco County Medical Examiner ruled Balaji's death a suicide. “There are tons of inconsistencies in their decision. Under lying assumptions are not supporting the facts in reports. We continue our investigation,” Ramarao said at the time.

A coalition of Democratic-led states have filed a federal lawsuit to challenge the Donald Trump administration's layoffs across the Education Department, calling it an “illegal dismantling” of an agency created by Congress.

According to an AP report, 20 states and Washington, DC in a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts, said that the layoffs are so severe that the department “can no longer function, and cannot comply with its statutory requirements.”

The federal lawsuit filed by the states alleges that the job cuts will result in a “loss or delay of federal money” for public schools, and will leave the agency unable to administer college financial aid or enforce civil rights laws at schools, among other disruptions.

Earlier, the Education Department insisted that it will continue to deliver on its statutory obligations, despite the cuts, the AP report added.

Some department employees left through buyout offers and the termination of probationary employees. After a layoff of 1,300 people announced Tuesday, the department will sit at roughly half the 4,100 it had when Trump took office. 

Trump has repeatedly said he wants the agency shut down, calling it wasteful and “overly influenced by liberal thinking”.

The suit says only Congress has the power to close the department or dismantle its core work.

New York Attorney General Letitia James told AP the cuts will impair necessary services for students and families.

“This outrageous effort to leave students behind and deprive them of a quality education is reckless and illegal. Today I am taking action to stop the madness and protect our schools and the students who depend on them,” James said.

Google is stepping up its security game, reinforcing the Play Store's defences as the risks of sideloading apps continue to grow. “Chrome users are protected against the identified malicious URLs by Google Safe Browsing. Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play,” Google told Forbes.

Earlier this month, Google cracked down on fake apps lurking in its Play Store, but a new threat has emerged—what if the Play Store itself is fake?

“Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, even when apps come from sources outside of Play,” Google assured.

Industry-favourite malware detector CTM360 reveals a massive campaign tricking users into downloading malware through counterfeit Play Store websites. These sites closely mimic Google's official platform, making it easy for unsuspecting users to fall into the trap.

People are baited to fraudulent pages through social media ads and messages which insist they download apps that appear to be free or even offer exclusive deals. These apps seem legitimate, but in fact, they are carriers of Trojan malware meant to steal the data of users.

CTM360 has discovered over 6,000 such fake Play Store pages. The malware isn't just stealing banking credentials—it's monitoring clipboard activity, logging keystrokes, and allowing attackers to exploit victims' data for further malicious activities. 

Dubbed ‘PlayPraetor', the campaign takes its name from Roman officials who wielded control over citizens, much like how this Trojan hijacks infected devices, extracting personal data such as login credentials and clipboard information. The scammers have even registered domain names that resemble official websites to make their ruse more convincing. Some sites go a step further, mimicking government agencies and public service portals to increase the chances of success. When users click the fake Play Store download button, they unknowingly install the Trojan.

They disguise the malicious apps themselves, giving them the same icons and the same names as legitimate apps. Like with many other attacks like these, these fake apps abuse permissions, especially Android's Accessibility Services, which, in this case, allows them to literally hijack a device. It includes capturing screen content, capturing keystrokes to steal login details or private keys and monitoring continuous clipboard items to scoop cryptocurrency addresses or passwords.

The tariffs that President Trump has imposed on Canada, Mexico and China, has not only resulted in the beginning of trade wars, but are also leading to a ""Boycott USA"" global consumer backlash against US goods.

In the past seven days, ""Boycott USA"" has spiked on Google with European countries and Canada topping the list. Moreover, multiple countries also have dedicated Facebook groups for boycotting US products.

Trump's plans to take over Denmark's semi-autonomous territory Greenland is also one of the reasons for this resistance. The Facebook group from Denmark has about 73,000 members and has the second-highest number of searches after Luxembourg.

Sweden is the fourth-biggest ""Boycott USA"" search region on Google, with 80,000 members, and their Facebook page boasts of the platform being the ""best weapon"" in the drive against US goods.

Meanwhile, France has a ""BOYCOTT USA: Buy French and European!"" page that is ranked at number 3 on Google and has 20,000 members.

Canada, the closest ally of the US, is also a frontrunner in the Boycott USA development, ranking at number 5 on Google for ""Boycott USA"" searches. There are ""Canada is not for sale"" hats everywhere with Ontario Premier Doug Ford among the ones wearing it. The latter even cancelled a $100 million contract with Elon Musk's Starlink.

Several Canadian provinces have also pulled American-made alcohol from store shelves. Lawson Whiting, CEO of Brown-Forman, the company behind Jack Daniel's, has denounced the Canadian retaliation, calling it ""worse than tariffs"" and ""disproportionate"" to the US levies.

""I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves,"" Whiting said.

Per a survey last month, conducted on 3,310 people, 98 per cent say they're looking for ""Made in Canada"" when they peruse the aisles.

The U.S. Travel Association has warned that a 10% drop in travel due to the lack of Canadians taking trips could result in ""$2.1 billion in lost spending and 14,000 job losses."" The number of Canadians taking road trips fell 23% last month, compared to the previous year.

Moreover, Musk's Tesla has seen major drops throughout the world. In Germany where Musk is supporting a far-right political party, sales fell almost 70% compared to January last year. Per Time magazine, Tesla sold 7,517 vehicles in Europe in January, half of what it sold in January the year prior. Tesla saw a 50% drop in sales in Portugal and 45% in France according to Reuters, while sales fell 42% in Sweden and 48% in Norway.

Trump also said on Truth Social this week ""Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla."" ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday warned his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, of ""devastating"" sanctions if Moscow refused a deal on a ceasefire in the Ukraine war.

Speaking after a meeting with Ireland Prime Minister Micheal Martin at the White House, Trump said that US negotiators are headed to Russia ""right now"" for talks on a possible ceasefire with Ukraine, a day after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day truce. He, however, did not give details.

The White House later said that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was going to Moscow later this week.

""We could do things very bad for Russia. It would be devastating for Russia. But I don't want to do that because I want to see peace, and we're getting close to maybe getting something done,"" Trump told reporters.

""People are going to Russia right now as we speak. And hopefully, we can get a ceasefire from Russia. And if we do, I think that would be 80 percent of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished,"" he said while speaking about the three-year war.

Trump's warning came two weeks after his explosive spat with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House over the US's stance on the war.

He later also halted military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine but resumed after Kyiv agreed to the truce proposal on Tuesday.

After US and Ukrainian officials concluded talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Volodymyr Zelensky backed the ceasefire proposal but said that Washington needed to persuade Russia to accept it.

""Ukraine welcomes this proposal, we consider it positive, we are ready to take such a step. The United States of America has to convince Russia to do this,"" he said.

""So we agree, and if the Russians agree, the ceasefire will work at that very moment,"" the Ukrainian leader added.

Later, he told reporters that Ukrainians had no confidence that fighting would stop. ""I have emphasized this many times: none of us trust the Russians.""

""Everything depends on whether Russia wants a ceasefire and silence, or it wants to continue killing people,"" he added.

The south-western province of Balochistan remains one of Pakistan's biggest security headaches after many decades of an armed rebellion seeking independence for the mineral-rich region. The latest in a series of bloodshed is a train hijack by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the strongest rebel group active in the region bordering Iran and Afghanistan.

On the afternoon of March 11, armed attackers blew up railway tracks to stop Jaffar Express, which was on a 30-hour journey from Quetta to Peshawar with over 400 passengers. It was Ramzan, and civilians and officials were heading home ahead of Eid. The train halted in a tunnel in a remote area, prompting an overnight gunfight with the forces amid fears of suicide bombers guarding the hostages.





The rebels sought the release of Baloch political prisoners and civilians allegedly kidnapped by the state forces, threatening to blow up the entire train if their demand was not fulfilled within 48 hours. The siege lasted not more than 30 hours, with Pakistani forces killing 33 rebels and rescuing the hostages. At least 21 passengers and four security personnel were also killed during the siege.

The hijacking marks a new episode in the Baloch movement, which has been raging since Pakistan gained independence and was carved out of a unified India. At the root of the rebellion is a betrayal by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, despite accepting the autonomy of one of the princely states that didn't want to merge with them.

Balochistan, Pakistan's largest and the most sparsely populated province, had always harboured dreams of being independent.

The British used the region as a base to protect its colonial interests from expansionist forces like Russia. But facing a robust resistance, they adopted a non-interference policy in the nineteenth century, according to a research journal by the University of Balochistan.

But the scenario changed after Pakistan arm-twisted Baloch leaders to merge with them after India's Partition. This didn't go down well with the natives and triggered an even more aggressive campaign to realise their dream of an independent Balochistan.

Baloch now allege exploitation of resources and marginalisation, which has fuelled ethnic discontent and severe anger against the Pakistan government.

Balochistan is mostly arid but is rich with minerals and resources. Reko Diq and Saindak, both in its Chaghi district, have major gold and copper deposits. The province also has iron ore, lead, zinc, and coal deposits. Baloch claim the government is exploiting these resources, which belong to the native population.

Several armed groups like the BLA and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) are at the forefront of this resistance.

The fallout has been targeted attacks on Pakistan's security forces and establishments, and infrastructure, especially those funded by the Chinese, like CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor). China also manages Gwadar port, a deep-water port central to the CPEC.

The Baloch realise instability would cause panic among the Chinese and believe they would pressure Pakistan into accepting their demands. A lack of local inclusion and exploitation has added to their anger. The conflict has worsened over the past few years by human rights abuses. Baloch allege hundreds of forced disappearances of activists and civilians by state forces to suppress their movement.

Balochistan was declared an independent state alongside India and Pakistan. The region comprises four former princely states - Kharan, Makaran, Las Bela, and Kalat. Ahead of Partition, the princely states were given three choices - accede to either India or Pakistan or stay independent. Khan Mir Ahmed Yar Khan - Khan of Kalat - chose the last option while the first three went with Pakistan.

According to historian Dushka H Sayyid, Kalat never held as much importance as Kashmir or Hyderabad since it was in the periphery of the Indian subcontinent, due to which it never featured in large in the contest between India and Pakistan for the accession of princely states at the time of the Partition.

Jinnah too accepted Kalat's independence initially. The Khan trusted Jinnah - that he was a friend and would ensure Kalat's independence.

Kalat declared independence on August 15, 1947, but the British feared it was too risky to allow Kalat to stay independent due to the threat from expansionist regimes. It pressed Pakistan to bring Kalat under its control and this is when Jinnah made a U-turn.

In October 1947, Jinnah advised the Khan to expedite the merger with Pakistan, but he refused.

""Since then the Pakistani authorities not only started a campaign against the 9 Khan to compel him to join Pakistan, but also prepared to use coercive methods for a forced merger of the state,"" writes Taj Mohammad Breseeg in his book 'Baloch Nationalism: Its Origin and Development up to 1980'.

On March 18, 1948, Jinnah announced the accession of Kharan, Makaran, Las Bela, which left Kalat landlocked and with less than half of its landmass. What worsened it for Kalat was a fake news that the Khan wanted to join the Indian dominion, leaving Pakistan furious. With no help from other international players, the Baloch leader was left with no choice but to accede to Pakistan.

The second rebellion came in 1954 when Pakistan launched the One-Unit plan to reorganise its provinces. With the merger of Balochistan States Union with the provinces of West Pakistan in 1955, the feeling of neglect and deprivation grew deeper and became acute, according to Breseeg. In 1958, the Khan of Kalat Nawab Nauroz Khan declared independence, but he was tricked into surrendering in 1959.

In his book 'Inside Baluchistan', Mir Ahmad Yar Khan Baluch quoted Khan as describing the military action: ""I gave myself up to the army which paraded with me on the roads and streets of Kalat. I witnessed several of my men falling dead on the ground by the indiscriminate firing of the army...I shut my eyes in agony, and knew (that) nothing of what happened there till I found myself in the Lahore jail.""

In 1963, came the third rebellion with Sher Muhammad Bijrani Marri, also known as General Sherof, leading a group of nationalists backing their demand for the withdrawal of Pakistani troops, One Unit Plan cancellation, and the restoration of Balochistan as a unified province. It ended in 1969 when General Yahya Khan replaced Field Marshal Ayub Khan as the head of the government and signed a truce. A year later, One Unit Plan was scrapped in West Pakistan and Balochistan was made one of the provinces besides Punjab, Sindh, and Frontier.

In the 1970s, the Baloch were emboldened by the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan and raised demands for greater autonomy. But Zulfikar Ali Bhutto refused, sparking massive protests and forcing the then prime minister to dismiss the Akbar Khan Bugti provincial government in Balochistan in 1973.

Pakistan launched a large-scale operation to suppress the protests, sparking an armed uprising that saw thousands of armed tribesmen fight against the Pakistani troops. This lasted four years until Bhutto was deposed by General Zia-ul-Haq. The Baloch were granted an amnesty and the Pakistani troops were pulled from Balochistan.

The fifth conflict began in the mid-2000s provoked by the rape of a woman doctor in a Baloch town allegedly by military personnel. The conflict has worsened in the past few years with deadly attacks on security personnel and infrastructure projects. But there has been no sign of a Pakistan government agreeing to the Baloch demands.

The struggle continues.

The Jaffar Express, carrying 440 passengers in nine coaches, was going from Quetta to Peshawar when Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) members derailed it using explosives and hijacked it near the mountainous terrain of Gudalar and Piru Kunri in a tunnel 160 kilometres from Quetta on Tuesday.

""Intelligence reports have unequivocally confirmed that the attack was orchestrated and directed by terrorist ring leaders operating from Afghanistan, who were in direct communication with the terrorists throughout the incident,"" the statement read.

""Pakistan expects the Interim Afghan Government to uphold its responsibilities and deny use of its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan,"" it added.

Before the army announcement, the BLA on Wednesday evening said it had killed 50 passengers. It had said on Tuesday that it was holding 214 people, mostly security personnel.

The BLA, the strongest rebel group active in Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, had threatened to start executing hostages unless authorities met its 48-hour deadline for the release of Baloch political prisoners, activists, and missing people it says had been abducted by the military.



The Pakistani security forces took time to complete the operation because the rebels were using the hostages as human shields, Army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmad Sharif said.

""The rescue operation continued periodically, and in the final clearance operation in the evening, all remaining hostages were secured. Since the terrorists were using passengers as human shields, the operation was conducted with extreme precision and caution,"" he told a news channel.

He said that first, snipers killed the suicide bombers and then cleared each train compartment.

He said that no passengers were harmed during the clearance operation.

A video released by the BLA shows its members bombing a section of the railway track and storming the train on Tuesday afternoon.

The 1 minute 23 seconds of the grainy footage shows passengers huddled on the ground, silhouetted against the mountain, with rebels, holding guns, keeping a watch over them.

Passengers freed described walking for hours through mountainous terrain to reach safety.

""I can't find the words to describe how we managed to escape. It was terrifying,"" Muhammad Bilal, who had been travelling with his mother on the Jafar Express train, told news agency AFP.

US Awami League Vice President Dr Rabbi Alam has raised concerns over the current situation in Bangladesh, stating that the country is under attack and urging the international community to intervene. Speaking to the news agency ANI in Kolkata, Alam, a close aide of ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, thanked India for providing the 'alignment' for shelter.

He further thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing a safe travel passage for Sheikh Hasina.

""Bangladesh is under attack, and it needs to be addressed by the international community. A political uprising is fine, but that is not what has been going on in Bangladesh. This is a terrorist uprising... Many of our leaders are sheltered here in India, and we are very thankful to the Indian government for providing the alignment. I also thank PM Narendra Modi for providing a safe travel passage for our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. We are thankful to the people of India,"" he said.

""We want to ask the Bangladesh Advisor to step down and go back to where he came from,"" he added.

Alam exuded confidence in Sheikh Hasina's return as Prime Minister of Bangladesh. He further stated that the country's young generation has made a mistake and has been 'manipulated'.

""... Sheikh Hasina is coming back as the Prime Minister. The young generation has made a mistake, but that's not their fault; they have been manipulated...,"" said Alam.

This week, a court in Dhaka ordered the seizure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Dhanmondi residence, 'Sudasadhan,' and some other properties owned by her family members, who are in exile in India.

An official said that at the same time, the court ordered the seizure of 124 bank accounts belonging to her family.

Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Zakir Hossain Ghalib issued the order on Tuesday following an application by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).

Sheikh Hasina's husband, the late nuclear scientist MA Wazed Miah, was nicknamed Sudha Miah. The house, 'Sudhasadan, was named after him.

In addition to Sheikh Hasina, some other properties have been seized, owned by her son Sajib Wazed Joy, daughter Saima Wazed Putul, sister Sheikh Rehana, and her daughters, Tulip Siddique and Radwan Mujib Siddique.

On February 6, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest with the Indian government over the ""false and fabricated"" comments and statements continuously being made on different platforms, including social media, by the country's former prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, aimed at instigating instability.

Through a protest note handed over to the Acting High Commissioner of India in Dhaka, the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it conveyed the government's deep concern, disappointment, and serious reservation, as such statements are hurting the people's sentiments.

Bangladesh has requested the Government of India to immediately take appropriate measures, in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, to stop Hasina from making such ""false, fabricated and incendiary statements"" using social media and other communications while she is in India, the statement said.

In the month of January, the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) issued an arrest warrant against former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and 10 others, including her former Defence Adviser Major General (retired) Tarique Ahmed Siddique and former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Benazir Ahmed, according to a report by Daily Star. The warrants relate to two cases involving allegations of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.

The orders were issued by the tribunal, led by Justice Md Golam Mortuza Majumdar, following two petitions filed by the prosecution seeking the arrest of the 11 individuals.

On August 5, a student-led movement ousted Bangladesh's Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, after weeks of protests and clashes that killed over 600 people. Hasina, 77, fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.

A US judge on Thursday ordered six federal agencies to rehire thousands of probationary workers fired as part of Donald Trump's push to slash the size of the government.

Judge William Alsup said the justification of ""poor performance"" for mass lay-offs was ""a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements,"" the New York Times reported.

Ruling on a lawsuit brought by employee unions, Alsup ordered the departments of the Treasury, Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy and Interior to reinstate anyone improperly fired.

""It is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie,"" said Alsup at a hearing at the US District Court in San Francisco.

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has taken an axe to the US government, cutting spending programs and firing tens of thousands of federal employees.

His actions have faced pushback from the courts, with several judges issuing injunctions intended to halt them.

The footage was from the liaison office of the San Francisco apartment building where Mr Balaji lived.

The mother of OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji, who was found dead in his San Francisco apartment in November last year, has shared a picture from the day of his death. The picture, taken from a CCTV footage, shows Mr Balaji waiting for an elevator with a brown paper bag in his hand - which is supposedly his dinner, Mr Balaji's mother claimed.

The footage was from the liaison office of the San Francisco apartment building where Mr Balaji lived.

Mr Balaji had turned a whistleblower against OpenAI shortly before his death. He had publicly raised ethical concerns about the AI giant's practices. An initial investigation had concluded that Mr Balaji's death was an act of suicide. However, since then, his family called for an FBI investigation and highlighted several lapses, alleging that their son was murdered. A re-opened investigation and a 13-page report from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) last month yet again concluded that Mr Balaji died by suicide.

Rejecting the report, Mr Balaji's mother said they saw the CCTV footage and still concluded he was ""depressed"".

""Another cover by OCME: they stated to our attorney that GHB is endogenous 3 days after death. But we found out that level of endogenous GHB is less than 5000ng/L. A line in autopsy report says that toxicology report will include GHB only if it is more than 50000 Nguyen's/L. Combined with alcohol this is a sedative. With this combination he will be losing muscle control or possibly unconscious. We are waiting for toxicologist to give a written report,"" she added.

But… pic.twitter.com/HwmZWhnt88

According to Mr Balaji's mother, her son's death is a ""murder conspiracy executed over a long-term planning"" - a claim that she has repeated over the months. She also said that the CCTVs in Mr Balaji's garage, one of the elevators, and neighbouring areas had stopped working.

One more suspensions finding CCTV in garage of Suchir's apartment and neighbors stopped working. One of the elevator CCTV also stopped working. This m*rder conspiracy is executed over long term planning and watching Suchir.

Earlier this year, Ms Rao alleged that OpenAI killed her son to ""hide something they want nobody to know"", adding that Mr Balaji had documents against the ChatGPT maker and knew what they were up to.

""My son had documents against OpenAI. They attacked him and killed him. Some documents were even missing after his death...My son celebrated his birthday a day before he died. What more do we need to give on account that he was in a happy mood?"" she said in an interview with American commentator Tucker Carlson.

A top Kremlin aide on Friday criticised the US-Ukrainian proposal for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, saying it would just be a ""breather"" for the Ukrainian military.

""It would be nothing more than a temporary breather for the Ukrainian military,"" Yuri Ushakov told state media after speaking by phone to US national security advisor Mike Waltz.

He said President Vladimir Putin would ""probably make more specific and substantive assessments"" on Thursday.

Ushakov also said that Russia was aiming for a ""long-term peaceful solution"" that would secure Russia's ""legitimate interests"".

""That is what we are striving for,"" he said.

""Any steps that imitate peaceful action are I believe not needed by anyone in the current situation,"" he said.

US negotiators travelled to Russia on Thursday to present their plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, as Washington pushed Moscow for an ""unconditional"" pause to the three-year conflict.

Russia has presented the US with a list of demands for a deal to end its war against Ukraine and reset relations with Washington, according to two people familiar with the matter.

It is not clear what exactly Moscow included on its list or whether it is willing to engage in peace talks with Kyiv prior to their acceptance. Russian and US officials discussed the terms during in-person and virtual conversations over the last three weeks, the people said.

They described the Kremlin's terms as broad and similar to demands it previously has presented to Ukraine, the US and NATO.

Those earlier terms included no NATO membership for Kyiv, an agreement not to deploy foreign troops in Ukraine and international recognition of President Vladimir Putin's claim that Crimea and four provinces belong to Russia.

Russia, in recent years, also has demanded the US and NATO address what it has called the ""root causes"" of the war, including NATO's eastward expansion.

US President Donald Trump is awaiting word from Putin on whether he will agree to a 30-day truce that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday he would accept as a first step toward peace talks.

Putin's commitment to a potential ceasefire agreement is still uncertain, with details yet to be finalized.

Some US officials, lawmakers and experts fear that Putin, a former KGB officer, would use a truce to intensify what they say is an effort to divide the US, Ukraine and Europe and undermine any talks.

The Russian embassy in Washington and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed this week's meeting in Saudi Arabia between US and Ukrainian officials as constructive, and said a potential 30-day ceasefire with Russia could be used to draft a broader peace deal.

Moscow has raised many of these same demands over the last two decades, some making their way into formal negotiations with the US and Europe.

Most recently, Moscow discussed them with the Biden administration in a series of meetings in late 2021 and early 2022 as tens of thousands of Russian troops sat on Ukraine's border, awaiting the order to invade.

They included demands that would constrain US and NATO military operations from Eastern Europe to Central Asia.

While rejecting some of the terms, the Biden administration sought to forestall the invasion by engaging with Russia on several of them, according to US government documents reviewed by Reuters and multiple former US officials.

The effort failed and Russia attacked on February 24, 2022.

US and Russian officials in recent weeks have said that a draft agreement discussed by Washington, Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul in 2022 could be a starting point for peace talks. The agreement never went through.

In those talks, Russia demanded that Ukraine give up its NATO ambitions and accept a permanent nuclear-free status. It also demanded a veto over actions by countries that wanted to assist Ukraine in the event of war.

The Trump administration has not explained how it is approaching its negotiations with Moscow. The two sides are engaged in two separate conversations: one on resetting US-Russia relations and the other on a Ukraine peace agreement.

The administration appears to be divided on how to proceed.

US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who is helping lead the discussion with Moscow, last month on CNN described the Istanbul talks as ""cogent and substantive negotiations"" and said that they could be ""a guidepost to get a peace deal done.""

But Trump's top Ukraine and Russia envoy, retired General Keith Kellogg, told a Council on Foreign Relations audience last week that he did not see the Istanbul agreement as a starting point.

""I think we have to develop something entirely new,"" he said.

Experts say Russia's demands likely are not only intended to shape an eventual agreement with Ukraine, but also to be the basis of accords with its Western supporters.

Russia has made similar demands of the US over the last two decades - demands that would limit the West's ability to build a stronger military presence in Europe and potentially allow Putin to expand his influence in the continent.

""There's no sign that the Russians are willing to make any concessions,"" said Angela Stent, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was the top US intelligence analyst for Russia and Eurasia. ""The demands haven't changed at all. I think they are not really interested in peace or a meaningful ceasefire.""

In their effort to forestall what US intelligence officials concluded was an imminent Russian invasion, senior Biden administration officials engaged with Russian counterparts on three of the Kremlin's demands, according to the US government documents reviewed by Reuters.

They were a ban on military exercises by US and other NATO forces on the territories of new alliance members and a ban on US intermediate-range missile deployments in Europe or elsewhere within range of Russian territory, according to the documents.

The Russians also sought to bar military exercises by the US or NATO from Eastern Europe to the Caucasus and Central Asia, the documents showed.

""These are the same Russian demands that have been made since 1945,"" said Kori Schake, a former Pentagon official who directs foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. ""With the behavior of the Trump administration in recent weeks, Europeans aren't just scared we're abandoning them, they're afraid we've joined the enemy.""

President Trump couldn't help but laugh as he was momentarily distracted by Mr Vance's crazy-patterned socks.

The discussion on inflation took an amusing turn when Mr Vance's shamrock-patterned socks suddenly caught the president's attention.

Pointing at his deputy's feet, President Trump said, ""I have to just, speak of inflation; I love these socks. What's with these socks?""

I will say when we meet later in the Oval Office, President Trump is a very big fan of conservative dress, so if he notices these socks, you have to defend me in the Oval Office by saying, 'This is an important part of cementing the Irish-American relationship,p and this is the only reason he is wearing these socks.'""

A couple who both worked at a Japanese university have sued the institution, a court said on Thursday, for reportedly allowing only the husband to keep an academic position after they were married.

Despite its highly educated female population, Japan is ranked 118th out of 146 in the 2024 World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap report and women leaders remain rare in Japanese business and politics.

The husband, a law professor, informed the dean at Miyazaki Sangyo-keiei University in southern Japan when they married in July, the Asahi Shimbun and other local media outlets said Wednesday.

However, the dean ""expressed discomfort and told him that the woman's job contract would be suspended at the end of March"", the Asahi said, citing the unidentified couple's lawyer.

The university said there was an unwritten rule that two spouses should not work there because it was a small institution, public broadcaster NHK said.

Miyazaki District Court confirmed the lawsuit was filed against the university and the dean last month.

A spokesman for the university told AFP that there had been ""a grave violation of the rules"" by the couple but declined to comment further, citing privacy concerns.

The couple even chose to file for divorce in an attempt to keep their jobs in the university's law faculty, according to local broadcaster UMK.

Even then the man was demoted to associate professor while the woman, an assistant professor, was made a clerical official, UMK reported.

""I felt I had been demanded to choose between marriage and career,"" the woman said in television footage that did not show her face.

""I'm very sad and quite indignant that the only university in this region that has a law faculty, and that touts recruitment of female students and their career support, can unfairly deprive a female teacher of her job and sense of fulfilment,"" she said.

The couple are seeking the reinstatement of their former positions.

Brazil is facing accusations of hypocrisy after cutting down large sections of the Amazon rainforest to construct a road for the upcoming COP30 climate summit, according to The Telegraph. The highway, designed to accommodate tens of thousands of delegates for the UN climate conference, has raised concerns about the country's commitment to environmental protection.

According to The Telegraph, the Amazon rainforest is credited with absorbing enormous amounts of carbon and hosting extraordinary biodiversity. Locals have said the new road is destroying their livelihoods, while conservationists claimed it would prove a danger to wildlife trying to move through the forest.

According to the BBC, the four-lane highway aims to ease traffic to the city, which will host more than 50,000 people - including world leaders - at the conference in November. The state government touts the highway's ""sustainable"" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact. The Amazon plays a vital role in absorbing carbon for the world and providing biodiversity, and many say this deforestation contradicts the very purpose of a climate summit.

Claudio Verequete lives about 200m from where the road will be. He used to make an income from harvesting acai berries from trees that once occupied the space. ""Everything was destroyed,"" he told BBC. ""Our harvest has already been cut down. We no longer have that income to support our family.""



Meanwhile, the Brazilian president and environment minister say this will be a historic summit because it is ""a COP in the Amazon, not a COP about the Amazon"".

The president says the meeting will provide an opportunity to focus on the needs of the Amazon, show the forest to the world, and present what the federal government has done to protect it.

Olivia Farnsworth, a young girl from the UK, has become a medical marvel due to her rare and unique condition, which causes her to experience no pain, hunger, or fatigue. This condition, believed to be the result of a genetic anomaly in her 6th chromosome, means that Olivia is likely the only person in the world who faces all three challenges simultaneously.

The most concerning aspect of Olivia's condition is her inability to feel pain. This lack of sensation makes it possible for her to injure herself severely without realising it, posing significant risks to her health and well-being. Her family must remain vigilant, closely monitoring her to prevent harm. Furthermore, Olivia does not experience hunger, so her mother ensures that she eats at regular intervals to avoid malnutrition.

Once Olivia was hit and dragged by a car at age seven and walked away without shedding a tear, her mum revealed to YorkshireLive.

""She got run over and dragged down the street by a car, and she didn't complain.

""She was dragged about ten car lengths down the road. It was horrendous; I don't think it's something I will ever get over.

""I was screaming, and all my other children were screaming as she ran out. But Olivia was just like, 'What's going on?' She just got up and started walking back to me.

""The hospital said she's bionic. Because of the impact, she should have had severe injuries.""

Another challenge for Olivia is sleep. Without medication, she cannot fall asleep naturally and can stay awake for up to three days at a time. To combat this, Olivia follows a strict regimen of sleeping aids to manage her sleeplessness, which is one of the most difficult aspects of her daily life.

This extraordinary case has drawn the attention of medical professionals, as it provides insight into the complexities of human biology and the impact of genetic mutations. Olivia's condition remains one of the rarest in the world, and her story has captivated both medical experts and the general public alike.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

New details have emerged in the disappearance of 20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student who vanished on March 6 while on a spring break trip in the Dominican Republic. Law enforcement officials assisting in the investigation revealed to CNN that there were other people on the beach at the Riu Republica Hotel in Punta Cana when Ms Konanki went missing.

Notably, the search for Konanki has entered its seventh day, with authorities from the US, Dominican Republic, and India collaborating on the effort. The Indian-origin student was last seen early on March 6, and her disappearance has sparked a massive search operation by air, sea, and land.

New video evidence has revealed that there were additional people on the beach around the time Ms Konanki went missing, apart from the young man who claimed to have been with her. Investigators are now working to identify these individuals and are urging them to come forward with any information they may have about her disappearance.

Based on the evidence, authorities are now considering the possibility that she may have interacted with others on the beach. Initially, Dominican officials treated Ms Konanki's disappearance as a potential drowning. However, the general prosecutor's office has announced that they are broadening their investigation to include the possibility that her disappearance may have been more than just an accident.

Her disappearance comes nearly two months after a tragic incident at the same location. On January 18, four tourists drowned at the Arena Gorda beach due to strong currents, according to the Dominican Republic's Civil Defence Agency. The agency reported on Facebook that the powerful currents had swept the tourists away, highlighting the hazardous conditions at the beach.

Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student, was reported missing while on spring break in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. According to her father, Konanki had travelled to Punta Cana ahead of her pre-med studies at the University of Pittsburgh, where she majors in chemistry and biological sciences.

A high-achieving student, Ms Konanki graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in 2022 with a diploma in biological sciences. Her family, originally from India, has been living in the United States as permanent residents since 2006.

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has issued a ""full and unreserved apology"" to four former female employees for failing to protect them from constant email abuse by former radio host Alex Belfield.

Rozina Breen, Elizabeth Green, Stephanie Hirst, and Helen Thomas were subjected to online abuse ""over a number of years"", the BBC said in a statement on Wednesday.

The broadcaster acknowledged that it did not do enough before 2019 to help these women and failed to understand ""the full impact that Alex Belfield's unacceptable behaviour had on them.""

""For that, we are deeply sorry and offer a full and unreserved apology,"" the BBC said.

Belfield was convicted and imprisoned on four stalking charges against broadcasters, including Channel 5 host and BBC Radio 2 DJ Jeremy Vine. He was handed a five-and-a-half-year prison sentence in 2022.

The BBC said it cared ""deeply about the welfare of its staff"", adding it has ""strengthened [its] internal investigative capabilities.""

Although the employees are ""often in the public eye and under scrutiny,"" it is ""unacceptable"" for anyone to endure any kind of persistent harassment, BBC said.

All employees have access to guidance and support on how to handle and prevent online abuse through the BBC's ""online abuse guidance and reporting tool,"" it said.

The broadcaster claimed it improved its capacity to initiate internal investigations and increased the staff's access to mental health facilities. They added they were ""significantly better equipped"" to deal with these problems both now and in the future.

After a trial at Nottingham Crown Court, Belfield was found not guilty of stalking charges in relation to the four women. However, the judge mentioned each woman suffered a campaign of ""harassment by email and social media communications ... arising from Mr Belfield's conduct.""

The verdict eventually left the four former employees needing psychological support. Belfield received an indefinite restraining order that forbade him from getting in touch with these women.

In 2022, he was found guilty of stalking BBC Radio host, Bernard Spedding, and videographer Ben Hewis. He was also found guilty of ""simple"" stalking against Vine and theatrical blogger Philip Dehany, BBC reported.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Mercedes Valentine, a 25-year-old neuroscientist-turned-OnlyFans model, suffered a devastating motorcycle crash when she collided with a pigeon. The accident left her with severe physical injuries, including a broken nose, skull, shoulder, and ribs, as well as a smashed eye socket and shattered pelvis. The crash also took a toll on Valentine's mental health, causing memory loss that erased her recollections of the month leading up to and following the accident, the New York Post reported. 

""When I open my eyes, I sometimes don't even recognize myself. Because I function differently and can't remember most things, it's like my brain is someone else's. It's been really confusing and emotionally challenging to come to terms with. I've had to start living, and adapting to doing so, as a different person,"" she told NeedToKnow.

Before the fateful summer of 2024, Ms Valentine's had a thriving career. She had just purchased a lavish house for over $900,000 and a sleek blue Porsche Taycan Turbo for over $100,000. A day before the accident, she was celebrating her parents' 60th birthdays and retirement. When it was time to leave, she opted to ride her motorcycle home instead of joining her family in their car, a decision that forever altered her life.

""I wasn't being clever and was going very fast down a residential street where there was a pigeon on the lamppost above me. As I approached, it swooped down and not knowing what it was at the time, I tried to avoid it. But then it hit me head and I swerved,"" she told the NY Post.

As she swerved to avoid the bird, her motorcycle crashed into a parked car, sending her flying 260 feet through the air. She landed six houses away from the point of impact, following which bystanders rushed to call for emergency assistance. Fortunately, Valentine's family, all of whom are medical professionals, were driving behind her and were able to provide immediate aid.

""I was lying in the road for about two minutes before they arrived. I was blue and not responding, my pupils were dilated and it was assumed I was dead. My dad ultimately saved my life, as he took off my helmet to stop it from choking me and stop the bleeding as best he could,"" she added.

She was then rushed to the hospital, and it was discovered that she lost over three litres of blood from the incident. As per doctors, Ms Valentine faced the possibility of blindness, double vision, and total limb numbness once her physical wounds healed. Additionally, she suffered from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a condition that weakens joints and bones.

When Valentine finally regained consciousness a week after the accident, she could only recall her boyfriend's name, Mark, and her family members. Everything else, including the accident itself, was a complete blank. After a month-long hospital stay, she was finally discharged and returned home, eager to resume her life. However, it was only then that the full extent of her memory loss became clear. 

""It was shocking and traumatizing. I'd be at the gym, and someone would say hello and I'd have no clue who they were. I quickly had to come to terms with the fact that my memory was never coming back. Time is completely warped to me now. I forget what day or month it is regularly. My boyfriend has to give me a run every day of what I've got on, otherwise, I'd forget,"" she shared. 

As she attempts to revive her content creation, she's faced with insensitive comments about her appearance, specifically her bruised eye and scars. Despite the challenges, Valentine has taken responsibility for the accident, acknowledging that greater caution could have prevented it. She's using her experience to caution fellow bike riders, stressing the importance of situational awareness, knowing one's limits, and always wearing a helmet because it ultimately saved her life.

Gold soared to a record high Thursday as US president Donald Trump threatened to impose huge tariffs on champagne, wine and other alcoholic products from European Union countries.

The fresh threats added to global trade uncertainty pushing gold, seen as a safe-haven investment, to an all-time high of $2,971 per ounce in afternoon deals, surpassing its late February record.

Barack and Michelle Obama are in talks to produce a new biopic about golf superstar Tiger Woods, a source familiar with the negotiations told AFP Wednesday.

The movie is in development at Amazon MGM, according to Hollywood trade outlet Deadline, which first reported on the project.

The studio had purchased the rights to ""The Tiger Slam: The Inside Story of the Greatest Golf Ever Played,"" Kevin Cook's book on how Woods became the first golfer to be reigning champion at all four majors simultaneously, in 2000-01.

Reinaldo Marcus Green, the filmmaker behind ""King Richard"" -- which told the story of the childhoods of tennis greats Venus and Serena Williams and their coach father Richard -- is attached to direct, Deadline said.

That film earned Will Smith the best actor Oscar -- an accolade infamously overshadowed when he struck comedian Chris Rock on stage during the 2022 Academy Awards gala, just minutes before winning the golden statuette.

The former US president and first lady run Higher Ground Productions, which has produced the Oscar-winning documentary ""American Factory"" and Netflix hit thriller ""Leave the World Behind,"" as well as TV shows and podcasts.

Woods is one of golf's all-time superstars.

He became the first Black player to win a major title when he captured the 1997 Masters in record fashion.

The film is set to focus on perhaps his greatest achievement, popularly known as the ""Tiger Slam,"" when Woods won the 2000 US and British Opens and PGA Championship, and then added the 2001 Masters to capture four major trophies in a row.

The movie is not expected to tackle Woods' subsequent self-inflicted downfall that began with a car crash near his home In November 2009, which led to the exposure of a slew of extramarital affairs and the collapse of his marriage.

The most recent of Woods' 15 major wins -- second only to Jack Nicklaus with 18 -- came at the 2019 Masters.

He announced Tuesday that he has suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon, in the latest injury blow to his roller-coaster career.

Australia's interior minister said on Thursday his department was reviewing the visa status of an American influencer who uploaded a video of her grabbing a baby wombat in an incident that has caused outrage in the country.

Sam Jones, who describes herself as an ""outdoor enthusiast and hunter"", posted a now-deleted video to her 92,000 followers on Instagram taken in an unknown location in Australia.

It shows her picking up the baby wombat, a protected species of marsupial found only in Australia, that is seen struggling and heard hissing as its mother follows on the road behind. The woman later places the wombat back on the road.

Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement his department was reviewing the conditions of Jones' current visa and determining whether immigration law had been breached.

""Given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again, I'll be surprised if she even bothers,"" he said.

""I can't wait for Australia to see the back of this individual, I don't expect she will return.""

Jones could not be reached for comment. Her Instagram account has since been set to private and it was not clear if she remained in the country.

Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the video was distressing.

""It looked pretty dreadful, didn't it?"" she said in an interview with Channel Seven on Thursday.

""Really, leave the wombat alone.""

Stargazers in North and South America will be able to view a red-colored ""Blood Moon"" starting Thursday night in the first total lunar eclipse visible on the continents since 2022.

The celestial event, observable with the naked eye, will have more than an hour of totality and can additionally be seen in parts of western Europe and Africa, as well as New Zealand.

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth goes between the Moon and the Sun, casting the Earth's shadow on the Moon.

A rare total lunar eclipse involves the Earth's umbra, the darkest part of the planet's shadow, covering the Moon.

According to NASA, this type of eclipse can also be called a ""Blood Moon"" due to the reddish-orange color the Moon can become during totality.



The coloration occurs due to sunlight scattering through the Earth's atmosphere before reaching the Moon's surface -- shorter wavelengths like blue and violet fail to reach the Moon, leaving only longer wavelengths such as red and orange to illuminate it.

As a result, the more items there are in the Earth's atmosphere -- such as clouds or dust -- the redder the Moon will appear during the eclipse.

""Keep a close eye on the weather forecast leading up to the eclipse,"" said NASA Chief Scientist Renee Weber in a statement. ""That totality will last for close to an hour, so even if it's cloudy you may still be able to glimpse it if the clouds are scattered.""

The timing of totality occurs simultaneously across time zones, and is expected to begin at 2:26 am Friday for those in Eastern Daylight Time and 11:26 pm Thursday in Pacific Daylight Time.

For about an hour both before and after totality, the moon will also be obscured in a partial eclipse.

Miami Beach mayor also proposes withdrawing grant after O Cinema screened Palestinian-focused documentary

The mayor of Miami Beach is attempting to evict an independent cinema from city-owned property after it screened No Other Land, the film about Palestinian displacement in the West Bank that just won the Oscar for best documentary.

Steven Meiner's proposal would terminate O Cinema's lease and withdraw $40,000 in promised grant funding. In a newsletter sent to residents on Tuesday, Meiner condemned the film as “a false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents”.

Meiner had previously urged the O Cinema to cancel scheduled screenings of the documentary, citing criticism from Israeli and German officials. According to the mayor's newsletter, O Cinema's CEO, Vivian Marthell, allegedly agreed to withdraw the film from programming, citing “concerns of antisemitic rhetoric”, but Meiner claimed she reversed her decision the following day. The screenings sold out and the cinema added additional dates in March.

“Our decision to screen NO OTHER LAND is not a declaration of political alignment. It is, however, a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard,” Marthell told the Miami Herald.

The documentary, which won the Academy Award for best documentary feature last week, follows the destruction of Palestinian villages in the occupied West Bank and chronicles the unlikely friendship between a Palestinian activist, Basel Adra, and Israeli journalist, Yuval Abraham, who co-directed the film.

Tensions over free speech and Palestinian activism nationwide have been further heightened this week after Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia student activist and green-card holder who helped lead the Palestinian solidarity movement during the college encampments last year, was detained by immigration authorities. The US president, Donald Trump, has alleged without evidence that Khalil has links to “pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity”.

A White House official told the Free Press that Khalil, who was arrested without charge, poses a “threat to the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States” and the “allegation here is not that he was breaking the law”.

A recent Gallup poll shows support for Israel has plummeted to a 25-year low, while Palestinian sympathy has surged.

Kristen Rosen Gonzalez, a Miami Beach commissioner, said she shared the mayor's negative assessment of the film but cautioned against a “kneejerk reaction” that could trigger “costly legal battles”, and noted O Cinema's “longstanding commitment to the Jewish community”.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida has called the mayor's retaliation against O Cinema unconstitutional. “The government does not get to pick and choose which viewpoints the public is allowed to hear, however controversial some might find them,” Daniel Tilley, the branch's legal director, told Axios.

Free speech advocates are also mobilizing against what they see as dangerous government overreach targeting constitutional rights.

“Screening movies to make sure they conform to local censors' tastes is a practice we left behind with the red scare,” said Adam Steinbaugh, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire).

“If the first amendment doesn't mean that a movie theater can show an Oscar-winning film, something is seriously wrong.”

Miami Beach has faced past controversy over artistic expression in 2019, when the city removed a portrait of Raymond Herisse, a Black man fatally shot by Beach police, from a city art project.

The mayor's proposal to cancel the cinema's lease is set for a commission vote next Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Federal judge Tanya Chutkan issues restraining order pending new filings over billions in axed research grants

A federal judge considering the Trump administration's abrupt cancellation of climate research grants worth billions of dollars told government lawyers they had to produce “some kind of evidence” of wrongdoing to back up such drastic actions.

Climate United, which coordinates investment in clean energy projects, sued to seek access to $7bn that was frozen before it was cancelled on Tuesday night by Lee Zeldin, the New York Republican congressman turned administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

In US district court in Washington on Wednesday, Judge Tanya Chutkan asked lawyers for the EPA: “Can you proffer any evidence that [the grant] was illegal, or evidence of abuse or fraud or bribery – that any of that was improperly or unlawfully done, other than the fact that Mr Zeldin doesn't like it?”

Marc Sacks, a government lawyer, said: “The determination is based on the information contained in the termination letter.”

Chutkan said: “That's pretty circular,” then asked if Climate United had violated federal regulations.

Sacks said: “I think the agency cited both of those regulations within their termination letter.”

Chutkan said: “I can cite cases all day long, but you have to have some kind of evidence or proffer to back it up.”

She also said: “You can't even tell me what the evidence of malfeasance is.”

There is plentiful evidence that Zeldin is implementing an assault on attempts to tackle the climate crisis. The EPA issued a slew of rollbacks of rules to combat pollution on Wednesday.

Zeldin said he was “driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America's Golden Age”.

Climate groups reacted with horror.

Jason Rylander, legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute, told the Guardian: “Come hell or high water, raging fires and deadly heatwaves, Trump and his cronies are bent on putting polluter profits ahead of people's lives. This move won't stand up in court. We're going to fight it every step of the way.”

Climate United is not the only group to have sued over access to grants. In New York, the Coalition for Green Capital has sued over the cancellation of a $5bn grant, an act it called “patently and plainly unlawful on its face” and “arbitrary and pretextual”.

In Washington, lawyers for Climate United argued that the EPA had not followed the law, meaning Chutkan could rule on the matter. Lawyers for the government said it was a contract dispute, so she could not.

Chutkan said: “The government didn't decide who it wanted to contract with. A new administration came in, didn't like the contract any more. That's what new administrations do. But there are procedures that have to be followed. And it doesn't appear, at least on the record before me, that those procedures have been followed.”

The hearing ended without Chutkan issuing a ruling or temporary restraining order, but asking both sides to make new filings by Monday evening: Climate United to amend its lawsuit and the government to provide information about alleged wrongdoing.

“I don't have the credible evidence that's required,” Chutkan said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Parts of Los Angeles hit by January blazes under evacuation warnings as west coast braces for heavy rain and snow

The US west coast is facing an atmospheric river event threatening flooding and power outages due to heavy rain and snow, with more than 20 million people in southern California under flood watches.

Evacuation warnings were issued by fire officials in the Pacific Palisades, Altadena and Pasadena areas, which were affected by the Palisades and Eaton fires in January.

“While we prepare for another storm headed towards LA, I want to urge Angelenos to stay vigilant, especially in burn scar areas,” the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, said in a statement. “My number one job is to keep Angelenos safe, so please heed all evacuation warnings, stay vigilant and stay informed.”

Los Angeles mountain ranges are under a wind advisory until Thursday night. A flood advisory is in effect in Los Angeles until 6am PT, while a level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles.

A special weather advisory was in effect for Los Angeles, Long Beach and east Los Angeles until 3.45am PT. In Orange county, a flash flood warning is in effect until 7.30am PT.

The National Weather Service said a tornado had moved through the Pico Rivera area on Thursday morning.

State agencies have deployed more than 400 personnel to prepare to respond to the storm at the direction of the California governor, Gavin Newsom. “In Altadena and the Palisades, we're continuing our months-long efforts to protect against potential debris flows,” Newsom stated on social media.

The California governor's office of emergency services explained in areas burned by intense wildfires, the soil can develop a layer that repels water rather than absorb water, resulting in significantly less rain to produce a flash flood. The lack of vegetation and plants that hold soil in place also increases the risk of mudslides and debris flow, especially on and around steep terrain.

“Those living near recent brush fires should be aware of the extreme danger possible from debris flows,” a Los Angeles fire department spokesperson said in a statement.

“When rainstorms impact the Los Angeles area, storm drains, canyons, arroyos and other sloped or low-lying areas can quickly fill with fast-moving water and debris, creating a life-threatening danger.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Cases of highly contagious disease that has killed two reported in Pennsylvania, California and Oklahoma

The measles outbreak continues to spread in areas of west Texas and New Mexico and has now reached several other states, including Pennsylvania, California and Oklahoma.

So far in 2025, more than 250 measles cases have been reported across multiple states, resulting in two confirmed deaths, including that of an unvaccinated child – the first death from measles in the US in a decade.

This comes as Robert F Kennedy Jr, the top US health official, continued to sow mistrust about vaccines this week, claiming in an interview on Fox News that, among other things, the measles vaccine “causes all the illnesses that measles itself cause[s]”. These comments arose despite research showing that the side-effects of the measles vaccine are far less serious than those associated with the virus itself.

Measles is one of the most contagious human diseases and can lead to life-threatening complications. The most effective way to protect against measles is through the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Receiving two doses of the MMR vaccine provides 97% effectiveness in preventing measles for life, per the CDC, and one dose offers about 93% protection.

The CDC emphasizes that when over 95% of a community is vaccinated, the majority of individuals benefit from community immunity.

In Texas alone, 223 cases of measles have been reported since late January, according to the state government there, leading to 29 hospitalizations. Notably, more than half of these cases involve children under 17 years of age.

Among those infected in Texas, the state government has reported that 80 individuals had not received the vaccine, 138 have an unknown vaccination status, and five have received at least one dose.

As of 6 March, measles cases have also been reported in 2025 in California, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington, with a majority of the cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals.

This week, the first cases of measles were confirmed in Oklahoma, where the state department of health reported two cases, and in Vermont, where officials confirmed a school-aged child had been infected.

The first measles cases were also confirmed this week in Los Angeles county and Fresno county, California.

In New Mexico, the department of health declared an outbreak and reported this week that the measles case count had risen to 33, including a new case in Eddy county, the first reported outside of Lea county.

Most of the cases involve unvaccinated residents, the department said, and so far, one case has required hospitalization.

Last week, the CDC said that more measles cases “are expected as this outbreak continues to expand rapidly”.

Measles was declared officially eliminated from the US in 2000, meaning that the virus is not continuously spreading within the country, according to the CDC.

On Thursday, Dave Weldon, a former Republican congressman and doctor from Florida who has questioned the safety of vaccine, who was Donald Trump's nominee to lead the CDC, was set to appear before the Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee as part of the confirmation process.

But, just hours before, on Thursday morning, the White House decided to withdraw the nomination, first reported by Axios.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Mahmoud Khalil described by former colleague at UK office for Syria as well liked and extensively vetted

A detained Columbia University graduate threatened with deportation after the Trump administration claimed he poses a risk to US foreign policy is a former employee of the British government who was extensively vetted before working at the embassy in Beirut.

Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate from a Columbia University master's programme, was arrested at home on 9 March as he returned with his wife from a dinner to break their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

“My husband was kidnapped from our home, and it's shameful that the US government continues to hold him because he stood for the rights and lives of his people,” his wife, Noor Abdalla, who is eight months pregnant, said in a statement read by her lawyer outside a New York court this week.

“His disappearance has devastated our lives.”

Khalil, a Palestinian born in Syria, had become a prominent face in protests on the Columbia campus over the last year. Following his arrest, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused him of leading “activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation”.

The White House has not specified publicly or in court that Khalil has committed any crime, or how this invalidates his status as a US legal permanent resident. The Trump administration has instead sought to use a provision within immigration law specifying that the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, “has reasonable grounds to believe that your presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”, according to a charging document provided to Khalil.

Andrew Waller, a former British diplomat who worked with Khalil at the UK office for Syria, a diplomatic mission housed inside the British embassy in Beirut, described Khalil as a thoughtful individual and highly valued colleague during his government service.

“This is a naked example of the US administration arresting someone for their political opinions, and I think the British government should be exercised about this,” he said.

“He is a former British government employee who was vetted and well liked.”

Waller added that the British government was entirely dependent on non-British nationals working at embassies worldwide to provide the language skills and local knowledge needed to operate. Khalil worked for years on the British government's flagship grant programme that brings foreign students to study at UK universities, as well as in a support role for which he helped to inform and shape British foreign policy on Syria through his knowledge and Arabic skills.

“The British government relies on people like Mahmoud all over the world,” he said. “Without them the UK could not operate overseas. It could not conduct diplomatic activity without this raft of employees who do this kind of work.”

Waller said he was “disappointed” that Khalil's loyalty to the government he served for years has not been publicly recognised by the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office. The Foreign Office declined to comment, saying it did not discuss former employees.

“There is an element of loyalty here that is really important: If there is one thing Mahmoud showed while working for the British government, it is loyalty,” said Waller.

Columbia University did not respond to questions about how the campus administration intends to protect other students like Khalil, after it emerged that he emailed the university begging for legal protection in the days before his arrest.

The White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this week that DHS was “using intelligence” to find other students who took part in campus protests over the Israeli assault on Gaza.

A spokesperson for Columbia University referred instead to a statement by the interim president, Katrina Armstrong, earlier this week pledging to “follow the law”, and underlining a “commitment to freedom of speech”.

International students at the Columbia journalism school were warned about angering the Trump administration by its dean, Jelani Cobb, and a professor of media law, Stuart Karle, according to the New York Times.

“Nobody can protect you,” said Cobb, advising them to avoid filling their social media with commentary on the Middle East. Karle reportedly warned the students to avoid coverage of protests of Khalil's arrest.

Both Waller and Khalil's lawyer, Samah Sisay, pointed to the extensive background checks and screening, including about his political views and those held by his family, that Khalil had been through in order to work for the British government, and then later to obtain a US green card.

“It's completely absurd that US government is saying Mahmoud presents a threat to its foreign policy interests,” said Sisay.

“They don't even say national security interests ... they are not accusing him of specific terrorist or criminal activity, they are just saying a discretionary belief by the secretary of state is enough to deport him.”

Khalil was subject to extensive background checks to obtain a green card last year, said Sisay, which granted him legal permanent residency as the spouse of an American citizen.

“He would not have been granted it if they truly believed he was a threat. The only difference is a change in the executive, which is incredibly concerning,” she said.

Waller described the “rigorous security clearance”, that Khalil was subject to before he began work for the British government at the embassy in Beirut. He oversaw applicants for the prestigious Chevening scholarship, an academic fund for students coming to the UK.

Khalil rose up the ranks at the UK office for Syria before deciding to study for a masters degree at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs. Before starting work for the British government, Khalil would have been questioned about his political beliefs, said Waller.

“I would say, and I am sure the vetting officers would disagree, that if you're going to work in a place like Beirut, they take that process a lot more seriously than some other countries,” he said. “Lebanon is a difficult place to work, and they take the security of the embassy there really quite seriously for obvious reasons. So it's not a box-ticking exercise, it's a considered process.”

Waller added that his friend and former colleague was motivated by a desire to help others after his family fled Syria in 2012.

“He is a political exile from Syria, who fled the oppressive regime and civil war there. Everything he has done has been driven by a sense of basic humanitarian mission and a sense of justice, to try and help people less fortunate,” he said.

The former diplomat also pointed to JD Vance's comments during a visit by Keir Starmer, when the US vice-president described “infringements to free speech in the UK”.

“Given that the US has just reprimanded the UK on freedom of speech extremely publicly, the least the British government could do is to say they are concerned about Mahmoud's case and the free speech violation it so clearly represents,” said Waller.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Sister of Gianni who took over Italian label after his murder in 1997 will become chief brand ambassador at Versace

For the first time in almost 50 years, Versace will no longer be designed by a Versace.

Three decades after she started working for the company – and 27 years after she stepped into the role of creative director after the murder of her brother, Gianni – the designer Donatella Versace has announced she is to step down from her role at the Italian brand from the end of March.

“It has been the greatest honour of my life to carry on my brother Gianni's legacy,” she said in a statement on Thursday morning. “He was the true genius, but I hope I have some of his spirit and tenacity.”

From April, Dario Vitale, 41, a former image director at Miu Miu, the edgier sister brand to Prada, will be Versace's creative director. Versace will not leave the company – instead she will become chief brand ambassador, looking after (among other roles) philanthropy and red carpet dressing. Of the new role, Donatella said: “I will remain Versace's most passionate supporter. Versace is in my DNA and always in my heart.”

Versace, the youngest and only daughter of a dressmaker in Reggio Calabria, was born in 1955, a decade after her eldest brother, Gianni. Though she left home to study in Florence, along with Santo, the middle brother who ran the business side, she was very much involved in the family business as a supporter and a muse to her brother. By 1989, aged 34, she began working at Atelier Versace, and by 1993 had sole creative responsibility for Versus, Versace's cheaper diffusion line.

It was after the murder of Gianni in 1997 – the 50-year-old designer was shot outside his home in Miami Beach – that Donatella, unexpectedly, was propelled into the top job. Despite having no formal fashion training, she inherited a $807m (£623m) business and 130 shops worldwide. Talking about that time in the Guardian in 2017, she said: “For the first five years, I was lost … I made a lot of mistakes. I would tell myself … don't try to be Gianni!”

At its height, under Gianni, Versace specialised in an aesthetic, synonymous with “flashion” and vulgarity and starry front rows. But with a knack for telling a story through the clothes themselves, Donatella became just as entwined with the look.

One of the few brands with a designer who is as much a visual ambassador of the clothes as the customer – not to mention one of the few women in a top job at a fashion house – Versace not only wore the brand, but became it. Instantly recognisable, in 2015 she even briefly appeared as the face of Givenchy.

Although Versace's status in popular culture rose on Gianni's watch – he designed Liz Hurley's safety-pin dress and choreographed the 1991 show in which the supermodels Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista lip-synched to George Michael's Freedom on the catwalk – it was consolidated by Donatella, who went on to work closely with Madonna and design, among other things, interiors, hotels and Jennifer Lopez's plunging “jungle” dress worn to the Grammy's in 2000. The outfit spawned so many search queries that Google was inspired to create what is now Google Images.

after newsletter promotion

Despite a few dips – Donatella has been vocal about her addictions and the company almost filed for bankruptcy in the early 2000s – she grew into the recognisable figurehead of the company, a champion for LGBTQ+ rights and a beloved character within the fashion industry.

The change in leadership marks not only a historic transition for the brand, but a financial one too. In the statement on Thursday, John D Idol, the chief executive officer of Capri Holdings which owns Versace as well as Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, called the decision “part of a thoughtful succession plan”.

It is also thought that the Prada group, which owns Miu Miu, wants to buy Versace and has an exclusive bidding window on the brand – and that Vitale will provide a new wave of energy. During his tenure at Miu Miu, the brand recorded a 58% increase in revenue, to €649m (£544m). Sales were up 93% last year.

Vitale is not a well known name in fashion. But he had been rumoured to be a contender for roles at Bottega Veneta and Gucci. In his own statement, thanking Donatella, he described his new position as “a privilege”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Photographer in coma and scores injured as police use teargas, rubber bullets and water cannon against retirees

Argentina's hardline security minister is facing calls to resign after the violent police response to a protest by pensioners left a photographer in a coma and scores of other people injured.

More than 1,000 riot police used teargas, rubber bullets and water cannons to disperse demonstrators late on Wednesday.

Retirees gather every week in front of Congress to demand an increase in pensions and the restoration of certain free medications, which have been hit by President Javier Milei's austerity programme.

This week the number of protesters swelled after fans from some of the country's biggest football clubs, including Boca Juniors and River Plate, joined the rally.

To the sound of trumpets and drums, elderly marchers waved walking sticks and signs reading: “Don't hit us, we are your parents,” and “Help me fight – you'll be the next elderly person.”

But violence soon erupted with columns of riot police releasing a near-constant stream of teargas, and shooting water cannons and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Around 5.30pm officers drove into the crowds on motorbikes, pointing guns at the demonstrators and causing hundreds to flee.

Footage circulating on social media showed an elderly woman being hit with a baton and being knocked to the ground, her head soon covered in blood. In another, an elderly man wearing a football shirt is seen being beaten by police.

A freelance photographer and activist was also left in a critical condition, after being hit in the head with a teargas canister. Pablo Grillo reportedly suffered a skull fracture and loss of brain mass, a graphic photo of which was shared online. The 35-year-old was rushed to a hospital where he underwent emergency surgery and remains in an induced coma.

His father, Fabián Grillo, blamed the president and national security minister, Patricia Bullrich, and said: “My son's life is in danger.” Bullrich responded by calling the photographer an activist.

The Argentinian Graphic Reporters Association (aRGra) is demanding Bullrich's resignation. “Today our former student was vilely and seriously injured by security forces,” their statement said. “We demand that the president of the republic immediately remove her and her subordinates from office and bring them to justice. Otherwise we make him [Milei] morally, politically and criminally complicit in the crimes committed by his minister.”

Hundreds of people protested peacefully, chanting from the sidelines. But others threw stones, firecrackers and bottles at police containment lines. A police van and rubbish cans were also set ablaze. Al Jazeera reported that a police officer had been shot.

Preliminary figures from the independent human rights group Comisión Nacional por la Memoria suggest more than 500 people were injured.

More than 100 people were detained, authorities said, with Bullrich alleging on TV that organised and violent football fans had turned up “prepared to kill”.

Axel Kicillof, the opposition governor of Buenos Aires province, condemned the government's “ferocious, illegal and premeditated” repression of the protest. “While a photographer fights for his life, government spokespeople lie, justify violence, and spread hatred. This authoritarian rampage must be urgently curbed,” he said.

Retirees were described as the biggest losers during Milei's first year in office, with pension increases falling significantly under inflation and the list of free medications being cut.

Nearly 60% of retirees receive only the minimum pension payment, which amounts to approximately $340 a month. From 23 March, those who have not completed 30 years of contributions will reportedly be unable to access the retirement pot – estimates suggest thousands will be affected.

Liliana Morono, a 73-year-old pensioner and grandmother, attended Wednesday's protest for the first time. “Milei's government is reducing our money every month, we can't live, we can't buy medications,” she said.

“I can't understand how any Argentinian could vote for this crazy man who is so sick and full of hate. He has created a clash, a division, across our country,” she added.

Russian president claims Kyiv seeking deal because it is losing on battlefield as he responds to US-brokered proposal

Vladimir Putin has said he has many questions about the proposed US-brokered ceasefire with Ukraine and appeared to set out a series of sweeping conditions that would need to be met before Russia would agree to such a truce.

Speaking at a press conference at the Kremlin alongside the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said that he agreed in principle with US proposals to halt the fighting but said he wanted to address the “root causes of the conflict”.

“The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,” Putin said.

But he suggested that Ukraine should neither rearm nor mobilise and that western military aid to Kyiv be halted during the 30-day ceasefire.

Donald Trump responded briefly before a meeting with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, saying that Putin had “made a very promising statement, but it was not complete”.

The US president said he was “ready to talk to Putin”.

“We will see if Russia agrees, and if not, it will be a very disappointing moment,” he said. “I would like to see a ceasefire from Russia. We hope that Russia will do the right thing.”

Putin claimed that Ukraine was seeking a ceasefire because of the battlefield situation, asserting that Russian forces were “advancing almost everywhere” and nearing full control of the Kursk region, where Kyiv launched a surprise incursion last year.

“How will these 30 days of [ceasefire] be used? To continue forced mobilisation in Ukraine? To supply weapons to Ukraine? … These are legitimate questions,” he said.

Ukraine has previously indicated it would continue its mobilisation efforts during the 30-day ceasefire.

“We need to discuss this with our American partners – perhaps a call with Donald Trump,” Putin added, thanking the US president for his involvement in the peace negotiations.

By avoiding an outright rejection of Trump's ceasefire proposal, Putin appears to be balancing between not openly rebuffing Trump's push for peace while also imposing his own stringent demands – potentially prolonging negotiations.

Speaking from the White House, Trump went into further detail on the US negotiations with Russia and Ukraine, saying that a “lot of individual subjects have been discussed”.

Trump indicated that the US and Ukraine had discussed “pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement. There's a power plant involved. You know, very big power plant involved. Who's going to get the power plant and who's going to get this and that?”

Trump said that Ukraine had also brought up “Nato and being in Nato, and everybody knows what the answer to that is”.

“We've been discussing concepts of land because you don't want to waste time with the ceasefire if it's not going to mean anything,” Trump said. “So we're saying: look, this is what you can get, this is what you can't get.

“Now we're going to see if Russia's there and if not it's going to be a very disappointing moment for the world,” he said.

Asked whether he had any leverage to compel Russia to agree to a ceasefire, Trump said that he did, but did not want to go into detail. “We're talking to him and based on the statements he made today, they were pretty positive,” he said.

On Wednesday, Trump said that he could do “things financially that would be very bad for Russia” if a ceasefire was not agreed, but did not elaborate on whether he meant new sanctions or tariffs.

The Russian president had travelled to the Kursk region the day before on a rare battlefield visit, where he spoke with Russian troops who were on the verge of expelling Ukrainian forces from the land it captured last year.

“What will happen in the Kursk region? Will an order be given for the troops stationed there to surrender?,” Putin asked.

“How the situation along the frontline will be resolved remains unclear,” he added.

Ukraine has not officially confirmed an organised retreat from the Kursk region but Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that “the military command is doing what it should do – saving the maximum number of lives of our soldiers”.

On Thursday a source in Ukraine's military who recently left Kursk region said: “It's over. The only question now is managing the withdrawal with as few losses as possible.”

But while Ukraine appears to be withdrawing from the Kursk region, Kyiv has largely stabilised the front in eastern Ukraine, where a Russian offensive has stalled in recent weeks.

Putin's remarks came hours after the jet of Trump's envoy and close ally, Steven Witkoff, landed in Moscow, where he is expected to meet the Russian leader to push for a ceasefire after Washington's talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

After talks with top US diplomats in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Ukraine said it was ready to accept an immediate 30-day ceasefire and the US said it was putting the proposal to Moscow.

Recent rhetoric from Russian officials has been notably sceptical of a temporary ceasefire, signalling little urgency to reach an agreement or make concessions, as Moscow remains on the offensive on the battlefield.

A Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, earlier in the day said he had informed the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, that Moscow views the proposed 30-day ceasefire as “nothing more than a short reprieve for Ukrainian forces”.

Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Thursday that Moscow was ready to discuss a US-backed peace initiative “as early as today”. But she also indicated that Russia saw little urgency in halting fighting, reiterating it would not accept western peacekeepers in Ukraine as a security guarantee and that they would be targeted if deployed.

Ukraine has said it would need some kind of security guarantee in order to sign a lasting ceasefire deal.

Moscow's continued resistance to European peacekeeping forces – seen by Ukraine as the only viable alternative to Nato membership for guaranteeing its security – presents a big obstacle to a peace acceptable to Kyiv.

Putin has repeatedly rejected the possibility of a temporary ceasefire, saying he was focused on addressing what he called the “root causes” of the conflict.

Observers believe Putin is determined to put forward a string of maximalist demands before agreeing to any ceasefire, which is likely to prolong negotiations.

Reuters and Bloomberg have reported that Russia, in discussions with the US, has presented a list of such demands to end the war in Ukraine and reset relations with Washington.

The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the media reports.

These demands could include the demilitarisation of Ukraine, an end to western military aid and a commitment to keeping Kyiv out of Nato. Moscow may also push for a ban on foreign troop deployments in Ukraine and international recognition of Putin's claims to Crimea and the four Ukrainian regions Russia annexed in 2022.

Putin could also revisit some of his broader demands from 2021, which go beyond Ukraine, including a call for Nato to halt the deployment of weapons in member states that joined after 1997, when the alliance began expanding into former communist countries.

Many in Europe fear these conditions for peace could weaken the west's ability to increase its military presence and could allow Putin to expand his influence across the continent.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Three more Norwegian ski jumpers were suspended on Thursday in a widening cheating scandal that has shocked the sport.

World championships medalists Robin Pederson and Kristoffer Eriksen Sundal were provisionally suspended along with Robert Johansson over suspicion of illegal manipulation of jump suits, the International Ski and Snowboard Federation said.

They follow the suspensions on Wednesday of Olympic gold medalists Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang in a scandal that came to light after Norway team officials manipulated suits to improve aerodynamics and help athletes fly farther.

FIS said it was asked to seize all jump suits used by Norway at the world championships in Trondheim last week and found no irregularities. But it said findings that “raised additional suspicions of manipulation” led to the suspensions of Pederson, Sundal and Johansson, who will not be able to take part in any events organized by FIS or national ski associations.

“The rules are quite clear. The rules are made by all the ski family,” FIS secretary general Michel Vion told a news conference in Oslo where a World Cup event started on Thursday. “We know exactly the situation and I heard [it said] that, ‘Yeah, but ski jumping is special. They [are always] on the limit, we can play' ... No, there's no play. There's no game here. It's only rules.”

It is not known how widespread the practice of manipulating pre-approved suits is within ski jumping.

Lindvik and Forfang said they knew nothing about deliberately altered equipment, but their coach Magnus Brevig and equipment manager Adrian Livelten confessed and were stood down from their jobs.

The investigation will be made by the FIS independent ethics and compliance office.

“We are all aware that this is not the best moment for ski jumping, but I think this is the way that we want to go,” FIS race director of ski jumping Sandro Pertile said. “In this case we have, we are into an intentional manipulation. We cannot communicate all the details but I think that we are on a good way to clarify the topic.”

FIS said all suits would be checked at the event in Oslo.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Yanis Tereshchenko says he was carrying an emergency first-aid kit and drew on war experience to intervene

A Ukrainian soldier has been praised for saving the life of a stabbing victim during a trip to Venice.

Yanis Tereshchenko, a 32-year-old teacher who enlisted in the Ukrainian army's third assault brigade immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, was on his way to his hotel with his wife and his five-year-old son in the Rialto district when he witnessed an altercation between two young men.

Suddenly, one of them drew out a large knife and stabbed the other in the arm and leg.

“Fortunately, I had my emergency kit with me, the one I've carried since the war began, even though my wife always tells me to leave it at home,” Tereshchenko told Corriere del Veneto. “I saw a deep wound on his thigh and pulled out a tourniquet to stem the bleeding. He lost consciousness and was haemorrhaging. I tried to bring him back to life.”

Doctors later said that Tereshchenko's intervention was very fortunate. The victim was losing blood rapidly, and without the soldier's prompt action, he might have died. Tereshchenko did his best to keep him conscious until the ambulance arrived.

“I don't know if he would have survived,” Tereshchenko said. “People were confused, and no one knew what to do. Sadly, I have seen so much during the war that I had no doubt about the need to intervene.”

Venice's mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, met Tereshchenko and his family personally to thank him and present him with a plaque.

The identities of the victim and the assailant, as well as the motivation behind the attack, remain unclear.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

David Baszucki says company is vigilant about protecting users amid reports of bullying and grooming on platform

Parents who are worried about their children gaming on Roblox should not let them use it, the platform's chief executive has said.

There have been reports of bullying and grooming, and fears that children are being exposed to explicit or harmful content, on the site, which is the most popular platform in the UK among gamers aged eight to 12.

Roblox's co-founder and chief executive, David Baszucki, told BBC News the platform was vigilant in protecting its users, and said “tens of millions” of people had “amazing experiences” on the site.

But he added: “My first message would be: if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox. That sounds a little counterintuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions.

“We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad, incident is one too many. We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.”

Justine Roberts, the head of Mumsnet, told the BBC's Today programme that parents could not watch everything their child was doing “24/7”, even if all the parental controls were set and especially if they had several children. She said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.

The US-based company is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 the site averaged more than 80 million players a day, and roughly 40% of those were under 13.

Players who behave badly can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform. The company is increasingly using more advanced AI systems to flag certain behaviour for investigation.

In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages and also from playing in “hangout experiences”, spaces that feature chat between players.

Baszucki said: “We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour.”

He added that Roblox used rigorous guidelines and had a “consistent policy” on age ratings, based on the content as well the titles of the games.

Baszucki founded the platform with Erik Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006. The pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution, but they quickly noticed that children were using the platform to do activities other than homework.

Baszucki said: “They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox.”

As the platform's popularity grew, the founders noticed players “starting to act out”, prompting them to appoint four people as safety moderators.

Despite attracting decent numbers of gamers, it was only when the company launched its digital currency, Robux, a year later that it really started to make money – Roblox is now worth $41bn (£32bn).

Players use Robux to buy accessories and unlock content. Content creators now receive 70% of the fee and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.

Baszucki said he believed Roblox was “the future of communication” and was now focused on its evolution into a metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form, and hoped eventually to attract 10% of the world's gamers.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Predictions that US firms could retain manufacturing plants in Ireland but move profits back to America

US pharmaceutical companies based in Ireland are more likely to shift profits back to the US than close manufacturing plants after Donald Trump accused Ireland of stealing American tax and jobs, experts say.

Aidan Regan, a professor of political economy at University College Dublin, said the US president was right to call out the trade imbalance created by US pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, arguing the warning signs have been there for years.

“Trump is right. And it was refreshingly honest what he said. I imagine the Irish government would feel the same way if it was Irish companies all over the globe making all their sales in Ireland but shipping their profits offshore,” he said.

Trump, at a meeting with the Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, repeatedly took aim at Ireland's success in luring big pharma. “Ireland was very smart. They took our pharmaceutical companies away from presidents that didn't know what they were doing and its too bad that happened,” Trump said.

About €50bn (£42bn) of medicines are exported worldwide from Ireland every year, according to official data, and Regan says many “never touch Irish soil”.

“Without these accounting-based exports, Ireland's trade surplus would be much smaller. The companies may not disappear but their taxable profits in might,” he said.

He said the “massive deficit” Trump was referring to was partly a result of a practice known as “profit shifting”, in which companies manufactured drugs partly or entirely outside Ireland, but because the legal ownership or intellectual property was held in Ireland, profits were booked there.

“One could argue that up to half of the corporate tax take in Ireland is volatile and based on, quite frankly, phantom exports,” Regan said.

He said Trump's team were very aware of this and could redress the imbalance through tariffs and amendments to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, US legislation introduced in 2018.

“It is designed to try to incentivise a lot of that profit to be relocated back into the USA, and in some cases it was, but there's a lot of loopholes in that legislation, which meant that it was much more profitable for the pharmaceutical sector, in particular, to move more profit into Ireland.

“Trump and his team are very aware of that and could just tweak the tax code to put pressure on the companies to [move] more profit to the US,” he said.

Dermot O'Leary, an economist with Goodbody stockbrokers in Dublin, agreed that tax would be far quicker to repatriate than jobs.

“From a manufacturing point of view, it takes a lot more than a four-year presidential term to actually find the land, put the plan in place, get the planning, build the factory, get the skills in place. But what can happen a lot more quickly is in relation to the profits generated and the intellectual property,” he said.

He pointed out that the danger for Ireland was twofold. If the US dropped its corporate tax from 21% to 15% in line with Dublin, then Ireland's tax advantage would be wiped out. But O'Leary also believes Trump could slash two other tax rates, 10.5% and 13.125% that apply to profits on IP activity, to lure US companies back.

Successive Irish ministers have conceded Ireland is vulnerable. As recently as November, Simon Harris, the then taoiseach, warned it could lose €10bn in corporate tax if just three US multinationals were repatriated to the US.

Official data released earlier this year shows Ireland took €28bn in corporate tax last year. The increase coincided with highly profitable multinationals “onshoring” their valuable IP assets to Ireland.

The country's fiscal watchdog estimates 75% of all corporate tax is paid by large US multinationals, with three firms alone responsible for almost 40%.

On tariffs, Oliver O'Connor, the chief executive of the pharma trade body the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, told RTÉ he was “confident” the 50,000-strong workforce in the sector in Ireland would be there in five years' time.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

‘What more do you want from us?' asks chancellor-in-waiting as he seeks urgent support for fiscal rule changes

Germany's chancellor-in-waiting has tried to win over the Greens to his ambitious but controversial plans to raise the country's defence spending, promising to expand the scope of the plans and demanding of them: “What more do you actually want from us?”

The outgoing parliament met on Thursday to debate the creation of a €500bn (£420bn) fund for infrastructure investment and radical changes in Germany's borrowing limits in order to boost defence spending.

Friedrich Merz, whose conservatives won last month's election and who is on the verge of becoming the new leader, wants to seal the funding deal before the new parliament convenes in less than two weeks. An expanded group of far-right and far-left MPs could oppose it in the new Bundestag, a “blocking minority” Merz is keen to avoid.

Amid expectations that Germany will relax a key element of its strict fiscal rules known as the “debt brake”, its allies have responded favourably and markets have rallied. Economic forecasters have said a public spending boost is likely to help the country emerge from two years of economic doldrums.

But an unusually tense and fractious debate proved on Thursday that the deal is far from being realised, as Merz's CDU/CSU alliance and his probable future coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), are far from securing the required support of the Greens.

In an attempt to win them over Merz offered to expand the scope of defence spending to include civil defence and intelligence spending, as well as allowing up to €50bn for climate protection. He asked the Greens: “What more do you want from us in so short a time?”

Merz stressed his belief in the urgency of investing in security. “We have to do something to improve our defensive capabilities, and quickly,” he said, describing a “truly worrying security situation in Europe”. Germany must “do something now … Anything else would be irresponsible,” he added.

The Greens' parliamentary co-leader Britta Haßelmann accused Merz of “bad manners”, saying he had not sought a proper, respectful conversation with her party but had instead simply left a message on her voicemail.

Before the nearly four-hour debate, the Greens had indicated that negotiations were at a stalemate, with senior figures citing “grave flaws” in the legislation, including the lack of prominence it gave to climate policies.

Throughout the debate, Merz was accused of wanting to use the new money to finance projects that would please the new government's conservative and SPD voter base, and was repeatedly called on to provide guarantees, including commitments to much-needed reforms, as well as extra cash to renovate hospitals, schools and kindergartens.

In a blistering attack, Heidi Reichinnek of Die Linke accused Merz's conservatives and the SPD of being “undemocratic”, convening the old Bundestag “because you're dissatisfied with the election results”. 

Both the far-right Alternative für Deutschland and Die Linke lodged complaints with the constitutional court before the debate, which could deliver its ruling this week.

Merz has argued that raising defence spending has become a matter of urgency because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not just for Germany but for the whole of Europe. With Donald Trump in the White House, he has argued, the continent must become more independent.

Economists have described Merz's multibillion-euro package as everything from a “bazooka” to “an extremely risky bet”, while he has called it vital “in light of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent”.

The second and third readings of the government's plans will take place next Tuesday, before heading to the upper house.  Over the coming days Merz will continue to negotiate with the Greens, according to his party officials.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

US president meeting Nato secretary-general after Russian president says he is in favour of ceasefire but flags ‘serious issues' with proposal

Trump also gets asked about Nato, and he praises Rutte for making the alliance step up.

Nato is stepping up through this man.

This man is a man that only knows how to step up. And we have the same goal in mind.

We want the war ended, and he's doing his job. He only knows how to do a good job. That's one thing. That's why I fought for him to get that job, because they had some other candidates that I'll tell you would not have done a very good job.

Rutte jokes he will need a clip of his comments for his family archives.

Trump then repeats his line that US spends too much even though “we are on the other side of the ocean.”

But he adds that the new minerals deal with Ukraine “will get us something back, a lot back,” even as he complains “we were treated very unfairly” by Europeans.

Russian president Vladimir Putin has said that Russia was technically “in favour” of the proposed ceasefire on Ukraine, but heavily caveated that with “nuances” and “serious issues” that need to be resolved before the proposal can be progressed further (16:51 and 17:13).

He further listed a number of practical issues, including on resolving the Ukrainian “incursion” in Russia's Kursk region and on monitoring any violations, as well as “addressing the roots of the crisis,” prompting fears he could be about to put forward maximalist Russia's demands on Ukraine and European allies (17:25 and 17:41).

Responding to his comments, US president Donald Trump said they were “promising,” but “not complete” (17:48). He added that it would be “very disappointing” if Russia rejects the offer, and appeared to pick up on Putin's suggestion the pair have a call to hash out the differences.

Putin is understood to be talking to Trump's senior aide Steve Witkoff in Moscow tonight.

In first Ukrainian public response to Putin's comment, Zelenskyy's most senior aide said Ukraine will not agree to a frozen conflict and insisted Europe would have to be involved in peace talks (19:19).

Separately, Trump also made explosive comments about Greenland saying he thought annexation of the island “will happen” as he appeared to dismiss Denmark's rule over the island (19:06).

Finally, the German parliament held a heated debate over the incoming government's sweeping plans to increase the country's defence and infrastructure spending and making changes to the constitutional debt break (12:36, 13:00, 13:17, 13:33, and report)

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, as I hand the blog over to Maya Yang, who will guide you through the evening.

I just wanted to quickly pick up on Trump's comments about the Greenland election where he said that “the person that did the best is a very good person as far as we are concerned, so we will be talking about it and it is very important”…

Well, I'm not sure about that.

The Demokraatit party, which won the election, had the following paragraph in its election manifesto:

US President Donald Trump has now repeatedly mused about buying Greenland.

Let's be clear: Greenland is not for sale. Not today. Not tomorrow. Never, ever.

Our country is not a commodity, and the idea of ​​buying us shows a profound lack of respect for our values. We are a proud nation that works hard for our freedom and future.

They then went on to say they wanted to “cooperate and trade” with others, including the US, “but it must always be done on our terms and with respect for who we are.”

They concluded:

Trump can drop the idea. Greenland is not for sale.

Vladimir Putin has said he has many questions about the proposed US-brokered ceasefire with Ukraine and appeared to set out a series of sweeping conditions that would need to be met before Russia would agree to such a truce.

The Russian leader suggested that Ukraine should neither rearm nor mobilise and that western military aid to Kyiv be halted during the 30-day ceasefire.

At the same time, Putin said that he agreed in principle with US proposals to halt the fighting and complemented Trump for his efforts to stop the war.

By avoiding an outright rejection of Trump's ceasefire proposal, Putin appears to be balancing between not openly rebuffing Trump's push for peace while also imposing his own stringent demands – potentially prolonging negotiations.

In the meantime, Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said that Ukraine will not agree to a frozen conflict with Russia.

“We will not go for a frozen conflict, our US partners are also against such a scenario. We are against Minsk 3, and Europe will be included in the peace process,” he said.

In a TV clip, posted also on his social media accounts, he further said that Ukraine had agreed with the US that representatives from Europe will definitely take part in the peace process.

And that's it for comments from Trump-Rutte meeting at the White House.

Trump also gets asked about fears among some Nato allies about the aggressive position of Russia and if he thinks these fears are justified.

No, I think [so].

When this gets done, it's done, they're going to all want to go home and rest. 

I don't see it happening.

And we'll make sure it doesn't happen. Not going to happen, but we'll make sure it doesn't happen.

Trump also gets asked about his leverage on Russia.

He insists he “does have a leverage,” but doesn't want to talk about it because “we're talking to him and based on the statements he made today, they were pretty positive.”

I hope Russia is going to make the deal too. …

I don't think they're going back to shooting again. I really believe if we had … if we get a peace treaty, a ceasefire treaty I think that leads to peace, that's going to really lead to peace.

I don't think anyone wants to go back [to shooting]. …

And I think if, if President Putin agrees and does a cease fire, I think we're going to … be in very good shape to get it done.

Trump repeats again that he stepped up the US support for Ukraine and “stopped” the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.

On Greenland, Trump gets asked about his vision for potential annexation of the island.

“Well, I think it will happen. I'm just thinking, I didn't give it much thought before, but I'm sitting with a man that could be very instrumental,” he says, as he turns to Rutte saying “Mark, we need that for international security … as we have a lot of our favourite players, cruising around the coast.”

Rutte distances himself from his comments on annexing Greenland, but says Trump is right talking about growing risks in the North Arctic.

Trump is then asked about the recent elections in Greenland, and says “it was a good election for us.”

“The person that did the best is a very good person as far as we are concerned, so we will be talking about it and it is very important,” he says.

The president says the US “is going to order” 48 icebreakers, and that would help to strengthen US position “as that whole area is becoming very important.”

“So we are going to have to make a deal on that and Denmark is not able to do that [offer protection],” he says.

He then mocks Denmark saying they have “nothing to do with that” as “a boat landed there 200 years ago or something, and they say they have rights to it?” “I don't know if that is true.”

“We have been dealing with Denmark, we have been dealing with Greenland, and we have to do it,” he says.

He again suggests Nato could be involved given its bases there, asking defence secretary Pete Hegseth if he should send more troops there. “Don't answer that Pete,” he laughs.

Trump also gets asked about Nato, and he praises Rutte for making the alliance step up.

Nato is stepping up through this man.

This man is a man that only knows how to step up. And we have the same goal in mind.

We want the war ended, and he's doing his job. He only knows how to do a good job. That's one thing. That's why I fought for him to get that job, because they had some other candidates that I'll tell you would not have done a very good job.

Trump then repeats his line that US spends too much even though “we are on the other side of the ocean.”

But he adds that the new minerals deal with Ukraine “will get us something back, a lot back,” even as he complains “we were treated very unfairly” by Europeans.

Trump reveals a bit more of what was going on in negotiations on the ceasefire as he says that “a lot of individual subjects have been discussed.”

Well, we'd like to see a cease fire from Russia. And we have, you know, not been working in the dark.

We've been discussing … Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement. There's a power plant involved. You know, very big power plant involved. Who's going to get the power plant and who's going to get this and that?

And so, you know, it's, it's not an easy process. But phase 1 is the ceasefire.

He goes on:

We've been discussing concepts of land because you don't want to waste time with the ceasefire, if, it's not going to mean anything. So we're saying: look, this is what you can get, this is what you can't get.

They discuss Nato, and being in Nato, and everybody knows what the answer to that is. Know that answer for 40 years, in all fairness.

So a lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed. Now we're going to see whether or not Russia is there, and if they're not, it'll be a very disappointing moment for the world.

On Putin's first reaction, he says it was “a very promising statement, but it wasn't complete,” and adds “I would love to meet with him or talk to him, but we have to get it over with fast.”

As part of his opening statement, Trump talks about Nato and how countries need to step up and pay their fair share (including, once again, a pointed praise of Poland for spending above targets).

He says that his comments that “I won't protect if you are not paying” got you criticism from Russia, but “if [I didn't say that,] nobody would have paid.”

He then goes back to Ukraine and Russia, and says:

We're getting words that things are going okay in Russia, but that doesn't mean anything until we hear what the final outcome is. 

But they have very serious discussions going on right now with President Putin and others, and hopefully they all want to end this nightmare.

…

So we hopefully are going to be in a good position sometime today to have a good idea. 

We'll have we know where we are with Ukraine, and we are getting good signals out of Russia as to where we are with Russia, and hopefully they'll do the right thing.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Britain in middle as some of US's trading partners retaliate while others want ‘pragmatic' route in hope levies are eased

Sailors crossing the Atlantic in March are used to dealing with rough seas. But when two shipments of steel from Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield were slowed up in crossing the ocean by storms this week it meant more than a few days' extra journey: the metal was caught up in the global trade war started by the US president, Donald Trump, as well.

“Obviously, it's a massive frustration,” says Liam Bates, the president of long products at the Italian steelmaker's northern England operation. The company had hoped to rush through two weekly shipments in order to avoid the Wednesday deadline for Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium. Instead, it will have to bear the costs – or hope for grace from the US government.

The tariffs have put the US's trading partners, including the UK, in a tricky situation. They are being pulled in two directions: some want trade war retaliation, while others want “pragmatic” negotiation in the hope that the changeable Trump can be persuaded to ease the levies.

The EU's response was swift. The bloc immediately retaliated with revived levies on all-American products such as bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and the promise of more on an array of other products including makeup, chicken, beef and metals.

Yet the UK is taking the second path: keeping its head down, and hoping it can persuade the mercurial and deal-driven Trump to change his mind.

Keir Starmer told parliament on Wednesday he was “disappointed”, while adding that the UK would “take a pragmatic approach” as it tried to negotiate a deal with the US. “But we will keep all options on the table,” he said, leaving open the possibility of future retaliation.

Chris Southworth, the UK secretary general for the International Chamber of Commerce, a business group, says the UK government will come under “tremendous pressure” to retaliate, and it may still do so. However, Starmer's relative success in mollifying Trump may open the way to talks that could roll back tariffs for the UK.

“What they'll be trying to do is avoid going head to head,” he says. The UK, as a “pragmatic broker”, could “try to shift the focus off tariffs, where neither of us win”. However, “it's a tricky balance”, he adds.

It is not the first time that the Labour government has taken a relatively conciliatory stance on trade since it took power in July: it has also so far declined to impose tariffs on Chinese car imports, even as the US and EU have done so.

Carmakers with UK operations appear much more concerned to avoid retaliation from China – the world's biggest car market – than on preventing Chinese products from coming into the UK. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has opposed the idea of tariffs on Chinese cars, and is not aware of any appeals from companies for investigation to the UK's Trade Remedies Authority, the first step to imposing tariffs.

A source close to government negotiations said the UK was taking a different approach to the EU because “active and intense” trade negotiations could come up with something.

“Coming to an actual agreement is a better weapon in our arsenal,” the source said. However, if talks with the US fail, the government would definitely consider quotas or tariffs for the steel industry.

Hoping for a good result from talks may not satisfy businesses. One key effect is the possibility of trade diversion: when exporters try to find new markets when their originals are closed. The steel industry shared its concerns with the business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, on Wednesday.

Gareth Stace, the director general of UK Steel, a lobby group, argues that the government should act quickly to prevent trade diversion, to match the speed of the EU, which is set to tighten protections within days.

“The need for quickness doesn't seem to have landed enough,” Stace says, referring to protections against other countries dumping steel in the UK once the US market is closed. He says the UK should “rip up the rulebook and get on with” protecting the sector.

However, Stace strongly praised the government's efforts to persuade the US: “We're your friend, not your foe.”

The UK is a relative minnow in the global metals industry, with 4m tonnes of steel produced in 2024 against more than 120m from the EU, or 1bn from China. That disparity means that the UK, no longer part of the EU, is not likely to be an economic priority for Trump – although there is a chance it could help the UK to win concessions.

The Indian-owned Tata Steel, which runs the vast Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, has great influence with the UK government because it will once again become the country's largest steel producer when it replaces its now-shut blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces. A spokesperson said that the UK must add safeguard measures to “avoid cheaper imports flooding our market and pushing down prices as competitors look to redirect steel originally destined for the US”.

Another steel industry executive, whose business exports about 10% of its products to the US, says Trump's argument for restrictions on the vast supply from China in particular was “something that I don't totally disagree with”. He argued that “trade remedies to protect our own industry” would help to avoid undercutting by Chinese steelmakers, which are desperate to find buyers amid weak domestic demand.

Yet not everybody is a fan of immediately moving to protectionism – not least because it could reduce export opportunities if everyone starts to pull up the drawbridge.

Bates said he believes the same is true of UK retaliation against the US, which could inflame the situation and lead to tit-for-tat tariffs that could block export markets completely.

“At the moment it feels like a better way to see if a deal could be done,” he said.

The irony of Trump's tariffs for Marcegaglia is that they will make things more difficult for its US operations in South Carolina, where 65 employees roll steel shapes known as billets and blooms into products for cars, construction and the oil industry.

Trump's argument when faced by global stock market turmoil in recent days is that there will be a “period of transition” – and maybe even a recession – while businesses are forced to shift manufacturing to the US, “reshoring” jobs. However, that is not an option for Marcegaglia because it does not have a “critical mass” in the US to justify the investment in another melt shop.

“It's quite extraordinary how anyone thinks this will do anything other than damage the US,” says the ICC's Southworth. “It's hard to think that anyone is looking at the US as a reliable partner.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Israeli forces have used sexual violence as weapon to ‘dominate and destroy' Palestinian people, report also says

Israel's systemic attacks on women's healthcare in Gaza amount to “genocidal acts”, and Israeli security forces have used sexual violence as a weapon of war to “dominate and destroy the Palestinian people”, a UN report states.

The 49-page report on sexual and gender-based violence was drawn up by the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Including East Jerusalem, and presented to the UN human rights council.

It details attacks on maternity wards and other healthcare facilities for women, the destruction of an IVF clinic and controls on the entry of food and medical supplies into Gaza that together “destroyed in part the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group”.

Israel's actions amounted to “two categories of genocidal acts in the Rome statute and the genocide convention, including deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians and imposing measures intended to prevent births”, the human rights council said.

The report found that Israel's security forces had made certain forms of sexual and gender-based violence part of “standard operating procedures”, including forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, and sexual assault.

The “pattern of sexual violence” that Israeli forces used, including cases of rape and sexualised torture, constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity, the UN said.

“The frequency, prevalence and severity of sexual and gender-based crimes perpetrated across the Occupied Palestinian Territory leads the commission to conclude that sexual and gender-based violence is increasingly used as a method of war by Israel to destabilise, dominate, oppress and destroy the Palestinian people.”

Israel's civilian and military leadership provided “either explicit orders or implicit encouragement” to carry out sexual violence including rape and attacks on genitals, the UN said.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the accusations in the report were baseless, and attacked the UN human rights council as biased against Israel.

A previous commission report investigated sexual and gender-based violence committed by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups during the 7 October 2023 attacks, when about 1,200 people were killed, the majority of them civilians, and 250 taken hostage to Gaza.

The latest report documents a wide range of violations against Palestinian men, women and children across the occupied territories in the wake of that attack.

Repeated patterns in the abuse of Palestinian boys and men showed the violence was intended as collective punishment, to “humiliate and intimidate”, the report found. This included filming and photographing public stripping, nudity and sexualised abuse and torture, and sharing images online.

Most perpetrators of sexual and gender-based violence listed in the report were members of the armed forces or working in detention centres, but they also included Israeli settlers targeting Palestinians.

The chair of the commission that drew up the report, Navi Pillay, said Israel's failure to investigate or prosecute abuses created a culture of impunity.

Israel last month sentenced a soldier to seven months for severe assaults of Palestinian detainees, the first conviction for abuse in the detention system. Nine other soldiers were arrested last year over allegations of sexual abuse so violent it left a detainee in a critical condition, but they have not gone on trial.

Pillay said: “The exculpatory statements and actions by Israeli leaders and the lack of effectiveness shown by the military justice system to prosecute cases and convict perpetrators send a clear message to members of the Israeli security forces that they can continue committing such acts without fear of accountability.

“In this context, accountability through the international criminal court and national courts, through their domestic law or exercising universal jurisdiction, is essential if the rule of law is to be upheld and victims awarded justice.”

The ​UN's international court of justice ordered the Israeli government to ensure its forces did not commit acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in January 2024.

Israel is party to the genocide convention, but not the Rome statute under which the international criminal court has jurisdiction to rule on individual criminal cases involving genocide.

The UN report also highlighted the “unprecedented scale” of female deaths in Gaza as another gendered aspect of the violence. Israeli attacks have killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, 33% of them women and girls.

That is a higher proportion than during Israel's past wars in Gaza, caused by “an Israeli strategy of deliberately targeting residential buildings and using heavy explosives in densely populated areas”, the report said.

Egypt and Hamas officials on Thursday welcomed comments from Donald Trump that Palestinians would not be forced out of Gaza. “Nobody is expelling any Palestinians from Gaza,” the US president said after a White House meeting with the Irish prime minister, Micheál Martin.

Trump has repeatedly called for the US to take ownership of the strip and rebuild it as a “riviera” for the Middle East without its Palestinian residents, suggesting they should move to neighbouring countries including Egypt.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Former Philippines president filmed a video message en route to the Hague, saying ‘I will be responsible for everything'

Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has said he will accept responsibility for his government's so-called “war on drugs” in a video message filmed on board a plane shortly before he was taken into the custody of the international criminal court (ICC).

“Whatever happened in the past, I will be the front of our law enforcement and the military. I said this already, that I will protect you, and I will be responsible for everything,” he said.

The video message, which appeared to have been filmed on board the aircraft that brought him to the Netherlands to face charges of crimes against humanity, were his first comments to the Philippines public since his dramatic arrest on Tuesday.

Dressed in a plain white shirt, and speaking to the camera, he said: “This will be a long legal proceeding. But I say to you, I will continue to serve the country. So be it. If that is my destiny. Thank you”.
 Duterte has previously said he offered “no apologies, no excuses” for his bloody anti drugs crackdowns which activists say may have killed as many as 30,000 people.

Duterte's plane landed at Rotterdam airport at just before 5pm local time on Wednesday, and he was transferred to a detention unit on the Dutch coast.

In a statement the ICC confirmed it had taken custody of the former leader, with the court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, calling it “a crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.” 
 Duterte is the first former leader of an Asian country to be served an arrest warrant filed by the ICC.

In a statement the ICC said its chamber, composed of three judges, had assessed material submitted by office of the prosecutor and found reasonable grounds to believe that Duterte is “individually responsible as an indirect co-perpetrator for the crime against humanity of murder, allegedly committed in the Philippines between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019.”

A hearing will be scheduled “in due course” for Duterte's initial appearance before the court, it said, which will confirm his identity and the language in which he is able to follow the proceedings. It is not clear when a trial will begin.

Supporters of the former leader gathered at The Hague Penitentiary Institution, waiving the Philippines flag and chanting “bring him back”. While rights experts and victims' families have been overjoyed by the news of Duterte's arrest, the former leader retains a strong support base, especially in the south of the country.

“I am OK, do not worry,” Duterte, who will turn 80 this month, said in the video message. His daughter, Sara Duterte, the vice-president, also arrived in The Hague on Wednesday evening to offer support.

Lawyers for Duterte on Wednesday filed a petition on behalf of his youngest daughter, Veronica, accusing the government of “kidnapping” him, and demanding he be returned to the Philippines.

Duterte's supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the court has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal.

The country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who once ran in an alliance with vice-president Sara Duterte but is now embroiled in a bitter feud with the family, told reporters this week he was confident “the arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Mauritshuis exhibition reveals how Dutch men hid in attic to avoid being taken to Germany in second world war

The 13-year-old boy answered the doorbell. “Tell your dad I'm here,” said a man, who stored his bicycle and then disappeared upstairs.

It was 1944, and right under the noses of Nazi command, people were hiding in the attic of The Hague's Mauritshuis museum from forced labour conscription – Arbeitseinsatz – under which hundreds of thousands of men from the Nazi-occupied Netherlands were conscripted to work in Germany.

The memories of 93-year-old Menno de Groot – a Dutch-Canadian who was that young boy – form an extraordinary part of a book and an exhibition of the secret history of the Dutch museum during the second world war.

“He must have gone all the way to the attic,” De Groot tells his granddaughter Kella Flach in a video for the exhibition, referring to the man who he assumed had arrived to go into hiding. “I don't know how many were up there. I have no idea how they lived up there, how they got there.”

The chance find of a logbook by De Groot's father, Mense de Groot, an administrator who from 1942 lived in the Mauritshuis museum with his wife and children, including Menno, inspired researchers to examine the museum's history.

“People were hiding in November 1944 because of the Arbeitseinsatz, but hiding in the Mauritshuis was hiding in plain sight,” Quentin Buvelot, a researcher and curator, said. “It was a house in the storm.”

Art from the museum, including Johannes Vermeer's Girl With a Pearl Earring, was first hidden in a bomb-proof bunker underneath the building and later stored in locations around the Netherlands. The German-born museum director Wilhelm Martin played a careful role, allowing the Nazis five propaganda exhibitions while also quietly resisting.

A newly discovered note on Martin's retirement in 1953 revealed he was involved in supporting people who had gone undercover on Assendelftstraat and in the museum. “Martin doesn't say how many, but he says that on a daily basis, 36 loaves of bread were delivered … And we also found [an expenses claim] for a first-class carriage to Maastricht, where he went with the Girl With a Pearl Earring under his arm on 11 May 1942,” said Buvelot.

Secret concerts were also held in the museum's basement between 1942 and 1944, according to Frank van Vree, an author and researcher at the NIOD institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies. “They were held to support musicians who were cornered by their resistance to German measures, especially compulsory membership of the Nazi Kultuurkamer,” he said. “People who refused to become members were out of work.”

Mense de Groot, who was hired to work at the museum when the janitor retired, also worked for the resistance. “He usually got Trouw, an underground newspaper,” Menno de Groot says in the exhibition. “And my dad, he copied them, made more copies. ‘Menno, are you ready? I've got 25 here.' I folded them up small, then I put them under my shirt and went to where people were living and distributed them.”

Life under occupation was a series of difficult choices, according to Eelke Muller, a historian and NIOD specialist in looted art. “There was little knowledge [before this research] about how culture could be a political instrument for resistance from the Netherlands but also a strong ideological instrument for the occupier,” she said. “Every museum, every civil servant in times of war was confronted with huge dilemmas: do you choose principled resistance, enthusiastically get behind Nazi ideas, or are you somewhere in the middle?”

Raymund Schütz, a historian and researcher at The Hague city archives, said while important archives are only partially open due to privacy concerns, oral history still reveals surprising stories. “This was the political centre of the city, the spider in the web of the occupying authorities,” he said. “But sometimes the lion's den is a good place to hide.”

 This article was amended on 13 March 2025 to clarify that under Nazi Germany's Arbeitseinsatz it was Dutch men who faced forced labour conscription; an earlier version referred more generally to Dutch “citizens”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Russian president hopes army on brink of ‘fully liberating' border region after recent advances; Trump says he could ‘do things financially' if Moscow rejects truce. What we know on day 1,114

Vladimir Putin has visited Kursk for the first time since Ukraine partly invaded the Russian region in a surprise August 2024 offensive. The Russian president expressed hope his army was on the brink of “fully liberating” Kursk after it claimed to have retaken 24 settlements in the past five days. “I am counting on the fact that all the combat tasks facing our units will be fulfilled, and the territory of the Kursk region will soon be completely liberated from the enemy,” he said on state television.

Minutes after Putin's remarks aired, Ukraine's army commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksandr Syrski, suggested his troops were pulling back to minimise losses. “In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. To this end, the units of the defence forces, if necessary, manoeuvre to more favourable positions,” Syrski posted online, in terms typically used to describe a withdrawal.

Syrskyi said the Russian military was suffering huge personnel and equipment losses while trying to achieve “political gains” by attempting to oust Ukrainian troops. Sudzha is the largest settlement that Ukraine seized in Kursk, and the Ukraine-based Deep State open-source mapping project showed earlier on Wednesday that Kyiv was no longer in full control of it. “The enemy is using assault units of airborne troops and special operations forces to break through our defences, oust our troops out of the Kursk region and move fighting to the territory of Sumy and Kharkiv regions,” Syrskyi said.

Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kyiv was doing “as much as possible” to protect its soldiers. “The Russians are clearly trying to put maximum pressure on our troops, and our military command is doing what it has to do,” the Ukrainian president told a press conference in Kyiv. “We are preserving the lives of our soldiers as much as possible.”

Donald Trump suggested he could target Russia financially as Ukraine's president urged him to take strong steps if Moscow failed to support a 30-day ceasefire agreed between Ukrainian and US delegations meeting in Saudi Arabia. Washington, Kyiv and Europe are waiting for Moscow's response to the proposal, and US envoys are expected to hold talks with Putin by the end of the week. The Kremlin has not publicly said whether or not it supports an immediate ceasefire. If Putin refuses, Trump said he could “do things financially that would be very bad for Russia”.

Zelenskyy said he expected strong measures from the Washington if Russia rejected the ceasefire proposal. “I understand that we can count on strong steps. I don't know the details yet but we are talking about sanctions [against Russia] and strengthening Ukraine.”

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Washington wanted Moscow's agreement with no strings attached. “That's what we want to know - if they're prepared to do it unconditionally,” Rubio said on a plane heading to a G7 meeting in Canada. “If the response is yes, then we know we've made real progress, and there's a real chance of peace. If their response is no, it would be highly unfortunate, and it'll make their intentions clear.”

The US threats came as the French defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, told a press conference in Paris that a ceasefire announcement could come as soon as Thursday and that Europe would have to be prepared to help enforce it. Defence ministers from Europe's five leading military powers – the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland and France – met in the French capital on Wednesday to discuss the formation of a “reassurance force” that would guarantee peace in Ukraine if a settlement was agreed. Lecornu said they were “hoping to see a ceasefire tomorrow” and that 15 countries were willing to contribute to a force of up to 30,000 personnel that would permanently secure Ukraine's airports, ports and infrastructure.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Former president was surrendered to The Hague amid a row between his family and that of the current president

Few expected things to move so quickly. Supporters of the Philippines' former president Rodrigo Duterte barely had time to protest before he was jetted off to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity in relation to his country's so-called “war on drugs”. According to activists, this bloody crackdown has seen as many as 30,000 people killed since 2016.

The charges brought against the former leader are the culmination of years of work by activists, lawyers and victims, who documented abuses committed under his government, often at great personal risk. But Duterte arguably would not have been surrendered to The Hague if it weren't for his family's dramatic feud with that of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the current president.

The two families were once allies. Marcos Jr ran on a joint ticket with Duterte's eldest daughter – Sara Duterte, now the vice-president – in the 2022 election, winning a landslide victory. At the time, Marcos Jr, who capitalised on the popularity of the Duterte name, was careful not to criticise Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs, and promised not to cooperate with the international criminal court's continuing investigation.

But the Duterte-Marcos marriage of convenience descended into a bitter dispute, with Sara Duterte launching scathing attacks on the president, even threatening to dig up the remains of his late father, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, and throw them into the sea.

It was inevitable that the families' alliance would collapse, according to Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, of the University of the Philippines. Both sides want their candidate to be elected president in 2028, so, she said: “It's a fight for the survival of their political families, their dynasties.”

Marcos Jr's public comments about the ICC shifted as tension grew. His government has continued to maintain that it would not assist the court, of which the Philippines is no longer a member, but explained that it would cooperate with any arrest warrant issued via Interpol.

Shortly after the plane carrying Duterte took off on Tuesday night, Marcos Jr told reporters: “The arrest that we did today was in compliance with our commitments to Interpol. It just so happened that that came from ICC.”

According to Tony La Viña, a lawyer and former dean of the Ateneo de Manila University school of government, the arrest was a “perfect execution” by Marcos Jr's administration.

When the warrant came, “they executed it and within the day they sent Duterte to The Hague, giving no chance for the supreme court to issue a TRO [a temporary restraining order against his arrest]”, he said.

The Dutertes may now struggle to recover their power. Rodrigo, who has the most political clout, is now outside the Philippines, just as the country gears up for crucial midterm elections in May.

Rodrigo Duterte is running to become mayor in the family's stronghold, Davao, but faces a challenge from an upstart dynasty, which analysts say marks the most significant threat to the Dutertes' power there in two decades. The former president is still thought likely to win, but it is unclear how he would be able to perform his mayoral duties from The Hague.

The mid-term elections are also important because Sara Duterte is due to face an impeachment trial soon after the vote. The family needs its allies to be elected to the senate if she is to avoid being removed as vice-president and prevented from running for president in 2028.

Rodrigo Duterte's supporters have portrayed him as a victim who was denied due process by the vengeful Marcos family, and who has been wrongly handed over to foreigners. The irony of the first claim is not lost on the victims of the war on drugs, many of whom were never given a day in court, but instead gunned down in the streets.

“Suddenly they are now using terms that they were laughing at [before],” said Atienza. “They are now calling for people power, they are using terms like rule of law, human rights. It's really hard to sell.”

The battle between the families, and online messaging from both sides, is likely only to intensify. Cleve V Arguelles, the CEO of the public opinion research firm WR Numero Research, said: “It will really be crucial in the coming weeks what kinds of narratives will be offered to the public and how the public will respond.”
 He added that the Dutertes were fighting to protect their power at a national level and on their home turf. “It's all at stake now,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Review concluded extending definition to cover extreme violence by ‘loners' such as Axel Rudakubana is unhelpful

The decision not to classify Axel Rudakubana as a terrorist following the Southport murders was right because it would be unhelpful to stretch the definition of terrorism to cover all extreme violence, the UK's terror watchdog has concluded.

Jonathan Hall KC wrote that the “legal definition of terrorism is already wide and should not be changed any further” in his post-Southport review of how extreme violence is legally classified. Expanding the definition would “increase the possibility of inaccurate use and, in theory, abuse”, he said.

Hall concluded that while “male loners, accessing violent material online, desperate for notoriety” present a real threat, terrorism must only refer to violence committed “to advance a political, religious, racial or ideological cause”, rather than serving as a label for the most serious offending.

Hall said extending the definition of terrorism would have “unintended consequences” such as hampering freedom of expression – for example, criminalising those swapping war footage – and placing pressure on resources.

“Any family member whose loved one was murdered by a violent fantasist or psychopath would have reason to ask why Counter Terrorism [Policing] and MI5 were not monitoring the individual and preventing the attack,” he said.

The review was commissioned in January by the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, to examine terror legislation “in light of modern threats we face”.

It followed a pledge by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, to update legislation to address the new threat Britain faces from “extreme violence carried out by loners, misfits, young men in their bedrooms” following the Southport murders.

Hall said that instead police should learn lessons from counter-terrorism in how to manage the risk from individuals who plan to carry out extreme violence for its own sake or because of a personal grievance.

This would include developing “a bespoke policing response” informed by the understanding that counter-terrorism police have built in recent years of how to monitor dangerous lone actors and “distinguish internet rhetoric and real-world attack planning”, Hall said.

This could pick up people such as Rudakubana, who was identified as a risk three times by the Prevent counter-terrorism programme but then dropped due to a lack of evidence of any clear extremist ideology.

Rudakubana was jailed for a minimum of 52 years for the murders of three girls and attempted murders of eight other children and two adults at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport in July last year. His attack was not considered terrorism under existing laws.

Hall felt that some counter-terrorism investigative powers, such as the ability to hold a suspect for up to 14 days pre-charge, were not “relevant to violent-obsessives”.

However he urged ministers to consider extending whole-life sentences to lone individuals who plan mass killings that are not motivated by terrorism.

It is currently not an offence to prepare for a non-terror attack, unless so many steps are taken towards carrying it out that it becomes an attempt.

“This means that no prosecution would be available if the police raided an address and found careful handwritten but uncommunicated plans for carrying out a massacre,” he wrote.

“It has become clear to me during the preparation of this report during January and February 2025 that there is a real and not theoretical gap for lone individuals who plan mass killing. If mass killing is intended, it is neither possible nor desirable to limit the offence to cases in which particularly extreme or terror-inducing forms of violence are intended.”

A government spokesperson said legislation would be amended to “close the gaps identified” in the report.

“Today's report is an important step in that search for answers, and to tackle horrific acts driven by a fixation on extreme violence,” they said.

They added that the government would look at the report's observation that social media was “putting long-established principles around how we communicate after an attack like this under strain” and the challenge of tackling misinformation.

A public inquiry into the Southport tragedy would be set up soon, the spokesperson said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

We are about to get a painful global lesson in why we should listen to, rather than denigrate, experts. No one wins a trade war

Earlier this month, outgoing Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau called US president Donald Trump's tariffs “very dumb”. Given the large hit to share markets this week in response to the escalating prospect of all-out trade wars and recession, some might say Trudeau's comment was an understatement.

Because the truth is, while much of the early economic analysis of the potential impact of tariffs has focused on country-level inflation and growth, the story is much more complicated, and the ripple effects are already travelling far and wide.

In its latest Statement on Monetary Policy, the Reserve Bank of Australia had a fairly optimistic view of the likely economic impact on Australia of Trump's tariffs, expecting growth to be shaved by only the narrowest of margins over the next two years, although admitting there were downside risks. We don't yet know just how many more exports may be in the firing line.

Even so, while Australia may not be slammed on its economic fundamentals anywhere near to the same extent as countries such as Canada or Mexico or China, we are not completely immune.

There are multiple channels through which tariffs will affect Australians – both those now placed on our own exports of aluminium and steel to the US, as well as those enacted throughout the world. Many American products that Australian businesses import for their own use, such as cars, trucks and specialist machinery and equipment, will become more expensive because these things invariably involve many components sourced globally. Substitutes for these goods and their inputs are not always readily available and, in this case, business costs will rise. Similarly, export demand for our raw inputs from third countries making goods headed to the US will see either demand and/or prices weaken. At the corporate level, there will be consequences for many.

And those channels of impact don't stop at the country or corporate level. The majority of us are already watching a sea of red as equity market falls have produced substantial losses in our superannuation balances.

Just under one-third of Australian super fund balances are held in overseas listed equities so, even if we don't face recession at home, and our share market manages to recover some of its recent losses, those balances remain vulnerable to the brewing global economic storm. Indeed, over the weekend, Trump himself could not rule out a recession in the US as a result of his tariff policy, which sent already nervous markets into further decline.

Undoubtedly, some of the market losses this week are a fear response to the punch and counterpunch of countries going tit-for-tat on raising tariffs in retaliation for US actions. We have no certainty around what the ultimate size or duration of economic fallout will be, because we still have no certainty around what tariff regimes will look like when the dust settles (nor other chaotic policies that may be on Trump's agenda).

But while this fear, and current market volatility, may well subside in due course, tariffs will continue to have some impact on superannuation returns by reducing economic growth and corporate profitability both here and overseas. Costs will be higher, demand will be lower and supply chains will be disrupted. Add to this increased uncertainty, which hampers corporate investment and employment, reducing future corporate growth potential and returns to shareholders, and the outlook – already uncertain – begins to look considerably less rosy.

Of course, there will be responses that will help cushion the blows, whether from governments, corporates or central banks, and our flexible exchange rate. And super fund managers will respond to recent events through changes to asset allocation, attempting to navigate short-term volatility and uncertainty against long-term value.

But all these hits come at a time when Australia, and the rest of the world, are only just beginning to emerge from the pandemic and its aftermath. While we are just seeing the signs that the pain of higher interest rates has indeed paid a dividend in bringing inflation close to target, our consumer and business confidence levels remain in a delicate condition.

It seems cruel that Trump's senseless tariffs will likely extend the economic malaise felt by so many over the past few years, here and around the world.

Almost 250 years ago, one of the founding fathers of economics, Adam Smith, published his seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, in which he explained how free trade benefited everyone. We are about to get a painful global lesson in why we should listen to, rather than denigrate, experts. No one wins a trade war.

Rodrigo Duterte arrived at The Hague on Wednesday. In photos and videos, here's how he went from president of the Philippines to defendant before the ICC.

More than eight years after launching a blood-drenched war on drugs as president of the Philippines, elected on a platform that boiled down to shoot first and ask questions later, Rodrigo Duterte, 79, arrived in The Hague on Wednesday. He was arrested the day before under a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, after years of taunting the international community to hold him accountable.

He landed in the Netherlands around 5 p.m. local time Wednesday, after a long flight from Manila that included a several-hour stopover in Dubai. His initial appearance as a suspect — during which the court confirms his identity and ensures he understands the charges and his rights — should take place within days of his arrival, ICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah said. He said ICC suspects are detained at the court's detention center, within a Dutch prison complex about a mile from the ICC headquarters.

In a video update recorded on the plane, Duterte said, “I think this is something to do with the law and order then,” referring to his brutal clampdown as president.

“I said this before to the police and military personnel that it is my job to be accountable for these things. So here it is,” he added. “I said that I will protect you. ... I will be held responsible for everything.”

His arrest is a moment of reckoning for the Philippines, where thousands were killed in a sweeping crackdown under Duterte's rule.

Duterte's push to stamp out drugs nationally began after his 2016 election victory — under a promise to continue with the approach that he used to make a name for himself in seven terms as the mayor of Davao City on the southern island of Mindanao, the country's third-most-populous city.

“Forget the laws on human rights. If I make it to the presidential palace, I will do just what I did as mayor,” he said at his final campaign rally. “You drug pushers, holdup men and do-nothings, you better get out because I'll kill you.”

“I'll dump all of you into Manila Bay and fatten all the fish there.”

He soon made good on his word.

Summary executions left victims on the street with bound limbs and taped faces, next to cardboard signs reading: “I am a drug addict.” Others were dumped in the water, sometimes loaded down with concrete.

For years, Duterte encouraged the killings in explicit terms, while denying direct state links and pointing instead to “vigilante killers” and gangland justice out of his control.

Many killings happened in murky police encounters: drug users shot in the back of the head, drug packets seemingly planted at crime scenes, the same guns found on different victims, according to reports from rights groups including Human Rights Watch. Police reports often alleged self-defense, using the Filipino stock phrase “nanlaban,” or “they fought back.”

Even as calls grew to investigate accusations of systematic, state-sanctioned killings by police, Duterte remained popular. A national survey in 2019 found that around 80 percent of Filipinos polled were “satisfied” with the administration's campaign.

The Philippine government in June 2022 reported that at least 6,252 people had died “during antidrug operations” since July 2016.

Some rights groups have said as many as 30,000 people died in the war on drugs.

Victims' families have been left for years without justice or satisfying answers.

For years, Duterte seemed to enjoy the same impunity that he appeared to extend to those who carried out killings during the drug war.

The ICC is responsible for trying individuals charged with some of the most serious crimes under international law, including genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Many such charges are largely symbolic, as the ICC does not try people in absentia. Duterte is set to join a small list of less than two dozen people who have been held in the ICC detention center and appeared before the court.

The ICC's Abdallah said that after a suspect's initial appearance, the court sets a date to begin a confirmation-of-charges hearing, at which the prosecution must present “sufficient” evidence for the case to go to trial. The suspect's defense lawyer can also present evidence. In a previous case, the confirmation-of-charges hearing came eight months after a suspect's arrival in The Hague.

Detainees at the ICC detention center have access to library books, television and news, as well as a computer to work on their cases with their defense. They're provided prepared food but can also cook for themselves and purchase additional items “according to their taste and cultural requirements,” the ICC website says. Duterte's lawyers have demanded his return to the Philippines.

Duterte has often railed against international law.

“Hitler massacred 3 million Jews. Now, there is 3 million drug addicts. … I'd be happy to slaughter them,” he said in public remarks in 2016. (More than 6 million Jewish people were killed in the Holocaust.)

As international scrutiny increased and cases began piling up, Duterte dared the international community to arrest him. He mocked the concept of human rights.

“Your concern is human rights, mine is human lives,” he said in his 2018 State of the Nation address, meaning lives lost to drug addiction.

Before a regional summit in September 2016, he said: “The campaign against drugs will continue. … Plenty will be killed until the last pusher is out of the streets. … And I don't give a s--- about anybody observing my behavior.”

He warned that “nobody has the right to lecture” him about human rights and extrajudicial killings.

“I am the president of a sovereign state. And we have long ceased to be a colony. I do not have any master except the Filipino people,” he said. He was expected to meet with then-President Barack Obama, who called the meeting off after Duterte in that briefing used a Tagalog expression literally meaning “son of a whore” in threatening to curse Obama if he raised the subject of extrajudicial killings.

The ICC began investigating Duterte in 2018, and three years later it formally authorized an investigation on accusations of extrajudicial killings amounting to a crime against humanity.

All the while, even up until his arrest, Duterte continued to dare the international community to act.

He repeatedly said he was willing to “rot in jail” to rid the Philippines of drugs.

Addressing the United Nations, United States and European Union directly in a 2016 speech, he taunted: “Come here, investigate me. … I will play with you in public.”

In December 2020, he said that “all addicts have guns. If there's even a hint of wrongdoing, any overt act, even if you don't see a gun, just go ahead and shoot him.”

“Human rights, you are preoccupied with the lives of the criminals and drug pushers,” he continued, the Philippine Star newspaper reported. “The game is killing. … I say to the human rights, I don't give a s--- with you. My order is still the same.”

After Iceland led a U.N. resolution calling for an investigation of Duterte's drug war in 2019, Duterte went on a rambling rant decrying the country's abundance of ice.

“Iceland. That's your problem. You have too much ice, and there is no clear day or night there,” he said. “So you can understand no crime. There is no policeman, either, and they just go about eating ice.”

“Please don't f--- with me. I will really kill you,” he said. “So what's wrong? I am asking the human rights people. Is it wrong to say if you destroy my country I will kill you? Is that a crime for a president, mayor or a governor to say that in public?”

At a Philippine congressional hearing in November, Duterte said, “I'm asking the ICC to hurry up,” noting that the issue had been left hanging. “And if I am found guilty, I will go to prison and rot there for all time.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

As President Donald Trump's global steel and aluminum tariffs took effect, the E.U. and Canada responded with their own levies, including on bourbon and motorcycles.

BRUSSELS — The European Union and Canada hit back Wednesday at President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs with levies of their own on billions of dollars' worth of U.S. products, including bourbon and motorcycles, while warning of further retaliation.

The European Union unveiled a two-stage response that will target up to $28 billion in U.S. exports. Canada announced 25 percent tariffs on $20.7 billion.

The U.S. decision to raise tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25 percent took effect Wednesday — the latest salvo in Trump's campaign to reshape America's trading relationship with the world.

European leaders for months warned that they would retaliate swiftly against new U.S. tariffs, even as they emphasized that a trade war would hurt both sides and tried to negotiate an off-ramp with the Trump administration.

With a deal elusive, the European Commission, the E.U.'s executive branch, said it will reimpose tariffs dating to Trump's first term on April 1. After consultations, leaders said, the commission will target an additional $19 billion in products by mid-April.

“We deeply regret this measure,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday. “Jobs are at stake, prices up, nobody needs that.” She and other leaders said they remained ready to negotiate.

Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the government is matching Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum “dollar for dollar.”

The Canadian tariffs, set to start at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, will hit steel products worth roughly $8.7 billion, aluminum products worth $2.08 billion and other products worth $9.85 billion. LeBlanc said the U.S. tariffs were unfairly targeting Canada's important steel and aluminum industry and creating “disruption and disorder” for consumers in both countries. Canada was the top steel supplier to the United States last year.

The levies also disturbed U.S. trade relations with other countries. In Brazil, officials reacted to steel tariffs with anger. The United States is the largest foreign market for Brazilian steel. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, speaking at a car factory in southeastern Brazil, said he wouldn't be intimidated.

“It doesn't matter if Trump keeps yelling, because I've learned not to be frightened of an ugly face,” Lula said. “Speak calmly with me, speak with respect to me.”

But Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said Wednesday that his country was not ready to retaliate. He said the Brazilian steel sector does not compete with the American steel industry but collaborates with it, and Brazil will try to negotiate a way out of the impasse. Later, the Lula administration said it might complain to the World Trade Organization. “The Brazilian government laments the decision taken by the American government,” the administration said in a statement.

South Korea, Japan and Australia, security allies that sell significant volumes of steel and aluminum to the United States, held out hope for exemptions from the tariffs, though Trump has insisted there will be none. All were granted carve-outs from Trump's tariffs in 2018; none retaliated Wednesday.

E.U. officials said their countermeasures would be designed for maximum political pressure. They hoped they would give the 27-nation bloc leverage to reach a deal.

The sides have been here before. When Trump imposed tariffs on the European Union during his first term, its leaders responded with levies on industries based in the home states of Republican leaders, such as bourbon from Kentucky, represented by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and iconic American products such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Levi's jeans.

Those tariffs were suspended after negotiations with the Biden administration. But that suspension will now be allowed to expire April 1.

E.U. leaders will consult with member states and industry leaders on additional tariffs.

The European Commission published a 99-page list of U.S. goods that could be hit, including chewing gum, soybeans, home appliances, beef, poultry and alcoholic beverages. Some tariffs could again target the home states of Republican leaders, such as Louisiana, represented by House Speaker Mike Johnson. There is also a focus on goods that can be secured from other countries.

“We're trying to hit the U.S. in important sectors for them, where it does not cost us much,” said a senior E.U. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. Another goal, the official said, is to prompt American businesses to convey to the Trump administration that “this is a bad idea.”

European leaders have long made clear that they would prefer to negotiate and persuade Trump to forgo tariffs. Their two-step approach, and the nearly three weeks before it starts, appears to allow time for that.

The disruption is “avoidable if the U.S. administration accepts our extended hand and works with us to strike a deal,” E.U. Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said.

Officials in Europe, like other U.S. trading partners, have tried to strike a delicate balance between launching countermeasures to deter further U.S. tariffs and containing harm to their economies. They have struggled to engage with a U.S. administration that has at times fluctuated between threats and backpedaling — and to gauge whom to lobby in the administration, diplomats say.

Analysts said Europe will have to be prepared for escalation.

“This is only the first act. We'll have to see how all of this develops,” said Ignacio García Bercero, a former European Commission trade official. “There's so much unpredictability these days.” The administration has pledged more tariffs on a broader range of imports from U.S. trading partners that could start in April.

The United States is Europe's largest export market. Key European economies were already dealing with sluggish growth. Now businesses are bracing for the prospect of a protracted trade war.

Germany, the bloc's leading exporter to the United States, would be particularly vulnerable, with some of the biggest anticipated effects on the car and pharmaceutical industries. Industry leaders have also warned that a U.S.-China trade war could have spillover impact on Europe: China could divert cheap goods to the continent, unwelcome competition for businesses.

The European Union has been preparing for U.S. tariffs. At bloc headquarters in Brussels, a group dubbed the “Trump task force” has been strategizing for Trump's return since last year and focusing on preparing for trade scenarios.

Yet Sefcovic, who visited Washington recently, said this week that the Trump administration “did not seem to be engaging” with European overtures to negotiate. “We jointly identified the few areas that would allow us to move forward by fostering a mutual benefit,” he told reporters. “But in the end, one hand cannot clap.”

The resumption of U.S. military and intelligence aid for Ukraine follows a contentious White House meeting between the American and Ukrainian leaders, but Moscow is unlikely to agree to the proposed ceasefire.

KYIV — The resumption of U.S. aid and intelligence sharing following peace talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, has reignited hope in Kyiv that Washington is willing to be a partner in ending the war with Moscow, even as resistance to a ceasefire mounted in Russia and the Kremlin declined to immediately endorse the proposal.

Pro-Kremlin Russian analysts, politicians and nationalist military bloggers said Russia would probably reject the ceasefire as a trap that would harm Russian interests and benefit Ukraine.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that envoys were headed to Moscow with the proposal. “It's up to Russia now,” he said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — whom the Trump administration had accused of being unready for peace after last month's contentious White House visit — described the meeting in a news conference Wednesday as “positive” and “constructive” and said it gave Ukraine a chance to signal to the United States its willingness for peace.

“We're not planning on playing with the narrative that ‘we don't want to end the war' that Russia is spreading all over the world. For me, it's important to end the war,” he said. “I want the president of the U.S. to see this, for Americans to see this and to feel this.”

He said that discussions included talk of returning prisoners and children and that the ceasefire would be a chance to work on a more comprehensive peace deal. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.

The agreement would temporarily freeze more than 1,800 miles of front lines in their current position — where Russian forces appear to hold the upper hand — and the White House has appeared eager for a Kremlin endorsement. Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz, discussed the proposal with his Russian counterpart on Wednesday, and special envoy Steve Witkoff will be dispatched to Moscow later this week, a spokeswoman said.

President Vladimir Putin has consistently stated that a temporary ceasefire would be unacceptable to Moscow. On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said only that Russia would not be “getting ahead of ourselves” and would scrutinize the ceasefire proposal and review the joint statement.

The bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday between Washington and Kyiv marked an improvement in the relationship between Ukraine and its most important backer, which had chilled in the aftermath of the disastrous Oval Office meeting. In a joint statement, the United States and Kyiv vowed to “immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the talks in Jeddah, said Wednesday: “We all eagerly await the Russian response, and we urge them strongly to consider ending all hostilities.”

He said if Russia answered positively, “then we know we've made real progress, and there's a real chance of peace. If their response is no, it would be highly unfortunate, and it'll make their intentions clear.”

“The ball is truly in their court,” Rubio added, as he traveled to a meeting of Group of Seven foreign ministers in Quebec.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), a close ally of Trump, said that Zelensky had proved support for peace and that he was skeptical that Russia would accept the ceasefire.

“It is now up to Putin to show his cards. In order to move toward peace, I will be introducing bone-breaking sanctions and tariffs against Russia before the end of the week. If they do not pursue the ceasefire with the same vigor as Ukraine, there will be hell to pay,” he posted on X.

Putin ruled out a truce or temporary ceasefire in July, while insisting that “Russia stands for a complete and final end to the conflict,” which according to his conditions for peace would involve Ukraine's demilitarization, neutrality and surrender of large chunks of territory. He maintained that a “truce or temporary ceasefire, or some kind of pause” would be used by Kyiv “to recover losses, regroup and rearm.”

Russian politicians, nationalists and military bloggers have expressed their opposition to a ceasefire. Even before the proposal was announced, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke against it on Tuesday.

Russian far-right ideologue Alexander Dugin, whose revanchist ideas are believed to influence Putin, said that Moscow would certainly reject the ceasefire proposal. He argued Wednesday on X that it would be contrary to what he sees as Trump's ideology of a world in which great powers carve up the globe into spheres of influence.

“The present stand on ceasefire is inconsistent in face of the Great Powers World Order he himself advocates,” Dugin wrote, referring to Trump. “Knowing that a Russian answer to so-called ‘ceasefire' will be decisive NO, warmongers from the International Deep State repeat this mantra that ‘the ball is on Russia's side.' That serves to justify the war. Another tricky trap for MAGA. Think better,” he wrote in another post.

In Kyiv, however, the atmosphere Tuesday was cautiously jubilant, despite air sirens echoing in the night — probably in retaliation for Ukraine's massive drone attack on Moscow earlier in the week. In the city's historic Independence Square, known as the Maidan, a few people walked past a makeshift memorial to fallen soldiers, some stopping to pay their respects. Sisters-in-law Karina and Oksana Harei wrote messages on small Ukrainian flags to add to the thousands speared in the damp spring soil.

“We are writing the names of our defenders,” Karina said. “Our friends, just people we know who defended us.” The war had been terrible, with too many people dying — including children — and she hoped it would end soon.

Nearby, Daryna Smilyanets also stopped in the square. “I'm trying to hold on, to believe in the best,” she said. “I want all this to be worthwhile and for it to end, for everyone to return, for those who are in captivity, for those who are fighting, for everyone to come home alive.”

Russian attacks on Ukraine continued overnight, killing five people — four in Odessa and one in Kryvyi Rih.

There has also been fierce fighting in Russia's Kursk region, where Ukraine has been holding a steadily diminishing sliver of land that it hoped to use as a bargaining chip in negotiations. Russian state agencies posted a video of a Russian flag in Sudzha's city center, an indication that the town might have fallen.

The Ukrainian military declined to answer questions about the situation in Sudzha, but in his briefing, Zelensky said the military in Kursk is “executing its tasks; the Russians are trying to push out our military as much as possible.”

On Tuesday, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian brigade that has been fighting in the Kursk region since January said the situation has rapidly deteriorated, that the Russians have “massed their forces very seriously” along the front line and “memorized all of our logistical routes.” The commander, who declined to provide his name or call signal because of security concerns, said it has become impossible for troops “to drive in or out from the territory of Kursk oblast to the territory of Ukraine” to resupply.

“Honestly,” he said, “slowly and slowly they pushed us to the point that we couldn't put up a fight there any longer.” It was unclear, however, how many Ukrainian troops remain in the enclave.

Russia's successes there and slow advances elsewhere along the front are why Moscow should not agree to the proposed ceasefire, said Sen. Konstantin Kosachyov, deputy speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament.

“Russia is on the offensive, so things will be different with Russia. Any agreements, with understanding for the need for compromises, will be reached on our terms, not American. This is not boasting, but an understanding that real agreements are still being written there, at the front. Washington also needs to realize that,” he wrote on Telegram.

Konstantin Malofeev, a conservative tycoon with ties to the Kremlin, claimed on Telegram that Russian fighters had “unfurled the Imperial flag in the center of Sudzha.”

“They unfurled it calmly, confidently, in the middle of the square. That's all you need to know about ‘30-day truces,' ‘freezing the conflict,' ‘NATO peacekeeping forces.' Only Russia can end the war and only on its own terms,” he wrote.

In Kyiv, though, the troubles on the front were largely eclipsed by the outcome of the Jeddah meeting, which “exceeded the most optimistic expectations,” Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko wrote on Facebook, positing that Trump was aiming for a ceasefire by Easter. The question, he said, was how the Kremlin would respond.

“For Putin, there is a difficult dilemma — Ukraine or Trump,” Fesenko said. “Just yesterday, he must have hoped to get both, with Trump's help to bend Ukraine to surrender, eventually restore control of Ukraine, and in parallel agree with Trump on various tactical and possibly strategic issues. And now he will have to choose.”

The Pakistani military said it had completed a deadly rescue operation in the embattled southwest of the country after armed separatists hijacked a train.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan's military said Wednesday that a two-day battle with separatist militants over a hijacked passenger train had ended in bloodshed, claiming the lives of at least 25 soldiers and civilians held hostage and dozens of militants.

Fighters belonging to a Baluch separatist group, the Baluchistan Liberation Army, or BLA, stopped and boarded the train, the Jaffar Express, in a mountainous part of Baluchistan province on Tuesday. More than 400 people were believed to be on board when the train was seized. About 150 of them were members of the security forces, Pakistani railway officials said.

Earlier Wednesday, the BLA claimed it still held 150 hostages and threatened to kill them if a rescue operation was attempted, urging Pakistani officials to negotiate a prisoner exchange instead. The group gave the Pakistani government 48 hours to respond, with the deadline set to expire Thursday at noon. The group said it had already killed more than 100 hostages and security forces.

Hours later, Pakistan's military said its operation to free the hostages has been completed. The army said it had killed all 33 attackers and lost four of its men. The BLA did not immediately respond to that claim.

The Washington Post could not independently confirm the death toll or establish how many of the dead were civilians.

The Pakistani government, facing a widening security crisis in the country's restive southwest, appeared to rule out negotiations from the start. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Tuesday that the “cowardly terrorists, who carried out this despicable attack, are not deserving of any leniency,” according to the Express Tribune.

Pakistani officials accused the militants of using women and children as human shields on the hijacked train — a claim that the group denied.

Mohammad Ashraf, a passenger who was released, said the militants allowed some of them to leave after separating him, other elderly people, and women and children from the remaining passengers. “It was so quiet — everyone was in fear,” he told Pakistani television crews.

The Jaffar Express left Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan, at about 9 a.m. and was expected to traverse much of Punjab province before arriving in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, more than 30 hours later. It was attacked roughly three to four hours into the trip. Some passengers may have taken the train because, after months of worsening security incidents along Baluchistan's highways, it was seen as the last safe method of transportation.

The train hijacking is a major blow to Pakistan's military and civilian leadership, which are struggling to realize their plans to integrate the volatile southwestern province into Pakistan's trade corridor with China. The deepwater Gwadar port in southern Baluchistan is a key component of that plan.

Militant attacks in that part of Pakistan surged by more than 80 percent last year, killing more than 320 people, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies. Most attacks have been claimed by the BLA and its ideological ally, the Baluchistan Liberation Front.

Their attacks have made parts of the province “ungovernable,” Pakistani security analyst Hasan Askari Rizvi said, adding that Tuesday's train hijacking signals “a grave security challenge for Pakistan.”

Dozens of people were killed in a BLA suicide attack at a Quetta railway station in November, which targeted a group of soldiers.

There are also Baluch communities in neighboring Iran and Afghanistan, and Pakistani officials have frequently accused the BLA and other groups of exploiting porous borders to evade capture and sustain their insurgency.

Pakistan's military said in its statement late Wednesday that “the attack was orchestrated and directed by terrorist ring leaders operating from Afghanistan, who were in direct communication with the terrorists throughout the incident.” The army urged the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to “deny use of its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan,” it said.

Abdul Qahar Balkhi, a spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry, “categorically” rejected the Pakistani claims, writing in a post on X on Thursday that the Baluch “opposition” does not operate from Afghanistan and has no links to the Taliban.

Analysts warn that Baluchistan's militancy is at least in part fueled by broader and more widely felt grievances over rampant poverty and neglect. The government and its foreign partners are seen by separatists as exploiting the region's vast natural resources with little benefit to local communities.

“A large share of Baluchistan's youths feel alienated, marginalized and excluded from their fair share of the province's economic development,” Rizvi said. “There should be a dialogue to win these people back.”

The BLA has claimed at least 10 attacks on Chinese targets since 2017, including a blast in Karachi in October that killed two Chinese workers.

Baluch militants have also targeted ethnic Punjabi civilians, whom they view as complicit in the government's plans for the region. Officials documented at least 15 attacks against non-Baluch workers, travelers or settlers last year.

The comments signal there will be tough negotiations ahead that could frustrate President Donald Trump's hope for a swift peace deal.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday refused to fully embrace a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war, stating that there were “nuances” that required “painstaking research,” especially since Russian forces were advancing in the war.

The Russian leader was due to meet President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff later Thursday evening to discuss the ceasefire proposal, which earlier one of his top aides had dismissed as unworkable. Putin's comments allow Russia to engage in protracted negotiations without immediately rejecting a truce.

Putin, who thanked Trump for his efforts to resolve the conflict, said that Russia would agree to a ceasefire, but only if it led to long term peace, hinting that Russia wanted to place conditions on a ceasefire, such as barring Ukraine from receiving arms from the United States or mobilizing new forces. He also questioned how a ceasefire would be verified, indicating that complex negotiations would be required before he could endorse it.

“The idea in itself is the right one, and we certainly support it but there are issues that we need to discuss,” Putin said. “We should talk to our U.S. colleagues, maybe in a call with President Trump.”

Putin also talked about how Russian troops were advancing against the remaining Ukrainian forces in its southern Kursk region. “If we stop fighting for 30 days, what does that mean? That everyone who's there will get out without a fight?”

He said agreeing on the next steps to end the conflict will depend “on how the situation develops on the ground,” in a clear reference to Russia's ongoing military successes.

Putin on Wednesday sent a defiant military message with a rare appearance in a camouflage uniform to mark Russian advances against Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. He urged his forces to fight on, evict Ukrainian forces from the Russian territory and drive forward to create a security zone on the border inside Ukraine.

Putin's statements on the ceasefire, however, were softer than the earlier ones made by his aide Yuri Ushakov, who is on Russia's negotiating team in talks with the United States over the Ukraine war. Ushakov told the state broadcaster that he had outlined Moscow's opposition to a 30-day ceasefire to national security adviser Michael Waltz in a phone call.

“The proposed temporary ceasefire in Ukraine is nothing more than a reprieve for the Ukrainian military,” Ushakov said. “Russia seeks a long-term peace settlement on Ukraine that addresses Moscow's interests and concerns. Steps that mimic peaceful actions are of no use to anyone.”

Putin has repeatedly opposed calls for a short term ceasefire. In January, at a meeting of Russia's Security Council, he said that the goal of the settlement should be “not a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but long-term peace.”

Trump envoy Witkoff arrived in Moscow Thursday and is expected to meet with Putin that night to discuss the U.S. ceasefire proposal. Witkoff met Putin last month and negotiated a deal for the release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, setting the scene for the talks between Russia and the United States in Riyadh and Istanbul. At the time, Witkoff said Trump's friendship with Putin had enabled the negotiations and would continue to do so.

Putin's talk of lengthy discussions over the terms of the ceasefire would likely mean that fighting will continue, and hundreds or thousands more lives could be lost — a prospect at odds with Trump's stated desire for the end to the bloodshed.

It would also allow Russia to capture more territory and continue its slow advance in eastern Ukraine. It has been three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who joined Putin at his briefing, said earlier it would be difficult for Russia to agree to the ceasefire, because it was advancing on the front line. “As Trump said, they hold high cards in their hands,” he said, adding these could allow Russia to “start winning this card game. Then an agreement will be reached.”

Fighting continued in southern Russia where Ukraine's seven-month-old occupation of a sliver of Russian territory in the Kursk region appeared to be nearing an end. Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of staff of the Russian armed forces, told Putin on Wednesday that the operation to evict enemy forces was in its final stages.

With the Russian Defense Ministry announcing Thursday the recapture of Sudzha — the largest town once under Ukrainian control — Moscow looks set to strip Kyiv of a territorial bargaining chip that it had hoped to use in peace talks brokered by the Trump administration.

A Ukrainian drone commander who has been fighting in Kursk since August said his brigade was “gradually withdrawing.” He said troops are holding onto parts of Sudzha to give other units time to withdraw.

“We will try to hold them at the Ukrainian border,” said Andriy, who asked that his last name not be used because he was not authorized to speak with the media. “I think the Russians will try to advance further and enter Sumy region. This is what we are fighting against right now.”

Ukraine's army chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, said on Wednesday that combat operations continued in the Kursk region, even as the Russian offensive was pushing steadily forward. Syrsky said Russia had “almost completely destroyed” the town of Sudzha with its aerial bombardment.

In the official video released Wednesday that the Kremlin said showed a uniformed Putin visiting a command point in the Kursk region, Putin ordered Gerasimov to drive Ukrainian forces from the region as quickly as possible and to “completely destroy the enemy.”

Putin's appearance in uniform is a signal of determination to complete the operation to liberate the Kursk region in the very near future,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian media. Many pro-war nationalist military bloggers also took it as a sign the Russian leader would press ahead with the war.

“The previous status along the border must be restored,” Putin said in the video. Any captured prisoners should be treated as terrorists, he added, fueling concerns about Russian mistreatment of prisoners after widespread allegations of torture of Ukrainian POWs by Russian forces.

Putin also said Russia must send forces into Ukraine to create what he called a “security zone” inside Ukraine, in a sign he intends to drive forward ahead of proposed peace negotiations.

In the past, Putin has called for a security corridor on Ukrainian territory — not Russian-occupied land — as a condition of any peace agreement.

Ukraine's August incursion and occupation of Russian territory shattered Putin's often-stated red line that attacks on Russian territory were unacceptable, and Russia was forced to deploy North Korean troops to the region in an effort to win back the territory.

Gerasimov said Kyiv “aimed to create a so-called strategic foothold in the Kursk region to use it later as a bargaining chip in the potential talks with Russia.”

He added: “The plan of our enemy has failed.”

Russia's terms for a peace deal have so far remained sweeping and inflexible, including shutting Ukraine out of NATO, recognition of Russia's land grab as legitimate and demilitarizing Ukraine, leaving it with a small army incapable of deterring future attacks.

Russia's position so far appears to hew closely to the recommendations on negotiating tactics and approach by an influential Moscow-based think tank close to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), which set out Russia's maximalist demands for any end to the conflict in Ukraine.

Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, on Thursday once more spelled out Russia's maximalist conditions, in an indication that the peace negotiations will be difficult. He ruled out any chance of Russia ceding any of the land it has seized, insisting that it was Russian territory that could never be returned.

“Crimea, Sevastopol, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk — these are regions of Russia. They are written into the constitution. This is a given fact,” he said.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Thursday also ruled out the presence of any foreign peacekeepers in Ukraine — a plan being mulled by European nations as a security guarantee for any future agreement.

“Russia does not accept the deployment of armed forces of other countries in Ukraine,” she said. “It would mean involvement in the conflict.” If this occurred, “Moscow will react with all means.""","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The document, written in February by a Moscow-based think tank close to Russia's Federal Security Service, lays out Russia's maximalist demands.

Russia should work to weaken the U.S. negotiating position on Ukraine by stoking tensions between the Trump administration and other countries while pushing ahead with Moscow's efforts to dismantle the Ukrainian state, according to a document prepared for the Kremlin.

The document, written in February by an influential Moscow-based think tank close to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), lays out Russia's maximalist demands for any end to the conflict in Ukraine. It dismisses President Donald Trump's preliminary plans for a peace deal within 100 days as “impossible to realize” and says that “a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis cannot happen before 2026.”

The document also rejects any plan to dispatch peacekeepers to Ukraine, as some in Europe have proposed, and insists on recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the Ukrainian territories it has seized. It also calls for a further carve-up through the creation of a buffer zone in Ukraine's northeast on the border with Russian regions such as Bryansk and Belgorod, as well as a demilitarized zone in southern Ukraine near Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. The latter would affect the Odessa region.

In addition, the document discusses the need for “the complete dismantling” of the current Ukrainian government.

The document, which was obtained by a European intelligence service and reviewed by The Washington Post, highlights the challenges still facing Trump in reaching any agreement with Russia for a peace deal, now that Kyiv has endorsed Washington's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, appearing to bridge a divide between the two countries.

While Russia has yet to signal that it would sign up for any ceasefire, analysts warned that Moscow still has a multitude of ways it could drag out agreeing to even a temporary pause in hostilities. The road to any long-term peace agreement remains treacherous, they said.

Russia is “not interested in an early resolution of the Ukraine crisis,” said Thomas Graham, a senior director for Russia at the National Security Council under George W. Bush and now a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “They consistently talk about the root causes, which, as you know, are about the domestic politics in Ukraine, and even more important than that, the European security architecture, which would be the role of NATO. And a simple ceasefire which doesn't take that into account is of no interest to Russia. And Trump doesn't appear to understand.”

Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin “was not aware of such recommendations,” calling them “extremely contradictory” and adding, “We are working with more-considered options.”

The document was prepared by a think tank working closely with the FSB's Fifth Service, the division that oversees operations in Ukraine, in the week ahead of talks between Russia and the United States in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which took place on Feb. 18. A Russian academic close to senior Russian diplomats said the main thrust of the recommendations reflects the broad consensus in Moscow, but added that it is never clear to what degree the Kremlin leadership reacts to documents being prepared for it.

While hawkish members of the Russian elite are urging the Kremlin to continue the war and “use the current situation to advance further,” other groups are pressing for a speedier resolution of the conflict and “for a ceasefire at least,” he said.

The FSB-linked document lays out ways in which Russia could boost its negotiating position by exacerbating tensions between the United States and both China and the European Union, and by proposing U.S. access to Russian minerals, including in the territories it occupies in Ukraine. Among them is the eastern region of Donbas, where the document says there are reserves of rare-earth metals.

In an interview on Feb. 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin said much the same when he suggested that Moscow could invite U.S. companies to develop Russian mineral deposits, including in the occupied territories in Ukraine. That appeared to be an effort to undermine a proposed accord on mineral resources development between Ukraine and the United States.

The document says Russia's efforts should first be focused on normalizing relations between Washington and Moscow, through the restoration of full diplomatic staffing levels at both countries' embassies and the appointment of Alexander Darchiev as Russia's ambassador to the United States — suggestions that emerged publicly after talks between Russian and U.S. officials in Istanbul on Feb. 27, which apparently focused on the operations of their respective diplomatic missions.

The document proposes that Russia agree not to station its Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Belarus, on the border with the European Union, while in return the United States would agree not to place new missile systems on the continent. It suggests, too, that Russia stop weapons supplies to countries considered “unfriendly” to the United States, while in return the United States would stop arming Ukraine. But it adds that ending Russian arms supplies to Moscow's allies would be “difficult to realize.”

The document dismisses what it says are initial proposals made by Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, for a peace agreement in which one suggested element would be Ukraine's ceding of territories taken by Russia and Kyiv's agreement not to attempt to regain them in the future through military or diplomatic means.

The FSB-linked document says, however, that even this type of settlement does not go far enough and that without official recognition of Russian sovereignty over the seized region, it is “fairly likely” the armed conflict will resume in the medium term, “for example after the next change of administration in the U.S.”

The document also dismisses any potential political concessions by Ukraine — such as Kyiv's rejection of NATO membership and the holding of elections in which pro-Russian parties would be allowed to participate — as not being far-reaching enough. “In reality, the current Kyiv regime cannot be changed from inside the country. Its complete dismantling is needed,” it says.

The presence of any peacekeeping contingent in Ukraine is also dismissed as “absolutely unnecessary,” since any force would be under “serious Western influence.” U.S. plans to continue arming Ukraine after any peace deal are “absolutely unacceptable,” the document says, as is maintaining the Ukrainian army at its current 1 million-strong level.

Efforts to entice Russia into a peace deal by offering to partially lift sanctions were also dismissed in the document. “It's not clear what would be the benefit for Russia,” it says, since “the importance of the factor of sanctions against our country has been clearly exaggerated.”

Boris Bondarev, a Geneva-based former Russian diplomat, said Russia is trying to lure Trump into talks by demonstrating its “openness and flexibility.”  Putin, meanwhile, wants to drag out the negotiations by positioning himself as “a real, true friend to Donald Trump who understands him completely, who  … wants to help him achieve his goals in United States,” Bondarev said. “But of course he would need something from him because he cannot do it just free.”

Dmitri Alperovitch, chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a national security think tank, said it could be difficult for Putin to reject the ceasefire proposal outright without risking Moscow's potential realignment with Washington. “The stakes now [in his view] are much more than just Ukraine — the bigger prize is the US-Russia diplomatic normalization, dropping of sanctions, driving a wedge within NATO,” Alperovitch said in a post on X.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

With crises from Sudan to Gaza, the United Nations is estimating that it will not be able to help some 200 million people in desperate need of humanitarian aid this year.

Cuts to foreign aid and humanitarian assistance by donors across the board, but especially by the United States, have been “a seismic shock,” the United Nations' chief humanitarian official said Wednesday. “Many will die because that aid is drying up.”

As the United Nations and other aid agencies try to regroup and find new efficiencies, the goal is to help at least 100 million priority cases out of an estimate of about 300 million people in desperate need of humanitarian aid this year, said Tom Fletcher, the U.N. undersecretary of humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator.

“We will have to save as many people as we can with the money we have. Not the money that we had, nor the money that we would like,” Fletcher told reporters at a briefing at U.N. headquarters in New York. “We'll have to build fresh arguments … find new sources of funding. We'll have to fight back. We'll have to reimagine what we do.”

His remarks came as the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, stopping tens of billions of dollars Washington distributes each year to humanitarian aid. In a social media post this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that 83 percent of all USAID programs have been canceled and that the remainder will be folded into the State Department.

At the same time, much of the U.S. funding for humanitarian, development, democracy and law enforcement initiatives through the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security and other U.S. agencies — as well as directly from the State Department — around the world has been frozen. While totaling less than 1 percent of the federal budget, U.S. assistance funds anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of all global aid expenditures, depending on the location and program.

Rubio, who was one of the strongest supporters of foreign aid as a senator, has instituted a 90-day review of all assistance programs to determine which should be permanently discontinued. But the abrupt pause in the distribution of funding — set in motion by the U.S. DOGE Service, led by Elon Musk — has already resulted in the shutdown of many programs that humanitarian organizations say will be difficult, if not impossible, to restart in the short or medium term.

Although some programs have been granted waivers for what Rubio has called “life-saving” activities, many humanitarian organizations say that the process is confusing and that they still cannot access money that they have been told has been cleared for expenditure.

Aid levels have been falling throughout the world for years, with the United Nations and other groups rarely able to reach their annual funding or emergency appeal targets. An emergency U.N. campaign for Sudan, where an estimated 30 million people are in extreme need of basic assistance for food, medical care and shelter, has reached between 5 and 10 percent of its funding target so far, Fletcher said. About 10 percent of all nongovernmental organization, or NGO, workers for humanitarian agencies were laid off during February, he said.

He also called on Israel to restart the distribution of aid in Gaza, where borders were closed two weeks ago as the fragile ceasefire verged on unraveling. During a January tour there before the latest cutoff, Fletcher said, “it was much, much worse than I'd anticipated, and I'd really prepared myself for the worst,” he said. He described complete destruction and “miles and miles of rubble” in northern Gaza without a single building left standing and feral dogs roaming piles of rubble in search of corpses to eat.

In addition to overseeing U.N. humanitarian programs, Fletcher leads the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, a coordination forum for organizations within and outside of the U.N. system to set strategic priorities and mobilize resources in response to humanitarian crises.

In a “humanitarian reset” document distributed Tuesday, he set out 10 actions to deal with the funding crisis, including tasking senior representatives to report by the end of this week on how they can “prioritize urgent life-saving actions.” He also stressed the need to find new funding sources, including from wealthy Persian Gulf countries and renewed grassroots appeals for private donations.

At the same time, Fletcher wrote, the aid community is not without responsibility for its problems. “Much of the change we need is about the way we work,” he wrote, saying there was already agreement “to be ruthless in eliminating turf wars and challenging our organizations to work genuinely together … to give up power and to act collectively where possible to share information and data.”

Acknowledging overlap and wasteful practices, he proposed the increased pooling of resources to “collectively finance common services” such as humanitarian air bridges, data collection and analysis, and rapid-response mechanisms.

“We have been reliant in recent years, over-reliant, on U.S. funding,” Fletcher said. “Almost half of our appeals have been funded by the American taxpayer. It's important to recognize that we shouldn't ever take that for granted, particularly in a period of economic difficulty and in a period when many governments are in retreat from the world.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, quickly condemned the report's findings as baseless.

TEL AVIV — A U.N. report released Thursday accused Israel of carrying out “systematic” gender-based violence during its 17-month war in the Gaza Strip, including by shelling fertility clinics and hospital maternity wards, causing maternal deaths by blocking aid deliveries, and subjecting male and female detainees to sexual humiliation or abuse.

The 49-page report, by a U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry, said that “Israeli authorities have destroyed in part the reproductive capacity of the Palestinians in Gaza as a group, including by imposing measures intended to prevent births, one of the categories of genocidal acts in the Rome Statute and the Genocide Convention.”

Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, quickly condemned the report's findings as baseless.

“Instead of focusing on the crimes against humanity and the war crimes that were perpetrated by the Hamas terrorist organization in the worst massacre carried out against the Jewish People since the Holocaust, the UN has again chosen to attack the State of Israel with false accusations, including baseless accusations of sexual violence,” Netanyahu said in a statement.

A report last year by the U.N. commission that investigated killings, torture and other crimes by Hamas and affiliated Palestinian militant groups during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel found “reasonable grounds” that perpetrators had committed sexual violence. Another U.N. report, from March 2024, found “reasonable grounds to believe” that victims were subjected to rape, gang rape and other forms of gender-based violence in several locations in Israel on Oct. 7.

The report released Thursday focused in part on what the United Nations said was an intentional attack by Israeli forces on the Basma IVF clinic in Gaza, the enclave's main fertility center, in December 2023. The attack destroyed about  4,000 cryogenically frozen embryos, along with 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilized eggs.

The report's authors said they did not “find any evidence that this IVF clinic was a legitimate military target at the time that it was attacked” by Israeli forces, adding that they concluded that “the destruction of the Basma IVF clinic was a measure intended to prevent births among Palestinians in Gaza.”

Israeli violations cited in the reported included the “forced public nudity and stripping” of Palestinian men and boys; the sexual assault of detainees in Israeli custody; and the willful killings of civilians — which, taken together, “form part of the [Israeli military's] standard operating procedures towards Palestinians,” the report said.

Attacks on “healthcare facilities offering sexual and reproductive healthcare services have impacted about 540,000 women and girls of reproductive age in Gaza,” the report said.

Israel's mission to the United Nations in Geneva, in a lengthy rebuttal released Thursday in response to the commission's report, said the Israeli military has “concrete directives, procedures, orders, and policies” that prevented the kind of misconduct the report described, adding that allegations of sexual violence were investigated in line with international norms.

Earlier this month, during a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza, Israel halted aid deliveries and cut electricity to a desalination plant in the enclave, saying the move was intended to pressure Hamas into accepting an extension of the recent ceasefire and to release the dozens of hostages the militant group still holds. Aid agencies have called for an immediate resumption of relief supplies, warning of further hardship for Palestinian civilians after nearly a year and a half of war.

“Israel's decision to suspend all aid and goods from entering Gaza is already depriving families of food and medicine. Over the last week the costs of essential goods in the market, including produce, flour, and oil, has more than doubled,” Kate Phillips-Barrasso of the humanitarian aid group Mercy Corps said in a statement Thursday.

“Gaza cannot afford a return to war,” she said. “Millions of lives are at stake.”

Israel's energy minister said Sunday that he would immediately cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip, in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas on negotiations after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired on March 1. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Widely shared video of the woman holding the baby wombat prompted Australian authorities to open an investigation into her visa status.

An American influencer who was filmed snatching a baby wombat from its mother has sparked deep upset in Australia, prompting an investigation by immigration authorities into her visa status, ire from the country's prime minister and a mass petition calling for her deportation.

In the 34-second clip, which cascaded across social media this week, a woman is seen grabbing the joey from the side of a road as its mother follows suit. The Instagram account that posted the video identifies her as Sam Jones, a wildlife biologist from Montana.

“I caught a baby wombat,” she tells the camera. “Okay, mom is right there, and she is pissed,” she adds, before eventually placing the animal back on the road.

“My dream of holding a wombat has been realized!” the video's caption read, according to Australian media. “Baby and mom slowly waddled back off together into the bush,” it added — a claim that was not immediately verifiable. The location and time of the recording, which was no longer publicly accessible Thursday, was not immediately clear.

Australian media identified the influencer as Samantha Strable, an outdoor influencer who has posed with hunted wildlife while visiting Australia. She did not respond to attempts to contact her on Thursday.

The clip was shared widely online among Australians, who take fierce pride in their role as custodians to one of the richest and most varied wildlife ecosystems on the planet, eventually catching the attention of the country's leader.

“To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress to its mother, is just an outrage,” said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in a television interview on Thursday. “I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there.”

Australia's home affairs office has also launched an investigation into potential breaches of immigration law following the video, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement shared with The Washington Post on Thursday. “The department is now working through the conditions on her current visa,” he said.

“Either way, given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again, I'll be surprised if she even bothers,” Burke said. “I can't wait for Australia to see the back of this individual.”

Over 24,000 people have also signed an online petition, launched Wednesday, calling for Australian authorities to deport the woman and bar her from future travels to the country.

Australian animal rights organizations identified the joey as a bare-nosed wombat and said the human interference and separation from its mother could have severe consequences for the animals.

“There is no clear evidence that the joey was successfully reunited with its mother. A baby of this size is highly dependent on its mother, and prolonged separation could have fatal consequences,” said Marie Wynan, director of Australia's Wombat Protection Society, in an email Thursday. “Additionally, without proper training in wildlife handling, the tourist not only risked injuring the joey but also putting herself in danger.”

Wynan also warned that it was dangerous to place a wombat in the road, putting  it at risk  of being hit by a passing vehicle.

John Creighton, who operates a wombat rescue center in New South Wales, said in an email Thursday that he “found the entire video quite difficult and uncomfortable to watch.”

“Wombats are highly intelligent mammals, and the emotional bonds between a mother and her joey are very strong,” he wrote.

He also noted that — while not normally aggressive — mothers can be defensive when separated from their offspring.

“With big teeth, an incredibly powerful jaw and lightning speed in close quarters, wombats are capable of doing some serious damage with just one bite. This young woman should consider herself fortunate that she did not have to learn this first hand on this occasion,” Creighton said.

The bare-nosed wombat is one of three wombat species in Australia and is mainly found in forested areas of the country's south east. According to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, the marsupial — which is largely nocturnal and mostly solitary — can grow up to 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds) in weight and can reach 115 centimeters from head to tail. They have powerful claws designed for digging a tunnel system, which can range from two to 20 meters in length.

Wildlife protection laws vary between Australian states, but those found guilty of harming wildlife can face penalties including fines. In New South Wales, for example, it is an offense to harm a wombat without a license.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

            Authorities have ramped up their efforts by air, sea and land to track down the 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student who went missing six days ago while vacationing in the Dominican Republic resort town of Punta Cana.
    


            Sudiksha Konanki, 20, vanished at the beach of the Riu República Hotel in the early hours of March 6, sparking a frantic search involving authorities from the Dominican Republic, the United States and India, where Konanki's family is originally from.
    


            Nearly one week after she was last seen, there are few concrete clues about what might have happened to her.

            The Dominican Republic National Police formed a “high-level commission” to work on the investigation, alongside the general prosecutor's office, the FBI and the international liaison of the US Embassy, the national police said this week.
    


            Authorities are investigating Konanki's disappearance as an “accident” and conducting a “special search operation in the ocean,” Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader said in a news conference this week.
    


            “We are concerned,” he said. “All government agencies are searching.”
    


            The Dominican Republic receives more than 11 million visitors per year and prides itself on being a safe place for tourists, Abinader said. “We are one of the safest countries, not just in Latin America, but in the world in every aspect,” he said.
    


            Konanki's disappearance – and authorities' search for her in the water and on land – comes nearly two months after the deaths of four tourists who were swept away by strong currents off the coast near Punta Cana, according to the Dominican Republic's civil defense agency.
    


            The four tourists disappeared off the Arena Gorda beach in Bávaro, an area of resorts in Punta Cana, and their bodies were recovered in January, the civil defense agency said in a social media post. The four drowned January 18, The Associated Press reported. Two other people also were swept away with the four but survived, the civil defense agency said.
    


            At the time of the January drownings, a red flag was flying at the beach to warn of dangerous ocean conditions, such as strong currents and rough seas, the AP reported.
    


            The sheriff's office in Virginia's Loudoun County, where Konanki's family lives, told CNN it was advised the water was rough in Punta Cana on the night Konanki went missing last week, but it could not confirm whether any warnings were in place.
    


            CNN has sought comment from Dominican Republic authorities about the conditions on March 6.
    


            Konanki traveled to the Dominican Republic with five other female students from the University of Pittsburgh on March 3, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office.
    


            On March 6 around 4:15 a.m., surveillance cameras captured a group of people – Konanki, five other women and two men – entering the beach, the Dominican Republic National Police said in a release. The group had been drinking in the hotel's lobby around an hour earlier, a source with the national police told CNN.
    


            Cameras later captured five women and one man leaving the beach around 4:55 a.m. – but not Konanki, two sources close to the investigation told CNN.
    


            Konanki appears to have stayed behind with a man in his 20s, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation. Surveillance video showed the man leaving the beach area just before 9 a.m. Thursday without Konanki, the two sources close to the investigation said.
    


            Authorities have been interviewing the man, though he is not considered to be a suspect at this time, the law enforcement source said. He was being kept in a hotel room under police watch as the probe continues, but he is not officially detained, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.
    


            He told authorities they both went into the ocean but he felt sick, got out of the water and fell asleep on a lounge chair, according to the source.
    


            Another law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said the man was interviewed by police several times and provided different details but there were no significant inconsistencies in his recounting of the events that night. The source said translation issues may have been a reason for the differences.
    


            When Konanki didn't come back to her room, her companions searched for her, according to the law enforcement source. The group reported her missing to hotel staff around 4 p.m. Thursday, the RIU hotel chain said in a release.
    


            Konanki's sarong-style cover-up was found on a lounge chair on the beach, but there were no signs of violence, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.
    


            Konanki's disappearance came a day after a power outage started at the hotel, the facility's operator, RIU Hotels & Resorts, said Wednesday. Power was restored to 70% of the facility by early March 5 – two hours after the outage began – and was fully restored at 2:13 a.m. on March 6, the company said.
    


            In the days since, a massive search effort involving dogs, drones and helicopters does not appear to have produced any solid leads about Konanki's whereabouts.
    


            Konanki's father, Subbarayudu Konanki, said his daughter is a “very nice girl” and “wanted to pursue a career in medicine.”
    


            She was visiting Punta Cana for spring break ahead of premed studies, her father said.
    


            Originally from India, the Konanki family has been in the US since 2006 and are permanent residents living in Virginia.
    


            Those in her hometown are praying for her safe return.
    


            “It's already four days and everybody's so worried,” family friend Shekar Pendem, who has known Konanki since she was 3, said in an interview with CNN affiliate WUSA Monday.
    


            The Dominican Republic Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating whether Konanki's disappearance could extend “beyond a possible accidental event,” officials said Wednesday.
    


            “As with any disappearance under the circumstances of the case at hand, we are applying a holistic investigation protocol that examines all variables,” Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso said.
    


            On Monday, Dominican police said they were re-interviewing people who had been with Konanki and employees of the hotel where they were staying.
    


            As of early Tuesday, more than 300 officers, specialists, tactical units and aquatic search teams were searching the surrounding area of the hotel for any information about the woman's whereabouts, according to a post on social media by Dominican Republic National Police.
    


            The Dominican Republic navy is searching along the coast about 24 nautical miles from the hotel where Konanki was reported missing, General Commander Agustín Morillo Rodríguez told CNN on Wednesday. The night Konanki disappeared, sea conditions were dangerous with high waves, he said.
    


            The government has made available “all the necessary resources” to find Konanki, police said, including teams of forensic technicians who are analyzing images from video surveillance cameras in the area. An alert has also been circulated to law enforcement worldwide to help locate her.
    


            Subbarayudu Konanki and his wife, Sreedevi, returned to Virginia this week after flying to Punta Cana with two family friends, according to Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman. Her father has asked authorities to widen the investigation.
    


            Investigators spoke with the parents on Tuesday, and the sheriff met with her dad and other family members on Wednesday, Chapman said.
    


            “They do not want to accept the fact that she may have drowned,” Chapman told Fox News on Wednesday. “We're looking into every possibility here. I think it's premature and I think it's actually unfair for anybody to come to that conclusion so quickly.”
    


            The father's formal request notes that the student's belongings, including her phone and wallet, were left with her friends, “which is unusual because she always carried her phone with her,” he wrote in the report, according to radio station WTOP, as reported by the AP. It's unclear where this information came from.
    


            Konanki's father told CNN earlier he wants local authorities “to also investigate other possibilities including whether this is a case of kidnapping or human trafficking.”
    


            Civil Defense spokesperson Jensen Sánchez told the AP the search “is underway at sea because it's presumed she drowned.”
    


            He noted it can take more than a week for a body to surface in warm waters, the AP reported.
    


            Detectives with the sheriff's office have traveled to the Dominican Republic, Chapman told NBC on Tuesday. Investigators have spoken with hotel personnel, lifeguards and others who may have been present at the time that she went missing, Chapman said.
    


            “We decided to send our own detectives down there with them (FBI) so that we're not missing anything. We want to make sure … we're getting the information firsthand,” Chapman said in the interview with NBC. “Some of the information that we've gotten so far – it has been a little disjointed, inconsistent, and we want to get it firsthand.”
    


            “We don't think she would be able to survive for more than three days in the water,” Subbarayudu told CNN on Sunday. “I think something else might've happened to her.”

Follow:


            An elected leader once dubbed “The Punisher” was handed to The Hague to face trial for crimes against humanity over his brutal war on drugs, in a breathtaking reversal of fortune for a politician who once openly boasted about killing people and placing opponents on hit lists.
    


            Rodrigo Duterte ran the Philippines for six turbulent years, during which he oversaw a brutal crackdown on drugs, openly threatened critics with death and tongue-lashed a host of global leaders from the Pope to former US President Barack Obama.
    


            On Wednesday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Netherlands confirmed the former Philippines leader was now in its custody.
    


            A former prosecutor, congressman and mayor, Duterte built his no-holds-barred reputation in the southern Philippine city of Davao. He swept to the presidency in 2016 on a populist – and popular – promise to replicate the hardline tactics of his hometown and wage war against drugs and drug pushers across the Southeast Asian nation.
    


            “All of you who are into drugs, you sons of b**ches, I will really kill you,” he told a huge crowd in one of his many characteristically profane-laced 2016 campaign speeches. “I have no patience, I have no middle ground. Either you kill me or I will kill you idiots.”
    


            Once in power he unleashed what rights groups called “death squads” to eradicate drug pushers – many of the victims young men from impoverished shanty towns, shot by police and rogue gunmen as part of a campaign to target dealers.
    


            Police data said 6,000 people were killed. Some rights groups say the death toll could be as high as 30,000 with innocents and bystanders often caught in the crossfire.
    


            Duterte's blood-soaked presidency ended in 2022. Three years later, only 8 policemen had been convicted for 5 of the victims killed in the war on drugs, according to court documents.
    

In video posted by his daughter, Rodrigo Duterte questions his detainment. The former Philippine president was taken into custody on March 11 after the country's government said it received an International Criminal Court warrant for his arrest for alleged crimes against humanity.

            The ICC launched an investigation into allegations of “crimes against humanity” committed by Duterte during both his time as national leader and mayor of Davao.
    


            Duterte has long denied the accusations of human rights abuses and contends the drug issue is one for domestic law enforcement. He has repeatedly said he will not kowtow to foreign jurisdiction and taunted the ICC, urging prosecutors to “hurry up” and move on him.
    


            Two days before his arrest, he slammed the ICC in a typically fiery speech to supporters in Hong Kong.
    


            “From my own news, I have a warrant…from the ICC or something… these motherf***ers have been chasing me for a long time. What did I do wrong ?” he said.
    


            But the tide had suddenly turned. Authorities were waiting for Duterte to return from Hong Kong, and arrested him at the main airport in Manila, sparking chaotic scenes.
    


            As the news filtered out, many were left in shock.
    


            Some flocked to churches in the majority Catholic country to attend impromptu mass to commemorate the thousands of victims of his drug war, seeing the move as a first step towards overdue justice.
    


            And just before midnight, Duterte was back on a plane – this time bound for the Netherlands in what appeared to be a stunning end to a stormy and violent stint at the top of Philippine politics.
    


            In a Wednesday statement, the ICC said Duterte was “surrendered” to its custody, and a hearing would be scheduled in “due course.” It is unclear when he will make his first court appearance.
    


            Shortly before landing in Rotterdam, Duterte released a defiant video message on his Facebook page. “I was saying to the police and military that you do your job and I will take responsibility, so it has come to this,” he said.
    


            “This will be a long legal proceedings, but I say to you, I will continue to serve my country. And so be it, if that is my destiny,” he added.
    


            The arrest likely owes more to Duterte being on the wrong side of a feud between two of the Philippine's most high-profile families than the might of the ICC, which cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants
    


            Duterte's clan was previously in an alliance with the famed Marcos political dynasty, with his daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio serving as deputy to current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
    


            But in recent months the alliance collapsed, descending into public tirades and name-calling.
    


            In October, Duterte-Carpio aired a litany of grievances against the president in a two-hour livestreamed press conference, saying she “wanted to chop his head off.”
    


            Then she said in an online news conference on November 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and House Speak Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned wasn't a joke.
    


            Marcos had said the Philippines will “disengage” from any contact with the ICC, as Manila does not recognize its authority over matters of national sovereignty.
    


            That's because Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court in 2019.
    


            But under the ICC's withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state.
    


            President Marcos said he was obliged to follow Interpol's request to arrest Duterte.
    


            “Interpol asked for help, and we obliged because we have commitments to the Interpol, which we have to fulfil. If we don't do that, they will not, they will no longer help us with other cases involving Filipino fugitives abroad,” Marcos said in a late-night presser after the plane carrying Duterte took off.
    


            Carlos Conde, a Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW) Conde said Duterte's swift arrest and removal was a “pleasant surprise” that caught also a lot of people off guard.
    


            “The victims of the drug war – thousands of victims – have pretty much lost faith in the domestic accountability mechanisms in the Philippines. So, they were pinning their hopes on the ICC,” he told CNN.
    


            Nobel laureate Maria Ressa told CNN Duterte's arrest marks a major moment for the country and signals that years of impunity can be ended.
    


            “It's historic for the Philippines, it's the first time a Philippine president has been arrested for crimes against humanity. That an Interpol-led arrest actually ended this impunity under president Duterte that now has him going to The Hague,” said Ressa, former CNN Manila bureau chief and CEO and founder of news site Rappler.
    


            Human rights campaigner Aurora Parong told CNN many advocates and drug war victims' family members were elated with a momentary sense of relief after hearing Duterte had indeed been arrested.

            “But there is this mixed feeling of joy and hope and anxiety because we do not exactly know where this will end up to what will be the outcome. Will there really be accountability?” said Parong, who is also co-chair of the Philippine Coalition for the ICC (PCICC).
    


            But she cautioned it would be an excruciatingly long road to justice.
    


            “It is time consuming. It will take years before there will be a conviction at the International Criminal Court. The waiting is really difficult for the victims and the families of the victims of the bloody war on drugs.”
    


            Located in The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC investigates and prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression against the territory of its member states, of which there are 125.
    


            Duterte's arrest and transfer is a significant victory for the body. The court cannot carry out arrests on its own and relies on the cooperation of national governments to execute warrants – which often rests on domestic politics and political will on whether to follow through.
    


            Many of those on its wanted list remain at large, unruffled by the serious charges laid against them.
    


            The court has been rounded on by the United States for seeking the arrests of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for Israel's military actions in Gaza following Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack.
    


            The ICC simultaneously sought the arrests of top Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was later killed.
    


            Neither the US nor Israel are members of the ICC.
    


            The court has also issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, although it is unlikely the warrant will be served any time soon. Putin travelled to ICC member Mongolia last year, but was not arrested.

Media commentator Hugh Hewitt analyzes the Department of Government Efficiency's potential when it comes to cutting government spending on 'One Nation.'

President Trump's most important moves among the many important moves that he has made in his first two months in office are those that restored the hard line he had taken towards China in his first term, a very firm line that has quickly been put back in its place of defining priority for our foreign policy and national security. Trump began with his support at the Pentagon and in Congress for defense spending re-focused for the Indo-Pacific region and with tariffs on imports from the People's Republic of China.The tariff arguments with Mexico, Canada and the European Union can be resolved over the negotiating table. But not so the competition between the superpowers. That competition will hopefully never become an armed conflict, but it would almost certainly have become one if American indifference to the ambitions of the PRC continued.The United States finally began to develop a strategy for containing China's global ambitions in the first Trump term. All of that effort was wasted by a disastrous four years of a leaderless country during the regency years of Joe Biden's infirmity.

CHINA, REACTING TO TRUMP TARIFFS, PROMISES TO ‘FIGHT TILL THE END' IN TRADE WAR ‘OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF WAR'Now the second part of the first American counter-China strategy is rolling out and it begins with our massive investment in our sea services and our on-shoring of the critical production lines abandoned to our adversary over four decades. President Trump speaks very softly and respectfully about General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping. That is the correct tone for superpower diplomacy. But Trump's respect for the Chinese dictator's power is as certain as is his resolve to counter it.

We all fell for the open secret that Deng Xiaoping proclaimed as China's key principle during his long run as the PRC's leader: ""Hide your strength, bide your time."" Quietly, consistently, China built its economic strength and then its military strength. America's China lobby helped the process of China's astonishing growth until Trump arrived on the scene.No documentary source has ever been found for the saying, often attributed to Vladimir Lenin, that ""the Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them,"" but it served nicely as an explanation for the early decades of the Soviet Union's growth and it most certainly applies to America's China policy after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R.  Not now. Never again for the foreseeable future in all likelihood. In early February Trump put a 10% tariff in place against goods from China and China quickly issued retaliatory tariffs. In early March, Trump upped the U.S.'s tariff on China by 25%. More retaliation from China followed.Don't expect this confrontation to be toned down or delayed. America has one peer competitor on the world stage across all domains and it is China, and China's hostility to us and our allies is open and ongoing. The espionage effort against us is vast and has gone mostly unchecked during the Biden years of fog and mumbling. The FBI under Trump raided and shut down the PRC's Houston consulate. The FBI under Biden raided Mar-a-Lago. Trump is back and new FBI Director Kash Patel will hopefully not disappoint when it comes to CCP espionage.There is talk of summits between Trump and Xi. Fine. Richard Nixon met with both Leonid Brezhnev and Mao. Summits can keep the crises away, conflict below the kinetic level. Both China and Russia have vast nuclear arsenals and emerging new technologies, though not as large or as lethal as ours. It's good to keep everyone focused on that basic fact set and to not lose sight of our need to keep our guard up there.

And Trump is not a chump of course. He'd rather the competition with China be contained and controlled but he won't be rolled and he won't be sold word salad at a summit or three. Trump leaves the table when there is no deal to be had and there is no significant deal to be had with the Chinese Communist Party, which has gone hard-line for the dozen years of Xi's increasingly iron-fisted rule. Trump has never not seen Xi clearly for who he is or how tough an adversary he has become.Admiral Mark Montgomery (USN, Ret.) talked at some length with me this week about the outline of the long-term strategy for dealing with China. Watch that discussion here.

What the admiral pointed out to me is that I had seen, but not understood the significance of the visit of the president of Taiwan Semiconductor to the White House. When President Trump shook hands with C.C. Wei, chairman and CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington on March 3, that was the signal through all the noise. Along with the China tariffs, along with Trump's emphasis on the Navy, Marine Corps and shipbuilding, here was a deft delivery of some diplomacy.

The number one bestseller on the New York Times non-fiction list a week back was Senator Tom Cotton's new ""Seven Things You Can't Say About China."" The senator from Arkansas is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the third ranking member of the GOP conference. He doesn't speak for the president, of course, but Cotton does speak with Trump. They get along. That's a very good thing, for if even half of Trump's and Cotton's shared, clear-eyed understanding of China spreads throughout Team Trump, the country will be prepared for Trump's most important fight among many important fights, one that will have to be carried consistently forward for decades.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to ""return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.""

The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities. 

""USDA can confirm it has provided notice to States, Territories and Tribes that the FY 2025 funding previously announced for the pandemic-era Local Food for Schools and Child Care Cooperative Agreement and pandemic-era Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement program is no longer available and those agreements will be terminated following 60-day notification,"" a spokesperson with the agency said in an email to CBS News.

The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.

""Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,"" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. 

In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said. 

One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals. 

""It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,"" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. ""It wasn't just about keeping food costs low — it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.""

While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs. 

The Local Food for Schools program ""was a godsend to us,"" Bilbrey said. ""It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.""

One farmer in Massachusetts told CBS News Boston that she was concerned the funding cut could hurt her business. Katie Carlson, president of Carlson Orchards in Harvard, Massachusetts, said the Worcester Regional Food Hub, which connects school districts with food from local farmers through the USDA program, had been a reliable customer. 

""We know that this time of year we can count on the Worcester Food Hub,"" Carlson said. ""They may not be huge orders every week, but we know that they're coming to take something every week, so if that were to all of a sudden drop off [...] It's just not, not good.""

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland

As Democrats in Congress seek to counter President Donald Trump and Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk's agenda, a familiar face is reemerging: Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland.

Raskin, a former lawyer turned politician, played a vital role in the Democratic response to Trump during his first term and rose to national prominence when he served as a floor manager for Trump's second impeachment after the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol.

As the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Raskin is pushing back against the Republican agenda in Washington.

Whether he's protesting in front of the Supreme Court or federal agencies or finding ways to slow the presidential agenda in the courts with the newly-formed rapid response and litigation working group, Raskin is leaning on his political and legal expertise as he faces a rapidly changing landscape.

U.S. News & World Report sat down with Raskin to discuss the ongoing fight in Congress to fund the government, the playbook Democrats are using to combat Trump and what he's leaning on to help guide him.

Aneeta Mathur-Ashton March 7, 2025



The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.

“It's a horrible choice that the Republicans have presented us with.

“Our position has been that they have majorities, albeit narrow ones, across the government. They have proven that they don't need our votes and don't care about our votes. But in the event that they can't pull together a majority to make it happen, then the way the system works is that they need to sit down with us and have a serious negotiation.

“Speaking for myself, I'm very open to a continuing resolution to keep the government open. But it cannot be based on billions of dollars of more cuts to the domestic budget and it cannot be based on their lawless actions in not living up to congressional enactments and appropriations decisions.”

“Well, you'd have to ask the Republicans who control the House, the Senate and the White House.

“It essentially sends the message that they are acting in extremist and irresponsible ways in Congress, the way that they are acting in extremist and irresponsible ways in the executive branch. Everybody can see the slash and burn tactics that have been adopted by Musk and Trump.”

“I've been a strong champion of D.C. statehood. I was the floor leader for it with [Democratic D.C. Del.] Eleanor Holmes Norton in the 116th and 117th congresses. I believe that tax-paying draftable U.S. citizens have the right to equal representation through statehood. But right now, Republicans want to move in the opposite direction and dismantle even the limited home rule that people in Washington have right now.

“This is clearly up to the people of D.C. and I will support them in whatever they want to do. But they should consider one of their options – coming back to Maryland – because they will find a lot more safety and a lot more equality in the Free State than they will find being directly under the thumb of MAGA tyrants.”

Aneeta Mathur-Ashton March 3, 2025



“Trump and the MAGA movement have been waging a war for the richest Americans against the vast majority of working and middle class people in the country. So part of that kind of top-down class warfare was perfectly predictable. Musk and DOGE have been the wild card factor here.”

“Every new historical epic requires new political strategies. That's just a truism about politics.

“I think that the values that the Democratic Party promotes and that more than 75 million people voted for are as relevant as ever. But we do need to figure out the best strategies of dealing with the new media ecosystem that we are in.

“The legacy media are no longer the mainstream media and most Americans are getting their political information in radically novel ways. So we need to figure out the best way of actually connecting with America through the new media ecosystem.”

“I was a professor of constitutional law for a quarter of a century (at American University's Washington College of Law). I was also a state senator in Maryland but I've always been on the Judiciary Committees.

“My ruling intellectual passion is for constitutional law and the mechanisms of democracy. My ticket has come up in this period because we are in the constitutional fight of our lives.

“I was at the Supreme Court Wednesday addressing the judicial conference. I told all of the judges who were there that the nation is looking to the judicial branch for its muscular defense of our constitutional system against all of the assaults that we are under right now.”

READ: 



“I've definitely learned to make good friends across the aisle. I've had a bunch of good friends from the other side of the aisle including (former Texas Republican Rep.) Lamar Smith and (Colorado Republican Rep.) Lauren Boebert. I'm making friends with (Ohio Republican Rep.) Jim Jordan, who's my counterpart on the Judiciary Committee.

“We should never allow the partisan discord and ideological extremism to interfere with those underlying bonds of affection that Abraham Lincoln talked about.”

“I've learned not to be too shy about making procedural motions in the Senate in a presidential impeachment trial.

“When I was leading the impeachment managers in the second trial of Trump, I wanted to make a motion to have the senators not be seated according to political party, because who had ever heard of a jury that is seated according to party designation.

“I was told by both the Democrats and Republicans that it was not a good idea because the senators were shaken up by Jan. 6, and they all wanted to stay in their individual desks and seats.

“I've always regretted not introducing that motion. I think it might have helped them focus on the fact that they shouldn't be thinking in party terms but simply as jurors rendering impartial justice on behalf of the Constitution.”

Spirit Airlines is out of bankruptcy, hitting its target to emerge in the first quarter, after a crippling few years. CEO Ted Christie says the carrier is leaner and ready to take on competitors, including rival Southwest Airlines.

Earlier this week, Southwest shocked customers by announcing it will start charging for checked bags for the first time in its half-century of flying, a huge strategy move for the largest domestic U.S. carrier. (There are some exceptions to Southwest new bag rules, which take effect in late May.)

""I think it's going to be painful for a little bit as they find their footing, and we're going to take advantage of that,"" Spirit's Christie said in an interview Thursday.

Southwest had been a standout in the U.S. by offering all customers two free checked bags, a perk that has endured recessions, spikes in fuel prices and other crises while most rivals introduced bag fees and raised them every few years.

Spirit Airlines, on the other hand, made a la carte pricing common in the U.S., with fees for seat assignments, checked bags and other add-ons. It's a strategy most large airlines, except for Southwest, have copied in one form or another.

As Southwest starts charging for bags and introduces its first basic economy class, which doesn't include a seat assignment or allow free changes, Spirit could possibly win over customers, Christie said.

Southwest said it would get rid of its single-class open seating model last year.

""There at least was an audience of people who were intentionally selecting and flying Southwest because they felt that it was easy. They knew they were going to get two bags,"" Christie said. ""Now that that's no longer the case, it's easy to say that they're going to widen their aperture and they're now going to look around.""

Spirit is far smaller than Southwest and even smaller than it was last year, but it competes with the airline in cities like Kansas City, Missouri; Nashville, Columbus, Ohio; and Milwaukee. If customers look on travel sites like Expedia, where Southwest is a new entrant, Spirit's tickets could be cheaper and appear higher in results, Christie said.

Other airline executives have also said they expect to win over some Southwest customers.

Delta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein said at a JPMorgan industry conference Tuesday that there are consumers who choose Southwest based on its free-bag perk ""and now those customers are up for grabs.""

Spirit, for its part, has recently been offering more ticket bundles that include things like seat assignments and luggage.

The carrier is now focused on returning to profitability. It posted a net loss of more than $1.2 billion last year, more than double its loss in 2023 as it grappled with grounded jets because of a Pratt & Whitney engine recall, higher costs, more domestic competition and a failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways.

Spirit has rejected multiple recent merger attempts by fellow budget carrier Frontier Airlines. Christie said Thursday that nothing is ""off the table"" and that a fifth-largest airline as a low cost carrier in the U.S. makes sense, but that the airline is focused on stabilizing itself after bankruptcy.

Through its restructuring process, which started in November, Spirit said it reduced its debt by about $795 million. The transaction converted debt into equity for major creditors. The carrier also received a $350 million equity infusion. 

Spirit plans to relist its shares on a stock exchange but hasn't set a date yet.

Oops, something went wrong

As gold races to new records, Wall Street analysts have rushed to raise their price targets, with the latest call from Macquarie Group predicting the precious metal will touch $3,500 in the third quarter.

On Thursday, gold futures (GC=F) climbed above $2,990 per ounce as a trade war intensified and the release of modest inflation data raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve may be more inclined to cut rates this year.

""Year-to-date, gold has been running ahead of our expectations,"" Marcus Garvey, head of commodities strategy at Macquarie, wrote on Thursday.

""We are raising our gold price forecast to a 3Q25 quarter average peak of $3,150 per ounce and our single point price high to $3,500 per ounce,"" Garvey wrote.

""President Trump's rapid move to announce, if not always to enact, import tariffs has contributed to geopolitical uncertainty and boosted inflation expectations, helping push down front-end real rates and supporting gold in the face of periodic USD strength and initially reduced expectations for Fed rate cuts,"" the strategist wrote.

The target raise comes after strategists at BNP Paribas called for prices to push above $3,100 per ounce in the second quarter.

""The Trump administration issuing a slew of tariff threats and the realigning of international relationships have added a new layer of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, providing a significant boost to gold,"" BNP's David Wilson wrote in a note on Wednesday.

Gold futures have rallied more than 11% year to date, hitting multiple record highs since January.

Wall Street has attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared.

Institutional investors have shipped elevated amounts of physical gold bars to vaults in New York in a move to front-run tariffs and take advantage of a price disparity between London and New York.

Last month, Goldman Sachs analysts raised their year-end gold price forecast to $3,100 per ounce, up from their prior projection of $2,890.

If tariffs on French macarons and Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano weren't enough, Europhiles and the country club set are poised to take another big hit — with French bubbly.

“If this Tariff [on US whiskey] is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,” President Trump declared on Truth Social Thursday morning, following a move by the EU with reciprocal tariffs.

Sacrebleu.

Though duties imposed on Italian cheeses and French champagne are causing some dismay, most big European exports to the US are more industrial — think finished manufactured goods like pharmaceutical products, machinery, and autos.

Just this morning, another maker of luxury goods — Ferrari (RACE) — said it will have to respond to the tariff threat. After all, the wealthy don't like to waste money either.

“We are ready with some countermeasures,” Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said at CNBC's Converge Live event in Singapore on Thursday morning. “We are in a scenario planning phase to manage as best whatever will happen,” Vigna said, without adding any details.

Ferrari, which only produces its cars from its factory in Maranello, Italy, is facing a potential 25% tariff on European autos imported to the US. It will most likely raise prices on its vehicles or absorb some (or all) of the tariff cost.

Yesterday, German luxury rival Porsche (P911.DE) gave a clue as to who might be paying tariffs for its highly desirable sports cars and SUVs.

""When the subject [of tariffs] becomes concrete, we will assess which price options there are to pass on to consumers,"" Porsche CFO Jochen Breckner said Wednesday, indicating its customers will be paying for Trump's tariffs, not the company.

""We have a very, very strong brand, a great customer base, a loyal customer base, and great product. So in the first place, we would look into additional pricing,"" Breckner added.

But it isn't just tariffs on EU-made goods that are a threat to European automakers, many assemble vehicles in Mexico as well. The Trump White House is poised to enact 25% tariffs on Mexican-made goods starting April 2.

Germany's BWW (BMW.DE), which has a major plant in Mexico, where the 3-series sedan and high-performance M2 sports car are made, is taking a different tack with tariff costs.

Per the Wall Street Journal, BMW is telling dealers it will absorb the costs of new tariffs on imports from Mexico and “price protect” those vehicles until May 1.

But if the tariff situation remains for longer, the company may need to “reassess” that policy.

Finally, German behemoth Volkswagen (VWAGY), the world's No. 2 automaker by sales, is a big tariff target as it makes a number of vehicles at its plant in Puebla, Mexico.

Countermeasures like increasing production at its US plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., would need “a bit more time,” Volkswagen Brand CEO Thomas Schäfer said on Thursday, according to Reuters.

And shifting production from Mexico, where the popular Tiguan SUV is made, to the US is “not realistic” in the short term, Schäfer said.

""For now, we are watching the situation and doing back-up plans for long-term solutions,"" Schäfer said.

With increasing production of current US-made vehicles or adding production of other cars at its US plant off the cards, VW has two options — raise prices or absorb them.

Both options are unappealing for VW, as higher prices would make its vehicles less competitive while eating the tariff costs would hit margins.

With no new clarity on the tariff threat emanating from the White House and EU negotiators, European automakers face a stressful and, as Porsche execs indicated, “sleepless” time in limbo.

Bottom line: The Moët & Chandon champagne and Whispering Angel French rosé will remain on ice, for now.

Two recent readings on inflation showed price increases decelerated in February — but within the details, economists see warning signs.

Thursday's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that its ""core"" Producer Price Index (PPI) — which tracks the price changes companies see and excludes food and energy — rose 3.4% from the year prior, down from the 3.6% seen in January. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed core prices rose 3.1% in February, the lowest yearly increase in core CPI since April 2021.

But the components from CPI and PPI that pass through to the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, indicate the closely followed inflation metric didn't fall in February.

Bank of America economists and several other Wall Street research teams now estimate that ""core"" PCE, which excludes food and energy, will show prices increased 2.7% in February, up from the 2.6% increase seen in January.

""This would indicate progress on inflation continues to stall and reinforces our call for the Fed to remain on hold,"" Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau wrote in a note to clients.

The reports come amid recent investor fears that inflation may remain sticky while economic growth slows. In recent weeks, fears over the latter had pushed markets to price in the possibility of a Federal Reserve interest cut in May. But after the two inflation readings, those bets have faded.

Markets are now pricing in just a 30% chance the Fed cuts rates at its May meeting, down from a 52% chance seen a week ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan also sees the two inflation readings leading to an increase in the Fed's preferred inflation gauge during February.

""This is the opposite of the downward progress on inflation the Fed needs to see to justify easing policy further and reinforces our view that the window for cuts has already closed this year,"" Ryan wrote.

Investors with a longer time horizon may not be running and hiding amid the market's March sell-off.

At least not yet.

""We see a range of emotions among our clients, from nervousness to a focus on the long term,"" Charles Schwab (SCHW) CEO Rick Wurster told me and Madison Mills on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts (video above). ""If we look specifically at what our clients are doing, we look at things like margin activity — it's a good pulse for what our more active traders are doing. And our level of margin has stayed roughly the same over the last month, and our margin clients have actually bought equities in the last week. So I think clients are generally hanging in there at the moment.""

Wurster took over as CEO of Schwab in January after serving as its president.

He arrives at an important juncture for markets and the iconic wealth manager.

Fresh economic data for consumer confidence from the Dallas Fed survey has painted a picture of increasingly cautious consumers and businesses. Walmart (WMT) is seeing its lower-income shoppers fret once again about inflation, new research reveals. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed an economy continuing to battle inflationary headwinds before the onset of any tariff-related pressure.

Listen: How Edward Jones CEO sees the markets

The market is moving violently as it aims to price in a first-half growth slowdown.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&P 500 (^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are each down 5% in March alone. Led by plunges in large-cap tech names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), the Nasdaq is down the most in March, with a 5.2% drop as investors sell off risk.

On the year, the Nasdaq is down nearly 8.6%, the S&P 500 is off by 4.8%, and the Dow 2.8%.

""I think there's a variety of [investor] concerns. I think you've seen the market turn or worry about growth... When you look at investors broadly, I think the biggest concern on their mind is just a softer growth picture,"" Wurster said.

After dealing with challenges from migrating TD Ameritrade clients to Schwab's platform for much of 2024, the company began to stabilize in the fourth quarter. Results were also helped by strong trading activity ahead of Election Day and following President Trump's win.

Fourth quarter revenue rose 20% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) improved 49%. Trading revenue advanced 14% from the prior year.

Revenue was up 4% year over year for full year 2024; adjusted EPS was up 4% as well.

Wurster said any issues related to the Ameritrade platform migration are in the rearview mirror. He adds the company is now eyeing a potential crypto product launch this year, but declined to share further details.

""We think 2025 presents another step forward in a return to normal for Schwab,"" JPMorgan analyst Ken Worthington wrote in a client note. ""We see clear tailwinds for Schwab with conducive backdrop in rates/macro and improving fundamentals.""

Worthington rates Charles Schwab shares an Overweight (Buy equivalent) with a $93 price target.

Shares are down 3% on the year. Robinhood (HOOD) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) have seen a 5% and 1% gain this year, respectively.

Oops, something went wrong

A C-suite long in the making at Intel (INTC).

Shares of the beat-up chipmaker rose 12% in premarket trading on Thursday as Intel announced Lip-Bu Tan as its permanent CEO.

Tan was the longtime CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) from 2009 to 2021. He left Intel's board in August 2024 after serving for two years, following what a source tells me were clashes on how to position the business with now-ousted CEO and near Intel lifer Pat Gelsinger.

The source said Tan was interviewed for the CEO role of Intel at the same time as Gelsinger. Gelsinger ultimately got the gig in 2021 but had to play nice by agreeing to put Tan on the board. Tan frequently pushed for a better artificial intelligence strategy to take on Nvidia (NVDA) and faster decision making in the notoriously bureaucratic Intel.

Listen: What Bill Gates thinks about Intel

""If anyone can save Intel, it's Lip, but it will take years and partners,"" a source who knows Tan told me. Tan is unlikely to spin off Intel's ailing foundry arm in the near term, but he could move fast to inject cash into the business via a rumored partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and the US government.

More layoffs could be possible as well under Tan, the source added.

Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.

To be sure, Tan has a mess on his hands at the iconic American tech giant.

Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. He slashed thousands of jobs, improved costs, secured CHIPS Act funding, built chip foundries, and promised fast AI chips that could compete with Nvidia and AMD (AMD).

He was fired in early December amid missed targets and a cash drain on the foundry business.

Intel's fourth quarter sales fell 7% year over year to $14.3 billion. Net earnings plunged 76%.

The company forecasts it will only break even on the profit line this year.

Here's what Wall Street is saying about Intel's newish executive team pick.

""We're encouraged by this appointment given Lip-Bu Tan's tenure and track record of creating shareholder value as CEO of Cadence and prior experience as an Intel board member. However, given the multitude of challenges that Intel currently faces, we are maintaining our Sector Weight rating, but look forward to hearing more about Mr. Tan's strategy for turning Intel around.""

""Having followed Mr. Tan's transformative impact on Cadence Design Systems during his eleven-year tenure as CEO at that company as well as many successful outcomes related to investments across the semiconductor universe, we believe that Mr. Tan is uniquely qualified to attempt a reboot of Intel.

""As such, we view Mr. Tan's appointment as a longer-term positive for Intel. However, we continue to believe that Intel faces a lengthy period of transition as the company realigns with the evolving AI-centric opportunity set that has been accelerated in recent years. In a company message released in conjunction with the CEO transition announcement, Mr. Tan notes that remaking Intel will not be easy but that the goal is to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company as well as a world-class foundry.

""In the near-to-medium term, we would expect clarity on Mr. Tan's vision and strategies to act as potential catalysts to Intel shares. However, as the AI opportunity continues to unfold, we expect real-time AI infrastructure beneficiaries such as Nvidia to outperform.""

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

To say that the bears are in control of the market right now is an understatement. No one is in control. Or really, no one really knows what's going to happen, making retreat the safer option.

But for the modelers who somehow turn geopolitical skirmishes, Capitol Hill intrigue, and corporate activity into layers of assumptions, risk assessments, and, ultimately, numbers, there's at least some clarity in declaring what might happen by December, versus trying to make sense of tomorrow's closing bell based off what we know today.

Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin became the first major name on Wall Street to lower their year-end price target for the S&P 500, following the gauge's tumble into near-correction territory.

At first glance, the lowered year-end outlook looks like a pullback. The stock market will likely end the year worse off than the previous estimate, reflecting a more than 4% adjustment, as a diminished GDP outlook weighs on projected corporate profits.

The new forecast is still well above where the market stands now. And it's higher still than the all-time peaks of February, charting an 11% gain for the year.

But can a downward revision really be all that optimistic if other forecasts still have the S&P finishing the year above 7,000? Is viewing the downshift in a positive light just a cheap sleight of hand aimed at lowering one's expectations?

Let us make the case. The revision comes when the mood of the day is panic and trade uncertainty is peaking. And as sobering as the vibe is, the year-end figure represents some big gains. Meanwhile, when forecasters at the end of last year predicted 2025 levels, Wall Street was knee-deep in animal spirits. A judgment made during trying times carries more significance.

Or, look at the numbers alone. Kostin's November 6,500 call at 5,900 was a 10% gain. Calling 6,200 at 5,600 is a fatter percentage.

Goldman Sachs was the first of the analyst teams we track to shrink their number, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported. And adding to the revision's bullish sentiment is the fact that it acknowledges the S&P slide but still keeps the year-end figure high. It's an updated call with the benefit of more information, even if some of that is taking myriad variables thought to be certain out of the equation.

Wednesday's largely favorable updates on inflation and hiring also reinforce the notion that the economy is still in solid shape, despite the stock market plunge sparked by Trump's tariffs. The immediate market concerns are about what's coming rather than what's currently happening, for now.

As this newsletter noted Wednesday, Wall Street may only be in the initial stage of accepting the ""pain"" of the White House's bigger plan. The corporate benefits of deregulation and tax cuts will come to pass later, the administration has promised. An end-of-year prediction has the benefit of time. By then, stronger economic data may reveal itself or perhaps the topsy-turvy tariff threats will have subsided.

But even if we accept that stocks go up over the long term, is December a long enough timeline? Just because the case for a bullish 2025 has become more modest doesn't mean it's any more correct.

Oops, something went wrong

It's been a brutal month for stocks, with tech stocks leading markets lower, just as they led the rally in 2023 and 2024.

And though the recent sell-off action has focused much attention on the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" juggernauts, just one rung below these names is a crop of tech highfliers that have also experienced steep losses in recent weeks.

Netflix (NFLX), AMD (AMD), Micron (MU), Dell (DELL), and Palantir (PLTR), among others, are some of the names that have been washed out in the midst of this latest market rout.

And though some of these stocks caught a bid on Wednesday amid a tech rebound, some on Wall Street are warning recent volatility has contained an even more sinister picture underneath the stock market's surface.

Recent price action has ""really felt unwindy,"" Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""Not like total panic or capitulation, but getting pretty close.""

Netflix stock has fallen about 15% from the 52-week highs it reached just one month ago, when the stock was trading above $1,000 a share.

Klein called out ""past retail and momentum thematic favorites"" in the tech, media, and telecom space, including names like AppLovin (APP), Affirm (AFRM), Oklo (OKLO), and Reddit (RDDT). All have seen shares fall between 30% and 50% over the past month.

Chipmakers like AMD and Micron, along with Super Micro (SMCI), Intel (INTC), and ON Semiconductor (ON) are all down at least 40% from their respective 52-week highs, according to data compiled by Yahoo Finance.

Shares of Palantir, a previous momentum play on Wall Street, have plunged 30% from the closing record it reached on Feb. 19. Dell stock has also tumbled roughly 50% from its own 52-week peak.

Of course, some of these names have also battled fundamental issues.

Palantir often trades like a meme stock, and shares sold off last month over fears the US government will dramatically cut defense spending. Netflix's heavy content spend and possible engagement headwinds have been called out by analysts concerned over its valuation.

And chip stocks have faced increased competition at home and abroad, with February's DeepSeek sell-off highlighting concerns over the health and longevity of the artificial intelligence trade at large.

The Mag 7 players that drove two-year bull market gains — Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) — are all down between 16% and 25% from their 52-week highs, with Apple and Nvidia sitting on the narrowest and largest losses among the group. The exception, of course, is Tesla, which is down just less than 50% from a record close in December.

As a group, the Magnificent Seven names helped lift overall profit growth for the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC), while non-technology companies have fallen behind.

The rally in some of their smaller tech peers suggested this enthusiasm was not limited to these ""magnificent"" names, with the AI boom fresh on investors' minds.

But recent outlook disappointments have weighed on this story too.

Take AMD, for example. The company delivered a strong fourth quarter earnings report, yet the stock still tanked after its disappointing growth forecast for its data center business, signaling a possible momentum snag in AI chips.

""A regime change is taking place in the markets and what used to work is not going to work from here anywhere to the same degree,"" independent economist Peter Boockvar wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""The stock market has a history of handing the baton over to other things and now seems to be one of those times.""

Boockvar, who argued tariffs and political uncertainty cannot be solely responsible for this drawback in markets, added, ""You lose the special 7 stocks, which at its peak made up about 35% of the S&P 500, you are without a net in the broader market unless the baton is immediately passed to someone else.""

But with uncertainty still in the driver's seat and all 11 sectors in the red over the past month, it's unclear which pockets of the market even have the capacity to finish the race.

Oops, something went wrong

With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on the brink of a 10% correction, stocks attempted a rebound on Wednesday following a better-than-expected inflation reading. 

As with most of the recent market action, the rally proved to be stop-and-go as news that Canada would slap retaliatory tariffs on the US sent the major indexes into negative territory before an eventual rebound throughout the afternoon.

The whipsaw nature of stocks as of late fits what many investors have been saying about the recent drawdown: Until there's clarity on tariff policy, the chaotic market action likely won't end.

Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs

Guggenheim Partners Investment Management CIO Anne Walsh told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday that the ""the on, then off, then on and then off again narrative"" surrounding tariffs is driving volatility in the market. And as long as that persists, there likely isn't a direct path higher for stocks.

""It doesn't feel like a smooth trajectory [for stocks] because of all of the noise,"" Walsh said.

Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz recently offered similar sentiment, writing in a note to clients: ""[We're] unlikely to see a material recovery in equities until we see the start of fiscal policy uncertainty abating,"" noting that a recent surge in fiscal policy uncertainty, as measured by an index tracked on Bloomberg and seen below, has coincided with the market's recent slide.

As JPMorgan Asset Management global strategist Jack Manley told Yahoo Finance recently, the market's issue with tariffs isn't the tariffs themselves. If a blanket 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada were signed into action, investors could discount which companies would be impacted, how much their profits would likely fall, and what the fair value would be for those stocks and the market as a whole.

The real issue is that there's no clarity on the tariffs. Manley pointed out that there's a ""snowball"" effect. If the US hits Canada with new duties, the counterparty might respond, as it did on Wednesday. If Canada retaliates, then would the US follow through with even more duties? Does the cycle end there?

These questions, Manley said, make pricing tariffs into the stock market ""extremely difficult.""

Tariffs were one reason Goldman Sachs recently downgraded its outlook for the S&P 500 this year. The firm wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday night that it now sees the benchmark index ending 2025 at 6,200, lower than its previously target of 6,500.

Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet

Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote that the firm's lower target reflects its recently reduced GDP growth forecast and a ""high assumed tariff rate."" Kostin's work shows that for every five percentage point increase in tariffs, S&P 500 earnings per share would be reduced by 1% to 2%. The riskiest scenario, in which the effective tariff rate rose to 15%, would shave off an additional 2%.

Given that earnings growth often drives stocks, tariffs weighing on earnings more than currently forecast would likely also hit stock performance more than expected.

To be clear, that is not Kostin's expected outcome, nor is it what most strategists expect. For now, as Truist Co-CIO Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance, the market may just need time to ""digest and get through some of the more challenging aspects of the current administration's policies.""

Tariffs may not always be the story investors focus on all year.

""You may start to focus more on tax extensions and deregulation later in the year,"" Lerner said, adding,"" I can't pinpoint that exact time.""

Oops, something went wrong

Intel (INTC) stock jumped Thursday after the chipmaker announced it's appointing Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO Wednesday evening.

Chip industry veteran Tan, who previously helmed Cadence Design Systems, takes over from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus. The duo succeeded former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted by Intel's board in late 2024.

Shares of Intel surged over 15% in early trading on Thursday as many on Wall Street welcomed the announcement.

The news came the same day as a Reuters report that a consortium of chip companies — led by TSMC (TSM) and including Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) — is in talks to take over Intel's manufacturing business.

But Tan told employees that he'll carry on with an existing plan to work on making Intel a top contract chipmaker, signaling he won't split out the company's design and foundry businesses.

Many on Wall Street welcomed the news, seeing it as adding credibility to Intel's turnaround efforts. ""Having followed Mr. Tan's transformative impact on Cadence Design Systems during his 11-year tenure as CEO at that company, as well as many successful outcomes related to investments across the semiconductor universe, we believe that Mr. Tan is uniquely qualified to attempt a reboot of Intel,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a note.

Tan is no stranger to Intel. The new CEO initially served on the company's board in 2022 but left the chip giant in 2024. He reportedly disagreed with Gelsinger on the company's turnaround plan, including its third-party contract semiconductor fabrication business, according to Reuters.

""I am honored to join Intel as CEO,"" Tan said in a statement. ""I have tremendous respect and admiration for this iconic company, and I see significant opportunities to remake our business in ways that serve our customers better and create value for our shareholders.""

Tan is taking over Intel in the midst of one of the darkest eras in the company's history. The chipmaker has lost its lead in process manufacturing to rival chip builder TSMC and ceded its opportunity to dominate in the AI space to Nvidia.

Shares of Intel have plummeted 54% over the last year as the company's revenue has shrunk from its pandemic highs. It now faces increased competition from longtime nemesis AMD (AMD) and a renewed effort by Qualcomm (QCOM) to break into the PC chip space, threatening Intel's biggest moneymaker.

The semiconductor giant has also received billions of dollars via the CHIPS Act to help pay for new manufacturing facilities in the US, including a massive campus in Ohio. But Intel says a part of the project is delayed and won't be completed until 2030. It was initially slated to open in 2025.

The TRUMP meme coin saw a sudden 19% surge before plummeting after false reports circulated that it would have real-world utility.

The digital asset jumped from $10.4 to $12.4 after DB, a prominent crypto news outlet, posted on X that the TRUMP token would “have real utility” on Thursday.

The surge was short-lived as a follow-up post appeared approximately seven minutes later claiming the account had been compromised. The TRUMP token price fell to $10.8 following the statement.

Initially, it was uncertain whether hackers or DB posted the second tweet. Ansem and others in the crypto community observed a grammatical error in the tweet, suggesting the security breach had yet to be resolved.

Some X users reported that DB's account also shared fake news that BlackRock had filed for a spot HYPE ETF.

DB has since removed the unauthorized posts and issued a statement asking users to disregard messages posted during the security breach.

The news outlet confirmed an investigation is in progress and will provide updates when available.

 Binance reportedly reached out to Trump's family in 2024, offering to strike a business deal as part of a plan to resume Binance.US operations in the country. 

Representatives of US President Donald Trump's family have reportedly held talks with Binance about acquiring a stake in the crypto exchange.

Binance reached out to Trump's family representatives in 2024, offering to strike a deal as part of a plan to resume Binance.US operations in the country, The Wall Street Journal reported on March 13.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report mentioned that Binance's billionaire founder Changpeng Zhao — who served four months in prison in the US — has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon.

“It is unclear what form the Trump family stake would take if the deal comes together or whether it would be contingent on a pardon,” the report said.

According to WSJ, a potential opportunity could be a scenario where Trump takes the stake in Binance or proceeds with the deal through World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a Trump-backed crypto venture launched in September 2024.

Trump has emerged as the first US “crypto president,” launching his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin days before returning to the White House on Jan. 20. A similar memecoin subsequently came from Trump's wife, Melania, while Trump's son, Eric Trump, has been actively pushing for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto adoption.

Cointelegraph approached Binance for a comment regarding the report on the alleged deal but did not receive a response by publication.

Additionally, Binance executives anticipated a potential legal resolution in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) civil case against Tron founder Justin Sun, The WSJ reported.

Sun, who in November 2024 announced a $30 million investment in Trump's WLFI, jointly asked a US court to halt his case with the SEC in February 2025.

Neither Sun nor any Binance representatives attended the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, 2025.

Minutes before the WSJ article was published at 1:00 pm UTC, Trump took to Truth Social to slam the publication for allegedly reporting wrong information.

“The Globalist Wall Street Journal has no idea what they are doing or saying. They are owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of ‘screwing' the United States of America,” the president wrote.

Source: Donald Trump

While Trump was fast to address the WSJ report minutes before its publication, key Trump-linked industry figures — including Elon Musk and David Sacks — did not react to the news on social media.

Source: Changpeng Zhao

Zhao subsequently took to X to deny the allegations, suggesting that the WSJ article is “motivated as an attack on the president and crypto.”

“Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance.US deal with … well, anyone,” CZ wrote.

Meanwhile, Binance CEO Richard Teng did not immediately respond to the report within the first hour of its publication.

Instead, Teng took to X on March 13 to highlight his new interview with CNBC, where he praised Trump as a catalyst for a “global pro-crypto shift.” Teng expressed confidence that the crypto industry is widely supporting Trump, stating: 

Still, some apparently have not been happy with all of Trump's crypto policies, with many advocating for Bitcoin-only US reserves instead of a multi-crypto approach that has been eventually chosen by the administration.

House Democrats have also been concerned about the plummeting TRUMP memecoin, proposing legislation to ban the issuance of memecoins by any US public officials.

 US President Donald Trump's mercurial trade policies have shifted the business landscape for Bitcoin miners. 

Bitcoin miners are adapting their business strategies as the continued trade war between the US and Canada makes energy prices and policies all the more uncertain.

US President Donald Trump threatened to double his tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, leading the government of the province of Ontario to walk back its own plan to increase the cost of power exports to the US.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford had promised to further increase the surcharge or even “shut off the electricity completely,” given further provocation. However, he appears to have softened his stance, at least for now. 

The trade war may have reached a lull, but some crypto firms are looking ahead at possible policy changes in order to protect their growth. 

Ben Ganon, the CEO of Canadian Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms, told Bloomberg on March 11 that the recent energy price hikes, had they gone through, were unlikely to affect his firm's business. 

Bitfarms' operations are mostly in Quebec and British Columbia, both of which boast significant hydroelectric capacity in relation to the total provincial energy mix. Ontario, by comparison, is “not as robust of an energy market. And over the last several years, they've really taken a big push on cutting back on baseload capacity.”

But even though Bitfarms' energy situation may look solid for the time being, Ganon said that the tariffs “have implications for what policy and regulatory frameworks are going to look like in the future.”

He said that his firm wants to see “greater access to electricity markets” as well as fewer regulations on setting up a new business or new power applications. 

Energy policy has been a contentious area of debate in Canadian politics, with critics accusing the Liberal government — now led by Prime Minister Mark Carney — of harming the Canadian economy with their strategies to lower emissions.

Ganon said: “The opportunities that are present in the United States are also present in Canada. And I think that this will all resolve itself and end up in a much more deregulated and smooth and efficient market because for years it's been tied up in regulatory red tape.”

Tariffs on goods such as steel, aluminum, and other industrial products — intended to encourage domestic production in the US—  also impact Bitcoin miners, with some effects being unexpectedly beneficial.

While Ganon noted that miners can't control the Bitcoin price, they can control their electricity costs. “One of the ways that we can do that is we can look for pockets of energy that are underutilized, that used to power heavy industry, which has been outsourced to other countries over the last 20 or 30 years.”

According to Ganon, Bitfarms has operations in Pennsylvania — a “Rust Belt” state heavily affected by the outsourcing of American steel and metals industries. His firm's assets could soon be in high demand if the US manufacturing industry were to come back from the dead.

Ganon said that Bitcoin miners have been investing heavily in energy infrastructure that “used to power aluminum smelters and steel refineries and all the stuff which was outsourced.”

“Now Bitcoin miners have these assets. And as the pendulum swings back to America, those assets are now in high demand.”

Canadian miners like Bitfarms may be unconcerned for now, but Trump's tariffs on China have already begun to squeeze American crypto miners, who import hardware from China-based firms like Bitmain.

According to Bloomberg, shipments of Bitcoin mining hardware from China to the US were experiencing significant delays as of February 2025. The delays reportedly were the result of the US blacklisting Bitmain's AI affiliate Xiamen Sophgo Technologies. 

Heavy customs fees for inspections of Bitmain-affiliated hardware have cost US miners up to $500,000, according to Vishnu Mackenchery, director of global logistics and services at Compass Mining Inc. New tariffs could make new imports of next-gen miners to the US “completely cost-prohibitive,” according to Synteq Digital CEO Taras Kulyk.

China-based mining hardware producers like Bitmain could set up operations in other countries to avoid US sanctions. During Trump's first term, when he imposed a 25% tax duty on a number of consumer electronic goods from China, many mining hardware producers moved to Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to avoid tariffs.

Bitmain even announced it would launch a US production line in December 2024 to “provide faster response times and more efficient services to the North American customers.” Bloomberg noted that the firm did not provide the exact location of its US line.

Trump's economic policies continue to be a mixed bag for the crypto industry. Wild fluctuations in trade policy and last-minute reversals have made the market difficult to predict. Elsewhere, the European Union has promised to impose counter-tariffs on the US, further threatening asset valuations.

 Solana price could drop as low as $80 if the bulls fail to defend the last support level between $125 and $110, following its ""death cross"" on the charts. 

Solana (SOL) price completed a “death cross” on the one-day chart on March 12, as the altcoin consolidated near its long-term support level at $125. 

This could potentially accelerate the SOL price sell-off in the near term for a drop below $100 for the first time since February 2024.

A death cross occurs when a bearish crossover occurs between the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), with the long-term indicator above the short-term indicator. 

Last month, the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) triggered a death cross on Solana's one-day chart, after which prices dropped 17%, from $137 to $122. 

While the SMA and EMA death crosses carry similar implications, the EMA triggers the death cross faster since it responds more quickly to price changes. A double death cross from the SMA and EMA will likely increase the possibility of a correction. 

Historically, the odds are neutral for Solana. Since its inception, SOL's price has witnessed a death cross three times (including 2025) when prices have been on a 90-day or higher downtrend. 

The first death cross in 2022 triggered a 90% collapse, but the FTX's fiasco escalated its severity. The second death cross occurred in September 2024, but it reversed within a month, leading to the Trump rally.

Yet, the current structure and sentiment mirror the 2022 death cross when we compare market conditions. On both occasions, a new all-time high preceded the downtrend, which led to the death cross.

As Cointelegraph reported, Solana's revenue dropped 93% since January, dropping from $238 million to $32 million. This indicates a current lack of activity on Solana's network after the end of the memecoin frenzy.

Based on its technicals, Solana remains in a tricky spot when comparing previous death cross returns and collective market sentiment. 

Solana must hold support between $125 and $110 for a bullish reversal. Since March 2024, SOL prices have rebounded six times after testing the support range, closing above $125 on each weekly retest.

A weekly close below $125 will signal market weakness, potentially increasing the likelihood of a drop below $100. The immediate price target after $110 is around $80 for Solana, which is a significant 30% correction. The downtrend target carries confluence with the weekly 0.5 Fibonacci retracement line.

However, the bulls will pin their hopes on a bullish divergence between the price and relative strength index (RSI) on the 1-day and 4-hour charts. 

If Solana manages to avoid another lower low, the divergences will remain valid, which can push prices higher above $125, enabling Solana to avoid a drop below $100 and possibly establish a bottom at $112.

 Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.33 billion of outflows in March, then broke a seven-day outflow streak as BTC nears $85,000 despite macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical uncertainties. 

Over $1.67 billion exited US spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in March, but investors stopped the bleeding by bringing in $13.3 million on March 12 as the BTC market price inched closer to $85,000.

As of March 12, spot Bitcoin ETFs had attracted $35.4 million worth of inflows spread across two days, according to Farside Investors data. On the other hand, spot Ether ETFs recorded inflows on just one occasion, bringing in $14.6 million on March 4.

According to Sosovalue, the cumulative net inflows of BTC ETFs confirmed the recent $13.3 million inflow on March 12, signaling a pause in Bitcoin's ETF outflows.

The total value of the trades that day for Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $2.01 billion, its lowest daily value since Feb. 20. The inflows were contributed by three BTC funds: BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC).

On the Ethereum side, the one day of inflows saw contributions from the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH).

The broader market downturn and macroeconomic uncertainties have contributed to the ETF outflows, driven by geopolitical tensions, trade wars and bearish investor sentiment.

Analysts say that the lack of concrete implementation or unmet expectations regarding President Donald Trump's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan has also exacerbated selling pressure.

Despite Bitcoin maintaining levels above $80,000, market watchers warned that the upcoming European Union retaliatory tariffs could introduce greater volatility, further influencing Bitcoin's price trajectory.

 An Argentine lawyer who represented a former president in a fraud case asked for a global arrest warrant to be issued for LIBRA token creator Hayden Davis. 

Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon has reportedly asked for a global arrest warrant to be issued for Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the LIBRA token that caused a political scandal in the country.

Dalbon submitted a request to prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and judge María Servini, who are probing President Javier Milei's involvement in the memecoin, seeking for an Interpol Red Notice to be issued for Davis, local outlets Página 12 and Perfil reported on March 11.

Dalbon said in the filing that there was a “procedural risk” if Davis remained free as he could have access to vast amounts of money that would allow him to either flee the US or go into hiding.

“His central role in the creation and promotion of the $LIBRA cryptocurrency, coupled with the international impact of the case, increases the likelihood that he will take steps to evade justice,” the document reportedly stated.

Dalbon, who represented former Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in her corruption case, asked for Davis' arrest and for “an Interpol red notice [to] be issued in order to locate and arrest him, with a view to his extradition.”

Interpol is the biggest international police organization and can issue Red Notices that request law enforcement agencies around the world to locate and provisionally arrest someone.

LIBRA is a token that Milei shared across his social media accounts just minutes after its creation on Feb. 14, which catapulted it to a peak value of over $4 billion. The token's creators held most of the supply and quickly sold their holdings, which caused the token's price to crash, with many claiming the token was a pump-and-dump scheme.

Days later, various lawyers reportedly filed fraud charges against Milei in an Argentine criminal court for promoting the token, while other lawyers reported the president for financial crimes to local authorities and to the US Justice Department.

Milei has claimed he didn't “promote” the LIBRA token and insisted he just “spread the word” about it. 

In a lengthy interview days after LIBRA's collapse with YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, better known as “Coffeezilla,” Davis defended the token as a failure rather than a scam.

Davis and his firm, Kelsier Ventures, were the biggest winners from the LIBRA token launch. He claimed to Findeisen that he netted around $100 million but said he didn't own the tokens and wouldn't be selling them.

It was later reported that he sent a text message bragging about being able to pay Milei's sister, Karina Milei, to have the president share the memecoin's details on X. Davis later said he had no record of this on his phone and denied making payments to the Mileis.

 The Turkish Capital Markets Board established full regulatory control over crypto asset platforms, taking responsibility for CASP licensing, operations and compliance. 

Turkey is advancing its cryptocurrency regulations with new rules for crypto asset service providers (CASPs).

On March 13, Turkey's Capital Markets Board (CMB) published two regulatory documents regarding the licensing and operations of CASPs, including crypto exchanges, custodians and wallet service providers.

The framework grants the CMB full oversight of crypto platforms, ensuring compliance with national and international standards.

It also sets standards and requirements for establishing and providing crypto asset services in Turkey, covering establishment capital, history of executives, shareholder rules and others.

Under the framework, the minimum capital requirement for exchanges is $4.1 million, while custodians are required to have at least $13.7 million, international attorney Burcak Ünsal told Cointelegraph.

“Fixed assets, receivables, available for sale financial assets are excluded from the minimum capital requirement,” he noted.

Additionally, CASPs will be required to invest in compliance infrastructure and establish dedicated risk management teams to identify and manage a range of risks. The providers must also establish a price monitoring system to alert suspicious trading activity.

Turkish CASPs must adhere to stringent reporting requirements, providing the CMB with timely information about their operations.

The new framework also further strengthens Turkey's crypto Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards, requiring CASPs to record significant data sets of transaction information, including canceled and unexecuted transactions.

Turkey previously introduced crypto AML regulations in December 2024, requiring users to share identifying information with CASPs for transactions of more than 15,000 Turkish liras ($409).

According to Ünsal, the CMB's framework also prohibits derivative transactions with crypto.

On the other hand, exchanges are entitled to launch initial coin offerings provided that they review the relevant smart contracts and ensure listing criteria.

“The crypto regulations are mute about how security tokens are defined. However, the issuance of security tokens is not prohibited,” the attorney noted. “Buying goods and services with crypto in Turkiye remains prohibited due to Central Bank regulations,” he added.

According to the lawyer, the regulations have different grace periods to enter into force, with most of them entering into force on June 30, 2025, and by the end of the year at the latest.

According to the document, Turkey's new crypto regulations align with global standards and follow regulatory approaches set by Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

 Ether has ignored oversold signals for two months already, raising concerns that a bottom against Bitcoin is still not in. 

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has dropped to its multi-year lows against Bitcoin (BTC), prompting analysts to predict further declines in the coming weeks.

On March 13, ETH/BTC—a pair that tracks Ether's strength against Bitcoin—dropped by over 1.50% to reach $0.022, its lowest level since May 2020.

ETH's descent is part of its multi-year downtrend that started when it established a record high of $0.156 in June 2017. Since then, it has plunged by more than 85%, underscoring Ether's growing weakness against Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, on the two-week ETH/BTC chart, the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator used to measure whether an asset is overbought or oversold, has fallen to a record low of 23.32.

Typically, when RSI drops below 30, it signals oversold conditions, potentially leading to a price rebound. 

However, in Ethereum's case, RSI has continued to plunge even lower even two months after becoming oversold, suggesting that ETH's downtrend is still accelerating rather than stabilizing.

Crypto analyst Alessandro Ottaviani has described the situation as a “falling knife” scenario—a term used to describe an asset that is experiencing a rapid and steep decline, often discouraging buyers from stepping in too soon. 

A falling knife implies that attempting to catch the asset at a perceived low could lead to further losses if the downtrend persists.

For Ethereum to signal a potential reversal, traders will be watching for RSI stabilization and reclaim of key resistance levels. That ideally begins with a rebound from the 0.022 BTC level, which had limited ETH/BTC's downside attempts in December 2020, leading to a 300% rally.

Should a rebound happen, the ETH/BTC pair can rally toward its 0.382 Fibonacci retracement line at around 0.038 BTC, aligning with the 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave).

Until then, the technical outlook suggests that ETH/BTC could remain trapped in its falling knife trajectory, with the next potential downside targets at historical support levels inside the 0.020-0.016 BTC range.

The lowest point of this range is approximately 30% below the current price levels.

Ether's prospects of declining further against Bitcoin are rooted in factors beyond technical analysis. 

For instance, Ethereum currently faces strong competition from rival layer-1 blockchains, namely Solana (SOL).

VanEck noted that Solana's decentralized exchange volume has surpassed Ethereum's even during a steep dropoff in memecoin trading activity. Meanwhile, Solana's volume has risen consistently in recent months, which coincides with a decline in Ethereum's volumes.

Furthermore, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has fundamentally altered the traditional crypto market cycle that used to benefit Ethereum and other altcoins.

Historically, after Bitcoin surged post-halving, capital rotated into altcoins, triggering an “altseason” where ETH and other assets outperformed BTC. However, the $129 billion inflows into Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 have disrupted this cycle, draining liquidity from the broader altcoin market—including Ethereum.

Another factor is Ethereum-specific selling pressure. 

The recent Bybit hack reportedly led to substantial ETH liquidations, with some of that value laundered via decentralized platforms like Thorchain. This absorbed sell-off may still be rippling through the market, depressing ETH's relative value.

 Wallet's new generation will be rolled out in the next two months and will allow users to gain yields on assets like Tether USDt. 

Wallet in Telegram, a third-party cryptocurrency wallet Mini App on Telegram, is set to expand its custodial crypto services, adding at least 50 new cryptocurrencies and launching an earn feature for users.

The Open Platform (TOP), the largest venture builder in The Open Network (TON) ecosystem, which manages Wallet in Telegram as one of its portfolio businesses, announced the rollout of the next wallet generation on March 13, introducing a wide range of new features.

With the rollout, Wallet in Telegram will add at least 50 new crypto assets, including major cryptocurrencies Ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP), as well as memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE), a spokesperson for Wallet told Cointelegraph.

Wallet's new generation is set to be rolled out within the next two months and will also introduce an “Earn” feature, which will allow users to gain yields on assets including Tether's USDt (USDT).

Initially, Wallet users will be able to buy, sell and hold non-TON tokens without onchain deposits or withdrawals, meaning altcoin transactions to other wallets and exchanges will not be allowed.

“The current stage of the rollout is only available for in-app transactions for non-TON tokens,” Wallet's spokesperson said, adding that the altcoin option is only available for trading within the custodial wallet. The spokesperson added:

“The list of tokens is not final yet, as it will be rolling out gradually within the next two months,” the spokesperson said, adding that the first release will feature 50 assets, with a full list now being finalized.

In addition to expanding Wallet with a large number of altcoins, TOP is working to introduce the new “Trade” section and the “Earn” section.

Starting with Toncoin (TON), the first Earn campaign will provide a “flexible yield” on TON deposits, with a minimum deposit amount of 0.1 TON.

“The yield is generated from TON staking,” the spokesperson for Wallet said.

In addition to Toncoin, Wallet plans to expand the earn offering to more altcoins and stablecoins, including Tether's USDt (USDT), the announcement stated.

 North Korean affiliated hacking collective has been laundering ETH and deploying new strains of crypto stealing malware targeting developers. 

North Korean-affiliated hacking collective the Lazarus Group has been moving crypto assets using mixers following a string of high-profile hacks. 

On March 13, blockchain security firm CertiK alerted its X followers that it had detected a deposit of 400 ETH (ETH) worth around $750,000 to the Tornado Cash mixing service. 

“The fund traces to the Lazarus group's activity on the Bitcoin network,” it noted. 

The North Korean hacking group was responsible for the massive Bybit exchange hack that resulted in the theft of $1.4 billion worth of crypto assets on Feb. 21. 

It has also been linked to the $29 million Phemex exchange hack in January and has been laundering assets ever since.

Lazarus has also been linked to some of the most notorious crypto hacking incidents, including the $600 million Ronin network hack in 2022.

North Korean hackers stole over $1.3 billion worth of crypto assets in 47 incidents in 2024, more than doubling thefts in 2023, according to Chainalysis data.

According to researchers at cybersecurity firm Socket, Lazarus Group has deployed six new malicious packages to infiltrate developer environments, steal credentials, extract cryptocurrency data and install backdoors. 

It has targeted the Node Package Manager (NPM) ecosystem, which is a large collection of JavaScript packages and libraries.

Researchers discovered malware called “BeaverTail” embedded in packages that mimic legitimate libraries using typosquatting tactics or methods used to deceive developers. 

“Across these packages, Lazarus uses names that closely mimic legitimate and widely trusted libraries,” they added.

The malware also targets cryptocurrency wallets, specifically Solana and Exodus wallets, the added.

The attack targets files in Google Chrome, Brave and Firefox browsers, as well as keychain data on macOS, specifically targeting developers who might unknowingly install the malicious packages.

The researchers noted that attributing this attack definitively to Lazarus remains challenging; however, “the tactics, techniques, and procedures observed in this npm attack closely align with Lazarus's known operations.”

 The former Binance CEO served four months in prison in 2024 as part of a plea deal with US authorities and the crypto exchange. 

Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has denied many of the claims in a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that he has been actively seeking a federal pardon from US President Donald Trump.

In a March 13 X post following the release of the report, Zhao said he had no discussions regarding a business deal between the Trump family and Binance.US. He further denied claims that he wanted a presidential pardon from Trump, which could potentially allow him to assume an operational or management role at Binance.

“No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA [Bank Secrecy Act] charge,” said CZ. “Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto' from the last administration are still at work.”

CZ's statement on a March 13 Wall Street Journal report. Source: Changpeng Zhao

In November 2023, Binance reached a deal with US authorities requiring the exchange to pay $4.3 billion and Zhao to plead guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failure to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the exchange. CZ stepped down as CEO, was later sentenced to four months in prison, and reportedly was permanently enjoined from operating or managing Binance as part of the deal.

Having already served time in prison, CZ seeking any potential pardon from Trump would not erase the former CEO's felony charge. However, according to the US Justice Department, a pardon will “facilitate removal of legal disabilities imposed because of the conviction” — e.g., potentially removing any restrictions on Zhao's involvement with the crypto industry.

The 2023 deal with Binance did not resolve the US Securities and Exchange Commission's civil case with the crypto exchange. However, after the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the appointment of Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair, the regulator filed for a 60-day pause in court. 

Since Trump took office in January, the SEC has dropped several investigations and enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including those who donated to his campaign or inauguration fund. 

In addition to halting Binance's case, the SEC may be considering wrapping up its civil suit against Ripple Labs.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD circling $81,500, down 2.3% on the day.

The February print of the Producer Price Index (PPI) came in below median expectations, copying the Consumer Price Index (CPI) results from the day prior.

“On an unadjusted basis, the index for final demand advanced 3.2 percent for the 12 months ended in February,” an accompanying press release from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) stated.

Despite this, both stocks and crypto remained unmoved, leading trading resource The Kobeissi Letter to tie in the ongoing US trade war.

“As we have seen, the market has had a very MUTED reaction to inflation data that would've previously sent the S&P 500 SHARPLY higher,” it wrote in part of its latest analysis on X.

Kobeissi explained that trader war efforts may now intensify, given slowing inflation.

“This is exactly why markets are not recovering losses following some of the best inflation data in months,” it continued, suggesting traders should “buckle up for more volatility.”

A week before the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision, market expectations for financial easing remained similarly lackluster, with the chance of a cut at just 1%, per data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool. Odds for the Fed's May meeting were at 28%.

“The Fed has already decided: steady course, no cuts this FOMC. Powell made that clear last week,” popular crypto trader Josh Rager told X followers earlier in the week, referencing a recent speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. 

Bitcoin price action thus sat between bands of buy and sell liquidity on exchange order books, with the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) in place as resistance.

For Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, this trendline, which typically functions as support during Bitcoin bull markets, was the nearest important level to reclaim.

“Bitcoin faces strong resistance at the 200-Day MA for the 4th consecutive day,” he summarized on X.

Referring to Material Indicators' proprietary trading tools, Alan concluded that such a reclaim was unlikely on the day, notwithstanding surprise catalysts in the form of announcements from the US government.

The USDC (USDC) and USDt (USDT) stablecoins have become a “store of value” in Latin America, accounting for 39% of total purchases on Bitso in 2024, the firm said in its third edition of the Latin America Crypto Landscape report issued on March 12.

The report highlighted a significant increase in stablecoin adoption on the platform, with total stablecoin purchases surging 9% from 2023.

“In Latin America, challenging macroeconomic conditions, characterized by high inflation and currency devaluations, drove increased cryptocurrency adoption — particularly stablecoins — as a reliable store of value,” Bitso stated in the report.

While stablecoin purchases surged, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a notable decline in trading volume on Bitso in 2024, with its share dropping to 22% from 38% in the second half of 2023.

According to Bitso, the decline in BTC purchases in Latin America indicates the growing trend of the hodl strategy, which implies buying and holding the cryptocurrency to profit from its long-term value appreciation.

The drop in BTC purchases aligned with the bull market of 2024, with Bitcoin rallying past $100,000 for the first time in history in December.

As Bitso users held off on Bitcoin purchases in 2024, buying activity switched to stablecoins like USDC and USDT, with the former leading the race at 24%.

USDT purchases accounted for 15% of total cryptocurrencies acquired on Bitso in 2024.

A more detailed analysis of geographical preferences among Latin American countries showed a massive trend for USDT use in Argentina, which is known for its high stablecoin adoption due to inflation rates surpassing 100%.

According to the report, Bitso users in Argentina mostly favored purchases of USDT and USDC in 2024, accounting for 50% and 22% of all crypto purchases in the country, respectively.

On the other hand, the share of Bitcoin purchases in Argentina accounted for just 8% of crypto purchases last year on Bitso, the lowest share among other analyzed countries.

Brazilian and Mexican Bitso users still continued to favor Bitcoin as the most purchased crypto asset last year, with the BTC buying percentages accounting for 22% and 25%, respectively.

 ETH's price has declined substantially since the most recent high of over $4,000 reached in December 2024, as post-election hype dies down. 

If the price of Ether (ETH) falls by a further 20%, the price decline could trigger a cascade of up to $336 million in decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidations, according to Kevin Rusher, founder of the real-world asset (RWA) lending platform RAAC.

The executive warned that a decline to $1,857 would trigger $136 million in liquidations, and a price drop to $1,780 could potentially trigger an additional $117 million in loan liquidations — making these the next price levels to watch.

Rusher added that the worst-case scenario would be a 20% drop in ETH's price to around the $1,500 price level, which could liquidate $336 million in DeFi loans, sending the markets tumbling. In a written statement shared with Cointelegraph, Rusher said:

The executive called for integrating RWAs, such as real estate and gold, which feature much stabler values, into the DeFi ecosystem to offset volatility and prevent cascading liquidations due to overleveraging.

Ether has dropped to multi-year lows against Bitcoin (BTC), signaling another potential 30% drop against the supply-capped asset, and led to some analysts predicting a potential $1,600 price bottom for ETH.

ETH's price has declined by over 15% in the past seven days and has been trading well below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) since February.

The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 31, which is almost in oversold territory, potentially representing a local bottom and could signal an impending price reversal.

Ether's disappointing price action prompted calls from some market analysts to shift into higher-performing altcoins to maximize profit potential.

“If still stuck on ETH, it is likely a good time to dump it to buy a higher beta altcoin,” trader Alex Krüger said in a March 12 X post.

 The new legislation is designed to protect users of crypto kiosks and ATMs in the state by requiring licensing and introducing transaction and fee limits. 

The governor of Nebraska, Jim Pillen, has signed legislation to protect against cryptocurrency fraud as crypto ATM crime skyrockets in the United States.

“Cryptocurrency is an important, emerging industry, and we've been working hard to build Nebraska into a cryptocurrency leader,” said Governor Pillen on March 12 following the signing of the bill. 

“An important part of these efforts is to make sure that we have guardrails to prevent criminals from taking advantage of Nebraskans,” he added.  

The bipartisan legislation establishes the “Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act,” which is designed to help combat fraud and protect users of crypto kiosks and ATMs.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, victims have lost over $65 million to crypto ATM fraud in the first half of 2024. “Fraud losses at BTMs (Bitcoin ATMs) are skyrocketing, increasing nearly tenfold from 2020 to 2023,” the commission reported in September. 

The bill, LB 609, was introduced on Jan. 22 by Senator Eliot Bostar. It stipulates that crypto ATM and kiosk operators must be licensed under Nebraska's Money Transmitters Act and registered and approved by the Department of Banking and Finance. Operators must provide quarterly reports on kiosk locations, names and transaction data.

It also implements transaction limits of $2,000 per day for new users and $5,000 per day for existing customers, and fees cannot exceed 18% of the transaction value. 

New customers who report fraud within 90 days can receive a full refund, including fees, while existing customers can be refunded for the fees associated with fraudulent transactions.

Kiosk operators must also display fraud warnings and appoint a compliance officer to enforce fraud prevention measures, it states. 

The US crypto ATM network shrunk by more than 1,200 machines earlier this month after Illinois Senator Dick Durbin introduced similar legislation.

“Nebraska is open for business in the cryptocurrency space,” commented state Department of Banking director Kelly Lammers, who added, “those that target our citizens … using crypto ATMs as part of their transfer method, we will soon have a team that will be watching even more closely.”

While being supportive of crypto, Nebraska has yet to join the 21 US states that have proposed legislation to establish strategic crypto reserves, according to the Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.

 A new ECB survey reveals significant consumer reluctance toward adopting a digital euro, with Europeans seeing little value in the CBDC. 

European consumers have shown minimal interest in adopting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), raising concerns for the European Central Bank (ECB) as it prepares for a potential rollout of the digital euro.

An ECB working paper on “Consumer attitudes towards a central bank digital currency,” which surveyed about 19,000 respondents across 11 euro-area countries, highlighted significant communication challenges that are discouraging European households from adopting the digital euro. 

When asked to hypothetically allocate 10,000 euros (roughly $10,800) across various assets, Europeans allocated only a small portion to the digital euro, having little impact on traditional liquid assets like cash, current accounts or savings accounts.

According to the March 12 ECB working paper, Europeans have a strong preference for existing payment methods and see no real benefit in a new type of payment system amid myriads of offline and online alternatives:

The study suggested that while a digital euro could be introduced with minimal disruption to financial stability, its adoption faces significant hurdles due to consumer habits. 

Additionally, it stressed the importance of targeted communication to address persistent consumer reluctance toward a digital euro.

The ECB paper found that European consumers were receptive to video-based education and training and concluded that educating the masses with CBDC-related video information could help with the widespread adoption of the digital euro:

The study's release comes as US lawmakers intensify their opposition to CBDCs. Speaking at the House Financial Services Committee hearing on March 11, Representative Tom Emmer said Congress should “prioritize pro-stablecoin legislation alongside anti-CBDC legislation.”

Emmer said, “CBDC technology is inherently un-American” and unelected officials should not be allowed to issue it. Emmer also reintroduced the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, which would prevent future US administrations from launching CBDCs.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Börse CEO Stephan Leithner recently called for the establishment of a permanent digital euro, among other reforms, to strengthen the region's financial autonomy.

 Hardware wallet provider Ledger showed Trezor that it was able to bypass a security check in Trezor's Safe 3 and 5 models, prompting Trezor to patch up the flaw. 

Hardware wallet provider Trezor has patched up a security flaw in two of its latest models after competitor firm Ledger's open-source research arm discovered a vulnerability in their microcontrollers. 

Ledger Donjon acknowledged Trezor has made several security advancements of late but found cryptographic operations could still be performed on the microcontroller of Trezor's Safe 3 and 5 models, which could make them “vulnerable to more advanced attacks.”

Fortunately, Trezor has since addressed the vulnerabilities found, Ledger's chief technology officer Charles Guillemet said in a March 12 X post.

“We believe that making the ecosystem more secure helps everyone, and is critical as we push towards broader adoption of crypto and digital assets,” Guillemet added.

Trezor had already implemented “Secure Elements” — chips designed to protect the user's PIN code and cryptographic secrets — as some of Trezor's devices could be tampered with by modifying the software running on it, potentially allowing threat actors to steal user funds.

The Secure Elements feature “effectively thwarts any inexpensive hardware attack, in particular voltage glitching,” Ledger said in a March 12 post.

However, Ledger found another potential attack vector stemmed from the microcontroller, the other main part of Trezor's two-chip design for its Safe 3 and 5 models.

Trezor implemented a firmware integrity check to detect modified software, but Ledger was able to demonstrate that an attacker could still bypass this security check.

This issue has since been resolved by Trezor — though neither Ledger nor Trezor have explained how. Cointelegraph reached out to Trezor but didn't receive an immediate response.

Trezor confirmed on X that user funds remain safe and that no action is required.

However, when asked whether Trezor was able to patch this issue via firmware, the hardware wallet provider responded: “Unfortunately not.”

Ledger isn't immune to security vulnerabilities either.

In December 2023, a hacker committed a security breach into Ledger's connector library and stole $484,000 worth of crypto assets.

Another threat actor who breached Ledger's systems published the mailing addresses of around 270,000 Ledger customers in June 2020.

 Dubai International Financial Center CEO Arif Amiri said Ripple was the first licensed blockchain payment provider in the DIFC. 

Update March 13, 9:22 am UTC: This article has been updated to add comments from a Ripple spokesperson.

Blockchain payment provider Ripple received full regulatory approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer cross-border crypto payment services in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The company announced on March 13 that it had secured its DFSA license, allowing it to operate in the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC), a UAE free-economic zone with its own tax policies and regulatory framework.

The announcement came almost six months after the company announced its receipt of an in-principle approval of the DFSA license. On Oct. 1, 2024, Ripple revealed that it was working to become licensed by the DFSA as it aimed to roll out its digital asset infrastructure in the UAE. 

With this license, Ripple can now provide its global blockchain-based payment solutions to businesses across the UAE. The company said this allows it to cater to financial institutions looking for partners to help them use digital assets in real-world applications. 

In a news release sent to Cointelegraph, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the UAE is “well-placed” to benefit from tech and crypto innovation, thanks to its early leadership and supportive environment:

Ripple also reported that it had seen increased demand across the Middle East for cross-border payments. The company said the demand was not limited to crypto-native firms but also came from traditional financial institutions. 

In a statement, a Ripple spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the company is also working to understand stablecoin requirements to comply with upcoming regulations in the UAE. The spokesperson said the firm monitors the Central Bank of the UAE's (CBUAE) moves to regulate stablecoins. 

“This is something we're monitoring closely, and we are working with the CBUAE to understand the requirements and timelines for when this regulation comes into effect,” the spokesperson said.

They added that Ripple is making it a priority to ensure the worldwide availability of RLUSD. The stablecoin is available in the UAE through a crypto exchange called CoinMENA.

With DFSA approval, Ripple has become the first blockchain-enabled payments provider to operate within DIFC's free zone, according to DIFC CEO Arif Amiri.

”We are thrilled that Ripple is deepening their commitment to Dubai by securing a DFSA license that makes them the first blockchain-enabled payments provider in DIFC,” he said.

The license allows Ripple to tap into opportunities in the UAE and the broader MENA region, he added.

 Crypto market trading volume has declined by more than 50% since February, when it was at its highest levels this year. 

Crypto trading volumes and dwindling digital asset prices are flashing signs of trader exhaustion and potentially weaker market momentum, according to analysts. 

Crypto-wide trading volume has been dropping since it peaked in February amid dip-buying opportunities. According to CoinGecko data, daily trading volume hit its highest level this year in early February when it reached $440 billion. It has since sunk by 63% to $163 billion on March 12. 

Market data firm CoinMarketCap has slightly lower figures but they show the same trend — that volume peaked in 2025 in early March before falling back 52% to current levels.  

Analytics firm Santiment said on X on March 13 that this decline in volume suggests that trader enthusiasm for the asset class is diminishing.

Santiment added that trader behavior “indicates a mix of exhaustion, hopelessness, and capitulation” following further market capitalization declines over the past fortnight.

Total market capitalization has declined almost 25% since the beginning of February, shrinking by $900 billion as the crypto market correction deepens. 

Those declines have accelerated over the past 10 days when markets have lost 15% as fears of a recession in the United States increased amid escalating global trade tensions.

Santiment stated that traders are becoming cautious, suggesting they might not believe that the current upward price movements will last. “Essentially, reduced trading activity reflects uncertainty, as fewer traders are convinced that buying at current levels will yield profitable outcomes,” the analysts added.

Weakening trading volume amid minor price bounces can serve as an “early warning sign of weakening market momentum,” Santiment reported, adding that without robust buying participation, price gains can quickly lose steam, “as there simply isn't enough underlying support to sustain the upward trend.”

However, shrinking volume during minor rebounds isn't necessarily a direct bearish signal, it said, adding that volume is a metric that measures participation from both retail and institutional traders and it needs to start rising before prices do.

Crypto market capitalization is currently around $2.8 trillion, which is where it was this time last year before seven months of consolidation followed. 

Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in “fear” territory, below 50, where it has been since Feb. 21.

 Bitcoin price faces pressure, but macroeconomic trends and regulatory shifts could drive future growth with BTC poised to reach six-figures once again. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has risen 8% from its March 11 low of $76,703, driven in part by large investors aggressively buying the dip with leverage. 

Margin longs on Bitfinex surged to their highest level since November 2024, adding 13,787 BTC over 17 days. Currently standing at $5.7 billion, this bullish leveraged positioning signals confidence in Bitcoin's upside potential despite recent price weakness.

Some analysts argue that Bitcoin's price is closely linked to the global monetary base, meaning it tends to rise as central banks inject liquidity. 

With recession risks mounting, the likelihood of expansionary monetary policies increasing the money supply grows. If this correlation holds, Bitfinex whales could be well-positioned to capitalize on a rally above $105,000 in the next two months.

For instance, X user Pakpakchicken claims to have identified an 82% correlation between the global money supply (M2) and Bitcoin's price. 

When central banks drain liquidity by raising interest rates or reducing bond holdings, traders become more risk-averse, leading to weaker demand for Bitcoin. Conversely, periods of monetary easing tend to fuel greater investor interest in the asset, increasing its price potential.

In early September 2024, Bitfinex margin traders added 7,840 BTC in long positions, coinciding with a period of bearish momentum as Bitcoin struggled to reclaim the $50,000 level for over three months. 

Despite the downturn, Bitfinex whales held their positions, and Bitcoin's price surged past $75,000 less than two months later. Notably, the global M2 money supply bottomed out around the same time these traders increased their Bitcoin exposure, further reinforcing the correlation.

It may be impossible to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between money supply and investors' willingness to accumulate Bitcoin, especially given the influence of major events during these periods. 

For example, Donald Trump's election as US president in November 2024 significantly fueled Bitcoin's rally due to the new administration's pro-crypto stance, regardless of global M2 trends and liquidity conditions.

Similarly, Michael Saylor's latest plan to raise up to $21 billion in fresh capital for Strategy to acquire more Bitcoin could shift market dynamics, even accounting for the $4.1 billion in net outflows from Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since Feb. 24. 

Strategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 499,096 BTC acquired at a total cost of $33.1 billion, reinforcing its long-term bullish strategy.

In essence, the expansion of the global money supply may have influenced the increase in Bitfinex margin longs, but Bitcoin's push toward $105,000 could be primarily driven by industry-specific news and events. 

A Wall Street Journal report on March 13 revealed that representatives of Donald Trump have held discussions about potentially acquiring a stake in Binance.

So far, the market impact of a more crypto-friendly US government has yet to yield concrete benefits. 

For example, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has not yet clarified whether banks can custody digital assets and manage stablecoins without prior approval. 

Similarly, Acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda announced plans to remove crypto-specific provisions from a proposed rule that would expand exchange definitions.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission is currently reviewing requests from spot Bitcoin ETF issuers to permit in-kind creations and redemptions, allowing shares to be exchanged directly for Bitcoin instead of using the traditional cash-based method.

Meanwhile, global macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated, putting pressure on Bitcoin's price. However, these same factors gradually push governments toward economic stimulus measures and expand the M2 money supply.

If this trend continues, it should ultimately create conditions for Bitcoin's price to meet Pakpakchicken's $105,000 prediction by May 2025 and possibly go even higher.

 A crypto trader fell victim to a sandwich attack on March 12, losing over $215,000, and one industry pundit suspects they may have been attacked another five times on the same day. 

A crypto trader fell victim to a sandwich attack while making a $220,764 stablecoin transfer on March 12 — losing almost 98% of its value to a Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) bot.

$220,764 worth of the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin was swapped to $5,271 of Tether (USDT) in eight seconds as the MEV bot successfully front-ran the transaction, banking over $215,500.

Data from Ethereum block explorer shows the MEV attack occurred on decentralized exchange Uniswap v3's USDC-USDT liquidity pool, where $19.8 million worth of value is locked.

The MEV bot front-ran the transaction by swapping all the USDC liquidity out of the Uniswap v3 USDC-USDT pool and then put it back in after the transaction was executed, according to founder of The DeFi Report Michael Nadeau.

The attacker tipped Ethereum block builder “bob-the-builder.eth” $200,000 from the $220,764 swap and profited $8,000 themselves, Nadeau said.

DeFi researcher “DeFiac” speculates the same trader using different wallets has fallen victim to a total of six sandwich attacks, citing “internal tools.” They pointed out that all funds traveled from borrowing and lending protocol Aave before being deposited on Uniswap.

Two of the wallets fell victim to an MEV bot sandwich attack on March 12 at around 9:00 am UTC. Ethereum wallet addresses “0xDDe…42a6D” and “0x999…1D215” were sandwich attacked for $138,838 and $128,003 in transactions that occurred three to four minutes earlier.

Both transactors made the same swap in the Uniswap v3 liquidity pool as the trader who made the $220,762 transfer. 

Others speculate the trades could be attempts at money laundering.

“If you have NK illicit funds you could construct a very mev-able tx, then privately send it to a mev bot and have them arb it in a bundle,” said founder of crypto data dashboard DefiLlama, 0xngmi.

“That way you wash all the money with close to 0 losses.”

While initially criticizing Uniswap, Nadeau later acknowledged that the transactions didn't come from Uniswap's front end, which has MEV protection and default slippage settings.

Nadeau backtracked on those criticisms after Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams and others clarified the protections Uniswap has in place to fight against sandwich attacks.

	Helium atoms filled gaps in iron crystals under high pressure and temperature

Under high temperature and pressure, helium atoms (red circles) move into the spaces between iron atoms (red circles with black centers) in a piece of iron metal, as show in this map called an electron localization function.

Scientists have coaxed one of the universe's most stubborn elements into a new compound.

Formed under intense pressures, the newly discovered compound packs helium atoms into crystalline iron, researchers report February 25 in Physical Review Letters. The compound joins a short list of materials that incorporate the normally unreactive element and suggests that helium from the early solar system could be stored in the iron that makes up Earth's core.

Helium is one of the least reactive elements on the periodic table. Like the other noble gases, helium doesn't gain or lose electrons easily and so does not normally form chemical compounds. But under extremely high pressures, helium can interact with a few other elements, including nitrogen and sodium — and now iron, research shows.

To make the new iron compound, physicist Kei Hirose of the University of Tokyo and his colleagues squeezed iron and helium together in a diamond anvil cell, a high-pressure device that subjected the elements to pressures greater than 50,000 Earth atmospheres and temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. This compression formed crystals containing both iron and helium.

The volume of the crystal formed was larger than that of a crystal of pure iron at the same pressure, the team found. The researchers attributed this increase to helium ions packing into interstitial sites, the tiny spaces between iron atoms in the crystal. But the helium atoms don't bond directly to iron — they're too unreactive, even at extreme conditions.

“Helium is very happy as it is. It doesn't want to share an electron,” says Stefano Racioppi, a chemist at The State University of New York at Buffalo. But it can still participate in “chemistry without chemical bonds” to form these ordered, crystalline compounds.

The new compound could help explain observations of helium in Earth's interior, Hirose says. Most of Earth's helium atoms have two neutrons and form from the radioactive decay of elements like uranium. But some ocean volcanic eruptions release helium atoms with just one neutron. These atoms first formed shortly after the Big Bang. Earth picked up this “primordial” helium as the planet formed.

Its loss from magma suggests that the planet has a deep reservoir of primordial helium, and the new compounds suggest that Earth's iron-rich core could hold some of that helium. But the team will need additional experiments to determine whether helium is more likely to reside in Earth's core or higher in its mantle.

“The partitioning of helium between magma, silicate melt and metallic iron is really the key,” Hirose says. If helium is more stable in iron than in the silicates found in the mantle, that would suggest that the helium is more likely to reside in the core — and vice versa.

Computational physicist Ronald Cohen agrees. “I wouldn't say that it's a proof that there's helium in Earth's core, but it suggests that it's possible,” says Cohen, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.

Aside from the geophysical implications, the findings could further expand noble gas chemistry. “I would like to see whether this is unique for iron or if it could also happen to other transition metals,” says Maosheng Miao, a chemist at California State University, Northridge. Forming other helium metal compounds, he says, could lead to “chemistry that we never thought of.”

	The figurines indicate cultural connections with other parts of Mesoamerica

These oddly expressive figurines from the ancient Maya world were probably puppets for ritual scenes — and perhaps used for portraying people long dead.

Five oddly expressive clay figurines, made on the edge of the Maya world about 2,400 years ago, were probably used as puppets in public rituals to commemorate mythical or real events.

“They would have either represented actual personages, or they were generic ‘media' for rituals connected to rulers,” says archaeologist Jan Szymański of the University of Warsaw.

Szymański and his colleague Gabriela Prejs unearthed the puppets near the top of a ruined pyramid at the San Isidro archaeological site, a little under 50 kilometers west of San Salvador. The soil layer containing the puppets dates to about 400 B.C. But such figurines may have been used throughout the Maya Preclassic and Classic periods, from about 2000 B.C. to A.D. 900, Szymański and Prejs report March 5 in Antiquity.

One of the largest puppets is about 30 centimeters tall and depicts a man, while two others of similar size depict women. The three large figurines lack hair, but two smaller ones — one almost 18 centimeters tall and the other about 10 centimeters — depict women with locks of hair on their foreheads.

The puppets had no clothes when they were found, but Szymański thinks they were decorated for their ritual roles. “I'm pretty sure that they were given clothes and wigs in order to look more lifelike,” he says.

The most striking features of the large puppets are their movable heads and strange facial expressions. From eye level, the puppets look angry, but from above they seem to be grinning, and from below they look scared, Szymański says.

What messages or stories they would have been posed to convey, however, are not known.

University of Michigan archaeologist Joyce Marcus, an expert on Mesoamerican figurines who was not involved in the study, says the ability to move the puppets' heads was “probably a sight to behold, a kind of ‘numinous' [spiritual] experience.”

This suggests that the figurines may have portrayed participants in rituals, witnesses to certain events or deceased individuals who were “brought to life” during the public rituals, she says.

Similar figurines have been found elsewhere in Central America, hinting at unexpected cultural connections between the San Isidro site and these other areas. The region was once thought to be a southern frontier of Maya culture, centered in the lowlands of Chiapas and Yucatán in Mexico, as well as Belize and eastern parts of Guatemala. But Szymański says that the discoveries indicate the region was instead a cultural crossroads linking the Maya world with other societies.

	The spots and stripes familiar to us today didn't arise until later in mammalian evolution

Small mammals during the Mesozoic Era (some illustrated) may have had uniformly dark coloring, allowing them to blend into nocturnal environments.

Zebra stripes? Leopard print? Neither were in vogue among the earliest mammals during the Age of Dinosaurs.

Early mammals and their close relatives probably sported dark, drab coats from snout to tail, researchers report in the March 14 Science. The monochrome ensembles may have helped ancient mammals blend into their nighttime surroundings and evade predators.

Many dinosaurs — especially birds — showcase a vibrant array of colorful feathers. But the diversity of fur color among modern mammals is underappreciated, says Matthew Shawkey, an evolutionary biologist at Ghent University in Belgium. “There's obviously lots of patterns, stripes, spots, blotches, all those types of things,” he says. “But also fairly diverse colors: grays, yellows, oranges.”

Yet very little is known about the evolution of mammals' colors or their presence in the fossil record, Shawkey says. Though pigment-containing structures called melanosomes have yielded details about the bright feathers of extinct birds, details about fossilized mammals' coat colors remain scarce, save for recent evidence of reddish fur in a 3-million-year-old mouse fossil. 

Shawkey and his colleagues used a scanning electron microscope to analyze melanosomes in the hairs of 116 modern mammals, linking their shapes and sizes to the colors they produce. After organizing the known melanosomes by various physical features, the team used statistics to test their ability to predict which colors others would produce. Melanosomes responsible for brighter colors, such as reds and oranges, are rounder, the researchers found, while blacks and browns generally come from elongated melanosomes.

Working with colleagues in China, the team applied this predictive power to melanosomes in preserved hairs from six early mammals and close relatives that lived in China 120 million to 167 million years ago, mostly during the Jurassic Period — the middle phase of the Mesozoic Era. While modern mammals exhibit an extensive range of these pigment-bearing structures, those from the six protomammals fell within a narrow range associated with dark grays and browns across their bodies, suggesting the ancient beasts had the same dark shade throughout. 

The early mammals in this study — like many during the Mesozoic Era — were small creatures much like rodents, shrews or moles. They also appear to have had similarly gray and brown coats. It's not unexpected given the world they evolved in, Shawkey says.

“They were basically dinosaur food,” he says. “They're going to be hiding in the shadows. So it makes sense that they were dark.”

Despite being a mix of gliders, burrowers and scamperers, all the mammals in the study had dull, dark fur. This suggests a nocturnal existence was ubiquitous for Mesozoic mammals and their relatives, regardless of their ecological role.

“I think this is the first good evidence that we have of an antipredation strategy among early mammals,” says Luke Weaver, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved with the research.

Dark, melanin-rich fur may have been useful in other ways. It heats up easily, and potentially helped early mammals stay warm. The dark hairs may have also been particularly tough and wear-resistant, protecting the mammals' skin.

Shawkey notes that the study was limited to six extinct species, leaving the possibility that some early mammals exhibited patterns or bright colors. The team's monochrome hypothesis could be upended, he says, if paleontologists “find a [fossil] rat with a giant orange mohawk.”

Sponsor Message

Determining when those kinds of fashion statements first arose is a natural next step, Shawkey says. “When do we start seeing spots and these patterns? When do we start seeing light browns and oranges and things like that?”

It's possible the extinction of nonavian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago played a key role. Mammalian diversity exploded in response, and the movement to a wide range of finally-safe daytime habitats may have triggered a broader spectrum of colors, too.

However, Weaver notes, some studies suggest that this diversification might have begun earlier. “There's emerging evidence to suggest that [mammals] might have been diversifying ecologically — and potentially inhabiting more daylight habitats — prior to the extinction of dinosaurs,” he says. Sampling melanosomes from mammals that lived during the late Cretaceous Period, at the twilight of the Age of the Dinosaurs, would be particularly informative. 

Maria McNamara, a paleontologist at University College Cork in Ireland, would like to know if mammals that lived in different biomes or latitudes during the Jurassic Period were similarly dark.

“We need more papers like this to be published,” McNamara says. “It's really important to demonstrate that modern paleontology is much more than describing dusty old bones. It's a thriving analytical science.”

This new superconducting prototype quantum processor achieved benchmarking results to rival Google's new Willow QPU.

Researchers in China have developed a quantum processing unit (QPU) that is 1 quadrillion (10¹⁵) times faster than the best supercomputers on the planet.

The new prototype 105-qubit chip, dubbed ""Zuchongzhi 3.0,"" which uses superconducting qubits, represents a significant step forward for quantum computing, scientists at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei said. 

It rivals the benchmarking results set by Google's latest Willow QPU in December 2024 that allowed scientists to stake a claim for quantum supremacy — where quantum computers are more capable than the fastest supercomputers — in lab-based benchmarking.

The scientists used the processor to complete a task on the widely used quantum computing random circuit sampling (RSC) benchmark in just a few hundred seconds, they said in a new study published March 3 in the journal Physical Review Letters.

This test, 83-qubit, 32-layer random circuit sampling task, was also completed 1 million times faster than the result set by Google's previous generation Sycamore chip, published in October 2024. Frontier, the second-fastest supercomputer in the world, would only be able to complete the same task in 5.9 billion years, by contrast

Although the results suggest QPUs are capable of achieving quantum supremacy, the specific RCS benchmarking used favors quantum methods. Also, improvements in classical algorithms that drive classical computing may close the gap, as happened in 2019 when Google scientists first announced a quantum computer had outperformed a classical computer — in the first use of the RSC benchmark.

""Our work not only advances the frontiers of quantum computing, but also lays the groundwork for a new era where quantum processors play an essential role in tackling sophisticated real-world challenges,"" the scientists said in the study.

The latest iteration of Zuchongzhi includes 105 transmon qubits — devices made from metals like tantalum, niobium, and aluminum that have reduced sensitivity to noise — in a 15-by-7 rectangular lattice. This builds on the previous chip, which included 66 qubits.

One of the most important areas critical to the viability of quantum computing in real-world settings is coherence time, a measure of how long a qubit can maintain its superposition and tap into the laws of quantum mechanics to perform calculations in parallel. Longer coherence times mean more complicated operations and calculations are possible.

Another major improvement was in gate fidelity and quantum error correction, which has been an obstacle to building useful quantum computers. Gate fidelity measures how accurately a quantum gate performs its intended operation, where a quantum gate is analogous to a classical logic gate, performing a specific operation on one or more qubits, manipulating their quantum state. Higher fidelity qubits mean fewer errors and more accurate computations.

—Quantum computers are here — but why do we need them and what will they be used for?

—Breakthrough quantum chip that harnesses new state of matter could set us on the path to quantum supremacy

—Scientists create world's 1st chip that can protect data in the age of quantum computing attacks

Zuchongzhi 3.0 performed with an impressive parallel single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.90%, and a parallel two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.62%. Google's Willow QPU edged it slightly, with results of 99.97% and 99.86% respectively.

These improvements were largely possible due to engineering improvements, including enhancements in fabrication methods and better optimized qubits design, the scientists said in the study. For instance, the latest iteration lithographically defines qubit components using tantalum and aluminum, bonded through an indium bump flip-chip process. This improves accuracy and minimizes contamination.

In a story of collaboration and community, researchers identified intergenerational epigenetic changes caused by war and trauma in Syrian refugees.

There are markers that sit on top of DNA and change over the course of one's lifetime, and they can even be passed down to future generations. These ""epigenetic"" markers alter how genes are expressed — without changing their codes — and they can change based on a person's experiences and environment.

Research suggests that stressful events can tweak a person's epigenetics — but what happens on a larger scale? How do people's epigenetics change, for example, in a population exposed to upheaval or violence multiple times over generations?

A new study, published Feb. 27 in the journal Scientific Reports, sought to answer that question.

An international collaboration of researchers convened by Rana Dajani, a molecular biologist at Hashemite University in Jordan, published first-of-their-kind results: they found that epigenetic signatures of trauma can be passed down through generations of people. The study was conducted with three generations of Syrian families that experienced the Hama massacre in 1982 and the Syrian uprising that began in 2011.

""This is an interesting and fascinating study that emphasizes the importance of considering how traumatic experience can have an impact across multiple generations,"" Michael Pluess, a developmental psychology researcher at the University of Surrey in the U.K. who was not involved in the work, told Live Science in an email.

Dajani mainly studies the genetics of ethnic populations in Jordan but always had an interest in stress and epigenetic inheritance. There were several studies in lab animals that suggested epigenetic changes can pass from one generation to the next.

However, the question of whether epigenetic signatures of trauma and displacement can pass between generations of people had yet to be answered.

As a daughter of a Syrian refugee, Dajani realized she was in a unique position to probe the question.

""It clicked in my mind, 'Wait a minute; we can actually answer this question because of the unique characteristics and the unique history that the Syrian community has gone through,'"" Dajani told Live Science.

Dajani brought the idea to Catherine Panter-Brick, an anthropologist at Yale University with expertise on stress biomarkers and global health, and Connie Mulligan, an epigeneticist at the University of Florida who focuses on childhood adversity. The three scientists spent the next decade partnering on the study.

Dajani and Dima Hamadmad, a co-author of the study and a daughter of Syrian refugees, contacted families all over the world mainly through word of mouth. The researchers sat down with the families and listened to their stories; they also explained the science of epigenetics, what they could expect from the study's results, and how these results could bring awareness to their stories.

""They [the families] felt gratified because, first, they understood the science, and second, they felt agency — that they were doing something in response to what happened to them,"" Dajani said.

""This could have only happened because … I'm a scientist and I'm Syrian. So it's somebody from the community center.""

The Hama massacre was an assault by the government on the west-central city of Hama, during which an estimated 10,000 to 40,000 people were either killed or disappeared. The Syrian uprising that began in 2011 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians protesting the Assad government regime.

It took seven years to find families with three generations of women willing to participate in the study and gather enough samples to meet its criteria. The researchers collected blood samples from grandmothers who had been pregnant during the 1982 attack, as well as from their daughters and granddaughters.

They also collected samples from mothers who had been pregnant during the 2011 uprising and from their mothers and daughters.

Additionally, the research team found families with daughters where one was a child during the 2011 uprising, and thus had direct exposure to trauma, while the other daughter was still in the womb at the time.

Finally, they took samples from Syrian families that had left the country before either incident, to use as a point of comparison.

""You cannot find three generations of humans who have been subjected to the brutality of war in such a discrete way with grandmothers versus mothers versus children being exposed or non-exposed to war. So that's a very unique design,"" Panter-Brick said.

Related: Scientists just rewrote our understanding of epigenetics



An analysis of the samples revealed 21 distinct epigenetic changes in the genome that were unique to those who had direct exposure to trauma. An additional 14 changes seemed to be unique to the grandchildren of grandmothers who were exposed to trauma while pregnant.

Together, these changes occurred at 35 sites along the genome. And the data hinted that, at the majority of those sites, the same pattern of epigenetic changes unfolded regardless of the type of exposure — direct, prenatal or from a prior generation.

Specifically, one common type of epigenetic change is the addition or subtraction of a compound — called a methyl group — from DNA. So across the different trauma types, most of the sites showed methylation in the ""same direction,"" either adding or subtracting.

However, that finding wasn't statistically significant, likely due to the relatively small sample sizes in each group, the authors noted. So the findings bear confirming in larger samples.

""What it seems to say is that there might be a common epigenetic signature of violence across generations, exposures and developmental stages,"" Mulligan told Live Science.

The analysis also found that children who were exposed to trauma in the womb appeared epigenetically ""older"" than their chronological ages; this was not seen in other modes of exposure. So-called accelerated epigenetic aging has been linked to a number of health issues, but it's unclear whether the epigenetic changes drive the health problems or simply reflect them.

Mulligan suggested that this aging effect could be the result of trauma exposure during a highly active stage of fetal development, which could explain why it was only seen in the context of prenatal exposure.

The scientists don't yet know what differences these epigenetic signatures might mean for human health.

Mulligan suggested that the marks ""might have allowed humans to adapt to environmental stressors, particularly psychosocial stress and violence."" The theory would need to be confirmed in future research.

Looking ahead, the researchers plan to continue investigating what these epigenetic changes mean biologically, as well as study other groups of people and see if the same sites are changed.

Dajani previously published work about how studies like these can shift our perspective on traumatic events.

""We can use this framing to go from victimhood and vulnerability to agency and adaptability,"" she said. ""We can propose that our discovery is proof that humans inherit this adaptability so that they can cope with future unpredictable environments.”

Dajani also recently became a grandmother and reflected on what she would say to her granddaughter about the discovery.

—Epigenetics linked to the maximum life spans of mammals — including us

—IVF may raise risk of certain disorders in babies — and epigenetic 'signatures' in the placenta could explain why

—Pregnancy may speed up 'biological aging,' study suggests

""Even though your grandparents or great-grandparents went through something, you have the tenacity, the 'sumud' [an Arabic word meaning ""steadfastness""], to go forward and thrive and flourish,"" she said.

For Panter-Brick, ""it's just pure joy to see the actual results come to fruition at this point.

""And it just means a lot for the population themselves, for our team of women scientists, and for the results of science,"" she added. ""But this is [also] an example of how we can work together for the benefit of humanity by understanding more about the challenges that humans repeatedly find themselves in when they face different kinds of violence.""

How does rowing affect your heart, and is it different to running?

Rowing machines and treadmills do not challenge your cardiovascular system in the same way, so what is the science behind it?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Rowing and running are undoubtedly some of the most popular forms of cardiovascular exercise. Both activities can send your heart rate through the roof and get your blood pumping, and both have been shown to decrease the risk of developing heart disease and high blood pressure. When it comes to cardiovascular benefits, rowing and running seem to be on equal footing, according to a 2023 study published in the European Heart Journal.

However, there is an interesting twist — evidence suggests that elite rowers tend to have notably bigger hearts compared to elite runners.

Take the landmark 1994 study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, for example. One of the biggest of its kind, it investigated structural and functional changes within the heart of 947 elite athletes representing 27 sports disciplines. Scientists used echocardiography — images of the heart obtained with an ultrasound scan — and found that, of all study participants, rowers had the thickest left ventricular wall.

This is the layer of muscle and connecting tissue surrounding the largest chamber of the heart. Rowers also had some of the largest left ventricles during the resting phase between heartbeats, when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. On the other hand, runners did not seem to display such far-reaching changes to their hearts, the study authors noted.



So how does rowing affect your heart, and is it different from running?

While both of these activities challenge your cardiovascular system, they do not do so in the same way, Dr. Bhaskar Semitha, a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon at Fortis Hospital Vashi in Mumbai, India, told Live Science by email. ""[This is why] elite rowers tend to have bigger, stronger hearts compared to elite runners, even when they have similar levels of cardiovascular fitness,"" Semitha said.

The reason lies in the movement itself. Running predominantly targets your legs. Rowing, on the other hand, is a low-impact exercise that simultaneously engages muscles in your legs, core and upper body.

""Rowing is a full-body workout that demands a high oxygen supply, so the heart has to pump more blood per beat,"" Semitha said. As such, exercising on one of the best rowing machines may force your heart to pump blood more efficiently than if you opted for a jog on a treadmill.

""Over time, this leads to a lower resting heart rate and a higher stroke volume [the volume of blood pumped from the ventricle per beat.] The heart is working less while delivering more oxygen,"" Semitha said.

This also leads to a significant increase in VO2 max, the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during exercise, which is one of the key markers of performance in cardiovascular exercise. ""That's why you will often see rowers with some of the lowest resting heart rates of any athletes,"" Semitha said.



Rowing and running elicit different heart rate responses even if these activities are performed at the same intensity, according to a 2002 study published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology. Scientists measured the blood lactate concentration — a biochemical marker of fatigue within exercising muscle — in 55 young, healthy men rowing on a rowing machine and running on a treadmill, and found that their heart rate was consistently lower during rowing even when both these exercises were performed with maximum effort.

Why? Again, it is all about the movement. The seated position during rowing makes it easier for blood to flow from the body's lower extremities back to the heart, scientists concluded.

There is a slight twist to the tale, though. Running, even at moderate intensity, is still more effective than rowing for increasing VO2 max, Sergii Putsov, PhD, a professional weightlifter, researcher and head of sports science at coaching service Torokhtiy Weightlifting, told Live Science. ""Running forces your body to work against gravity, amplifying oxygen consumption and utilization. Since rowing is less weight-bearing than running, its overall ability to increase VO2 max is slightly lower for people who do not push themselves to high intensity,"" Putsov said.



Running also tends to cause more dramatic spikes in heart rate, particularly during high-intensity sprints. ""[This is why] running puts more demand on arterial flexibility than rowing,"" Semitha said. ""The repeated impact and fluctuations in intensity force the blood vessels to expand and contract rapidly, which can make arteries more elastic over time and therefore help prevent high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.""

— How running changes your body

So in the rowing vs running debate, which activity wins for cardiovascular benefits? Neither. Both rowing and running are good exercises for boosting stamina and strengthening the heart muscle, according to Putsov.

""However, their effectiveness may depend on your fitness level, specific goals and physical condition,"" Putsov said. ""The full-body nature of rowing helps improve oxygen utilization efficiently without the harsh repetitive impact associated with running. Running, on the other hand, generates repetitive pounding on your joints and requires relatively high initial energy which can be overwhelming for beginners and people with poor cardiovascular fitness.""

These disease-causing mutations are carried by up to 2% of people of Northern European descent. However, not everyone who carries the mutations ultimately develops a POLG-related disorder.

Estimates suggest that these diseases affect approximately 1 in 10,000 people worldwide.

Causes: POLG-related diseases are caused by several hundred different mutations in the POLG gene. This gene encodes a protein in mitochondria, called DNA polymerase gamma (pol γ), which is needed to replicate and repair the unique DNA found only inside mitochondria, rather than in the cell nucleus.

People develop POLG-related diseases by inheriting either one or two copies of the mutated POLG gene from one or both of their parents.

Mitochondria are the cellular powerhouses responsible for breaking down the carbohydrates and fatty acids in food to produce molecules called ATP, which the body then uses as energy.

In people with POLG-related diseases, issues with polymerase gamma can either end up decreasing the amount of DNA in mitochondria or introducing mutations into that DNA. And in some cases, both these events can occur.

Ultimately, cells become energy-depleted, and this can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

POLG mutations are the most common cause of inherited mitochondrial disorders, with around 300 mutations in POLG known to cause disease. Examples of POLG-related diseases include Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, ataxia neuropathy spectrum and childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum.



Symptoms: POLG-related diseases can be tricky to diagnose, in part, because they can cause an array of symptoms that vary in severity. These symptoms can also emerge at different times in a person's life, from early childhood to adulthood, depending on which disease they have.

The timing of symptoms partly varies depending on the specific POLG mutation a person carries and the number of copies, as well as the underlying driver of their condition — whether it's mostly related to the loss of DNA or accumulation of mutations.

Once they manifest, the symptoms mostly affect parts of the body that require a lot of energy, such as the central nervous system, muscles and liver.

Common symptoms of POLG-related diseases include progressive weakness of the eye muscles and the muscles that are closest to the center of the body, such as those located in the shoulders or upper arms. People with these diseases may also have droopy eyelids and develop epilepsy and liver failure.

Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is one of the most severe forms of POLG-related disease. In addition to the previously listed symptoms, people with this condition also usually experience seizures, a reduced ability to move and liver disease.

People with ataxia neuropathy spectrum, meanwhile experience issues with coordination and balance, as well as reduced nerve function.

Treatments: There is no cure for POLG-related diseases; current treatments instead focus on reducing a patient's symptoms. For instance, doctors can prescribe drugs to help manage seizures or movement difficulties. Transplantation is also an option for patients who experience liver failure.

People with a POLG-related disease typically live for between three months and 12 years after symptoms first begin.

Recent cases: In March 2025, Prince Frederik of Luxembourg, who was second cousin of the heir to the throne, reportedly died of a POLG-related disease at the age of 22. Frederik was the founder and creative director of The POLG Foundation, an organization that supports research into treatments for POLG-related diseases.

The mummy of a first-century-B.C. individual found in Egypt was not pregnant and did not have cancer, according to a new CT study.

An ancient Egyptian woman thought to have been pregnant and dying of cancer was actually just embalmed with a technique that mimicked these diagnoses, researchers have concluded, settling a four-year scientific debate.

Nicknamed the ""Mysterious Lady,"" the first-century-B.C. mummy was found in the Egyptian city of Luxor (ancient Thebes) but was brought to the University of Warsaw in Poland in 1826. The mummy was not scientifically studied for over a century.

In 2021, experts with the Warsaw Mummy Project concluded that, contrary to their assumption that the mummy was a male priest based on the sarcophagus, it was actually the remains of a woman in her 20s who was 6.5 to 7.5 months pregnant.

In the first published study of the mummy, researchers used X-ray imaging and CT scans to identify several bundles of mummified organs in her abdomen. They also suggested that a poorly preserved fetus, around 28 weeks in gestational age, could be seen on the scans.

In a second study, the research team proposed that the reason no fetal bones could be clearly identified was that the mother's uterus lacked oxygen and had become acidic over time, essentially ""pickling"" the fetus. And finally, the team suggested that they had found evidence of potentially fatal nasopharyngeal cancer in the mummy's skull.

These interpretations were controversial, however. Radiologist and mummy expert Sahar Saleem told Live Science in 2022 that the Warsaw team failed to ""identify any evidence of anatomical structures to justify their claim of a fetus."" Instead, Saleem was convinced the mysterious structures in the mummy's abdomen were embalming packs.

To settle the debate, a team of 14 researchers with varied expertise led by archaeologist Kamila Braulińska of the University of Warsaw studied the Mysterious Lady and published their findings in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences last month.

Members of the research team each examined more than 1,300 raw CT image slices of the mummy produced in 2015 to determine whether there was any radiological evidence of a pregnancy or of cancer.

Every expert who reanalyzed the CT scans concluded that there was no fetus and that the material assumed to be a fetus was actually part of the embalming process. Further, the suggestion that the fetus' skeleton and soft tissue did not show up on the scans because the body was ""pickled"" is impossible, the researchers noted in the study, because acids within the human body are insufficient to dissolve bone, especially after a body is embalmed.

Similarly, none of the experts on the new study could identify clear evidence of cancer in the mummy. Some suggested instead that the damage to the woman's skull most likely occurred when her brain was removed during the embalming process.

Given the diagnostic consensus of the international panel of experts, the researchers concluded in the study that ""this should resolve once and for all the discussion of the first alleged case of pregnancy identified inside an ancient Egyptian mummy, as well as the dispute about the presence of nasopharyngeal cancer.""

But given the public's intense interest in the ""case of the pregnant mummy"" over the past four years, the researchers suggested that, going forward, additional focus should be given to questions of maternal and pediatric health in ancient Egypt.

Once again, the future of the Tampa Bay Rays is murky. On Thursday, Rays owner Stu Sternberg announced the team will not move forward with plans to construct a new $1.3 billion ballpark in St. Petersburg, citing ""a series of events beginning in October that no one could have anticipated."" Among those events was Hurricane Milton, which severely damaged Tropicana Field in October.

""After careful deliberation, we have concluded we cannot move forward  with the new ballpark and development project at this moment. A series of events beginning in October that no one could have  anticipated led to this difficult decision,"" Sternberg said in a statement. ""... Our commitment to the vitality and success of the Rays organization is  unwavering. We continue to focus on finding a ballpark solution that  serves the best interest of our region, Major League Baseball and our  organization.""

Approval for the $1.3 billion ballpark was granted last July. The new stadium was going to be built essentially on the other side of the Tropicana Field parking lot and was scheduled to open in 2028. The design included a surrounding ballpark village with commercial and residential space, and an entertainment venue. The Rays are walking away from all of it.

Following Hurricane Milton, the Rays claimed they could not afford construction delays, which led to political infighting. The team faced a March 31 deadline to show they could come up with their $700 million obligation for the new ballpark. Now, for all intents and purposes, it is back to the drawing board. There is no new stadium in the works.

The Rays will play their 2025 home games in Tampa proper at George M. Steinbrenner Field, spring training home of the New York Yankees. Yankees chairman Hal Steinbrenner has previous called that a one-year solution, not a permanent arrangement. Sternberg said the plan is to repair the Trop in time for 2026. What happens long-term is unclear.

With the caveat that, right now, no one, not even MLB or Sternberg, knows what will happen long-term, here are some possible outcomes for the Rays now that the franchise's new ballpark deal is no more.

Whether he is ""forced"" to sell is a matter of semantics. The chances Sternberg, who has owned the Rays since 2005, sells the team have never been higher. Commissioner Rob Manfred and several owners are reportedly pushing him to do so. Why are they pushing Sternberg to sell and not, say, Athletics owner John Fisher? Because of the stadium mess. Sternberg's new stadium deal fell apart. Fisher's Oakland to Sacramento to Las Vegas plan is still moving forward, as dubious as it may seem.

The Baltimore Orioles were sold for $1.75 billion last year. The Kansas City Royals ($1 billion in 2020) and Miami Marlins ($1.3 billion in 2018), two small-market teams like the Rays, were also sold for 10-figure sums in recent years. Sternberg may ultimately be forced to sell the team, but he'll be make out just fine. The fact Manfred and some owners were already trying to push Sternberg out, and now the new stadium deal has fallen apart, makes a sale feel inevitable. Likely sooner rather than later.

Manfred has insisted that he wants to keep the Rays in the Tampa area and he wants to keep baseball in Florida in general, though we have more than three decades of evidence showing us it doesn't work. The Rays are competitive more often than not and the Marlins won two World Series titles fairly early in their existence, yet both franchises rank near the bottom of the league in attendance each year, and the Marlins secured a new ballpark not that long ago (2012).

The Rays threatened relocation under Sternberg -- who can forget the cockamamie two-city plan with Montreal and Tampa? -- and a new owner could come in with the intention of moving the franchise elsewhere. Hall of Famer Barry Larkin recently joined the Orlando Dreamers, a group trying to lure an MLB franchise to Orlando. In addition to a potential expansion franchise, the Dreamers have also previously expressed interest in bringing the Rays to Orlando.

The Dreamers are merely one of several groups trying to bring Major League Baseball to a new city. Others include the Portland Diamond Project, Big League Utah (Salt Lake City), and Music City Baseball (Nashville). A return to Montreal has been considered possible as well. Point is, yes, relocation is on the table for the Rays. Maybe more than ever. That will continue to be true until shovels are in the ground in St. Petersburg, Tampa, or the surrounding area.

Sure, it's possible. After all, a stadium plan was in motion as recently as early October, before Hurricane Milton damaged the Trop. A new owner could come in and perhaps rekindle that $1.3 billion project, or come up with an entirely new ballpark plan that keeps the team in St. Petersburg. Again, so much is unsettled right now. There's no sense in ruling out a long-term stay in St. Pete.

Really though, a move across the bay to Tampa would be best if MLB and Rays ownership (Sternberg or otherwise) insist on keeping the team in the area. A new ballpark in Tampa would put the Rays closer to the population center and also make it easier to draw from Orlando. Of course, Sternberg and the Rays have been trying to secure a ballpark closer to Tampa for the better part of a decade now. If it were easy, it would have happened already.

""If in the  coming months a new owner, who demonstrates a commitment to honoring  their agreements and our community priorities, emerges, we will  consider a partnership to keep baseball in St. Pete,"" St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch told the Tampa Bay Times. ""But  we will not put our city's progress on hold as we await a collaborative  and community-focused baseball partner.""

This seems very unlikely. The team's lease at Tropicana Field runs through 2027 and the plan is to return there in 2026, after the roof and other parts of the ballpark that were damaged by Hurricane Milton are repaired. Long-term though, the Rays need a new stadium. The Trop opened in 1990, making it MLB's seventh oldest ballpark, and although the team has done what it can to liven the place up under Sternberg, it is a bottom-tier MLB facility. The Rays need a new stadium. No one disputes that.

Now that the new ballpark deal has fallen apart, it is possible the Rays will look into a short-term lease extension at Tropicana Field just to give the team a home as they sort out their future. The new stadium won't happen and it will be impossible to plan a new ballpark, get the necessary approvals, and get it built in time for 2028. Playing 2025 at GMS Field and the 2026-27 seasons at the Trop might be the best possible outcome right now. A short-term extension to cover, say, 2028-30 could then be an option. A long-term stay at Tropicana Field can not happen though. The Rays need a new home badly.

The John Fisher plan, basically. Last season was the last year on the Athletics' lease at the Oakland Coliseum and, rather than stay there on a short-term extension until their Las Vegas ballpark tentatively opens in 2028, the team will play at least the next three years at Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento. It is a Triple-A ballpark the A's will share with the Sacramento River Cats, Triple-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. It is not ideal, but it is what Fisher came up with.

The precedent has been set. A major-league team will play at least three seasons in a Triple-A ballpark while it waits for its new stadium to be built. The Rays are playing in GMS Field because of an Act of God. A hurricane badly damaged the Trop. The A's are playing in a Triple-A ballpark willfully as a stopgap between Oakland and Las Vegas. The Rays could explore a similar arrangement in the future, and who knows where that will land the team?

Technically yes, in reality no. MLB pushed to contract the Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos for economic reasons in 2001, but those plans fell apart when a court injunction compelled the Twins to honor their lease with the Metrodome. The Twins eventually opened a new stadium, Target Field, in 2010. The Expos moved to Washington and became the Nationals in 2004. They played home games at RFK Stadium from 2004-07 before Nationals Park opened in 2008.

MLB revenues are at an all-time high and the MLB Players Association would consider contraction an act of war. It would mean the elimination of 26 MLB jobs, 40 40-man roster spots, and 165 minor-league contract spots. And remember, you can't just contract one team, right? The every single day nature of the sport requires an even number of teams, so contracting the Rays would mean contracting another team as well, and twice as many player jobs lost. It's not going to happen.

In the short-term, the most likely outcome is Sternberg sells the Rays and the new owner floats relocation. Perhaps earnestly, perhaps only to create leverage to get a new ballpark in St. Petersburg, Tampa, or the surrounding area. How the Rays go from here to a new ballpark is once again a great unknown, and how long it will take or where it will be located is anyone's guess.

UNLV athletic director Erick Harper admitted that the school can only afford to pay the first two years of new football coach Dan Mullen's five-year, $17.5 million contract.

Harper made the admission at a Board of Regents meeting last week, telling the group that the athletic department is in at least $26 million worth of debt and could only afford the first two years of a contract that pays the former Florida coach $3.5 million annually.

""We have the funds to pay the coach over the next two years,"" Harper said. ""We have been working with our donors to assist with philanthropic dollars. We have one that has already paid their commitment, and that money is in an unrestricted line and that will be utilized in the future to help with the salaries.""

UNLV hired Mullen in December to replace Barry Odom, who left for Purdue. The Big Ten school will pay UNLV $3 million to buy out Odom's contract, slated to arrive in two $1.5 million payments paid over the next two years. Mullen hadn't coached since 2021, instead working as an analyst for ESPN, after a four-year stint at Florida where he finished with a 34-15 record that included three top-15 finishes. 

Mullen's contract also calls for an annual $100,000 retention bonus starting in 2027 and bonuses ranging from $25,000 for playing in the Mountain West championship game to $100,000 for participating in the College Football Playoff. Making any bowl game comes with a $75,000 bonus. 

Mullen takes over a UNLV program that went 10-3 last season and is considered a preseason Group of Five favorite to make the College Football Playoff. Harper said that UNLV has sold an additional 970 season tickets since Mullen's hiring, putting the total at more than 5,000 for the Mountain West school. 

Harper's admission the school can only afford two years of Mullen's five-year contract is arresting yet not without precedent. When Colorado hired Deion Sanders to a five-year, $29.5 million contract, the school's AD made a similar comment as Harper.

""We don't have the money yet, but I know we'll have it so I'm not worried about that piece,"" Colorado AD Rick George said after Sanders' hiring. 

The hiring of Sanders, of course, became a financial boon for Colorado as CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello detailed last year. 

UNLV's big bet on Mullen is indicative of the challenges smaller schools face in this current environment of ever-growing expenses. With Power Four schools set to spend as much as $20.5 million on revenue sharing starting this year if the House settlement is officially approved, schools have the choice to either try to keep up in spending or risk falling behind. 

It feels like UNLV senses an opportunity to capitalize on the Group of Five's path to the College Football Playoff and is spending accordingly. Paying Mullen $3.5 million annually is a significant financial commitment at that level, and puts him above Power Four coaches such as UCLA's DeShaun Foster and Arizona's Brent Brennan. If it doesn't pan out, that massive amount of debt Harper detailed to the Board of Regents may only grow.

The Texas athletic department has self-reported five NCAA violations in relation to sports betting that took place between July 11 and Nov. 4, 2024, according to the Austin American-Statesman.

The American-Statesman obtained documents that censored the names of the involved parties. Texas' self-reporting submissions listed two football players, a non-student athlete that had ties to the women's tennis team, a student assistant, and an uncategorized athletic department employee.

The five people totaled $14,885.76 in their impermissible bets as a group. The wagers were placed with the daily fantasy sports website PrizePicks, where bettors can wager on a player's statistics. Traditional sportsbooks are illegal, but PrizePicks is legal within the confines of Texas.

Per NCAA rules, players, coaches and staff members are prohibited from wagering on any sport in which the NCAA sponsors a championship.

According to the American-Statesman, the NCAA has stated an estimated 50 sports betting violations were reported in 2023 and 100 violations in 2024.

In each of the five cases at Texas, the school utilized a service called ProhiBet, which works alongside colleges and universities to monitor sports betting activity. The service cross-checks a person's personal data -- such as their name and birthday -- against the data that individuals use to sign up for online sportsbooks and daily fantasy websites.

Since the start of the 2023-24 season, the SEC has put a mandate in place requiring schools to use the ProhiBet technology.

Once ProhiBet discovered the impermissible wagers, the Texas athletic department discovered the non-student athlete placed bets on Texas sporting events. The assistant's role with the athletic department ended at that time. Meanwhile, the two non-student athletes were given warnings.

One of the Longhorn football players was deemed ineligible, but was ultimately reinstated. That particular player was required to pay back the value of the wagers to a charity of his choosing.

Meanwhile, the other football player reportedly had a ""problem"" with sports betting, according to the documents that the American-Statesman received. He had placed an estimated $9,600 in impermissible wagers while attending school at Texas. In addition, two of his bets were placed on Texas basketball teams.

That player ended up leaving Texas and stopped his college football career, so the Texas athletic department didn't penalize him.

We are down to seven bubble teams following yesterday's action. Arkansas and Oklahoma moved up, for now, following wins in the SEC Tournament. Georgia and Vanderbilt lost, but I have kept them off the bubble for now.  

Not so lucky was Ohio State, which lost to Iowa and has dropped off the bubble to the wrong side. The Buckeyes went into the Big Ten Tournament needing multiple wins but couldn't even manage one against the Hawkeyes.  

All seven teams are in action today. Most notably, we have double-bubble action in the Mountain West, where two of the last four teams in today's bracket face off.

This is unquestionably the most important bubble game of the day. Both teams are among the last four teams in my bracket this morning. It is a likely elimination game; however, teams currently off the bracket have not done a great job of improving their cases. The winner of this game gets the winner of top seed New Mexico vs. San Jose State.  

vs. Oregon, 12 p.m. | Big Ten Network, fubo (Try for free) 

The Hoosiers have made a run into the bracket by winning four of their last five games, including victories over Michigan State and Purdue. The one team to beat them in that stretch was Oregon, but the Ducks were at home. This game is in Indianapolis, and while it's not Assembly Hall, it will certainly sound like it.  

vs. Marquette, 2:30 p.m. | Peacock 

Xavier is the bubble team in this matchup but the higher seed against the Golden Eagles. Marquette has not been in great form since the start of February. These teams split the season series with each team winning on the road. Xavier could really use another good win, especially away from home.  

vs. Wake Forest, 2:30 p.m. | ESPN, fubo (Try for free) 

The Tar Heels continue to bide their time until they get another shot at Duke.  Anything less than beating Duke is not good enough. However, that is tomorrow's problem. They have to get there first. Wake Forest is the higher seed in this game, for what that's worth. The Demon Deacons did win the one game these two played this season.  

vs. Texas Tech, 7 p.m. | ESPN, fubo (Try for free) 

Baylor took care of business yesterday against Kansas State, and now it takes its shot at Texas Tech. A win over the Red Raiders should punch Baylor's ticket. A loss could still keep the Bears in the field, but Selection Sunday will be nervy.  

vs. Nevada, 9:00 p.m. | CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ with Showtime (Try It Free)    

Colorado State has made a run to near the top of the Mountain West standings and near the bracket. The Rams have a couple of bad losses, but they swept Boise State and have home wins over Utah State and San Diego State. They may have to win the tournament to get in, but an at-large bid cannot be ruled out. It would be with a loss today, though.  

Locks based on résumé: 32 | At-large bids in play: 5 | Automatic bids secured: 11 of 31              	            

Note – all references to NCAA Tournament selection records and trends based on NET rankings excludes the 2021 tournament. Due to shortened schedules and a relatively small number of nonconference games, those rankings are not reliable enough to be considered.

A planned $1.3 billion stadium to keep the Tampa Bay Rays in St. Petersburg is no longer happening. Owner Stu Sternberg announced Thursday that the team ""cannot move forward with the new ballpark and development project at this moment,"" citing ""a series of events beginning in October that no one could have anticipated.""

That ""series of events ... no one could have anticipated"" was Hurricane Milton, which destroyed the Tropicana Field roof and damaged other parts of the stadium. The Rays claimed they could not afford delays to the new stadium project, which led to political infighting. The team faced a March 31 deadline to prove that they could come up with their $700 million obligation toward the costs.

""Our commitment to the vitality and success of the Rays organization is unwavering,"" Sternberg said in a statement. ""We continue to focus on finding a ballpark solution that serves the best interests of our region, Major League Baseball and our organization.""

The Rays will play the 2025 season in Tampa at George M. Steinbrenner Field, spring training home of the New York Yankees. Yankees chairman Hal Steinbrenner has previously said the arrangement is a one-year solution, not a long-term answer. GMS Field is a minor-league facility with no roof, meaning the Rays will deal with the Florida rain and humidity all summer.

Sternberg said the intention is to restore the Trop for the 2026 season and the City of St. Petersburg is currently advancing plans to do so. What happens long-term is unclear. Commissioner Rob Manfred and several owners are reportedly pressuring Sternberg to sell the Rays. He has owned the team since 2005.

""As for the future of baseball in our city — if in the coming months a new owner, who demonstrates a commitment to honoring their agreements and our community priorities, emerges — we will consider a partnership to keep baseball in St. Pete,"" St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch told the Tampa Bay Times. ""But we will not put our city's progress on hold as we await a collaborative and community-focused baseball partner.""

Approval for a new 30,000-seat facility in St. Petersburg (essentially on the other side of the Tropicana Field parking lot) was granted last July. The project was set to include a new ballpark district with commercial and residential space around the stadium. The Rays have been seeking a new stadium for more than a decade now.

The Rays went 80-82 last season, their first losing season since 2017. They joined MLB as an expansion team in 1998. The Trop first opened in 1990 and is MLB's seventh-oldest stadium.

Is it just me or does the NBA's ""silly season"" seem to arrive earlier and earlier each year? It would make sense that tanking teams would start to truly throw in the towel even sooner this season due to the plethora of potentially franchise-changing talent at the top of the 2025 draft, but we used to at least get through March before seeing the likes of A.J. Lawson, Johnny Juzang and Daquan Jeffries lighting up the scoreboard.

This is just the way things are going to be until losing is no longer rewarded with a better chance at a top pick, but it's unfortunate that it can affect the outcomes for teams that are embroiled in actual, competitive playoff races. You just have to hope that the teams in the remaining part of your schedule are less incentivized to win than those of your competition.

One team that's plowing through any competition whatsoever is the Golden State Warriors, who are now 12-1 with Jimmy Butler in the lineup. It's hard to recall one single player having this much effect on winning and losing this quickly, especially without going out and scoring 30 points every night. Golden State now has the league's third-best defense and fifth-best offense since Butler's first game and has finally cracked the top 10 in this week's Power Rankings after consistent upward movement.

Heading in the opposite direction are the Los Angeles Lakers, who saw LeBron James go down with a groin injury and have struggled because of it. James and Luka Dončić were starting to develop some real chemistry, and that will now be delayed for as long as James will have to sit out. It affects the standings as well, because the Lakers are jam-packed toward the top of the West with the Memphis Grizzlies, Denver Nuggets and Houston Rockets. Any extended period of losing could take them from No. 2 to No. 5 real quick.

The top of the rankings remains steady, with the juggernaut Cleveland Cavaliers at the top once again, followed by the Oklahoma City Thunder and Boston Celtics. Those aforementioned Grizzlies were the week's biggest risers, moving up three spots to No. 4.

Here are this week's NBA Power Rankings.

Minnesota fired coach Ben Johnson early Thursday morning, in an announcement posted to social media at 2:19 a.m. ET, following the team's season-ending loss Wednesday in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament to Northwestern.

A Minnesota alumnus, Johnson coached the program for the past four seasons and went 56-71, failing to bring his alma mater to the NCAA Tournament.

""I met with Ben in-person early this morning when the team returned to Minneapolis from the Big Ten Men's Basketball Tournament and informed him that we were making a change in leadership,"" Minnesota athletic director Mark Coyle said in a statement. ""I thanked him for his dedication and for guiding the program, one he cares deeply about, for the last four years. Ben is a terrific person, and we wish him well.

""These decisions are difficult and are made after careful consideration and evaluation,"" Coyle continued. ""The expectation for our program is to compete for championships, and unfortunately, we have not done that in the last four years.""

The way Johnson was canned was atypical in this regard: Coyle is on the men's basketball selection committee, which began its process to build the NCAA Tournament field in Indiana yesterday. Coyle flew back in secrecy to Minneapolis late Wednesday to fire Johnson. 

""It was ruthless,"" one source told CBS Sports.

Johnson led Minnesota to a 15-17 record in 2024-25, which ended with five losses in the team's final six outings. The 2023-24 Gophers went 19-15, the only year in which they were above .500 under Johnson's watch. The program last made the NCAA tourney in 2019, when Richard Pitino was the coach.

Minnesota has ranked in the bottom two or three in the Big Ten in NIL resources for the duration of Johnson's tenure, according to industry sources. Johnson and his staff were responsible for raising nearly all of Minnesota's NIL budget — approximately $2 million for this past season, per a source. The team was handcuffed all the more by key losses in the portal last spring, including point guard Elijah Hawkins (Texas Tech) and power forward Pharrel Payne (Texas A&M), who got much larger financial opportunities to play elsewhere. Additionally, two other players portaled out and promising freshman Cam Christie left for the NBA.

Johnson's stint at Minnesota was his first as a head coach after assistant coaching stops at Northern Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Xavier. A Minneapolis native, he played two seasons for the Golden Gophers and finished his college career at Minnesota before going into coaching two decades ago.

With the job open, there is an obvious candidate Minnesota is expected to interview in its search: Colorado State's Niko Medved is a Minneapolis native and has led the Rams to the NCAA Tournament two times in the previous six seasons. CSU, 22-9 and the 2-seed in the Mountain West Tournament, plays Nevada on Thursday.

Army and Navy's request to add a 13th regular-season game has been tabled by the Division I Football Oversight Committee, sources confirmed to CBS Sports. 

Because their annual meeting in December is played the week after the College Football Playoff field is selected, an additional game would have helped with not only their CFP resumes but also standing in the AAC. 

Both programs were in the running for a CFP berth well into November just this past season. 

The Oversight Committee, which met recently to discuss the matter, has oversight responsibility of the regular season and championship administration. A source familiar with that meeting told CBS Sports there was ""no support"" from Oversight to honor the request. The source added that granting the schools' request would be ""a legislative beast"" to be approved because of the impact on the regular season.

The Army-Navy request would require the NCAA to modify its rules which limits teams to 12 regular-season games. CBS Sports was first to report the schools' request. 

NCAA Bylaw 17.11 sets the maximum number of regular-season FBS games at 12. Bylaw 17.11.4.1 allows a 13th game for teams that play a regular-season game in Hawaii.

Both Army and Navy are in the AAC. The Black Knights joined in 2024 after 20 years as an independent prior to its last conference membership in Conference USA from 1998-2004.

Both schools play only 11 regular-season games before conference championship weekend. The 12th game is the annual Army-Navy game, typically played the second week of December. Adding a 13th game would mean adding a fourth nonconference opponent, and the American currently plays eight conference games. 

Former Army athletic director Mike Buddie, now at TCU, told CBS Sports previously it was important for both schools to have an extra ""data point"" in regard to CFP consideration. 

""When it was a four-team playoff, there was language in the agreement that if Army or Navy was in consideration, they would hold off on the [CFP] announcement until after the Army-Navy game,"" Buddie said last year. ""When they switched to the 12-team playoff, they removed that language, which essentially rendered the Army-Navy game irrelevant for conference standings and irrelevant as a data point for the CFP.

""So it makes sense for Chet [Gladchuk, Navy AD] and I to approach it from this angle.""

The Army-Navy request is not believed to impact desires for any FBS conference to play additional games on the weekend of conference championship games. The Big Ten, SEC and Big 12 -- at least -- are believed to be considering play-in games to determine automatic qualifiers for the CFP beginning with the 2026 season.

Whether automatic qualifiers are instituted at all in '26 will be taken up by the FBS conferences at future CFP meetings. 

Army went 12-2 last season, the most wins in program history. Navy, 10-3, posted its first winning season since 2019. The Midshipmen defeated the Black Knights 31-13 in their annual meeting last season for the 17th time in the last 23 showdowns.

The 26-person Oversight Committee is chaired by USF AD Mike Kelly.

When Rutgers freshmen Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey arrived on campus as the two highest-ranked recruits in program history, there was immediate optimism that the Scarlet Knights could not only reach the NCAA Tournament for the third time this century. High-end projections had them making a run deep into March behind two potential top-five NBA Draft picks. 

At 15-17 and projected well outside the bubble, Rutgers' tournament hopes were dashed following a 97-89 loss to USC in the Big Ten Tournament on Wednesday, putting the final touches on one of the biggest what-ifs of the one-and-done era. Lots of teams with top picks have missed the NCAA Tournament over the years. Recent examples include LSU with Ben Simmons, Washington with Markelle Fultz and Georgia with Anthony Edwards (there was no NCAA Tournament in 2020, but the Bulldogs would have been left out had it taken place).

Ten teams in the modern recruiting era have landed two high school prospects ranked in the top five of their respective class. Nine of those squads reached the NCAA Tournament (Duke's 2024-25 team is the other). Kentucky scored two in John Calipari's final year with the program last season and lost in the first round of the Big Dance.

Harper and Bailey were both fantastic individually this season, and their draft stock held firm despite the team's lack of success. However, the talent around the superstar duo wasn't enough, as Rutgers finished 15-17 overall and 8-12 in Big Ten play.

Behind Cooper Flagg and Khaman Maluach, Duke could become only the second program in the modern recruiting era -- after Kentucky -- to win a national championship with two top-five recruits. 

With Duke still in action, here's how the other teams that signed two top-five prospects finished their respective seasons.

Who: Ace Bailey (No. 2) and Dylan Harper (No. 3)Season result: Projected to miss the NCAA Tournament

Rutgers debuted at the bottom of the preseason AP Top 25 poll but quickly fell out for good following a loss to Kennesaw State in its fifth game. The Scarlet Knights lost three of their next four and struggled to find a rhythm against Big Ten competition. Rutgers went 4-13 against Quad 1 opponents, with the wins coming against UCLA, Nebraska, Northwestern and Illinois. When it's all said and done, this season will be remembered as a massive ""what if"" because the likelihood of two of the top three ranked players in the same recruiting cycle enrolling at Rutgers again seems unlikely.

Who: Justin Edwards (No. 3) and Aaron Bradshaw (No. 5)Season result: Lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament 

John Calipari's final recruiting haul at Kentucky ranked No. 1 in the 2023 cycle. The highest-ranked prospect of the group, Edwards, was touted as a potential No. 1 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, but some early season struggles led to a reduced role. Bradshaw missed the first month of the season because of an injury and transferred to Ohio State after an up-and-down campaign. Kentucky lost to Oakland in the first round of the NCAA Tournament in the final game of Calipari's tenure at the school.

Who: Dereck Lively lll (No. 2), Dariq Whitehead (No. 3) and Kyle Filipowski (No. 4)Season result: Lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament 

In the its season after legendary coach Mike Krzyzewski, Duke brought in three five-star recruits to jump-start a new era. Lively and Whitehead both declared for the 2023 NBA Draft (where they became first-round picks), and Filipowski elected to return to school for his sophomore season. After a loss to Virginia dropped the Duke to 8-6 in ACC play, they went on a hot streak. Duke won 10 consecutive games before falling to Tennessee in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

Who: RJ Barrett (No. 1) and Cam Reddish (No. 3)Season result: Lost in the Elite Eight

Perhaps the best recruiting class in the modern era, Duke was able to sign the top-ranked (Barrett), No. 3 (Reddish) and No. 7 recruits (Zion Williamson) from the 2018 recruiting cycle. The Blue Devils embarked on an exhilarating NCAA Tournament run that included close wins over UCF and Virginia Tech before losing to Michigan State in the Elite Eight. Williamson is one of three freshmen (with Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant) to win the Naismith Award.

Who: Harry Giles (No. 3) and Frank Jackson (No. 5)Season result: Lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament 

Duke managed to sign two of the top players in the 2016 recruiting cycle, but the best talent from the class came from outside the top five. Future NBA star Jayson Tatum was the No. 8 player in his class and helped the Blue Devils secure the top-ranked recruiting haul during the 2016 cycle. Duke lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament to South Carolina as a No. 2 seed.

Who: Cliff Alexander (No. 4) and Kelly Oubre (No. 5)Season result: Lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament 

The 2014-15 Kansas roster featured seven players who would play at the next level. Alexander and Oubre were two of them. The Jayhawks entered the 2015 NCAA Tournament as a No. 2 seed and fell to No. 7 seed Wichita State in the second round. Oubre was selected No. 15 in the 2015 NBA Draft, while Alexander went undrafted.

Who: Julius Randle (No. 2) Andrew Harrison (No. 3) and Aaron Harrison (No. 5)Season result: Lost in national title game

Kentucky was the first in the 247Sports era to sign three top-five players from the same class. The Wildcats entered the 2014 NCAA Tournament with a 24-10 record and won five consecutive games over Kansas State, Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan, and Wisconsin to reach the national title game. Aaron Harrison hit a handful of clutch buckets throughout the tournament to spark that run.

Who: Shabazz Muhammad (No. 2) and Kyle Anderson (No. 3)Season result: Lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament 

After signing two top players from the 2012 recruiting cycle, UCLA coach Ben Howland was fired after a first-round exit in the NCAA Tournament. Muhammad was drafted No. 14 in the 2013 NBA Draft after a standout freshman campaign but never lived up to the hype at the next level. Anderson elected to come back to school for his sophomore year and became a late first-round pick the following summer.

Who: Anthony Davis (No. 1) and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (No. 2)

Season result: Won national title 

It's rare to get a talent of Davis' caliber at the college level. The former Kentucky star is considered one of the best one-and-done players in college basketball history, and he helped lead the Wildcats to their last national title in 2012. Kidd-Gilchrist also was one of the best freshmen in college basketball during his lone season at UK. Davis and Kidd-Gilchrist would eventually go one-two in the 2012 NBA Draft -- just like they were slotted in the final 247Sports rankings.

There's going to be some temptation, especially given the quality of the game itself, to treat Wednesday's battle between the Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder as an NBA Finals preview. It makes sense on paper. The Celtics are the defending champions. The Thunder have one of the best net ratings in NBA history and are on pace to win 67 games. There is a pretty reasonable chance that the Celtics and Thunder face off in June with the Larry O'Brien Trophy on the line.

But calling this game -- a 118-112 road victory that clinched a playoff spot Oklahoma City -- a Finals preview ignores the wider picture. The Thunder didn't have Jalen Williams. They obviously expect to have him in the postseason, and if they don't, they aren't winning the West. The same is true for the Celtics and Kristaps Porzingis. Cleveland, the first-place team in the East, gives Boston problems even at full strength. Neither the Thunder nor the Celtics were at full strength in this one.

That makes combing through the decisions and outcomes within this game so important. These teams might see each other again, but they hopefully won't see each other under the conditions present on Wednesday. So let's try to figure out what we can learn from this clash and put that in perspective ahead of a possible Finals matchup. 

Here are our biggest takeaways from Oklahoma City's enormous win over Boston.

Typically, the teams that succeed against the Celtics are the ones that limit their 3-point volume. Take the Orlando Magic. They've beaten the Celtics twice in five matchups across the last two seasons and have held them to 35.4 3-point attempts per game in that span. Boston's average, by comparison, was 42.5 attempts per game last season and 48 this season. When a team shoots as well as Boston does, it makes sense to limit their volume.

The Thunder don't play that way. They willingly surrender 3s, allowing the seventh-most attempts overall and more valuable corner 3s than anyone in an effort to maximize their rim defense and force turnovers. They entered this game with a plan: let the Celtics shoot as many 3s as they want. Here's how that worked out for Boston:

In terms of the outcome, this strategy worked. Oklahoma City won the game. It's worth wondering, however, how viable this strategy would be in a possible Finals matchup. The Celtics have, after all, shot a pitiful 28 of 109 (25.7%) from deep in two games against the Thunder. Sure, defense matters on those long shots to an extent, but a lot of that is just bad variance. The Celtics aren't going to shoot like that four times in seven tries.

The Thunder could survive hotter Celtics shooting if the tradeoff at the rim proves worthwhile. In some ways it did. The Thunder outscored the Celtics by eight at the rim, and more importantly, they drew 23 more free-throw attempts. The Thunder foul a lot by design, it's the nature of their ultra-physical defensive style, so winning the free-throw battle by that margin is notable. You're not going to get to the line much when you're shooting 63 3s.

But Boston shot 11 of 12 in the restricted area and 18 of 22 in the paint overall. That Thunder defense was good at incentivizing 3s over layups, but when the Celtics did get to the rim, they scored there. The third quarter was especially important in this respect. All year, and really, throughout this entire Jayson Tatum-Jaylen Brown era, the question surrounding the Celtics was whether or not they'd be willing to pivot off of 3-pointers when they stop falling in high-leverage games. They did so in that third frame, attacking the basket relentlessly when the opportunity presented itself. Their rim offense was more than good enough to win them this game. Their jump shooting just failed them. 

Oklahoma City can't rely on that in the Finals, so expect to see the Thunder introduce several wrinkles if these teams see each other again. Fortunately, with Williams and Alex Caruso available, a lot of defensive doors open for the Thunder.

Even in a loss, the Celtics answered an important question we covered above. When they need to, they are capable of scoring at the basket against the Thunder. Oklahoma City had a different question to answer in this one, and it dates back to last postseason.

Oklahoma City's offense is much more reliant on MVP favorite Shai Gilgeous-Alexander than Boston's or Cleveland's is on any single player. The idea is for Gilgeous-Alexander to score his standard 30 or so points, of course, but also to leverage his rim gravity to create open 3s for everyone else. As Boston saw on Wednesday, those 3s can be fickle. The advantages that lead to them, though, can be used in other ways. The Thunder couldn't beat the Mavericks in the playoffs last season in part because the rest of their offense couldn't punish a Dallas defense that keyed in on Gilgeous-Alexander.

It's a one-game sample, and Williams wasn't even involved, but the Thunder have to be encouraged by what they saw offensively on Wednesday. Even in a scoreless night from Aaron Wiggins, the Thunder generated enough offense around Gilgeous-Alexander to win. They even won the minutes he rested by three points. There was no single, offensive sidekick for Gilgeous-Alexander. It was a group effort centered on their bulk. Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein proved problematic for Boston's front court near the basket and are skilled enough with the ball in their hands to punish mismatches even when they get the ball far away from it. Cason Wallace and Luguentz Dort showcased why this team gets away with minimal perimeter height. They're so strong and have such low centers of gravity that they can finish against longer defenders and even push some of them around.

Boston's defense has been on cruise control for lengthy stretches this regular season. Porzingis changes everything as well. A lot of those acrobatic finishes Thunder guards pulled off on Wednesday aren't going to be available when he's patrolling the basket at 7-foot-2. But getting Williams back means a good deal to Oklahoma City as well. 

This wasn't the Dallas series. Oklahoma City's supporting cast has improved substantially.

Rim defense is a big component of Oklahoma City's willingness to allow 3s, but the other major component is turnover generation. This is what the Thunder do best, especially to teams with reluctant ball-handlers. The Thunder generate 17.5 turnovers per game, which is not only the most in the league, but is a full turnover more than any other team. They want to take the ball away from you and turn games into track meets in which they score easy points in transition.

The Celtics are the opposite. Only the Thunder give the ball away less than they do, and Boston ranks 27th in the NBA in pace. They want a slow, grind-it-out game because they know they can out-execute basically anyone in a half-court setting. Through two head-to-head games, they've largely been able to dictate these terms. They turned the ball over just 13 times on Wednesday and 16 in their first matchup. That's more than their average of just under 12, but it's below Oklahoma City's season-long average (17.3) pretty comfortably. Additionally, the Thunder average 16.1 fast break points per game, but have reached only 13 in both Celtics games.

This should give the Thunder an idea of what to expect in a series against the Celtics. They're going to operate methodically, protect the ball and try to keep the pace down. This is playoff basketball in a nutshell, and no team in the current NBA does it better than the Celtics. The Thunder winning both of their regular-season games against Boston is in some respects a testament to their adaptability, but also, as we've covered, partially just shooting luck. If they do see the Celtics again, they probably have to go into such a series knowing that they're not going to be able to generate turnovers quite as easily as they usually do and that Boston will eventually make the 3s it missed in the regular season. 

This game was, in some ways, a bit of an experiment for the Thunder. They've seen how Boston reacts to a defense that gives it all of the 3s it wants. The Celtics will have adjustments ready if there is another matchup ahead between these teams. That's the benefit of the doubt that champions get. 

The Thunder are still working to receive that same treatment, but these two regular-season wins are a good start.

A ton of dominoes have fallen during the first few days of NFL free agency, with several big-name free agents reportedly coming to terms on new deals. A lot of marquee players have found new homes, but there are still a lot of good players available as we continue on into the new league year.

The tampering period kicked off on Monday with two quarterbacks finding new NFL homes. Justin Fields, after deciding to test free agency despite the Steelers' attempts to re-sign him, reportedly agreed to a two-year, $40 million deal with the New York Jets that includes $30 million guaranteed. Shortly after Fields landed with the Jets, the Seattle Seahawks reportedly signed Sam Darnold to a three-year, $100.5 million deal just days after trading former Pro Bowler Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders. 

More notable players found new NFL homes on Tuesday, including former Dolphins safety Jevon Holland, who reportedly came to terms on a three-year, $45.3 million deal with the New York Giants. Will Fries, the former Colt and the top-available offensive lineman going into Tuesday, reportedly agreed to a five-year, $88 million deal with the Vikings. Former Chiefs safety Justin Reid reportedly came to terms on a three-year, $31.5 million deal with the New Orleans Saints. 

On Wednesday, we saw players like Javon Hargrave (Vikings), Evan Engram (Broncos), Darius Slay (Steelers), Demarcus Lawrence (Seahawks), Kevin Zeitler (Titans) and more come off the board, largely on shorter-term deals with their new teams. But even with those guys now locked up, there is still plenty of talent out there.

Here's a look at the top-10 players who are still available. It should be noted that the following ranking is not solely about talent, it's also about market demand and the position they play. 

Rodgers is technically not a free agent until his official release from the Jets on Wednesday. He might not be the best player still available, but he is a future Hall of Famer who plays the most important position in all of sports, so him taking the top spot was kind of a no-brainer. 

It appears that the Steelers have the inside track at landing Rodgers after missing out on Fields. But the Giants (who re-signed receiver Darius Slayton on Monday) are also still in the mix. There are rumblings that Rodgers' third NFL team will be revealed at some point on Tuesday. 

Like Rodgers, Wilson is probably not the second-best player still available. But he is a possible future Hall of Fame quarterback who was named to his 10th Pro Bowl in 2024. 

At this point, it appears that Wilson will sign with whomever doesn't land Rodgers. That could mean a return to Pittsburgh for the 2025 season. A dark-horse candidate for both Rodgers and Wilson is the Vikings after Minnesota watched Darnold leave for Seattle. 

Robinson is the top offensive tackle left on the board. The veteran is 29 years old and has been linked to the Patriots since the start of free agency.

A former first-round pick who didn't pan out with the Jets, Becton enjoyed a career rebirth last year while helping the Eagles win the Super Bowl. A big reason for Becton's success last year was him moving from tackle to the interior of the offensive line. Becton is only 26 and has shown considerable growth at both run blocking and in pass protection. 

Like former teammate and 2021 draft classmate Fields, Jenkins is hoping to revive his career with a new team after things didn't necessarily pan out in Chicago. Like Becton, Jenkins' play has improved after transitioning from tackle to guard. He's also young (27) and already has 40 starts under his belt. 

Several defensive backs reportedly found new teams on Monday, but Douglas is still available. Arguably the best cornerback still available, Douglas' career so far includes a Super Bowl win with the Eagles (in 2017, his rookie season) and a year that saw him record a league-best two interception returns for scores (in 2021 as a member of the Packers). Douglas is a good fit for teams that like to play zone. 

Cooper is looking to rebound following a disappointing 2024 season that saw him produce the lowest stat lines of his career. Cooper, though, is just two years removed from his 2023 campaign that saw him record a career-best 1,250 yards receiving. A receiver-needy team should take a chance on him if the price is right. 

The 38-year-old Campbell hasn't officially confirmed whether or not he wants to play in 2025. But if he does decide to return for an 18th season, Campbell may get signed by a team that has a realistic shot at winning a Super Bowl, something that has alluded him to this point in his career. The Lions have recently been named by multiple outlets as a possible landing spot for Campbell, who had five sacks and a dozen tackles for loss last season as a member of the Dolphins. 

Samuel was limited to just four games this past season due to injury. He's been strong in coverage when healthy, even if he's somewhat limited as a perimeter corner who is on the smaller side. The Chargers have seemingly moved on in their defensive backfield, so it's possible Samuel could be had on the cheap. 

Ojulari has shown flashes, but is oft-injured. Not sure he can be an every down player and is more like a depth piece. Whenever he has played extended time, he's gotten injured. Talent is there though.

The new NFL league year kicked off Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET, but the chaos of the offseason was in full swing well before that.

We had stars receive franchise tags (Tee Higgins and Trey Smith), Pro Bowlers get traded (Geno Smith, Deebo Samuel and DK Metcalf), franchise quarterbacks receive pay raises (Matthew Stafford and Josh Allen), All-Pro edge rushers land record-breaking extensions (Maxx Crosby and Myles Garrett) and a whole lot more. And all of that was before the NFL's legal tampering period began at noon ET on Monday! 

Once teams were able to negotiate with other clubs' impending three agents, several high-profile deals were almost immediately agreed to. The biggest ones on Monday were the Seahawks signing Sam Darnold to a three-year contract worth $100.5 million and the Jets signing Justin Fields to a two-year deal worth $40 million. Elsewhere on Day 1, the Patriots added several key defenders for new head coach Mike Vrabel, the Texans traded their star left tackle to the Commanders and the Browns acquired a former first-round quarterback from the Eagles.

Day 2 brought even more movement, headlined by quarterback Daniel Jones signing with the Colts on a one-year deal worth $14 million. Meanwhile, the Vikings spent big for guard Will Fries and defensive tackle Jonathan Allen while the Texans traded away yet another former first-round offensive lineman, this time sending Kenyon Green to the Eagles for safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson. Then on Tuesday night, the Bills bolstered their pass rush with Joey Bosa and the Ravens added a contested-catch standout in DeAndre Hopkins.

From blockbuster moves to bargain-bin shopping, we've got you covered below with a running tracker of every team's 2024 additions, including external signings and trade acquisitions. For more info on all the free agency deals and rumors, click here.

Duke freshman star Cooper Flagg suffered a left ankle injury Thursday in the Blue Devils' first appearance of the postseason vs. Georgia Tech and had to be helped off the floor into the locker room. Replays showed Flagg rolling his left ankle as he came down for a rebound and immediately grabbing the area of injury while writhing in pain on the court.

Flagg, the frontrunner to win National Player of the Year for No. 1 Duke, sustained the injury with 2:46 remaining in the first half and was escorted by trainers to the locker room for further evaluation. The Blue Devils rallied in the second half for a 78-70 win over the Yellow Jackets. 

Duke said at halftime that his return to the game was doubtful but later ruled him out. Footage taken by Ross Martin of CBS Sports, who is on press row in Charlotte, showed Flagg participating in Duke's timeout huddles during the second half but walking gingerly back to the bench.

Flagg was unable to put much, if any, weight on the leg after the incident. He punched a chair on the bench in frustration and screamed before being taken back to the locker room, at which point he was placed in a wheelchair with his left shoe removed. 

Flagg leads Duke in scoring, rebounding, assists and blocks this season for a Blue Devils team that won the ACC title outright and entered the postseason with a 28-3 overall record. Flagg finished the regular season in style with a 15-point, nine-rebound, six-assist, four-block game in Duke's sweep of rival North Carolina. Interestingly, the Tar Heels are in the unusual position of rooting for Duke on Thursday because they need an opportunity for resume-building wins to get off the bubble. Such an opportunity could come Friday for North Carolina, should it and Duke advance. 

Duke's injury woes against Georgia Tech alone are staggering with Selection Sunday just days away. Earlier in the game, junior forward Maliq Brown also suffered an injury in an apparent aggravation of a nagging shoulder injury. He has also been ruled out for the game.

CBS Sports Bracketologist Jerry Palm expects Duke to be tight-lipped about Flagg's injury over the weekend, if he does not play again in Charlotte, to possibly preserve its spot as a No. 1 seed. 

""If he's out only this game, no big deal,"" Palm said. ""If he is expected to miss significant time, that's different."" 

Flagg is the first major conference freshman to lead his team in all five major statistical categories since Ben Simmons did so for LSU in 2015-16, underscoring his irreplaceable production. 

The big question with Flagg is of course how much, if at all, the injury lingers, and to what extent it may impact him. He was able to walk back to the bench from the locker room area while only slightly favoring his ankle, which could in theory bode well for his future availability as Duke marches into the postseason as one of the favorites to win the NCAA championship. Championship odds for Duke in some places went from +300 to +770 in a matter of minutes in the wake of Flagg's injury, before resettling at +350 when cameras showed him walking without a severe limp. 

In a terrible world in which Flagg does miss the tournament, etching his name along Kenyon Martin as an all-time what-if, here are the stakes:  Flagg would be the 5th player ever to win National Player of the Year (AP, Wooden or Naismith) and not play in the NCAA Tournament (1963-64 Gary Bradds, 1969-70 Pete Maravich, 1974-75 David Thompson, 1999-00 Martin).

However, Duke's roster aside from Flagg is far from barren. There are four other five-star prospects on Duke's current roster including two other projected lottery picks for 2025 led by guard Kon Knueppel, the team's second-leading scorer, and center Khaman Maluach, a 7-foot-2 big man who is second on the team in rebounding and blocks.

Auburn is tied for Duke as the favorite to win it all (+350), with Houston and Florida (+700) following.

Real Madrid booked their spot in the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals the hard way on Wednesday, beating Atletico Madrid 4-2 in a penalty shootout after the aggregate score was tied at 2-2.

The hosts took a lead within the first 30 seconds courtesy of Conor Gallagher, who leveled the aggregate score at 2-2 and scored the fastest goal of this season's competition. The two sides traded spells of possession and shots, but the match appeared to tilt Real Madrid's way when Clement Lenglet fouled Kylian Mbappe in the box and conceded a penalty. The ever-reliable Vinicius Junior missed his first penalty in a Real Madrid shirt in the 71st minute, setting up for a frantic finish to regular time.

Both sides had their chances in extra time, but neither side was able to find a go-ahead goal before the end of 120 minutes. The shootout was full of drama, with Real Madrid's Lucas Vazquez and Atletico Madrid's Marcos Llorente failing to convert their spotkicks. The most pivotal moment of the shootout, though, came with Julian Alvarez's kick -- the refereeing team, after some time, deemed that he kicked the ball twice before sending the ball in the back of the net, invalidating his penalty.

Real Madrid will face Arsenal when the competition resumes in early April.

Rudiger steps up and though Oblak gets a touch, it still goes in! Real Madrid advance 4-2 on penalties.

Llorente goes quickly from the spot but the ball hits the post! Real Madrid 3, Atletico 2

Vazquez steps up to take the spotkick for Real Madrid but he can't get the height on it so Oblak makes the save! Real Madrid 3, Atletico 2

Correa scores but because of Alvarez's kick, they're behind. Real Madrid 3, Atletico 2

The referee has ruled that Alvarez took two touches and so his penalty doesn't count! Real Madrid 3, Atletico 1

Oblak guesses correctly but Valverde's able to slot his penalty into the back of the net anyway. Real Madrid 3, Atletico 2

Alvarez is next for Atletico and he slides his strong strike underneath the crossbar. Real Madrid 2, Atletico 2

Bellingham's up next and he also slots the ball into the bottom right corner. Real Madrid 2, Atletico 1

Sorloth steps up for Atletico and puts the ball in the back of the net. Real Madrid 1, Atletico 1

Mbappe steps up first and he takes a nice, clean strike and sends the ball in the bottom right corner. Real Madrid have a 1-0 lead in the shootout to start.

27 shots between the two teams, but only one turned into a goal -- and that was back in the first minute of this 120 minute game. There's one last stage of this round of 16 tie, and it will involve spotkicks. 

115' With five minutes plus stoppage time to go until penalties, Ancelotti makes a big call -- he takes off Vinicius for Endrick. Fresh legs will always come in handy but it's hard not to be reminded of Vinicius' penalty miss and wonder if that went into the decision.

115' These teams are in a frantic search for the go-ahead goal but quality chances are few and far beteen, the natural result of tired legs working in a panic. Llorente and Vazquez have a little bit of a heated exchange that ends with both getting booked -- and then getting back to work.

109' Real Madrid get a corner and though they don't score from it, they're able to recycle the ball multiple times over in the hopes of finding a goal. Diaz and Rudiger are on the list of players who have a chance at scoring but Atletico's defensive work means a quality shot is hard to come by.

105'+1 Mbappe is fouled just outside the penalty area and so the visitors have a freekick. The ball naturally finds itself in the penalty box and Vazquez is the one with the last touch, but Oblak collects with relative ease.

99' Sorloth, who's had an impressive first season with Atletico, looks to add another goal to his account but it's a swing and a miss from clsoe range. No go-ahead goal just yet.

97' Reinildo falls to the ground and has an issue with his leg, and though he tries to make it work, it's clear he needs to come off. Azpilicueta comes on in his place. 

Real Madrid have three substitutes to use, while Atletico have two.

One goal, 19 shots and one missed penalty later, these two sides are deadlocked on aggregate at 2-2. You know what that means -- 30 minutes of extra time. Atletico have been the better side throughout with 13 shots and 1.45 expected goals, but with tired legs and a half-hour on the clock, it really is anyone's game.

90' Correa's got the ball and barrels closer to the touchline, but he decides to go for goal and doesn't miss by much. The fourth official announces four minutes of stoppage time, a period that will undoubtedly be spent by players doing whatever they can to avoid extra time.

83' Mendy falls awkwardly in a recent sequence and he gives it a go for a moment, but as soon as he gets up to attempt to run it off, he realizes he can't continue, his leg not being in the right condition to do so. Ancelotti goes to his bench and brings on F. Garcia to close out this game.

81' In a game of momentum shifts, the latest one has favored Real Madrid. Vinicius' missed penalty has not sucked the life out of the visitors, perhaps instead revitalizing their quest to find the go-ahead goal with extra time approaching. Atletico is game to return to their solid defensive shape, though, so Real Madrid haven't created a lot of clear-cut chances. Vazquez has a ball that he hopes to use to set up a nearby teammate for a goal, but the ball is cleared out for a corner and then the visitors can't do much with the in-swinging effort.

73' Fresh off Vinicius' missed penalty, Real Madrid reboot their attacking effort and build something promising courtesy of Vinicius himself, who tries to set up a teammate for the opportunity. The pace of the ball slows at some point and so Vazquez's header, while well-timed, does not come with enough pace to cause trouble for Oblak.

71' Who saw that coming? Vinicius steps up to take the penalty and give Real Madrid the lead, a perfect candidate since he was four for four with penalty kicks this season. Somehow, though, he skies the ball and so the aggregate score is still tied at 2-2.

68' Atletico go forward but Vinicius wins the ball back well into Real Madrid's half and kicks off the counterattack, which sees him connect with Bellingham before he passes the ball to Mbappe. Mbappe goes on an impressive run and Lenglet can't stop him outside of fouling him in the box so Real Madrid have a penalty. Vinicius will take.

66' Modric and Tchouameni (who's on a yellow) come off as Ancelotti goes to the bench in the hopes of finding a game-winning goal with extra time (and penalties) looming. Camavinga and Vazquez come on in their places.

61' Vinicius picks up a yellow card after tripping Simeone, which would keep him out of the first leg of the quarterfinals should Real Madrid advance.

57' It's Real Madrid's turn to go forward and it's Bellingham who hopes to create a geme-changing moment, but Gimenez intervenes with an all-important block. There's been a lot of last ditch defending from both teams, arguably the natural complement to a back-and-forth, must-win game.

54' Atletico are carving out chances for themselves, the latest coming with Simeone running down the right flank and forcing Real Madrid to concede a corner. The visitors keep the ball out of danger and then do so again on a subsequent corner but it looks like they've picked things up from where they left off in the first half.

No changes at the half for either side.

A total of 144 players will step foot onto the course at TPC Sawgrass this week with hopes of raising one of the biggest trophies of their respective careers. For some, the 2025 Players Championship will be as good as it gets, but for others, it could prove to be a stepping stone to bigger and better tournaments ... or perhaps another entry into a hall-of-fame résumé.

While there have been some surprises in recent Players Championships -- veterans like Lee Westwood and Jim Furyk contending or relative unknown Anirban Lahiri nearly winning in 2022 -- the recent winners have been a who's who in the game of golf.

Dating back to Tiger Woods' last Players title in 2013, only two non-major winners (at the time of their title or down the road) have entered the winner's circle at the PGA Tour's flagship event. Those players are Rickie Fowler and Si Woo Kim.

As for the rest? Well, it's been who you would expect. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler became the first player to successfully defend his title at TPC Sawgrass with his miraculous come-from-behind victory last season. A win this week to complete a rare three-peat would give him the most Players crowns alongside Jack Nicklaus (three).

Cameron Smith, Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy round out the names on the Players trophy since the tournament transitioned from May to March. While the switch in the time of year switched up certain aspects of the golf course, it did not alter the quality of winner with Webb Simpson, Jason Day and Martin Kaymer all coming through at this tournament as well.

With this in mind, let's take a closer look at the nine golfers -- only 6% of the field -- with the best chance to win this year's edition of The Players. Be sure to check out a PGA Championship TV schedule and coverage guide so you know exactly when and where to watch all 72 holes this week.

Mikal Bridges made news before the New York Knicks tipped off on Wednesday when he publicly lobbied for head coach Tom Thibodeau to play his starters fewer minutes. As it turned out, the Knicks needed every one of Bridges' 41 minutes against the Portland Trail Blazers. 

With Jalen Brunson still sidelined, Bridges took the reins of New York's offense and scored 33 points, including the game-winning 3-pointer, in what was perhaps his best game with the Knicks.

The game was a classic even before the Bridges dagger, though. It included 42 lead changes in 53 minutes. And were it not for the shot Bridges drilled at the end, we'd remember this game for an entirely different reason. With 7.2 seconds remaining and the Knicks leading 111-110, Josh Hart needed to simply inbound the ball and wait for a teammate to get fouled so New York could extend the lead to two or three. 

Instead, he committed one of the rarer violations in all of basketball. Hart moved several steps before he inbounded the ball, which isn't allowed unless the inbound is coming after a score. This inbound came after the ball went out of bounds on Portland, so Hart was not allowed to maneuver the baseline. As a result of his blunder, the ball went back to the Blazers.

The call was so rare that broadcaster Mike Breen said on the air that he had never seen it at the end of a game in 33 years. The Blazers took advantage. While Mitchell Robinson blocked Deni Avdija on his go-ahead layup attempt, Avdija secured the rebound, made the putback and got fouled in the process. 

That gave Portland a 113-111 lead, but with the game on the line, Thibodeau drew up the play for Bridges. He delivered with a game-winning triple.

After the game, Tom Haberstroh noted a somewhat shocking bit of NBA history that came on this Bridges shot. The tracking-era record for most lead changes in a game is 43. That was set in an overtime game between the Brooklyn Nets and Atlanta Hawks. In that game, Bridges hit a game-winner to secure a 114-113 victory for his team, just as he did tonight in a game that included the second-most lead changes of the tracking era (42).

It's been an uneven debut season for Bridges with the Knicks. Despite rejoining his Villanova teammates Brunson and Hart, Bridges is having his worst 3-point shooting season since his rookie year. His defense hasn't been up to its typical standard either, and after the Knicks gave up five first-round picks to get him, expectations were understandably high. 

Perhaps this shot is a sign of things to come for Bridges down the stretch with the postseason approaching. If nothing else, Hart owes him a big thank you for the bail out.

There isn't a good time to have to hire a football coach, but Scot Loeffler's sudden departure from Bowling Green to take an assistant job with the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 28 left athletic director Derek van der Merwe in a particularly bad spot. With college football's coaching carousel already complete and spring practice just around the corner, van der Merwe had an unconventional list of candidates to navigate and a short window to complete the process.

Bowling Green coaching alum Urban Meyer pushed an ""out of the box"" name onto van der Merwe's radar in Eddie George. The former Heisman Trophy winner, NFL All-Pro and sitting coach at Tennessee State -- who ironically took van der Merwe's initial call while driving through Bowling Green, Kentucky -- emerged as the leading candidate and was hired on March 10. 

With a splash hire secured, van der Merwe began to see the upside to the awkwardly timed change in leadership.  

""What's unique about this one is that if you can imagine like you're sitting in December, and you have a coach leaving after a season or after a bowl game. Then all of a sudden, that transfer portal is wide open,"" van der Merwe told CBS Sports. ""Sometimes they're out the door before there's that chance for that coach to kind of on-ramp into that relationship, and demonstrate that person's really committed to the well-being and the development (of the players).

""So there's somewhat of an advantage for a March (hiring) situation. Yes, they have this transfer portal window open because of the transition, but you know that they're still enrolled in school for the semester and they they're still going to complete the semester in school. (This way they) get the chance for that coach to actually sit down with that person.""

Now the Falcons are full steam ahead preparing for spring practice -- still set to start next week -- and only one player has formally entered the portal since Loffler left. George and his staff will get 15 full practice sessions to make an impression before the portal window opens on April 16. 

He's no stranger to a late start. He hit the ground running in April of his first season at TSU. He has conducted meetings with the current assistants and it's unclear if he will make any outside hires -- which could include with members of the TSU staff that won an OVC title and qualified for the FCS playoffs last year. 

""I think now the goal is, how do we get to September?"" George told reporters after his introductory press conference. ""It's going to take diligence. It's going to take us, for us to be focused, operate with a great attitude (and) be intentional. You know, trust the process of us getting there. And that process is constantly having communication, being transparent with that communication and understanding that the end goal is to put the best staff together. "" 

Van der Merwe calls George a renaissance man who has been successful in business, Broadway, and now coaching. It stands to reason that George will be key in raising funds for the program as a familiar face to alumni who remember him as a Tennessee Titans or Ohio State star. It's also unclear if George will be donating back to the school a la Joe Moglia at Coastal Carolina or Biff Poggi at Charlotte. 

The Eddie George era may be starting a little late in comparison to other coaching tenures, but the fact that it's happening at all is a bold bet by Bowling Green that he can bring a renaissance for the Falcons -- just like Meyer did 25 years ago.

The national anthem has become a staple of major American sporting events, and with versions sung every single night, every sport has its share of infamous performances. One that stands out in NBA history came back in 2003, when the Portland Trail Blazers were hosting the Dallas Mavericks in a first-round playoff game.

Natalie Gilbert, then 13 years old, took center court to sing, but midway through the performance, she forgot the words. Fortunately, she had an eager helper in the form of then-Blazers head coach Maurice Cheeks, who stepped up and encouraged her to keep going. 

Cheeks even finished the song alongside her, embracing her afterward and turning what could have been a horrible night into a heartwarming moment that made national news. 

Fast forward 22 years and Cheeks is an assistant coach under Tom Thibodeau with the New York Knicks. Those Knicks make only one trip to Portland per year, and the Blazers decided to bring back a very special anthem singer for the occasion. 

Gilbert, now 35, stepped onto the floor to once again sing in front of Cheeks. She nailed her performance this time.

A Rip City redemption like no other 🥹❤️🎶 pic.twitter.com/FHPZuZDuMJ

The Portland crowd gave Gilbert a rousing ovation after her performance, and the camera even cut to a grinning and applauding Cheeks. Even now, more than two decades later, Gilbert remains thankful to Cheeks for his kindness. 

""This moment changed my life. And I wouldn't have had it any other way,"" Gilbert said on the broadcast, according to ESPN. ""I would not go back in time and change it at all. Seeing him and seeing that he's still the standup guy today that he was back then. It's amazing.""

how it started vs. how it's going 🫂❤️ https://t.co/ewjnNnecg2 pic.twitter.com/vHx1dL8Jla

The age of the internet has made it easier than ever for a single embarrassing moment to snowball into something that defines someone's life. Were it not for Cheeks, that perhaps could have been the case for Gilbert. Instead, the two were able to give fans in Portland and around the NBA two of the most memorable national anthem renditions the league has ever seen.

Once again, the NFL news cycle is being dominated by Aaron Rodgers as the future Hall of Fame quarterback tries to figure out his next move. 

The four-time league MVP, former Super Bowl MVP and future Hall of Famer is facing an unknown future after the New York Jets decided to go in another direction earlier this offseason. Rodgers is reportedly trying to decide whether he will either retire or play a 21st season in the NFL. The Steelers and Giants are reportedly the front-runners to land Rodgers if he decides to resume his career, but the Minnesota Vikings are also a darkhorse candidate after losing Sam Darnold via free agency. 

Rodgers, 41, is coming off a 2024 season that was odd to say the least. While he put up decent numbers, Rodgers lacked the mobility that he had prior to his major Achilles injury that wiped out virtually his entire first season with the Jets. Rodgers was also part of a Jets team that endured an horrific 5-12 season that led to a regime change in the Big Apple. 

It's easy to fall behind on this story, as there is seemingly an update on Rodgers' future by the hour. In order to stay on top of the latest news, here is a running thread of the latest stories and updates regarding Rodgers and the teams that he has been linked to. 

Show me the money? Money is not the reason why Rodgers hasn't signed with the Steelers yet. The Steelers have made their offer to Rodgers, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. It's simply about Rodgers taking his time about making a decision. 

Based on the Post-Gazette's report, it appears that Rodgers is OK with the Steelers' offer, so things should come together rather quickly if he decides to come to Pittsburgh. 

Vikings might be in play: The Vikings' decision-makers are evaluating their options at quarterback which includes Rodgers, according to The Athletic, who also reported that Rodgers is intrigued by the idea of playing in Minnesota.

Of the three teams that appear to be in the running to get him, the Vikings appear to be the best spot, considering that the Vikings are coming off a 14-3 season, have one of the league's top receiving duos in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, running back and former Rodgers' teammate Aaron Jones, and a defense that recently added free agents Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave. 

Jets releasing Rodgers: While this was a formality, it was reported on Wednesday that the Jets would officially release Rodgers sometime after the start of the new league year. While they haven't released him yet, Rodgers was allowed to begin speaking to other teams after the Jets announced their intentions to part ways with him last month. 

Holding the Steelers hostage? Former NFL GM Doug Whaley said on Wednesday that Rodgers is ""holding the entire Steelers organization hostage"" during a Pittsburgh radio hit. The Steelers are indeed reportedly waiting for Rodgers to give them an answer, although NFL Media reported Wednesday morning that it could be weeks before a decision is made. Retirement is still a possible an option for Rodgers. 

Wilson not waiting around: Instead of waiting for Rodgers to make a decision, Russell Wilson -- the other notable quarterback who is still a free agent -- is taking matters into his own hands. Wilson is reportedly meeting with the Browns on Thursday and the Giants on Friday. 

If he were to sign with Cleveland, Wilson could find himself in a position battle with Kenny Pickett, who was traded from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia shortly after Wilson was signed by the Steelers last offseason. 

Teams be warned: An NFL team executive told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones that teams still waiting for the future Hall of Famer to make his decision should ""do so at their own risk."" Teams should only wait so long and can only wait so long to make a decision on their quarterback room, given the free agent market and the upcoming draft class.

Back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs -- yes, that's five straight -- isn't something you see often. In fact, it's never been done in MLB history (the record is four, done 11 times). But Tuesday, the Kansas Jayhawks accomplished the feat in the third inning as part of a 29-1 romp over the Minnesota Golden Gophers.

DID THAT JUST HAPPEN??? YES IT DID WE HAVE VIDEO PROOF 😎5 STRAIGHT HOMERUNS FOR THE HAWKS@ChaseDiggins6 x @JR_Soliz_BOOM x @BradyCounsell x @ballingerbrady7 x @JacksonHauge 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/iF4SLVtkJt

It's just the fourth time in Division-I history a team has hit five straight home runs. The Jayhawks joined ...

Already leading 6-1, Kansas' dinger party began with Chase Diggins' three-run shot. Then came solo shots from Max Soliz Jr., Brady Counsell, Brady Ballinger and Jackson Hauge. Overall, Kansas scored eight runs in the third inning, three in the fourth, eight more in the fifth, one in the sixth and four in the seventh. The game was called after seven innings via run rule.

The 29 runs and the 28-run margin are both Kansas records versus a Division I opponent.

You'll notice an interesting backdrop for the feat, too. Minnesota is currently playing its home games inside U.S. Bank Stadium, home of the NFL's Vikings. Even though Wednesday was actually quite pleasant in Minneapolis, the Golden Gophers begin their seasons indoors to avoid the normal cold.

Diggins and Hauge finished with two home runs and seven RBI apiece for the Jayhawks, who improved to 15-2 on the season and begin Big 12 play Friday against Baylor.

The PGA Tour season is beginning to pick up steam, and with the 2025 Players Championship fast approaching, the key question everyone's asking is the same across the golf world: Who are you picking to win at TPC Sawgrass? With a tremendous field featuring most of the best golfers in the world in attendance, we should be in for an epic ride beginning with Thursday's first round.

While The Players does not hold a ""major championship"" designation, but it's nevertheless a huge event on the annual golf calendar as the PGA Tour's flagship tournament. The $25 million purse and $4.5 million winner's share is more than will be payed out at the Masters, PGA Championship, U.S. Open or Open Championship this year.

Scottie Scheffler, the defending Players champion, enters with plenty of momentum from another dynamite 2024, though his start to the 2025 season has been less than ideal. Collin Morikawa has been playing incredible golf of late, but he fell back Sunday at the Arnold Palmer Invitational to relinquish a lead he held for the better part of two rounds. Tiger Woods will not be in attendance at TPC Sawgrass, though Rory McIlroy will be looking to put his best foot forward with one month to go until he competes for the elusive green jacket at Augusta National Golf Club.

So, what is going to happen this week in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida? Let's take a look at a full set of predictions and picks from our CBS Sports experts.

You can also check out a full slate of Players Championship odds to help set your expectations of the field, Players Championship tee times and pairings for Round 1 on Thursday and the entire Players Championship TV schedule for the week so you know exactly when and where to watch all 72 holes.

Patrick McDonald, golf writer 

Winner -- Collin Morikawa (16-1): The Arnold Palmer Invitational loss may still sting, but Morikawa will get right back onto the horse and ride into the winner's circle after traveling a few hours North. The two-time major champion was sensational from tee to green at Bay Hill, and that will carry over to TPC Sawgrass where his blend of accurate driving and pinpoint iron play will allow him to rise to the top of the leaderboard. His Players Championship history is mixed, but he has a number of quality rounds under his belt. Given the way he is trending, he should be able to string four together this week.

Sleeper -- Justin Rose (150-1): The former world No. 1 can still keep up with the big boys on golf courses that require more than just physical skill. One of the best course managers in the game, Rose will rise to the challenge that is TPC Sawgrass like he has many times in the past. The Englishman has two top-10 finishes and two missed cuts since the tournament moved to March drawing parallels to his current season where he has two top 10s (Pebble Beach and Bay Hill) and two missed cuts (both at Torrey Pines).

Top 10 lock -- Scottie Scheffler: What's throwing me off the scent of Scheffler to take home the title is the level of difficulty involved in winning any golf tournament three years in a row, let alone the Players Championship where Scheffler became the first ever to successfully defend with his title last season. The world No. 1 figured out the big stick at Bay Hill where he led the field from off the tee and the rest of his game is now beginning to follow suit. His poor putting at Arnie's Place may introduce some questions, but his tee-to-green game is good enough to finish inside the top 10 without the aid of a cooperative flat stick.

Star who definitely won't win -- Justin Thomas: There have not been many to win The Players twice, and Thomas isn't going to add his name to that list (at least not this year). While the tee-to-green presence is strong, there are still some holes in his game -- big misses off the tee, big numbers on the scorecard and short misses on the greens -- especially when the test ramps up. Since his 2022 PGA Championship victory, Thomas has one top 10 (2024 PGA), six missed cuts and no other finishes inside the top 30 in the majors or The Players.

Surprise prediction -- Jordan Spieth contends: His Players form stinks, but something is clicking at the moment. Spieth continues to drive the ball effectively, and while his iron play can come and go, he is making putts again -- something he was not doing from 2022-24. A top-10 finish at the WM Phoenix Open was not all too surprising given his history at TPC Scottsdale, but another such result at PGA National in his debut appearance was more than welcomed. 

Lowest round: 64 (-8)Winning score: 268 (-20)Winner's Sunday score: 68 (-4)

Josh Mullenix, Early Wedge producer

Winner -- Scottie Scheffler (5-1): His start to 2025 has been a little turbulent by his standards, but he still has three top 11 finishes in four starts. He's going to make someone else stare him down and win the tournament, something only Stephan Jaeger has done the last two years. TPC Sawgrass will make the winner hit three to five well executed golf shots on Sunday down the stretch, and no one executes better than the World No. 1.

Sleeper -- Daniel Berger (55-1): He's done nothing but bank top 25 finishes since the RSM Classic in November. After a missed cut at the Farmers Insurance Open where the putter let him down, he's gaining across the bag and just finished T15 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational despite opening with a 78 on Thursday. It's his first Players Championship in three years, but he finished among the top 15 in both 2021 and 2022. One thing is for sure about Berger: He has the confidence to win this week and his game suggests the same. 

Top 10 lock -- Collin Moriakwa: There's a clear closing problem with Morikawa -- look no further than Bay Hill last Sunday. But that's basically his only problem at this juncture. He leads the PGA Tour this season in strokes gained tee to green and is a measly sixth in approach. As one of the best iron players in the world with the driving accuracy to hit from the fairway all week long, it's hard to see him not banking a quality finish. I just highly doubt he'll figure out how to win again with the pressure of TPC Sawgrass' closing stretch staring him in the face.  

Star who definitely won't win -- Patrick Cantlay: The golf world is perpetually underwhelmed by Cantlay even though last week's T31 was just his second finish outside of the top 25 since last year's Memorial Tournament. However, he also finished outside the top 30 at Pebble Beach. He's battling a different thing every week; lost strokes with the putter and off the tee at the Arnold Palmer, the short game was bad at the Genesis and the putter disappeared at Pebble Beach. Before that he started the year with some shaky iron play. More than anything, Cantlay isn't going to win this week because Cantlay doesn't win anywhere. We are now 933 days removed from his last victory at the 2022 BMW Championship.

Surprise prediction -- Two of the six betting favorites will miss the cut: The volatility of success at The Players is one of the reasons this tournament is so fun. Every year, past champions and big names find the water one too many times and miss the cut. Two of Scheffler, Morikawa, Thomas, Rory McIlroy, Ludvig Åberg and Tommy Fleetwood will not even play the weekend. Maybe McIlroy brings a wayward driver like he did last year. Thomas's putter is nonexistent. Åberg's short game and approach is a little sloppy. TPC Sawgrass is primed to turn little imperfections into a weekend off, even for the best in the field.

Lowest round: 64 (-8)Winning score: 272 (-16)Winner's Sunday score: 70 (-2)

Adam Silverstein, senior director of editorial

Winner -- Collin Morikawa (16-1): Scheffler is the deserving favorite at TPC Sawgrass given his dominance of the course, but Morikawa is the value play coming off his second-place finish (that should have been a win) at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week. His precision and accuracy will do him well in Ponte Vedra Beach, and simply put, he's a trustworthy start who is unlikely to go wayward like so many others might. Scheffler winning three straight is certainly possible given his immense skill, but he still needs to put it all together in 2025.

Sleeper -- Shane Lowry (35-1): Granted, I might stretching the definition of ""sleeper"" here, but Lowry is basically a top-10 lock at TPC Sawgrass. At some point, he's going to break through to hoist the trophy and $4.5 million check. He's finished among the top 11 in each of his last two starts and seems to be continuing to surge off a successful 2024. I'd rather back him at these odds than someone twice as long who is far less likely to win.

Top 10 lock -- Scottie Scheffler: Whether Morikawa struggles to close or he puts his game together at the right time, it's hard to imagine Scheffler not being among the top five once 72 holes are played at TPC Sawgrass. Being given twice as many spots in which to back a guy who has already defended his title at The Players feels generous, but I'll take it.

Star who definitely won't win -- Xander Schauffele: The game is just not there, and at 18-1, it would be foolhardy to back him (though that is twice as much value as he'll get at majors later this year). Schauffele finished T30 at The Sentry and T40 last week after barely making the Bay Hill cut on the number. Going from that to the winner's circle coming out of this strong of a field is highly unlikely.

Surprise prediction -- Rickie Fowler contends on Sunday: There is nothing from his season thus far that points to Fowler making a run at TPC Sawgrass, though he does have two finishes near the top 10 this year, and obviously he's won at this course before. He's at 90-1 on the oddsboard and coming off a week where he did not play after not receiving an expected exemption into the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Talk about motivation.

Lowest round: 64 (-8)Winning score: 274 (-14)Winner's Sunday score: 69 (-3)

EA Sports held a photoshoot for ""College Football 26,"" and a leaked photograph showing a potential version of the Deluxe Edition cover is real, CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello confirms. Several coaches are involved in the promotional material this time around, including Georgia's Kirby Smart and Ohio State's Ryan Day. 

Smart, Day and Penn State's James Franklin are identifiable on the leaked cover, as are several players, including Ohio State wide receiver Jeremiah Smith, Alabama wide receiver Ryan Williams, Florida quarterback DJ Lagway and Penn State running back Nicholas Singleton. 

The EA CFB 26 photo is real and photoshoot happened today, sources tell @247Sports/@CBSSports. Several coaches involved, including Ryan Day and James Franklin. Some coaches don't yet know if they're in the game but as another source told me, why else would EA bring ‘em out? pic.twitter.com/JtzJ64emZI

EA Sports has yet to reveal any details about ""College Football 26,"" though it did confirm in January via social media that it will drop sometime in the summer. Previous entries in the series were typically released in July. 

EA revived its college football-based video game series, previously called ""NCAA Football,"" in 2024 after a hiatus spanning more than a decade. The cover for ""College Football 25"" featured Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers, Michigan running back Donovan Edwards and Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter, who won the 2024 Heisman Trophy. 

An overwhelming majority of players around the FBS opted into a name, image and likeness deal allowing them to be represented in the game itself. The cover athletes were also compensated for their appearance in promotional material.

Filed under:

Men's college basketball teams have received payouts for appearing in and playing in the NCAA Tournament since 1991. Now, the money is coming to the women's game.





Charlie Baker publicly set an expectation last year standing in the media workroom in Cleveland, Ohio's Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. Moments before tip-off in the national championship game for Division I women's college basketball between South Carolina and Iowa – a game that would shatter viewership records for the sport – the president of the NCAA told reporters that he wanted to see units awarded for the women's tournament in the next fiscal year.

“I can't imagine getting it done with the distributed decision-making process we have at the NCAA any faster,” Baker said. “And I think it will be the start of what ought to be a terrific remunerative benefit for teams that make the tournament and do well.”

To Baker's credit, he met his goal.

In January, the NCAA Division I membership voted unanimously — 292-0 — to create a unit payout system for teams that participate, and win, in the women's NCAA Division I basketball tournament. Put more simply, each of the 68 teams that play in this year's March Madness, for the first time ever in the women's game, will receive a cut of the money the NCAA makes off it. The more a team wins, the more it can earn.

A day after the NCAA announced its historic Women's Basketball Performance fund, Duke coach Kara Lawson was asked about the introduction of units into the women's game and what her former coach would've thought about it. While playing for the late, great Pat Summitt in the early 2000s, Lawson helped the Tennessee Lady Vols make three Final Fours. She is about to coach in her third NCAA Tournament with Duke next week, fresh off winning an ACC Tournament title.

“I think Coach Summit would've thought, ‘It's about time.' That's probably what she would've said. It's about time that everybody is starting to catch up to how great a sport this is, how many great programs we have, coaching figures and players,” Lawson said. “I think that's what she would've said, short and succinct: ‘What took y'all so long?'”

While the move by the NCAA was widely celebrated across the sport, there are many coaches who echoed the sentiment that Lawson expressed on Summitt's behalf.

The men's basketball tournament started paying out units in 1991. Why did it take 34 years longer for the women's game to get the same sort of financial investment?

“It's progress… I think the frustrating thing for me – because I've been in the game for a while – is that we're just now getting there for women. That should have happened a long time ago,” Georgia Tech coach Nell Fortner told SB Nation. “We've been held back, you know? And it's like, why would we do that? Why did that happen to us? This should have happened a long time ago, when the women's basketball Final Four started selling out. I mean, come on.”

Units finally arriving to the sport is the culmination of years of pressure from the loudest voices in women's basketball – from coaches to administrators – pressuring the NCAA for a prize money payout system for the sport's biggest event. The perfect storm to pave the way for it took place over the past few years.

The month that Baker, the former governor of Massachusetts, succeeded Mark Emmert as NCAA president was March 2023. That was the beginning of a memorable NCAA Tournament that ended with Caitlin Clark's Iowa meeting Angel Reese's LSU in Dallas in the national championship, smashing ratings records with a viewership of 12.3 million.

Several months later, in January 2024, the NCAA signed a new media rights deal with ESPN and Disney for its 40 Division I national championships outside of FBS football and men's basketball. While all the sports were lumped together, it valued women's basketball at $65 million annually – or about 57 percent of the total $920 million deal across eight years.

But many coaches wanted to see women's basketball spun off onto its own separate media rights deal. The 2021 Kaplan Report recommended that the women's basketball tournament be unbundled from this championship rights package with ESPN. The report also suggested that, if its media rights were sold separately – like football and men's basketball – that the women's basketball tournament could be worth between $81 and $112 million annually.

Instead of breaking women's basketball away from the rest of the championships and truly taking it to market for its own separate deal, the NCAA essentially used women's basketball as leverage – or a tax – to get more money from ESPN and Disney for the entire package. Simply put: It used women's basketball to prop up its unprofitable sports.

Fortner, 66, who has an Olympic gold medal and 15 seasons as a college head coach under her belt, figured the logical move was to separate women's basketball from the rest of the championships.

“I thought that was going to happen, and it was a little bit disappointing to see that it didn't. And I'm surprised that it didn't, that we weren't standalone,” Fortner said. “At least it's more than it was. We'll continue to prove ourselves, and that seems to be what we have to constantly be doing, and I think we constantly do it.”

The television contract keeps the women's Division I NCAA Tournament on ESPN platforms for the next eight years. Perhaps the next time the deal is up, the NCAA will spin off its women's basketball tournament as a separate property and take it to the open market to determine its true value.

Until then, the sport can celebrate units finally arriving. Courtney Banghart, the president of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association and head coach at North Carolina, sees this moment as a real milestone.

“It's critical. Like, you want to talk about value in women's basketball, then put some money on postseason success, right? And the fact that Charlie Baker took the gig and immediately made that happen is a big deal,” Banghart said. “I'm just glad for progress. And the progress is, we have units. And the progress is that women's basketball is being discussed in House settlement. That's progress.”

As the president of the WBCA, Banghart has been in the company of Baker a few times since his tenure as NCAA president began. She felt like her position in the WBCA gave her a microphone and a platform to advocate for the future of the sport.

“I just made sure that every time I was in a room with Charlie Baker, every time I was in a room with the NCAA, I just said units, over and over and over again. Competitive units, financial incentives – over and over,” Banghart told SB Nation. “I think when you keep hearing the same thing over and over again from someone who's been selected to lead the voice, you know, it's critical that I'm saying it in every room I'm in.”

Each year, the NCAA pays conferences in the men's basketball tournament based on how many teams it has in the field and how many wins it accumulates. So, for example, a low mid-major like the MEAC is guaranteed one unit for simply having a team appear in the tournament as an automatic qualifier. Further units – more often to teams from power conferences – are rewarded for additional at-large bids and games-played. In 2022, a men's basketball unit was worth $338,887. That season, the ACC had five teams in the tournament and those teams collectively won 13 games. So, the ACC was awarded 18 units, which will be paid out annually over the next six years for a grand total of about $36.6 million. In most conferences, that money is typically split evenly among the teams, while some schools who earn the unit might receive bonuses.

For women's basketball, the flow of money will begin with this year's tournament, with payouts – from a pool of $15 million – going out in the 2025-26 fiscal year. That figure will increase to $25 million in the 2027-28 season. The funds will then grow at about 2.9 percent per year, the same rate as all other Division I funds.

“I think continuing to capitalize on the momentum that our sport has gained the last, you know, 12 to 24 months really, it's positive. And then, continuing to reinvest in the sport, and continuing to show that, not only is it a revenue-producing sport, it's one that can continue to grow,” Lawson said. “So, the way I look at units is like reinvestment back into the game. And hopefully there's many other things on the horizon for the sport.”

For coaches like Lawson, Banghart and Fortner, a bit more is at stake because of the performance success initiatives set up by the ACC, which rewards schools for winning in the postseason in football and men's and women's basketball.

“Credit to our membership… They got ahead of this and designed the mechanics that in the event the NCAA starts to have payouts for women's basketball, the ACC would be in position to take advantage of that in this year,” ACC Deputy Commissioner Ben Tario recently explained to Duke radio host Chris Edwards. “Financial rewards will come not only to the conference, but to the institutions.”

Tario added: “That unit has a financial value, some of which will go into a conference pot, some of which will go to the institution that earns it.”

In short, how the units are divided and spent will not be created equal conference to conference. The value of the unit won't change, but a team in the ACC might earn more of it — because of the league's performance incentives — than teams in other conferences.

“It's pretty neat to know that, like we have in men's basketball, the better your team does, the more your school is going to be rewarded financially,” N.C. State coach Wes Moore said. “I guess that puts more pressure on coaches, right? You got to deliver. But I think it's really cool and it says a lot about how far our game has come and the talent level that has made it one of the top entertainment values out there.”

For many coaches at schools across the country, the hope is that the introduction of unit payouts will incentivize athletic departments and boosters to invest more in women's basketball.

What's that old saying? You got to spend money to make money?

“It's only going to enhance our world, where college athletics is changing. To get more resources pumped directly into women's basketball is critical,” Virginia Tech coach Megan Duffy said. “In a good way, it puts more pressure on our shoulders to produce. We got to get great teams and a great product on that floor to hold up our end of the bargain.”

Stanford coach Kate Paye added: “The opportunity to earn units – and hopefully more investment and transformational change is coming. People are excited about women's basketball. You see the investment at the collegiate level, the professional level. It's just going to continue to grow.”

Well, okay.

Bill Belichick's time at North Carolina is already proving quite unique. There's more attention on the football program than ever before, he's been approached about having the school become the first on Hard Knocks, and school officials are being asked to send everything intended for Bill to his 24-year-old girlfriend Jordan Hudson.

bill belichick asked unc staff to copy his girlfriend on every email they send him

On the one hand, I kind of get it. Answering email sucks, and I have to imagine Belichick enjoys answering administrative questions about as much as dating someone born before his first Super Bowl win. 

Might as well delegate that crap so he can focus on football and not “FB social media and web content 12/16” which I have to imagine Bill saw the subject and threw his phone against the wall because he hates every single word in that sentence.

It's definitely a little odd to use your girlfriend like a secretary, but to each their own, I guess.

Filed under:

Alperen Şengün's wild assist is full of Nikola Jokic's influence.

The Houston Rockets are one of the best stories of the NBA season. When the franchise hired head coach Ime Udoka ahead of last season, Houston was coming off three horrendous campaigns where they won 17 games, 20 games, and 22 games respectively. Udokda was hired to accelerate their post-James Harden rebuild, and he's done that despite not having a true superstar.

The closest thing the Rockets have to a star player in Alperen Şengün, who was named an All-Star for the first time in his career this year. The Rockets selected the Turkish big man with the No. 16 overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft after he won MVP in his country's domestic league at just 18 years old. Şengün always had some special talent with the ball in his hands, and Udoka has molded him into a serviceable defensive center who can stay on the floor in big moments.

Şengün has obviously watched a lot of Nikola Jokic growing up. You can see Jokic's fingerprints all over Şengün's game, and it especially shows up in his confidence passing the ball. As the Rockets faced the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night, Şengün threw one of the best passes of the season, looking like something straight out of the Jokic playbook with a little extra flair for the dramatic. 

Watch Şengün's pass here:

NO LOOK. BEHIND THE BACK. UNREAL, ALPEREN SENGUN! https://t.co/W9fQ6OQrfu pic.twitter.com/ULfVSEGkCZ

Jokic's passing is more functional than flashy, but Şengün is adding a little extra sauce to his dimes. This is a wild delivery that led to two points in a win for the Rockets. Having cutters as athletic as Tari Eason sure helps a big man who likes to pass.

Houston beat the Suns, 111-104, to keep pace in the Western Conference standings.

Houston was holding down the No. 2 seed in the West for much of this season, and they still have a decent shot at it with under 20 games left to play. The Rockets improved to 41-25 overall after beating the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night, which ties their win total from last year. No one would have expected Udoka to lead the Rockets to 50+ wins just two years after getting hired, yet they're poised to accomplish that and more this season.

Şengün has talked about how Jokic is his idol. You can see the impression he's left in his game even if he's never going to be anywhere in his vicinity as a player. It's so cool to see how the greats influence the next generation, and Jokic has done that with Şengün.

Liverpool great Jamie Carragher believes the Reds can exploit a major problem in Newcastle United's style of play ahead of the Carabao Cup Final this weekend. The former Reds defender was on punditry duty on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football and took a closer look at some of the goals the Magpies had conceded in recent weeks.

Eddie Howe's men were one of the in-form sides in the Premier League over the festive period, but have lacked consistency after securing their place in the impending showpiece. That has led to Carragher making a key point.

""I think the narrative around Newcastle will be, are their heads on the Carabao Cup Final?"" Carragher asked ahead of the Magpies' 1-0 win over West Ham. ""You look at this result here, the Arsenal game...

""They beat Arsenal over two legs 4-0, then Birmingham, they they win, but they're conceding goals. Over their five games since the Arsenal game, they've conceded 13 goals and we can see the numbers there. That'll be a big worry for them, not just tonight but at the weekend against the top team in the country.""

Arne Slot's side have already beaten the Magpies twice this season and they will be the favourites going into the Wembley finale. Carragher then went on to highlight an area Liverpool can potentially exploit.

Carragher added: ""When you look at some of the goals they've conceded of late, you can't help but think subconsciously, at the back of their minds, they're not fully at it. Now the team they're playing next week [Liverpool], they go to Anfield, of course it's a tough place to go and lose 2-0.

""The result's not the end of the world in losing 2-0, but the lack of intensity. This is just not Newcastle. Mac Allister has picked the ball up in his own box, no challenge here on Jota, Diaz is allowed to run right up into the box, again no challenge. That is not the Newcastle I know under Eddie Howe.

""Then you've got six players in the box, six Newcastle defenders, two attackers here completely free. And that can't happen at this level, or any level of football. The ball goes into Szoboszlai and it's not even the greatest strike in the world, to be honest, the goalkeeper probably should do better.

""There was a game a few weeks ago against Nottingham Forest, they were blistering in the first half, outstanding. But they allowed Forest to come back into the game, and almost leave the game with the feeling that they'd lost. Even though they got three points.

""This isn't even a good corner [Anderson's cross for Forest's second goal] it's not even a good ball back in. It looks scruffy and it's just not right. People aren't on it, they're not alive, they're not switched on. This is only a few weeks ago and thinking about how they're going to play tonight and at the weekend, Eddie Howe likes his team man-for-man across the pitch and be really aggressive.

""You see that everyone has got their man and the reason I'm mentioning is because a lot of teams do this and it's something that we'll get into with Russell [Martin] later in dealing with that and the goalkeeper being the free man. But with the defenders that they've got especially with some of the injuries, Trippier into his 30s, Dan Burn the same and Schar the same, can these players cope with being man-to-man with some of the best players in the Premier League on the halfway line with space in behind?

""Now we know Ederson is fantastic [with the ball at his feet] and it's actually Trippier who gets caught out here by Marmoush and that ball over the top. That's definitely a problem for them now certainly with some of the problems they've got at the back with Botman being out. Lewis Hall out as well, that's something to keep an eye on tonight against West Ham.""","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Eurosport UK'}"

""A third in a row would put him into a very select category of greats.""

Looking at the odds for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, it isn't obvious that Galopin Des Champs is bidding to do something so rare.

Only four horses, including the legendary Arkle and Best Mate, have ever won a hat-trick of Gold Cups.

And yet the Willie Mullins-trained horse is the odds-on favourite for Friday's Gold Cup, which goes off at 16:00 GMT, and meaningful challengers seem thin on the ground.

So what makes Galopin Des Champs so special?

""I think he's got just lots of heart,"" Mullins told BBC Sport at his sprawling Closutton stables in County Carlow.

""He's obviously got athletic ability, he's better than average. But when push comes to shove in those last two furlongs, when you've got to dig deep, this guy seems to have reserves of energy.

""And it's also mental. It's his heart. He just gets down, you know, when the going gets tough, the tough get going and that's what he is. He's tough.""

Mullins has more than 200 horses in training, and over the past 35 years has trained some stars of the sport.

But he said Galopin Des Champs - affectionately nicknamed ""the good one"" by stable staff - will rank as the best of them all if he wins the Cheltenham Festival showpiece on Friday.

""I've had some wonderful horses here. If he does the treble, we'll probably have to give him that accolade, but until then we'll wait,"" said Mullins, 68.

But does he know how good he is?

""The more he wins, the more bigger he gets in himself,"" said Galopin's groom Adam Connolly. ""You'll be trying to wash him off and he'll be kicking and biting at you. And as the season goes on, he gets a bit bigger and he knows anyway.""

Cheltenham Gold Cup full racecard

Eight horses will be trying to deny Galopin Des Champs on Friday, as the nine-year-old bids to become the first triple winner since Best Mate in 2004.

December's King George VI Chase winner Banbridge is the closest rival according to the market, while the third favourite is the market leader in the Grand National - Inothewayurthinkin - whose owner JP McManus paid £25,000 to enter him for the Gold Cup.

There are only three British-trained runners - Ahoy Senor, The Real Whacker and Royale Pagaille - and they are all outsiders.

Mullins knows the hat-trick won't be easy, having come up just short when attempting the feat with Al Boum Photo, who won the race in 2019 and 2020 but finished third in 2021 and sixth in 2022.

However, no-one knows how to train a Cheltenham Festival winner better than Mullins, who celebrated a century of them last year and is the leading trainer so far this week.

Galopin Des Champs stormed to a seven-length victory in 2023, and defended his crown last year despite having to contend with the unwelcome presence of a loose horse.

Retired jockey Barry Geraghty, who rode 43 Cheltenham Festival winners, is confident he has what it takes to win it again.

""He's an absolutely brilliant horse. He's won good Gold Cups and has won them with authority as well,"" he told BBC Sport.

""There's no concern about his form this year. As a nine-year-old, he still looks to retain all of his ability and his runs leading into Cheltenham have been of a very high standard.

""If the same Galopin Des Champs turns up this year, he's going to be very hard to beat.

""He'll already be remembered as a high-class winner of the Gold Cup, as he's already in an elite club having retained it, but a third in a row would put him into a very select category of greats.""

Mullins said he believes Galopin Des Champs is in better form than in previous years but will face stiffer competition as he tries to emulate some of racing's all-time greats.

So perhaps it will all come down to the ""lucky charm"" that has been brought over from Ireland - a red football in his stable.

Our Champions League Awards honour the best – and worst – of the midweek European action, featuring the Madrid derby and Gianluigi Donnarumma.

Atletico Madrid just can't exorcise their demons against Real Madrid. For the fifth time the capital clubs met in the Champions League and, for the fifth time, Real Madrid progressed. It's often been agonising for Atletico and this was no different. Conor Gallagher's goal inside 27 seconds saw The Metropolitano erupt as Atletico levelled the tie, one unable to be separated across 210 minutes of action.

As was the case in the 2016 final between the teams, penalties decided the outcome. Again, Atletico fell short. Julian Alvarez's spot-kick was dramatically ruled out as the Argentine slipped on contact, deemed to have touched the ball twice before it hit the net.

Though Jan Oblak saved from Lucas Vazquez, Marcos Llorente hit his effort against the bar for Atleti. Antonio Rudiger settled the shootout – and tie – to keep Real Madrid's dream of a 16th European title alive. Atletico's ambitions ended again by their fiercest rivals.

Player of the Week

Gianluigi Donnarumma had his critics after Paris Saint-German's defeat to Liverpool last week. While Alisson was extraordinary at the other end to frustrate the French champions, Donnarumma failed to get a strong enough hand to Harvey Elliott's smash-and-grab winner.

The Italian answered those critics at Anfield. An engrossing game saw the two teams trade blows throughout on Merseyside, with Donnarumma equal to anything Liverpool threw at him. He relieved pressure with six aerial claims, before standing tall to decide the shootout.

 

Saves from Darwin Nunez and Curtis Jones sent PSG into the quarter-finals and few will fancy facing Luis Enrique's side in the latter stages. For Donnarumma, it was another unforgettable evening in England, after his heroics for Italy during the Euro 2020 final at Wembley. He's now faced 12 penalties in shootouts in England, with seven saved or missed.

We have not seen anything like Lamine Yamal before. Not at this age. Not Lionel Messi. Not Cristiano Ronaldo. Perhaps not even Pele, given the different era, despite World Cup success at 17.

It's easy to forget that Yamal does not turn 18 until July. He's already approaching 60 goals and assists for club and country. He's won a major international tournament. La Liga and, perhaps, the Champions League could follow before that 18th birthday.

The youngest player to score and assist in a Champions League game this week, he helped Barcelona book their place in the last eight. Another moment of magic to savour from the teenager.

It's not too often January signings hit the ground running but Marco Asensio has done just that. Two goals against Club Brugge took The Villans into the Champions League quarter-finals and made it seven in all competitions since his loan arrival from PSG.

Time to open talks over a permanent deal?

President Donald Trump's health officials want you to take your vitamins.

Mehmet Oz, the nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has fed calves on camera to tout the health wonders of bovine colostrum on behalf of one purveyor in which he has a financial stake. Janette Nesheiwat, the potential surgeon general, sells her own line of supplements.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services, said he takes more vitamins than he can count — and has suggested he'll ease restrictions on vitamins, muscle-building peptides, and more.

Their affection for supplements might lead to tangible consequences for Americans' health regimens. Late in the 2024 campaign, Kennedy claimed the federal government was waging a ""war on public health"" by suppressing a vast array of alternative therapies — many of them supplements, like nutraceuticals and peptides.

In February, Trump announced the ""President's Make America Healthy Again Commission"" with Kennedy at the helm, calling for ""fresh thinking"" on nutrition, ""healthy lifestyles,"" and other pathways toward combating chronic disease. Spokespeople for Kennedy did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

Supplements can be beneficial, particularly in aiding fetal development or warding off anemia, said Pieter Cohen, a general internist at the Cambridge Health Alliance, who researches supplements. ""I recommend supplements routinely,"" he said.

Still, ""the majority of use is not necessary to improve or maintain health,"" and due to only light regulations, supplement makers may make claims about their benefits without sufficient evidence, Cohen said. ""No supplement needs to get tested or vetted by the FDA before it's sold.""

Consumer watchdogs, regulators, and researchers have reported cases of finding traces of lead and other toxins in supplements. And a 2015 analysis from a team of federal health researchers attributed about 23,000 emergency department visits annually to supplement use. (The Council for Responsible Nutrition, the industry's lobbying group, challenged the findings, arguing some visits were due to over-the-counter and homeopathic medicines that should not have been included.)

Nevertheless, many Americans are ready to buy in. Internet forums populated by biohackers, weight lifters, and enthusiasts of alternative medicine, along with supplement producers, applauded Kennedy's elevation to health secretary. Many express hopes that he'll loosen what they perceive as unwarranted restrictions on these products.

The Natural Products Association saluted Trump's health nominees as a victory for ""health freedom.""

""For the first time in our industry's history, the top healthcare political appointees think it is important that Americans have the right to use nutritional supplements,"" wrote Kyle Turk, the association's vice president for government affairs.

The worlds of supplement users and the Trump team overlap substantially when it comes to being skeptical of the traditional health system.

Supplement use is part of ""a broadening sort of health populist movement,"" said Callum Hood, the head of research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that researches online disinformation, pointing to influencers who criticize conventional public health measures and offer alternatives like supplements, powders, or peptides.

To many supplement enthusiasts, Kennedy's views align with theirs — particularly his dislike for Big Pharma and Big Food, which he characterizes as corrupt, profiting from Americans' ill health.

Kennedy promotes supplements as a key part of good health. In a prerecorded interview aired this month, amid a growing measles outbreak that started in West Texas, he said doctors had had ""very, very good results"" by treating those patients with cod liver oil, which can be delivered in pill form, along with a steroid and an antibiotic. (Separately, he wrote in a Fox News op-ed that parents should discuss the vaccine with their doctors, adding, ""The decision to vaccinate is a personal one."")

""What we're trying to do is really to restore faith in government and to make sure that we are there to help them with their needs and not particularly to dictate what they ought to be doing,"" Kennedy said in a Fox News interview.

Kennedy spoke of federal officials delivering vitamin A to affected communities — a treatment he pushed in past remarks as chairman of the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense.

""What is the cure for measles?"" he told an audience in 2021 at an Amish country fair in Pennsylvania. ""Chicken soup and vitamin A. And neither of those things can be patented.""

The World Health Organization advises people who contract measles to take vitamin A, which can prevent blindness and death — but it also strongly urges all children be vaccinated against the disease.

While the image of natural wellness has long evoked organic supermarket-patronizing, liberal types, supplement use is bipartisan — and now slightly more popular with Republicans. A December poll from Ipsos and Axios found that 63% of Republicans take supplements daily or most days, versus 58% of independents and 52% of Democrats.

Supplement companies sometimes explicitly court right-wing customers. In the days before Trump's inauguration, the brand Nugenix posted an ad on the social platform X for its testosterone supplement with the president's trademark red hat perched on the bottle, bearing the slogan ""Make Your T-Levels Great Again."" (Adaptive Health, Nugenix's parent company, did not respond to requests for comment.)

Some industry observers think the shift rightward happened during the pandemic. ""During the covid era, Democrats became the party of science and establishment,"" said John Roulac, a California-based supplements entrepreneur. In his telling, the party and especially its elected officials were more likely to trust the FDA and other big institutions — and to discount any potential contribution to health from supplements.

""Under RFK, you have people associated less with pharmaceutical drugs and more with healthier lifestyle choices, whether that's eating organic food or using herbs or taking vitamins,"" Roulac said.

Kennedy and others in Trump's orbit have found a particularly warm reception among some of the biggest supplement evangelists: influencers, who often promote personal responsibility, in the form of vitamins and other products, as the key to health — and have provided plenty of airtime in recent years for Trump's newly minted health officials.

On popular podcast host Lex Fridman's show in 2023, Kennedy accepted praise for being in ""great shape"" and attributed it, in part, to his vitamin regimen. ""I take a lot of vitamins,"" he said. ""I can't even list them to you here because I couldn't even remember them at all.""

In November, Oz endorsed Kennedy's nomination on his TikTok channel — and then, in his next post, told viewers they need “an alphabet soup"" of vitamins to protect their brains and power their organs.

Oz, who at the time had not yet been named to lead CMS, pointed viewers to a ""trusted source"" of vitamins: iHerb.

Federal ethics rules generally bar public officials from using their office for financial gain. Last month, in a letter to the health agency's ethics official, Oz disclosed that he is an adviser to iHerb and holds a financial stake in the company. He wrote that, if he is confirmed, he plans to resign and divest from iHerb, as well as recuse himself from policy matters directly involving the company ""until I have divested.""

Oz's Senate confirmation hearing is scheduled for March 14. A spokesperson for Oz did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

Nesheiwat, Trump's pick for surgeon general, has touted BC Boost, a combination of vitamins promising to toughen one's immune system and rev energy. The supplement — which advertising claims was formulated by Nesheiwat herself — bears her name and portrait on the package.

""After years of educating my patients, now I made it a little easier to get all the nutrition you need to live strong and stay healthy,"" reads a marketing quote attributed to Nesheiwat.

The surgeon general, considered ""the nation's doctor,"" does not set policy but rather acts as a spokesperson for public health. During the Biden administration, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy outlined the ills from alcohol, loneliness, and social media.

Nesheiwat, whose financial disclosures are not yet public, did not reply to an inquiry to her website, nor did an HHS spokesperson reply to a request for comment.

It's unclear what moves the administration might take to boost supplements. Industry officials say they hope the government will make it easier for everyday consumers to use health savings accounts to buy vitamins and other products. The FDA could also decide to allow manufacturers to make more aggressive claims about their wares' health benefits.

Contrary to Kennedy's claim of a ""war on public health,"" in recent years the supplements industry has seen its fortunes grow, and attempts to increase regulations have fallen short amid pressure from supplement makers.

According to the Nutrition Business Journal, revenues for the supplement industry surged during the pandemic, as customers became ""more invested in their health,"" said Journal analyst Erika Craft. Revenues have continued to increase since then, outpacing earlier industry expectations and boosting product sales to some $70 billion per year, she told KFF Health News.

One FDA attempt to put more stringent regulations — like registration — on businesses, during the 1990s, was defeated soundly after the industry and its clients lobbied Congress.

""It was one of the largest campaigns to Congress imaginable,"" David Kessler, the FDA commissioner at the time, said in an oral history.

Grace Sparks, a survey analyst at KFF, the health policy research, polling, and news organization that includes KFF Health News, provided research assistance for the Ipsos-Axios poll.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net","Can House Republicans cut $880 billion without slashing Medicaid? It's likely impossible.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250313/Can-House-Republicans-cut-24880-billion-without-slashing-Medicaid-Ite28099s-likely-impossible.aspx","Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:52:00 GMT","

The prospect of deep Medicaid cuts has become a flashpoint in Congress, with leaders of both parties accusing their counterparts of lying.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Feb. 27 that a Republican budget measure would “set in motion the largest cut to Medicaid in American history,” and that Republicans are hiding the consequences.

“The Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid,” Jeffries said. “I can't say it any other way. Republicans are lying. Prove me wrong.”

Republicans said Democrats were distorting the Republican budget. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) said, “The word 'Medicaid' is not even in this bill.” House Speaker Mike Johnson said on CNN that Republicans don't want to cut Medicaid, “and the Democrats have been lying about it.”

Republicans are looking for massive budget savings to meet their goal of fully extending President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. This is a separate process from Congress' need to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running by March 14 or face a federal government shutdown.

Here's what we know so far about potential Medicaid cuts.

Medicaid serves about 1 in 5 Americans. The health care program for low-income people is paid for by the federal government and partly by states. Louisiana, home to Johnson and Scalise, has one of the highest state proportions of Medicaid enrollees.

The House Republican budget plan adopted Feb. 25 opens the door to slashing Medicaid, even though it doesn't name the program. The plan directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find ways to cut the deficit by at least $880 billion over the next decade.

The committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid, Medicare, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, in addition to much smaller programs. CHIP offers low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid.

Republicans ruled out cuts to Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors that leaders cut at their political peril. Medicare is about 15% of the federal budget, and Medicaid is about 8.6%.

When Medicare is set aside, Medicaid accounts for 93% of the funding under the committee's jurisdiction, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found in a March 5 analysis. That means it is impossible for the committee to find enough cuts that don't affect Medicaid.

“It's a fantasy to imply that federal Medicaid assistance won't be cut very deeply,” said Allison Orris, an expert on Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.

After Medicaid, the next-largest program under the committee's jurisdiction is CHIP. Lawmakers don't appear to be planning to wipe out CHIP, but even if they did, they would be only a “fraction of the way there,” said Joan Alker, an expert on Medicaid and CHIP at Georgetown University.

If Medicare cuts are off the table, the only way to achieve $880 billion in savings is through big Medicaid cuts, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, the health policy research, polling, and news organization that includes KFF Health News.

Andy Schneider, a professor at Georgetown University who served in the Obama administration as a senior adviser at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said even if the committee eliminated all those “other” programs entirely it could achieve only $381 billion in savings — about 43% of the target.

“In short, if they don't want to cut Medicaid [or CHIP], and they don't want to cut Medicare, the goal of cutting $880 billion is impossible,” Schneider said.

The $880 billion cut is not a done deal. House Republicans were able to pass their budget package, but Senate Republicans are taking a different approach, without proposing such significant cuts.

Any finalized budget blueprint would need Senate Republicans' buy-in. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is among Republicans who have spoken against potential cuts; he told HuffPost, “I would not do severe cuts to Medicaid.”

The numbers are starting points that may lead to negotiation among at least Republicans, said Joseph Antos, a health care expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “We are a long way from final legislation, so it's not possible to predict how much any program will be cut,” he said.

“If the bill also includes extending the [Trump 2017] tax cuts, we are probably months away from seeing real language,” Antos said.

Once the House and Senate have reached an agreement on language and the resolution passes both chambers, the committees will work on detailed cuts. To enact such cuts, both chambers would need to approve a separate bill and receive Trump's signature.

Republican leaders have deflected concerns about Medicaid cuts by talking about a different target: Medicaid fraud.

“I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there,” Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 9, in keeping with his campaign rhetoric that he would protect those programs.

At the same time, Trump on his Truth Social platform praised the House resolution that would make cuts highly likely: “The House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!”

Would eliminating fraud solve the Medicaid problem? No.

On CNN, Johnson said cutting fraud, waste, and abuse would result in “part of the savings to accomplish this mission.” He said the government loses $50 billion a year in Medicaid payments “just in fraud alone.”

Johnson conflated “fraud” with “improper payments.” The Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, found about $50 billion in improper payments in Medicaid and the same amount in Medicare in fiscal 2023.

Those improper payments were made in an incorrect amount (overpayment or underpayment), should not have been made at all, or had missing or insufficient documentation. But that doesn't mean that there was $50 billion in Medicaid fraud, which would involve obtaining something through willful misrepresentation.

The system used to identify improper payments is not designed to measure fraud, so we don't know what percentage of improper payments were losses due to fraud, said Schneider, the former Obama administration health adviser.

Plus, it's a drop in the overall bucket of the potential $880 billion in cuts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net","Hospital gun-violence prevention programs may be caught in US funding crossfire","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250313/Hospital-gun-violence-prevention-programs-may-be-caught-in-US-funding-crossfire.aspx","Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:14:00 GMT","

Seven years ago, Erica Green learned through a Facebook post that her brother had been shot.

She rushed to check on him at a hospital run by Denver Health, the city's safety-net system, but she was unable to get information from emergency room workers, who complained that she was creating a disturbance.

""I was distraught and outside, crying, and Jerry came out of the front doors,"" she said.

Jerry Morgan is a familiar face from Green's Denver neighborhood. He had rushed to the hospital after his pager alerted him to the shooting. As a violence prevention professional with the At-Risk Intervention and Mentoring program, or AIM, Morgan supports gun-violence patients and their families at the hospital — as he did the day Green's brother was shot.

""It made the situation of that traumatic experience so much better. After that, I was, like, I want to do this work,"" Green said.

Today, Green works with Morgan as the program manager for AIM, a hospital-linked violence intervention program launched in 2010 as a partnership between Denver Health and the nonprofit Denver Youth Program. It since has expanded to include Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado Hospital.

AIM is one of dozens of hospital-linked violence intervention programs around the country. The programs aim to uncover the social and economic factors that contributed to someone ending up in the ER with a bullet wound: inadequate housing, job loss, or feeling unsafe in one's neighborhood, for example.

Such programs that take a public health approach to stopping gun violence have had success — one in San Francisco reported a fourfold reduction in violent injury recidivism rates over six years. But President Donald Trump's executive orders calling for the review of the Biden administration's gun policies and trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans have created uncertainty around the programs' long-term federal funding. Some organizers believe their programs will be just fine, but others are looking to shore up alternative funding sources.

""We've been worried about, if a domino does fall, how is it going to impact us? There's a lot of unknowns,"" said John Torres, associate director for Youth Alive, an Oakland, California-based nonprofit.

Federal data shows that gun violence became a leading cause of death among children and young adults at the start of this decade and was tied to more than 48,000 deaths among people of all ages in 2022. New York-based pediatric trauma surgeon Chethan Sathya, a National Institutes of Health-funded firearms injury prevention researcher, believes those statistics show that gun violence can't be ignored as a health care issue. ""It's killing so many people,"" Sathya said.

Research shows that a violent injury puts someone at heightened risk for future ones, and the risk of death goes up significantly by the third violent injury, according to a 2006 study published in The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection and Critical Care.

Benjamin Li, an emergency medicine physician at Denver Health and the health system's AIM medical director, said the ER is an ideal setting to intervene in gun violence by working to reverse-engineer what led to a patient's injuries.

""If you are just seeing the person, patching them up, and then sending them right back into the exact same circumstances, we know it's going to lead to them being hurt again,"" Li said. ""It's critical we address the social determinants of health and then try to change the equation.""

That might mean providing alternative solutions to gunshot victims who might otherwise seek retaliation, said Paris Davis, the intervention programs director for Youth Alive.

""If that's helping them relocate out of the area, if that's allowing them to gain housing, if that's shifting that energy into education or job or, you know, family therapy, whatever the needs are for that particular case and individual, that is what we provide,"" Davis said.

AIM outreach workers meet gunshot wound victims at their hospital bedsides to have what Morgan, AIM's lead outreach worker, calls a tough, nonjudgmental conversation on how the patients ended up there.

AIM uses that information to help patients access the resources they need to navigate their biggest challenges after they're discharged, Morgan said. Those challenges can include returning to school or work, or finding housing. AIM outreach workers might also attend court proceedings and assist with transportation to health care appointments.

""We try to help in whatever capacity we can, but it's interdependent on whatever the client needs,"" Morgan said.

Since 2010, AIM has grown from three full-time outreach workers to nine, and this year opened the REACH Clinic in Denver's Five Points neighborhood. The community-based clinic provides wound-care kits; physical therapy; and behavioral, mental and occupational health care. In the coming months, it plans to add bullet removal to its services. It's part of a growing movement of community-based clinics focused on violent injuries, including the Bullet Related Injury Clinic in St. Louis.

Ginny McCarthy, an assistant professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Colorado, described REACH as an extension of the hospital-based work, providing holistic treatment in a single location and building trust between health care providers and communities of color that have historically experienced racial biases in medical care.

Caught in the Crossfire, created in 1994 and run by Youth Alive in Oakland, is cited as the nation's first hospital-linked violence intervention program and has since inspired others. The Health Alliance for Violence Intervention, a national network initiated by Youth ALIVE to advance public health solutions to gun violence, counted 74 hospital-linked violence intervention programs among its membership as of January.

The alliance's executive director, Fatimah Loren Dreier, compared medicine's role in addressing gun violence to that of preventing an infectious disease, like cholera. ""That disease spreads if you don't have good sanitation in places where people aggregate,"" she said.

Dreier, who also serves as executive director of the Kaiser Permanente Center for Gun Violence Research and Education, said medicine identifies and tracks patterns that lead to the spread of a disease or, in this case, the spread of violence.

""That is what health care can do really well to shift society. When we deploy this, we get better outcomes for everybody,"" Dreier said.

The alliance, of which AIM is a member, offers technical assistance and training for hospital-linked violence intervention programs and successfully petitioned to make their services eligible for traditional insurance reimbursement.

In 2021, President Joe Biden issued an executive action that opened the door for states to use Medicaid for violence prevention. Several states, including California, New York, and Colorado, have passed legislation establishing a Medicaid benefit for hospital-linked violence intervention programs.

Last summer, then-U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared gun violence a public health crisis, and the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act earmarked $1.4 billion in funding for a wide array of violence-prevention programs through next year.

But in early February, Trump issued an executive order instructing the U.S. attorney general to conduct a 30-day review of a number of Biden's policies on gun violence. The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention now appears to be defunct, and recent moves to freeze federal grants created uncertainty among the gun-violence prevention programs that receive federal funding.

AIM receives 30% of its funding from its operating agreement with Denver's Office of Community Violence Solutions, according to Li. The rest is from grants, including Victims of Crime Act funding, through the Department of Justice. As of mid-February, Trump's executive orders had not affected AIM's current funding.

Some who work with the hospital-linked violence prevention programs in Colorado are hoping a new voter-approved firearms and ammunition excise tax in the state, expected to generate about $39 million annually and support victim services, could be a new source of funding. But the tax's revenues aren't expected to fully flow until 2026, and it's not clear how that money will be allocated.

Trauma surgeon and public health researcher Catherine Velopulos, who is the AIM medical director at the University of Colorado hospital in Aurora, said any interruption in federal funding, even for a few months, would be ""very difficult for us."" But Velopulos said she was reassured by the bipartisan support for the kind of work AIM does.

""People want to oversimplify the problem and just say, 'If we get rid of guns, it's all going to stop,' or 'It doesn't matter what we do, because they're going to get guns, anyway,'"" she said. ""What we really have to address is why people feel so scared that they have to arm themselves.”

An estimated 80% of women have some type of menopause symptoms — and the more symptoms they experience, the greater the chances of developing dementia later in life.

The findings were published in the journal PLOS One following a study by the University of Calgary.

The researchers analyzed the data of 896 postmenopausal women who participated in the Canadian Platform for Research Online to Investigate Health, Quality of Life, Cognition, Behaviour, Function, and Caregiving in Aging (CAN-PROTECT) study.

4 Key Women's Health Issues That Have Been Neglected, Expert Says

The women reported their perimenopausal symptoms to researchers. Their cognitive function was measured using the Everyday Cognition (ECog-II) Scale and the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C), with higher scores indicating greater severity.

Those with greater menopausal symptoms had higher scores for both cognitive tests, indicating more severe decline.

""One of the most interesting findings was the association between menopausal symptom burden and mild behavioral impairment (MBI) symptoms — a syndrome increasingly recognized as an early indicator of dementia risk,"" lead study author Zahinoor Ismail, M.D., professor of psychiatry, neurology, epidemiology and pathology at the University of Calgary, told Fox News Digital.

""These novel findings highlight the need to consider not only cognitive changes, but also mood, social interaction and personality changes that emerge and persist in later life following menopause.""

While hormone therapy was not significantly associated with cognitive function, it was shown to have a significant link to fewer MBI symptoms, according to the researchers, emphasizing the need for further research into the potential role of hormone therapy in long-term brain health.

""Interestingly, participants who reported using estrogen-based hormone therapy during perimenopause had significantly lower mild behavioral impairment symptom severity,"" noted Ismail.

Alexa Fiffick, a board-certified family medicine physician specializing in menopause, stated that previous data has shown higher symptom burden is somehow related to decreased cognitive function and possibly dementia.

Some studies have shown that even when hot flashes aren't perceived by the woman, they are still associated with worsened cognitive function, according to the Ohio doctor.

Testosterone Therapy Could Help Boost Women's Sex Drive As They Age, But Risks Exist, Experts Say

""It is believed that the vasomotor symptoms are correlated with development of white matter hyperintensities in the brain, akin to what vascular dementia looks like on imaging,"" Fiffick, who was not involved in the new study, told Fox News Digital.

""We have yet to obtain the data that treating VMS will prevent cognitive decline, but are hopeful that with menopausal hormone therapy and other non-hormonal options, we may be able to obtain this data in the near future.""

The researchers acknowledged several limitations of the study.

""This study is cross-sectional, meaning it captures a snapshot in time rather than tracking changes over the years,"" Ismail told Fox News Digital.

This means it can only identify associations between menopause symptoms and cognitive and behavioral health, but cannot determine whether the symptoms directly cause the changes in brain health.

""To better understand the long-term impact of menopause on dementia risk, future research should follow participants over time and incorporate biological data, such as hormone levels and brain-related biomarkers (we are, in fact, doing this now),"" Ismail added.

The study also did not assess the severity of the symptoms, which could play a key role in understanding risk.

Another limitation is that the study focused on the most commonly reported menopause symptoms, but it's possible that some participants experienced additional symptoms.

""In fact, it's reported that there may be 30+ symptoms that females may experience when undergoing the menopause transition,"" said Ismail. ""While we included an ‘other symptoms' category, it may not fully reflect the range of experiences.""

The study also did not distinguish between different types and formulations of hormone therapy.

""Future studies will be able to explore whether specific types of HT have different effects on brain health,"" Ismail noted.

Tamsen Fadal, a New York menopause expert and author of the upcoming book ""How to Menopause: Take Charge of Your Health, Reclaim Your Life, and Feel Even Better than Before,"" said she was not surprised by the results of the study.

""Research has been pointing to this connection for a while,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Brain scans of women in menopause reveal real structural and metabolic changes, and this study reinforces that we can't just brush these symptoms off as ‘normal aging.'""

""For too long, women have been experiencing brain fog, memory lapses and mood changes, and many of us have been dismissed,"" Fadal went on.

""This research just reinforces that menopause is a neurological shift as much as it is a hormonal one.""

Love Is Blind personality Sara Carton is responding to rampant speculation that she has been dating costar Joey Leveille since their respective breakups.

“I've seen this a few times online in the past 24 hours,” Sara, 29, said on the Thursday, March 13, episode of “The Viall Files” podcast. “Well, to be clear, me and Joey are not dating.”



Sara and Joey, 36, were both participants on season 8 of Love Is Blind, which was filmed in Minneapolis in spring 2024 and aired on Netflix last month. They each found love sight unseen with Ben Mezzenga and Monica Danus, respectively. After whirlwind engagements, both couples broke up at the altar.

“There was a love square between me, Monica, Ben and Joey. We were all talking to each other until the second to last day in the pods,” Sara recalled on Thursday. “Of course, naturally in that circumstance, you do connect with people. I feel like me and Joey did establish a really great friendship.”

According to Sara, she “didn't really talk” to Joey further until “five months” post-production.

“[Joey] and five other people visited me in Nashville and we called ourselves the ‘Yee-Haw Crew,' like, it's such a good time,” Sara said. “We grew really, really close with each other just because of the support for each other, knowing what we've all been through and being able to be there for one another. It's been super important to me.”

She continued, “This whole situation, I've felt very close with Joey. I'm fond of our relationship, but I [also] feel very well-supported by all those involved. I'm just very grateful that I've met him, but, yeah, we definitely have a friendship. We're definitely not dating.”

As to whether a potential romance could eventually unfold between the two pals, Sara played coy.

“I don't know what the future will hold,” Sara teased. “But, I do know for right now, I definitely have no capacity to even think about a relationship.”

In addition to her friendship with Joey, the nurse has been able to lean on her family while navigating her broken engagement. (In the end, Sara called off her nuptials to Ben over fundamental political and religious differences.)

“I couldn't have done it without them. And also my brother, my mom and stepdad, they were my rocks. I cannot state how much I appreciate them for being there for me,” Sara exclusively told Us Weekly ahead of the March 9 finale. “[My sister], Lisa, and [her partner], Kelsie, they're very rational people and that helps me keep grounded. Sometimes I'm, like, all about the fantasies and being spontaneous and having fun and they helped me a lot, especially with this scenario putting it all in context.”

She added, “They helped me feel OK that it may not be my person and that's OK — even though I so badly wanted it to be my person and have this beautiful thing work for me.”

Love Is Blind is currently streaming on Netflix.

Everyone in the Southern Charm cast knows about Molly O'Connell's feelings for Shep Rose — and even his ex-girlfriend Taylor Ann Green is cool with their potential romance.

After Shep, 42, and Sienna Evans seemingly called it quits during the March 6 episode of the Bravo series, several cast members pushed Molly, 37, to try and shoot her shot while still in the Bahamas. (Shep and Sienna dated for several months in 2024 before their romance fizzled out that November.)



Molly, however, wasn't a fan of the pressure. Once she returned to Charleston, she turned to Taylor, 30, in hopes of gleaning a little guidance.

“I'm not, like, in love with Shep or anything,” Molly tells Taylor in Us Weekly's exclusive sneak peek at the Thursday, March 13, episode of Southern Charm. “Everybody's like, ‘You should go for Shep.' I kinda feel like I'm in middle school.”

Taylor confesses, “It just seemed a little forced,” which is similar to how Molly says she felt in the moment.

“It's embarrassing. Not because Shep's done anything to make me feel stupid,” Molly reveals in a confessional. “It's really everyone else in the group trying to be weird about everything.”

Taylor, meanwhile, notes that when “people put pressure on you,” it often leads to you “putting pressure on yourself.”

Molly concurs, noting that she's “obviously seen Shep date people,” Taylor included, so she doesn't want to start “putting my eggs in that basket.”

The America's Next Top Model alum then teases, “I'm also, like, a decade too old for him, probably,” referring to Shep's tendency to date women nearly two decades his junior.

Taylor, who dated Shep for two years before breaking up in summer 2022, admits to the cameras that she sees how Molly and Shep could be a match.

“Shep and Molly are both kinda quirky and weird and they have a bunch of the same values,” Taylor explains. She then quips, “Other than the fact that Molly probably doesn't cheat on people.” (Shep confessed in 2021 to cheating on Taylor during their romance. Once they split, Taylor accused him of sleeping around throughout their entire relationship.)

Taylor reveals she wants Molly to “have some fun,” noting that Shep could be the perfect medicine for just that. “Maybe Shep is good practice,” Taylor says with a laugh. “He's good practice [for] getting back into the dating pool.”

When chatting with Molly, Taylor advises her to “meet someone organically” and Molly once again agrees.

“F— all these men in Charleston, not literally,” Molly concludes, laughing on a bench with Taylor. “I'll just have my three cats and my dog.”

Southern Charm airs on Bravo Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.

Love Is Blind star Ben Mezzenga is sharing his side of his breakup drama with ex-fiancée Sara Carton — with “receipts.”

“Sara had just told me a few days before [we had dinner] that she was gonna be in Nashville for the whole summer,” Ben, 28, said in a Wednesday, March 12, TikTok video. “I was pretty much figuring out if I wanted to do long distance with the fragile state our relationship was in after filming.”

Sara, 29, and Ben got engaged sight unseen during Love Is Blind season 8, which was filmed in Minneapolis in spring 2024 and aired on Netflix last month. Sara ultimately called off the engagement at the altar, citing fundamental political and religious differences.

After accepting Sara's decision, Ben asked whether she wanted to continue dating. The nurse merely said, “We'll see,” later claiming at the tell-all reunion that they did briefly date. According to Sara, Ben made plans to join her in Nashville for the remainder of her travel nursing contract before allegedly backing out at the last minute.



In his candid TikTok video, Ben addressed Sara “ripping into” his alleged behavior during the Sunday, March 9, reunion and denied her claims.

“I had thought coming into the reunion that Sara and I were on good terms. The reason I thought that was because we had very little to no contact for the entire time she was in Nashville,” Ben said on Wednesday. “She did text me in October for my birthday and then she moved back in December. We'd run into each other a few times at bars with just pleasant conversations. I wasn't prepared for her to address this situation at the reunion.”

According to Ben, he “thought [they] were broken up” at a time when Sara believed they were still dating.

“The issue is the fact that I reached out to [Sara and she] ghosted me,” he claimed. “I reached out the Saturday that she moved to Nashville when I took her off ‘Find My Friends' [and] apologizing for doing that, as well as the next day because I knew she was still upset.”

To further illustrate his point — Ben captioned his upload “Inside info, timeline and receipts from the final episode, reunion and everything over the last year” — the developer shared screenshots of the former couple's alleged text messages.

“‘Made me sad, but it's OK. I feel really good now being back. I'm just telling you, so you know where I'm at,'” Ben read aloud. “In this case, she still thinks we're together, but the responses don't seem like we're together. Then it goes on [and I say], ‘I'm sorry, I know I should've handled that better.'”

After Ben's text pointed out that he was “trying to figure out” how to heal his broken heart, Ben revealed how Sara allegedly responded.

“And it goes on, ‘As a team effort to keep out respect for one another and continue to be on good terms,'” Ben read her alleged message. “Do you say to ‘be on good terms' if you're still dating someone? I don't think so.”

Ben then sent two more follow-up apologies to Sara in April 2024 and May 2024, respectively.

“She thumbed up [my message], which I guess was enough of a reply for her and I felt bad and I was thinking about it the whole day, so I texted her another apology,” he said. “This was the text that she had ‘no weight to the words.”

Ben's April 7, 2024, message said, “I want to apologize for just removing location stuff out of the blue, and not calling you on your drive to Nash. I do care about you a lot and I guess I am just wanting to protect my heart. I cried a lot yesterday morning and today, and I know there are things I should've done better yesterday. I am just trying to do my best with respecting you and stay on good terms and still care for my own feelings.”

Sara apparently didn't respond, but Ben wrote back on May 28, 2024.

“Hey Sara, you have been on my mind and since we kinda stopped talking in a weird situation, I wanted to see if you had time for a FaceTime this week,” he wrote. “It would be good to see how you are doing.”

According to Ben, he was “so confused” that Sara thought during this entire period that they were still a couple.

Sara, meanwhile, addressed the Nashville of it all during her Thursday, March 13, appearance on the “Viall Files” podcast.

“I was just hopeful that we would progress just us two,” Sara explained. “We did decide a week after the weekend that he was going to come with me to Nashville. … The day that I left for Nashville, I just felt kind of dropped. I was confused because we had such detailed agreements, but ultimately, when he removed me from ‘Find My Friends,' that's when I had the most clarity of, ‘OK, this is actually who Ben is and what the situation is.' Like I felt pretty duped.”

Snow White actor Martin Klebba is disappointed that Disney has decided to scale back the film's big premiere.

Klebba, who voices Grumpy in the live-action adaptation of the animated classic, told TMZ on Wednesday, March 12, that “he's seriously bummed and a bit pissed Disney axed what should've been a massive premiere for such a major film.”

While the Snow White premiere will take place on Saturday, March 15, at Los Angeles' El Capitan Theatre, it won't be a typical red-carpet event. As Variety reported Tuesday, the press won't be present for interviews with stars Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler, the film's leading ladies, and the event will instead be limited to photographers and house crew. (Us Weekly has reached out to Disney for comment.)

Zegler, 23, plays the titular princess in the film, and Gadot, 39, portrays the Evil Queen. Klebba, meanwhile, is among the actors lending their voices to motion-captured versions of the Seven Dwarves, taking on the role of Grumpy. (Klebba, 55, has a form of dwarfism called acromicric dysplasia.)



Reasons for the scaled-back premiere have not been confirmed, but the latest Snow White iteration has generated various controversies since the production began four years ago. In a January 2022 interview on Marc Maron‘s “WTF” podcast, actor Peter Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism known as achondroplasia, opined: “You're progressive in one way and you're still making that f—ing backward story about seven dwarves living in a cave together. What the f— are you doing, man?”

After Dinklage's feedback, Disney released a statement saying, “To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community.”

According to TMZ, Klebba claimed that “as far as he knows, motion-capture was always the plan and was not a knee-jerk reaction” to Dinklage's comments.

The outlet reported, however, that Klebba noted how “it's unbelievably difficult for Little People to land Hollywood roles, let alone lead ones, so this could have been a bigger opportunity for others.”

Zegler, meanwhile, garnered pushback from critics in 2023 when she called the 1937 original “dated” because the prince “literally stalks Snow White,” telling Variety in an interview at the time, “She's not going to be saved by the prince. She's not going to be dreaming about true love. She's dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be.”

During an interview for the March 2025 issue of Vogue Mexico, Zegler addressed the public's response to the reinterpretation of Snow White. “I interpret people's sentiments towards this film as passion,” she said, per translations. “What an honor to be a part of something that people feel so passionately about. We're not always going to agree with everyone who surrounds us and all we can do is our best.”

Lisa Barlow doesn't love how The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City concluded its explosive fifth season.

“Most reunions, I feel like I say everything I need to say, and I don't feel like I have that this year,” Lisa, 50, exclusively told Us Weekly on Tuesday, March 11, while promoting Clorox's Clean Feels Good campaign. “I definitely felt like I have unresolved business and it needs to be taken care of.”



During the three-part reunion show, which concluded on Bravo in February 2025, Lisa didn't always see eye-to-eye with several cast members, including Whitney Rose, Bronwyn Newport and Angie Katsanevas.

While the cast — including Lisa and her husband John Barlow — was recently photographed filming for season 6, Bravo has yet to confirm who will participate in the upcoming season.

“I think that people know by now that, like, when I say something, if I say it, I can back it up,” Lisa explained to Us. “I don't like to lie. I don't like to falsify things. I'm human. I make mistakes, too. But I've learned as I've gotten older that I love to have backup for things before I make a decision or say something.”

In simpler terms, the VIDA tequila founder reminded fans, “If I'm saying it like I can, I can back it up.”

Instead of getting messy with her costars, Lisa is currently focused on keeping it clean with Clorox's new campaign, Clean Feels Good. The brand platform reimagines what brings small moments of satisfaction into people's daily lives.

For Lisa — who shares sons Jack, 20 and Henry, 12, with her husband — there are certain aspects of her Utah home that need to be clean and fresh at all times.

“I just got back from a trip and I think there's nothing worse than coming home to a house that's not spotless,” she shared. “For me, I love to have my countertops clean all the time, my bathroom clean, everything smells amazing and fresh and Clorox-y, like, all the things.”

Although Lisa is a busy woman navigating many businesses, she's not afraid to roll up her sleeves and make sure things are spotless in her home.

“I am the bathroom cleaning expert in our house,” she told Us. “I'm the one that's in the bathroom scrubbing, cleaning, using the Clorox wet wipes to clean everything up. … I am a neat freak, so I really love my house to look almost like no one's living here.”

Tamra Judge and Teddi Mellencamp are “Two Ts in a Pod” once again!

Judge, 57, reunited with her longtime podcast cohost on Wednesday, March 12, and documented the reunion via X.

“Back with my Teddi Jo, and suddenly, everything makes sense again. ❤️,” she captioned a photo of her and Mellencamp, 43, who is pictured rocking a short buzzcut after recently undergoing surgery for multiple brain tumors.

Judge herself has been in the headlines this week after hinting that she had quit The Real Housewives of Orange County while filming a cast trip in New Orleans over the weekend.



Judge shared in an Instagram Story late Sunday, March 9: “It was a long run! When life gives you real problems this reality s— doesn't make sense. Peace out … I'm out.” Later, in response to an Instagram comment asking if she was quitting the show, Judge responded, “Yes!!!”

Judge addressed her RHOC future on the Wednesday, March 12, episode of the “Two Ts in a Pod” podcast, which featured The Real Housewives of New Jersey's Dolores Catania as a guest cohost filling in for Mellencamp amid her recovery.

“I think I just hit a wall. There's so much going on in my life and it's just I don't know,” Judge reflected while admitting that she's been going to therapy as she is struggling with some “personal things.”

She continued: “I just hit a wall and I feel like I'm gonna be in a full depressed mode.”

Judge explained that this year has not been off to a good start for her recently and she can't get out of the funk she's been in despite seeking professional help.

“I'm just so mad at myself because I feel like I just can't pull myself out of the funk. Well, I'm usually pretty good [at] just pulling myself out, and I've been saying it for a while now,” she said. “I just can't pull myself out of this. I can't pull myself out of this. And it was just 2025 has been a real doozy. It's just been one thing after another.”

Judge shared that she went into filming this season of RHOC amid her personal struggles. However, it all got to be too much for her.

“I went into the season not knowing, not sure, very anxious and just dealing with some stuff through therapy, and you know that really breaks you down to your lowest point,” she admitted. “I'm like, ‘Should I just quit? Because it's just I feel like it's breaking me down.'”

Judge added that Mellencamp's health issues have also taken a heavy toll on her. However, her podcast cohost has still been by her side through this rough patch.

“Teddi gave me a pep talk and that is like the first time I've laughed in so long. Like, we laughed, and she just yelled at me and said, ‘Listen to me, I have to be bald and fat right now and going through this. You get your ass back over there,'” she recalled. “I just started laughing. So I think I'm going to see her today. I think that's gonna pull little bit of spark back into me.”

 
Which Is the Best ‘Housewives' City?





Mellencamp announced in February that she was undergoing surgery to have multiple tumors in her brain removed. Earlier this month, the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast member said that doctors had found five more tumors — three in her brain and two in her lungs.

Kim Kardashian‘s desire to live out her Princess Jasmine dreams didn't turn out as planned when she realized India isn't exactly like the Disney movie Aladdin.

During the Thursday, March 13, episode of The Kardashians, Kim, 44, and Khloé Kardashian traveled to Mumbai, India, for the wedding of billionaire heir Anant Ambani and his now-wife Radhika Merchant. Kim and Khloé, 40, found time to explore India before the six-day event, which took place in July 2024.

Their plans got off to a rough start when a dog approached Kim. “I don't do random dogs,” she told Khloé, who was more friendly to the animal. Khloé subsequently pointed out some kittens, which Kim was more excited to walk by.

The stroll itself surprised Kim and Khloé, who were used to being driven around in Los Angeles.



“I thought it was going to be like the marketplace,” Kim said in a confessional. “This is like the streets.”

She continued: “What you see Aladdin going through and stealing the bread from. That is where I thought we were going.”

Kim and Khloé were able to make the most of their walk by buying some gifts for their family. They had to step into a jewelry store after getting caught in some rain, since July is usually “monsoon season” in India. At the store, Kim and Khloé purchased silver pill boxes “to put by” their beds for everyone in the family.

In a post-credits scene, Kim elaborated on her love for Disney movies, adding, “I just feel like Princess Jasmine. This is where I am meant to be.”

Elsewhere in the episode, Kourtney Kardashian took part in the Run Travis Run 5K in support of husband Travis Barker. While Barker, 49, ran most of the way, Kourtney, 45, opted to speed walk instead.

Kris Jenner was featured on The Kardashians as well, weeks after her sister Karen Houghton died at age 65. Houghton died in March 2024 from cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac arrhythmia. Type 2 diabetes served as a secondary underlying cause.

Kris, 69, refused to elaborate on her sister's passing when asked by producers. She previously honored her sister in an emotional post.

“It is with the heaviest heart and deepest sadness that I share that my sister Karen passed away yesterday unexpectedly. My heart aches for my mom MJ and my niece Natalie and I pray that God guides us all through this difficult time,” she wrote via Instagram. “Karen was beautiful inside and out. She was the sweetest, kindest, the most sensitive and vulnerable and so so funny.”

She added: “She always felt grateful and thankful for her life and treasured her family and friends and especially her beautiful daughter. She holds such a huge part of my heart and I cherish every single memory we have together. Karen's passing is a reminder that life is so short and precious and tomorrow is never promised. We must tell those we cherish how much we love them. I love you my beautiful sister.”

New episodes of The Kardashians air on Hulu every Thursday.

Dylan Mulvaney's Paper Doll memoir allowed her to take an “empathetic step towards disarming transphobia” but also gave her the opportunity to spill some tea.

“I feel rather comfortable divulging details of my life publicly after years of oversharing online but the permanence of a book is definitely more daunting,” Mulvaney, 28, told Us Weekly exclusively, while promoting the memoir. “There's less instant gratification with a book but it's also an opportunity for more nuance, and it will be more lasting (hopefully) than the videos I make for our tiny screens.”

Mulvaney admitted that she felt some “pressure to spill a bit more than usual,” and readers will definitely get the details they so desire. “I was absolutely heavy-handed in my pour,” she quipped.

Paper Doll — which hit shelves on Tuesday, March 11 — allowed Mulvaney to take “a step toward healing my own personal trauma and dysphoria,” she told Us.



“Reading the entries and essays back has been far more emotional than writing them,” she explained. “While I'm writing, I rely heavily on fact and wit and when reading, I can better let my heart take over from my head.”

And for those wondering, yes, Mulvaney did not hold back when it came to discussing Beergate. And she tells Us that she feels no “shame” about the situation which has become an “integral” part of her story. (Mulvaney received an onslaught of transphobic hate on social media after posting an ad for Bud Light on Instagram.)

“The only part of me that would hit rewind is the part that wants to protect the greater community,” Mulvaney said. “When I say greater community, I mean the innocent folks from all walks of life whom this affected.”

When it came to writing her book, Mulvaney looked to successful memoir writers who came before her, including Glennon Doyle (“which gave me the courage to share the darker sides of my story”), Lena Dunham and Chelsea Handler, who helped her lean heavily on humor.

“Joy may be the first weapon in my arsenal against transphobia, but humor is a close second,” she said. “It's hard to feel laughed at when you have so many laughing with you.”

Dakota Johnson is channeling her inner scream queen while filming Verity in New York City.

Fans flocked to Midtown on Wednesday, March 12, to watch Johnson, 35, get covered in blood as she filmed the forthcoming movie's opening scene with costar Josh Hartnett.

The production team set up the bloody crash scene as onlookers took several videos of the moment.

Johnson's costume was a business casual look with burnt orange pants paired with a trenchcoat. She was wearing headphones that were also covered in blood. Hartnett, 46, was spotted in a full suit.



Verity is based on the book of the same name by Colleen Hoover, and the aforementioned crash scene opens the novel, which was published in 2018. The story follows budding writer Lowen (Johnson) who meets a wealthy man name Jeremy (Hartnett) while on the way to a publisher meeting, but her plans get derailed after she watches a biker get hit by a car. Unbeknownst to her, Jeremy is who she has the meeting with. Jeremy taps Lowen to be his incapacitated — or maybe not — wife Verity's (Anne Hathaway) ghostwriter.

This is the second of Hoover's novels to be adapted for the big screen, following the release of It Ends With Us last summer. (Her Regretting You novel is in the process of being adapted as well.)



A post shared by Mickey Blank 🗽 (@mickmicknyc)



Johnson and Hartnett's casting was announced in December 2024, a month after Hathaway, 42, signed on to play the titular character.

Hathaway is also set to produce the project with her Somewhere Pictures studio, and this will be her second collaboration with director Michael Showalter. Johnson has also been named as an executive producer on the film.

“Excited is an understatement,” author Hoover captioned a December 2024 Instagram post reacting to news of the film adaptation.

Wednesday's viral bloody videos were not the first time Hoover fans got a look at Hartnett on set. Production on the movie kicked off late last month in NYC with Harnett and Hathaway running around the Big Apple.

Photos showed Hathaway wearing a red dress and laughing as she ran alongside her onscreen husband, who looked to be in disarray with a bowtie hanging off his neck. Readers can only speculate which flashback scene they were filming.

Hoover first spoke about the Verity casting when attending an event in August 2024.

“We are discussing casting next week,” she said at the time. “I need to get on that because right now they're all just blurs in my head. I'm so excited that this one's starting to take off.”

West Wilson has had enough of the back-and-forth with Summer House costar Lindsay Hubbard.

After the two of them traded blows in the media over a comment Wilson, 30, made about Hubbard, 38, potentially returning to Summer House, Wilson said the two hashed things out over the phone.

Now Wilson, who joined the show in season 8, says the whole thing was blown out of proportion.

“That got clickbaited real bad,” he said during a Wednesday, March 12 appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “I brought up how much I loved Lindsay this summer and was asked if she would come back to the house and I said, ‘No way unless you get a babysitter.' It got headlined real bad and I've written headlines before, what you're supposed to do is keep it within the same narrative obviously, and they did a full 180.”



He added, “I called Lindsay, we squashed it.”

Their tiff began when West appeared on Jason Tartick's “Trading Secrets” podcast in February. When he was asked whether Hubbard would return to Summer House for a 10th season, he said, “There is no way.”

“I don't think I can babysit,” Wilson quipped. “I don't know how that works.”

Hubbard, an original Summer House cast member, announced in July 2024 that she and boyfriend Turner Kufe — whose name she did not reveal at the time — were expecting a baby. They welcomed daughter Gemma in December.

She appeared on the Thursday, March 6, episode of Betches' “Mention It All” podcast, where she fired back at Wilson.

“I told him, I was like, ‘Look, here's the problem that I have with this statement — not that I brought you onto this show and gave you a job, that's not even the problem that I'm having here, but you should remind yourself of that — the problem I'm having is, I just became a mother and this is my job and I need to be a provider for my daughter,” she said.

“You going around being like, ‘There's no way [she's returning],' is not really helpful, and is actually really hurtful,” she added. “I thought we were friends and I'm trying to be financially independent and provide for my daughter. You saying, ‘There's no way,' is really f—ed up.'”

Hubbard also confirmed that the two have “hashed it out.”

“What is with these guys publicly doing things and then expecting people to not publicly respond?” she asked. “I'm like, ‘OK, then shut your f—ing mouth and I won't f—ing say anything. But if you want to go, then let's f—ing have a media war. I'm down. I'm so down for a media war with West Wilson.”

Summer House airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.

Kaitlyn Cleveland, the estranged wife of Baltimore Ravens lineman Ben Cleveland, has made another adjustment to her social media after cheating allegations ended their marriage. 

After making her Instagram profile private earlier this month, Kaitlyn has now changed her avatar to a picture of her sipping a cocktail with a sly smile on her face. 

The switch comes days after Kaitlyn cryptically posted lyrics to Kelsea Ballerini's divorce song “Interlude (Full Length)” via her Instagram Story. 

“‘Cause people that I loved are just people that I knew once,” the lyrics read, in a post captured by TMZ. “The rumors goin' 'round, but the truth is kinda nuanced / I wanna set it straight, but my lawyers said I shouldn't.”



Ballerini, 31, wrote the song about her own 2022 divorce from ex-husband Morgan Evans. 

Ben filed divorce documents in Baldwin County, Georgia, on February 28, citing “adultery” as the reason for the dissolution of the marriage. He and Kaitlyn got married in July 2022 after meeting during their time together at the University of Georgia. 

The filing does not specify which member of the couple was allegedly unfaithful. 

In the documents, Ben listed the date of separation as on or around December 29, 2024. Ben and Kaitlyn last appeared on social media together on December 26, 2024, when Kaitlyn shared a carousel of photos via Instagram from the Ravens' Christmas Day game against the Houston Texans, including pictures of Ben and Kaitlyn posing on the sidelines together. 

Ben's filing came just 16 days after he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in Milledgeville, Georgia. He was pulled over on February 12 after being observed weaving between lanes and swerving on the road, per an arrest report shared by the NFL.

According to the report, Ben registered a .178 blood alcohol content — more than double the legal limit. He was charged with DUI and failure to maintain lane before being released on bond. 

Ben and Kaitlyn got engaged in Las Vegas in February 2020 when he proposed in front of the fountains at the Bellagio Hotel & Casino.

“If I'm being honest, your first and my last name will just sound better together and probably always will,” Ben wrote at the time in a since-deleted Instagram post. “Nobody I'd rather spend my forever with and now we get to try that out.”

In another since-deleted Instagram post from June 2020, Ben shared photos from a beach day with Kaitlyn and expressed how the couple was fine taking things slow. 

“Two years and then some until you're actually my wife,” he wrote alongside photos of the couple from a beach day. “Not sure, we haven't really started wedding planning yet and we've been engaged 6 months so that's on her. But she's gonna be my wife so that's kinda cool.”

Tamra Judge is opening up about her decision to quit The Real Housewives of Orange County.

On Sunday (March 9), Tamra, 57, abruptly announced that she was seemingly quitting the Bravo series shortly after filming for season 19 began.

During the Wednesday (March 12) episode of her Two Ts in a Pod podcast, Tamra admitted that she's been struggling lately with some ""personal things.""

Keep reading to find out more...“I think I just hit a wall. There's so much going on in my life and it's just I don't know,"" Tamra said, adding that she's been seeking help through therapy. “I just just hit a wall and I feel like I'm gonna be in a full depressed mode.”

“I went into the season not knowing, not sure, very anxious and just dealing with some stuff through therapy, and you know that really breaks you down to your lowest point,” Tamra explained. “I'm like, ‘Should I just quit? Because it's just I feel like it's breaking me down.'”

She went on to say that these personal problems ultimately became too much for her to handle after she realized she couldn't get ""out of the funk.""

“When I get like this, my body just shuts down, It just completely shuts down,” Tamra said. “And I can just sit in one place and just stare at the wall for hours. And that's how I feel and it's really hard to film like that when you feel like that.”

While she didn't go into detail about what's caused these struggles, she did acknowledge that co-host and close friend Teddi Mellencamp's health issues have been weighing heavily on her. 

Last month, Teddi, 43, underwent surgery to have tumors removed from her brain and doctors recently found more tumors on her brain and lungs.

“Teddi gave me a pep talk and that is like the first time I've laughed in so long,"" Tamra shared. ""Like, we laughed, and she just yelled at me and said, ‘Listen to me, I have to be bald and fat right now and going through this. You get your ass back over there.'""

“I just started laughing. So I think I'm going to see her today,"" she added. ""I think that's gonna pull little bit of spark back into me.”

Blake Lively and her legal team have scored a big victory in her ongoing battle against It Ends with Us director/co-star Justin Baldoni.

If you don't know, there have been ongoing lawsuits between the pair revolving around on set behavior.

Keep reading to find out more...

On Thursday (March 13), Judge Lewis Liman granted Blake's request to keep some information private - aka ""attorneys eyes only.""

Blake and her team did not want sensitive information made public during the discovery phase of the trial because of the public facing nature of this case, where many celebrities and publicists are involved. 

The judge wrote (via Variety), “These cases involve both business competitors and allegations of sexual harm. Discovery will necessarily include confidential and sensitive business and personal information. The risk of disclosure is great.”

Justin's lawyers are okay with keeping sensitive information private, but they did want the ability to share with clients, according to the report.

This was not a complete win for Blake's team, however, as the judge said only the information that is deemed “highly likely” to cause “significant” injury should be kept private.

A spokesperson for Blake shared, “Today, the Court rejected the Wayfarer Parties' objections and entered the protections needed to ensure the free flow of discovery material without any risk of witness intimidation or harm to any individual's security. With this order in place, Ms. Lively will move forward in the discovery process to obtain even more of the evidence that will prove her claims in Court.”

“What intrigues me about this case is how unified folks' responses are regardless of strata,” the anonymous donor wrote. 

“In Corporate America, for instance, there has been widespread doubt of potential prosecutorial mishandling and overcharging.”

The note left on Luigi Mangione's defense fund by the anonymous donor

The person's donation beat out the previous highest donation of $30,000 made some time in February. The new top donation has increased the total raised for his defense fund to over $722,000, bringing the total closer to the fund's goal sum of $1 million.

The donations are being collected to cover his legal bills from the December 4 Legal Committee a fundraiser on GiveSendGo for his legal defense.

Luigi is scheduled to return to federal court in Manhattan on March 19. See the photos from his latest court appearance, which garnered attention.

George Clooney's Broadway debut has arrived and we have the first photo from his performance in the play Good Night, And Good Luck.

The Oscar-winning actor co-wrote the play with his longtime creative partner Grant Heslov and he's playing the lead role of Edward R. Murrow. See a full photo in the gallery. 

George co-wrote and directed the 2005 film version of Good Night, And Good Luck. He also played the supporting role of Fred Friendly, but is now moving into the role played by David Strathairn in the film.

Fans have noticed that George has ditched his signature silver hair for the role.

In Good Night, and Good Luck, we tune in to the golden age of broadcast journalism and Edward R. Murrow's legendary, history-altering, on-air showdown with Senator Joseph McCarthy. As McCarthyism casts a shadow over America, Murrow and his news team choose to confront the growing tide of paranoia and propaganda, even if it means turning the federal government and a worried nation against them. The play chronicles a time in American history when truth and journalistic integrity stood up to fearmongering and disinformation—and won. 

The cast of the play also includes Ilana Glazer and Clark Gregg, among others.

Tickets for Good Night, And Good Luck are now on sale on Telecharge. Opening night is set for April 3 at the historic Winter Garden Theatre.

While neither Sheawna nor Chris have publicly spoken about a split, he did post photos with another woman named Giselle.

Harry Styles is addressing those rumors!

The 31-year-old ""Watermelon Sugar"" singer and One Direction superstar is at the center of rumors swirling of a residency at Las Vegas' Sphere.

Now, in a statement shared via his rep, we now know the answer.

Keep reading to find out more...

On Thursday morning (March 13), following a week of rumors claiming that Harry was set to perform 35 dates at The Sphere, the representative said to Billboard: “To set the record straight, there has never been plans for Harry Styles to perform at Sphere.” 

Reports first emerged around March 6, though nothing was ever confirmed. Still, fans got excited about the rumors, and even began wondering if it meant Harry was finally planning a comeback three years after the release of his 2022 record, Harry's House. 

Harry hasn't toured since his global Love On Tour, which ran from 2021 to 2023. He did have mini-residencies during the tour, including a 15-show run at New York City's Madison Square Garden and another 15 shows at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calif.

Hours after Michelle Obama launched a video podcast, Fox News anchor Jesse Watters had already declared it a “flop.”

In a Wednesday night episode of Jesse Watters Primetime, the conservative firebrand said he had been wondering where Obama had been after she skipped a string of major events, including President Donald Trump's inauguration and former President Jimmy Carter's funeral.

“Turns out, Michelle has been busy working on a new podcast, and so far, it's been a flop,” Watters said. “The first two episodes have been up all day and only gotten a few thousand views on YouTube. Half of them are probably Primetime producers, but still.”

Michelle teamed up with her basketball executive brother to launch IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson, a weekly show where they'll be joined by guests to answer viewers' questions and share personal anecdotes. It's produced by Higher Ground, the media company Michelle and former President Barack Obama founded in 2018.

The show's first two episodes, including one featuring actress Issa Rae, were released on Wednesday. By late evening, both episodes had only garnered about 21,000 views on YouTube, though the show was rated favorably by thousands of listeners on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

The episodes included stories about how Michelle had to train the former president to get ready on time and how their daughters, Sasha and Malia, hated the White House tradition of pardoning turkeys for Thanksgiving.

Fox News personality Rachel Campos-Duffy joined Watters to dismiss the show as “boring.”

“This would've been such interesting stories about 15 years ago,” she said. “I don't care about any of these stories; I didn't even find them funny.”

Watters also speculated whether the podcast was Michelle's way of dipping her foot into politics, as Campos-Duffy noted that liberals like California Gov. Gavin Newsom have been making forays into the popular medium.

“Liberals have been wanting to break into this podcast medium for a long time,” Campos-Duffy said. “Conservatives have been so successful at it. It's basically what helped Donald Trump ride into the White House, showing just who he is, and liberals can't seem to break into it.”","{'href': 'https://news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}"

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will no take part in an upcoming video conference proposed by UK and France, in which a so-called “coalition of the willing” intends to increase military support for Ukraine, La Repubblica and La Stampa newspapers have reported.

In its article on Tuesday, La Repubblica said that “it is certain” that Meloni will boycott the virtual meeting of the Western European leaders being convened by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday.

The Italian PM reportedly “distances herself from the Franco-British axis” due to her disagreement with the push by London and Paris to send peacekeepers to aid Kiev. Meloni believes that Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are “rushing ahead” with their idea, according to La Repubblica.

The move by Rome could “split the front that Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to build,” La Stampa noted.

The media outlet claimed that the Italian authorities had decided to drop out of the video conference after extensive discussions with other governments, including the administration of US President Donald Trump.

Starmer announced that the UK and France are ready to lead a “coalition of the willing” to support Ukraine with troops and aircraft during an emergency summit in London in early March. This came shortly after Donald Trump and Vladimir Zelensky had a public disagreement at the White House, where Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of opposing peace with Russia and being ungrateful for US assistance.

Shortly after the summit, Meloni stressed that “Italy will not be sending troops to Ukraine.” She suggested that European politicians should instead focus on developing conditions for a just and lasting peace between Moscow and Kiev, including security guarantees for Ukraine.

Earlier this week, the Italian PM expressed “satisfaction” with the outcome of the talks between the US and Ukraine in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which ended with Kiev agreeing to an “immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire.” She said that Rome “fully supports” Trump's peace efforts and that “the decision is now up to Russia.”

Moscow has said repeatedly that it would not accept a temporary ceasefire with Kiev, insisting that the conflict must be settled through reliable, legally binding agreements that would eliminate its root causes. Russia has also categorically ruled out the possibility of Western European peacekeepers arriving in Ukraine.

The co-founder and financial backer of file-sharing website The Pirate Bay, Carl Lundstrom, died when the plane he was piloting crashed in the mountains of Slovenia, a nationalist Swedish political party with which the entrepreneur was linked announced on Wednesday.

Slovenian police later confirmed to Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday that a body found at the crash site is “likely of the pilot, a Swedish citizen,” but declined to identify the remains pending forensic research.

The Alternative for Sweden party said in a post on Facebook that the fatal accident, which claimed the life of “a legend and veteran of Swedish nationalism” occurred on Monday.

The party cited a close friend of Lundstrom, who said that the 64-year old businessman, who had taken off in his Mooney M-20 aircraft from the Croatian capital of Zagreb, had been heading to Zurich, Switzerland.

The plane crashed into a wooden cabin in the Velika Planina area of northern Slovenia, splitting the structure in two, AFP reported, adding that bad weather conditions had prevented rescuers from recovering the body before Tuesday.

Lundstrom, the grandson of the founder of the world's largest crisp bread producer Wasabrod, was one of the early financial backers of The Pirate Bay. The site was launched in 2003 to allow web users to avoid paying copyright fees while sharing music, movies and other files. Telecommunications operator Rix Telecom, owned by the entrepreneur, provided services and equipment to the service until 2005.

Lundstrom and three other defendants were charged with “accessory to breaching copyright law” in 2009 and sentenced to one year in jail and ordered to pay 30 million Swedish krona ($3 million) in damages to several major media companies. As a result of an appeal claim, the fine was increased and the sentence was reduced to four months, which he served.

Involved in politics, the businessman funded the Swedish Progress Party in 1991 before it later merged with the Sweden Democrats. According to Alternative for Sweden, Lundstrom joined the party in 2018, serving as a district manager and later running in the 2021 Church Assembly election, which he lost.

Russia is ready for a ceasefire in the Ukraine conflict, President Vladimir Putin has said, stressing that such an agreement “must lead to long-term peace.”

Moscow believes that the “idea” of a ceasefire is the “right one,” Putin told journalists during a joint press conference with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Moscow on Thursday. “We absolutely support it,” he added.

“We endorse the idea of resolving the conflict through peaceful means,” the president insisted.

Certain issues still need to be discussed and resolved before a truce can be reached, Putin stated, adding that Moscow particularly needs to discuss them with the US. The dialogue could also require a personal conversation with US President Donald Trump, the Russian leader said.

Concerns listed by Putin included systems of “control and verification” to monitor the ceasefire regime, as well as Kiev's potential attempts to use the pause in hostilities to rearm and reinforce its troops on the frontline.

“Are 30 days to be used to continue forced mobilization in Ukraine, to supply it with arms and to train the newly [formed] units?” the president stated. “Will there be any guarantees that nothing of that sort will happen?”

The situation in Kursk Region, on the Russian border, could also be a major point of contention, according to the Russian president. Putin wondered if a ceasefire would mean that Russia would have to allow all Ukrainian troops that invaded the area in August 2024 to leave. “Should we just let them out after they committed numerous crimes against civilians? Or will Kiev order them to lay down arms?” he asked.

As of Wednesday evening, Moscow's forces had liberated 86% of the territory occupied by the Ukrainians in August 2024, according to the head of the Russian General Staff, General Valery Gerasimov. The remainder of Kiev's units in the area were largely “encircled” and “isolated,” he explained.

Washington and Kiev both endorsed a 30-day temporary truce following a meeting between the two nations' delegations in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. US special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to present the results of those talks during his visit to Moscow later today.

Russia has previously spoken out against any temporary truce in the Ukraine conflict, arguing that Kiev would use it to rearm and continue fighting. Putin has insisted that any resolution to the conflict must address the root causes in order to establish a long-lasting sustainable peace.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Finland on Thursday announced a new arms package for Ukraine amounting to around 200 million euros ($217 million) and pledged more defense cooperation with Kyiv. 

The aid package for Ukraine involves artillery ammunition, “which is in great need right now,” said Finland's Defense Minister Antti Häkkänen as he signed a memorandum of understanding alongside his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov. 

Finland's Defense Ministry said other contents of the aid package would not be divulged at this time.

Häkkänen said that Finland remains committed to supporting Ukraine and shares Kyiv's “view of the Russian threat in light of our historical experiences.”

The areas of closer cooperation include information exchange, research and innovation, ammunition production, and defense industry projects in Finland and Ukraine, the ministry said.

The minister said that the relationship was not a one-way street.

“Three years of war against Russia have made Ukraine's armed forces one of the strongest in Europe. At the same time, the country has accumulated extensive experience in defending itself against Russia. It is therefore clear that in developing our own defense, we should listen carefully to Ukraine's teachings and utilize their experiences,” Häkkänen said.

The latest decisions would increase the total value of Finland's material aid to Ukraine to 3.3 billion euros (nearly $3.6 million), the ministry said.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — As tensions in Serbia soar, students and other opponents of the populist president are gearing up for a major rally in the capital, Belgrade, over the weekend. 

Momentum has been building in favor of their demands for major changes in the Balkan country, after nearly four months of student-led anti-government protests.

Some believe that the demonstration on Saturday could mark the “D-Day” and endgame that have shaken the firm grip on power of authoritarian Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.

As thousands of protesters arrive in Belgrade from all over the country, Vucic has warned that the rally could end in bloodshed. He threatened mass arrests of the protesters if they turn to violence, and said the only way he would leave power was “if they kill me.”

Most of the student led-protests have so far been peaceful, with sporadic incidents caused by Vucic supporters. But this time, the president's loyalists started arriving in the capital from all over the country days ahead of the scheduled opposition rally. They set up a tent camp in a park in front of the presidential palace downtown, creating a de facto human shield for Vucic.

The crowd, which had grown to a few thousand by Thursday lunchtime, included some pro-Vucic students who claimed they “just want to resume learning” after most universities shut their classes following the protests. 

However, the occupants of the camp include veterans of a dreaded paramilitary unit that committed war crimes during the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s. Well-known figures from Serbia's flourishing criminal underworld could also be seen, along with soccer hooligans who routinely resort to violence and have been supporting Vucic, acting as guards at some of his rallies. 

The catalyst for monthslong protests was the deadly collapse of a railway station canopy in the northern city of Novi Sad on Nov. 1 which resulted in 15 fatalities. This incident has been widely attributed to governmental negligence, endemic corruption and shady deals made with Chinese construction companies that took part in the recent renovation of the station.

Initially, the protests began as sporadic demonstrations seeking accountability for the Novi Sad tragedy. However, they rapidly evolved into a nationwide movement addressing broader issues such as demands for major democratic reforms. 

The movement has garnered extensive support from various segments of Serbian society.

Vucic has tried to ease the pressure by sacrificing the prime minister, who resigned in December along with the government. He put forward draft legislation on university education, while 16 people were charged over the disaster in Novi Sad. 

At the same time he has described the protests as a ploy organized in the West to oust him from power. Vucic sought and obtained support from Russia's President Vladimir Putin while cracking down on liberal rights groups at home.

The rally is open-ended and may continue after Saturday, and student organizers say there may be further protests to come.

“We are not taking the final steps — we are making tectonic changes. If our demands are not met, we will remain on the streets, in blockades, in the fight until justice is served,” they said on Instagram.

Similar student-led rallies already have been held in Novi Sad, the central city of Kragujevac and Nis, in the country's south, drawing tens of thousands of people and lasting for a day or longer.

Thousands of people from all over Serbia are expected to converge on Belgrade by Saturday. Already, hundreds of students have begun marching on the capital from various directions, while some are also cycling.

The citizens of Belgrade, a city of some two million people, also are likely to swarm the streets in huge numbers as support for the student-led protests has persisted despite Vucic's campaign against them.

The gathering on Saturday could easily turn into the biggest rally ever in the troubled Balkan nation, which has a long history of anti-government demonstrations.

        Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz wants to alter Germany's strict fiscal rules to massively boost defence spending, the Greens are standing in his way.
    

Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz on Thursday made concessions to the Green Party in the hopes it would lend critically important votes to his multi-billion-euro spending spree.

Merz and the CDU, alongside would-be coalition partners, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), unveiled their plans last week to lift Germany's ""debt brake"", which was written into Germany's constitution in 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis. It tightly restricts the government's ability to borrow new money. 

Over the years, the country's strict fiscal rules have created headaches for successive governments as they tried to raise funds to respond to crises. It was suspended in 2020 as the state tried to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, and in 2024, a spat over its reform led to the breakdown of the country's three-party ruling coalition. 

Last week, the CDU and the SPD proposed exempting defence spending that exceeds 1% of Germany's GDP from the debt brake, which currently sets the structural deficit at a maximum of 0.35% of the country's GDP. 

The proposal would also set up a €500 billion fund to invest in Germany's creaking infrastructure over the next decade, as well as loosen borrowing rules for Germany's sixteen states. 

But the Greens, who have long argued for reform of the debt brake, are now standing in Merz's way. Although the party supports changing the debt brake, it argues the proposals on the table do not address the need to invest in Germany's clean energy transition. 

The Greens have offered their own draft law, one which expands the definition of ""defence"" and draws more on funds from within the government's current budget. 

On Thursday, Merz and the SPD attempted to appease the Greens by offering to divert €50 billion of the special funds into the Climate Transformation Fund, a multi-year federal budget set up to finance climate and energy transition policy measures. 

Merz also conceded that the scope of defence spending would be expanded to include civil defence and intelligence spending. 

“What more do you want from us in so short a time?” Merz demanded. 

The Greens, however, stuck to their criticism, with party parliamentary group leader Katharina Dröge arguing on Thursday that ""shifting of billions"" from one fund to another should not be the purpose of the draft law, arguing that the word ""additional"" be added to the proposal.

The party say they fear that without safeguards such as the word ""additional"" added, the money kicked up through the proposal will simply be used to fulfil the campaign promises of the CDU and the SPD.

Merz and the SPD are deeply dependent on votes from the Greens to pass the proposal through the country's old parliament as adjusting the debt brake requires a majority vote of two-thirds of the parliament. 

The new makeup of the Bundestag — which is set to convene 25 March — would mean that without the Greens on board, Merz would need votes from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and The Left to push forward the measure.

But both of these parties were so opposed to the debt brake proposal that they filed urgent lawsuits to the country's Constitutional Court to prevent the debate from taking place. 

Adjusting the debt brake has general approval from the country's economists, with disagreement primarily lying in the wording of the government's proposals. 

Jens Südekum, who alongside three other economists brainstormed the proposal upon which the CDU and SPD's plans are based, said that the word ""additionality"" is missing to make the proposals more robust. 

""We really need to make sure if we have this debt break reform that the additional money only flows to military and infrastructure,"" Südekum told Euronews. ""We need to make a very strong commitment to say: OK, all of the money goes additionally into infrastructure, investment and military.""

Influential economist Veronika Grimm of the German Council of Economic Experts has also expressed concern over the proposals, telling domestic media that the problem with the measures is in their ""design"".

""There is a risk that their negative effects will outweigh the positive ones, thus counteracting the intended effect,"" Grimm wrote in an open letter to the Bundestag budget committee. 

Südekum told Euronews that while the Greens are making trouble for Merz and the SPD, the biggest catastrophe would still be if no package and adjustment is agreed at all. 

""We (Germany) have been stagnating for five years. We are entering dirty tariff wars with the US, geopolitical tensions, and Donald Trump doesn't negotiate with losers. So, we only can basically push through our interest if we bargain from a position of economic strength,"" Südekum said. 

Merz himself has framed the multi-million-euro package as vital ""in light of the threats to our freedom and peace on the continent.""

""The world is watching,"" Merz said on Thursday, as the clock ticked down and the Greens showed no sign of falling in line with the bill. 

He faces several days of negotiating with the Greens in order to get the party on board with his proposals ahead of a vote on the 18 March. 

The bill must also pass through the Bundesrat, or Germany's upper house, which represents the governments of the country's 16 states. There, the CDU, SPD and Greens would need the backing of one more party for the bill to pass.

        Germany's fiscal shift will drive billions into infrastructure, energy, and housing, boosting eurozone growth. Goldman Sachs highlights 12 Buy-rated European stocks set to benefit from this economic transformation.
    

Germany's historic shift on fiscal expansion is set to reshape Europe's economic landscape, unlocking a wave of public spending that could boost growth across the eurozone.

With hundreds of billions of euros expected to flow into defence, infrastructure, and energy, investors are eyeing key stocks poised to benefit.

Goldman Sachs analysts have identified 12 buy-rated European companies outside the defence sector that could ride this spending boom, spanning industries from airport operations to renewable energy.

Germany's government-in-waiting is setting the stage for a historic departure from its traditionally conservative fiscal approach.

The CDU/CSU and SPD-led coalition unveiled a €500 billion off-budget infrastructure fund—equivalent to 11.6% of GDP in 2024—to be deployed over the next ten years. This fund aims to revamp the country's ageing infrastructure, accelerate the energy transition, and boost housing and transport investments.

In a further break from its traditionally strict fiscal orthodoxy, the government will exempt defence spending exceeding 1% of GDP from the constitutional debt brake—a rule that limits new borrowing—effectively unlocking an additional €11 billion per year for military upgrades.

Additionally, Germany will ease fiscal constraints on its regional states, raising the structural deficit allowance from 0.0% to 0.35% of GDP.

Goldman Sachs economists have raised their German GDP growth forecasts for this year and 2026, citing stronger fiscal stimulus. This revision also prompted an upgrade to eurozone growth projections, with the European Central Bank's (ECB) terminal interest rate forecast now set at 2%.

By contrast, US growth forecasts have been downgraded, weighed down by rising tariffs and weaker-than-expected expansion under President Donald Trump.

“There has been a material repricing of reflation risk in Europe versus the US across assets,” said Christian Mueller-Glissmann, CFA, at Goldman Sachs.

Amid this evolving economic landscape, Goldman Sachs has identified 12 Buy-rated European stocks—outside the defence sector—that stand to benefit from the anticipated spending boom.

These companies span industries ranging from construction and logistics to energy and real estate, making them key players in Germany's economic revolution.

Eiffage – The French construction giant is well-positioned to gain from increased defence-related projects in both France and Germany. The company has already secured a €7 billion building renovation contract for the French Armed Forces, with further potential for its defence-focused Clemessy subsidiary.

Sika – The Swiss building materials firm could benefit from the push for sustainable construction, as its mortars and additives help reduce the carbon footprint of high-emission industries like concrete production.

Fraport – Frankfurt's airport operator could see gains from potential corporate tax cuts and reduced aviation taxes. Its newly expanded Terminal 3, set for completion in 2025, will also support growth. “Fraport raised its airline fees at a pace higher than expected,” said Patrick Creuset, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.

DHL – The logistics giant is poised for upside if Germany's fiscal expansion fuels a broader economic acceleration across Europe, driving increased shipping demand.

E.ON – As Europe modernises its aging power grid, Germany's fiscal policies could unlock long-term growth for energy players. E.ON derives two-thirds of its EBITDA from power grids, with Goldman Sachs analysts seeing an “underappreciated opportunity” from electrification trends.

RWE – A re-industrialisation effort in Germany could drive power demand growth by one percentage point per year, boosting investment across the electricity value chain. Analysts expect this to translate into higher returns in renewables, flexible generation, and power grids.

Siemens Energy – The German government's potential plan to develop 20 gigawatts of gas power plants by 2030 could fuel growth for Siemens Energy, whose gas service business contributed 31% of group revenue in 2024. “Comments on new gas plants are supportive for Siemens Energy,” said Ajay Patel, a Goldman Sachs analyst.

Nordex – The wind turbine manufacturer has increased its European exposure, with the region now accounting for over 80% of its order backlog. Government support for renewable energy is expected to enhance its market position.

BASF – The German chemicals giant is approaching a financial turning point, with Goldman Sachs analysts anticipating a sharp free cash flow improvement in 2026 as it monetises a €10 billion investment in China. Analysts also highlight the company's commitment to returning at least €12 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks between 2025 and 2028.

Additionally, any potential reinstatement of Russian gas imports into Europe would favour BASF, given its energy-intensive operations.

Akzo Nobel – The Dutch coatings company is expected to see a “meaningful volume improvement” from 2026 onwards. “Akzo's shares are trading at a significant discount to historical averages,” said Goldman Sachs's Georgina Fraser, PhD, adding that European fiscal expansion and post-war reconstruction in Ukraine could provide further tailwinds.

Geberit – Switzerland-based Geberit, a leader in sanitary appliances, could benefit from Germany's push for new housing. With nearly 30% of its sales coming from Germany, it stands to gain from any government efforts to alleviate the housing shortage.

Vonovia – Germany's largest residential property group could benefit from public investment in housing and infrastructure. Government incentives to modernise properties could help Vonovia expand its non-rental revenue streams, which it aims to grow to 25% of EBITDA by 2028.

“The new policies could incentivise private homeowners to modernise their properties by leveraging subsidies and tax incentives,” said Jonathan Kownator, a Goldman Sachs analyst.

By 2028, the company aims to increase EBITDA from non-rental revenues—such as development—to as much as 25%.

        The two leaders are exploring the strengthening of relations, with an emphasis on trade and economy.
    

President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev arrived in Paris on a state visit to France for his third trip to the French capital, after October 2018 and November 2022.

The official welcoming ceremony for the president was held at the Invalides monument in Paris on Wednesday, where he was greeted by Emmanuel Macron, who will host him until Thursday. 

The two leaders and their delegations later met at the Elysee Palace to discuss Uzbek-French relations, with an emphasis on trade and economy. Discussions also touched on encouraging the cooperation with French companies and businesses. 

As a first outcome, Mirziyoyev and Macron signed a joint declaration on strategic partnership, the Uzbek president's press service's statement said on social media platform X. 

""In front of leaders documents were exchanged, including agreements on specialist and student mobility, mutual visa exemption for diplomatic passport holders, and a cooperation program for implementation of projects worth 6.5 billion euros,"" the statement read. 

Further agreements on ""education, finance, technology, healthcare, culture and other spheres"" were also concluded, according to the statement.

While retaining traditionally close ties with Moscow, Tashkent has turned to reform and closer relations with the West under President Mirziyoyev in recent years.

When US President Donald Trump appeared to turn his back on long-time ally Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia, it would have been understandable if a few eyebrows were raised and concern spread in Taiwan.  This is not the case, however, according to the island's representative in Israel, Abby Ya-ping Lee.Sitting down with The Jerusalem Post this week, Lee spoke with confidence about Taiwan's resilience, emphasizing that while global geopolitics are shifting, her archipelagic nation remains steadfast in defending its sovereignty and concentrating on deepening ties with like-minded allies. Advertisement“Three years ago, when we saw the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was like a watershed moment for Taiwanese people,” she said. “We know that we have to be quick to prepare ourselves from such military conflicts replicated in other countries. So we are not only strengthening our national defense but also increasing our whole society's resilience.”For Taiwan, the lessons of Ukraine and Israel in dealing with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran have reinforced a fundamental truth: self-reliance is key. As the world watches Trump's evolving stance on foreign conflicts, Taipei is taking proactive measures, from military reforms to diplomatic initiatives, to safeguard its future.  IN RESPONSE to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the island has significantly bolstered its defenses.

Due to diplomatic constraints stemming from China's influence and the “One China” policy, Taiwan does not officially designate its diplomatic missions as embassies. AdvertisementShe has spearheaded a campaign of solidarity with the Jewish state, particularly in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks. “Taiwan was among the first in the world [post-Oct.7] to support Israel, to express our solidarity with the State of Israel,” she said.Beyond diplomacy, Taipei has also provided humanitarian support. “My office here also engages with a lot of NGOs in providing humanitarian relief goods, including livelihood goods, medical assistance, trauma therapies, and education to the communities and people affected by the war, such as parents who lost their children at the Nova festival,” Lee explained.But the relationship is more than just symbolic. Economically, Taiwan and Israel are natural partners. “Taiwan is a leader in hardware, and Israel is a leader in software,” she noted. “Our business and technological cooperation opportunities are enormous. We see a lot of Israeli start-ups coming to Taiwan to find reliable partners, and we have a very business-friendly infrastructure for them.”  This synergy extends to security and democratic resilience. “Taiwan and Israel are standing on the forefront to defend the democratic way of life,” Lee said. “We have been the testing ground for democracy, facing cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and psychological warfare.”Trump's first monthsTrump's return to the White House has prompted intense speculation about his policies toward China and Taiwan. Lee, however, remains measured.“The US is Taiwan's most important partner in security, science, and technology,” she emphasized. “We pay a lot of attention to trade policies and will adapt quickly. A close and deep partnership between Taiwan and the US is essential for maintaining peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.”She pointed out that Trump's fundamental policies on Taiwan have remained consistent. “The US has long-standing policies on Taiwan – support for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo, and bipartisan Congressional backing. We have many good friends in the Trump administration who continue to engage with us and provide substantive support.”However, Taiwan is under no illusions about the volatility of geopolitics. “We are very clear, realistic, and efficient in optimizing our leverage to strengthen our partnership with the US,” Lee stated. “Taiwan's peace and stability are essential for global peace.”One of Trump's most aggressive policies has been his renewed economic war on China, particularly tariffs and restrictions on Chinese technology.Lee acknowledged that Taiwan is watching these moves closely. “Trump's trade policies aim to address issues such as trade imbalances, Chinese overcapacity, and state subsidies. Taiwan, as a trade economy, carefully analyzes all relevant policies.”However, Taiwan's position in global trade is unique. “Currently, 91% of Taiwanese exports to the US are intermediate goods, not consumer goods,” she explained. “These include servers, electronic components, and networking equipment—essential for AI and 5G networks. Our trade with the US is complementary and healthy.”While Taiwan could benefit from US-China tensions by strengthening trade with America, it must also ensure that it does not become collateral damage in any broader economic conflict. “We remain proactive in maintaining a smooth and effective dialogue with every US administration,” Lee said.Taiwan's Silicon ShieldPerhaps the most significant development in US-Taiwan economic relations is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's $100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five cutting-edge fabrication plants in Arizona.“This is a milestone in US-Taiwan trade relations and a historical moment for TSMC,” Lee stated. “It strengthens Taiwan's relevance with the US and helps TSMC better serve its American customers, who make up 60% of its business.”When announced, Trump stated that TSMC's investment ensures the company – a key supplier of the world's most advanced semiconductors – can sidestep the tariffs he has considered applying to the global chip industry. His broader goal is to strengthen US manufacturing and solidify America's trade leverage over both competitors and allies.However, there are concerns that shifting semiconductor production overseas could weaken Taiwan's strategic importance. Lee dismissed such fears. “Even when all overseas manufacturing lines are completed by 2030, 80% of TSMC's production will still remain in Taiwan, and the most critical technology will be kept on the island.”Taiwan's dominance in chip production remains staggering: 60% of the world's total chips are made in Taiwan, 92% of the world's advanced chips (such as 5 nanometer and 3nm semiconductors) come from Taiwan, and 99% of the world's AI chips are produced by Taiwanese companies.“That's why the semiconductor chief industries and TSMC is always referred to as ‘Taiwan's silicon shield' as a protection of our national security,” she told the Post.Taiwan, Ukraine, and lessons learnedTaiwanese leaders have watched the war in Ukraine with deep concern, drawing direct parallels to their own situation with China. However, they are determined not to be caught off guard.“The Ukrainian people are very resilient,” Lee said. “This has been an awakening call for Taiwanese people – that our determination to defend ourselves is critical to our survival.“The future of Taiwan should be determined, decided by Taiwanese people,” Lee expressed to the Post. “That is the reason why we fight so hard to build democracy in Taiwan – and Taiwan and China: We don't have jurisdiction over each other. China did not rule Taiwan for a single day. We are enjoying different political systems, and Taiwan is independent by its reality.”In response to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the islands have significantly bolstered their defenses. By increasing its defense budget to 3% of GDP, extending military conscription from four months to one year, developing a domestic defense industry, and enhancing cyber defense against China's daily cyberattacks, the government hopes it will maintain the status quo and deter Beijing from any thoughts of attack.“The Chinese government conducts three million cyberattacks on Taiwan every day,” Lee revealed. “We have adopted countermeasures, including real-time debunking of disinformation campaigns and media literacy programs to teach our youth to identify fake news.”She also noted the disturbing rise of anti-Israel content on Chinese social media platforms like TikTok. “Pro-Hamas, anti-Israel content is freely spreading inside China. I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.

We have many good friends in the Trump administration who continue to engage with us and provide substantive support.”However, Taiwan is under no illusions about the volatility of geopolitics. “We are very clear, realistic, and efficient in optimizing our leverage to strengthen our partnership with the US,” Lee stated. “Taiwan's peace and stability are essential for global peace.”One of Trump's most aggressive policies has been his renewed economic war on China, particularly tariffs and restrictions on Chinese technology.Lee acknowledged that Taiwan is watching these moves closely. “Trump's trade policies aim to address issues such as trade imbalances, Chinese overcapacity, and state subsidies. Taiwan, as a trade economy, carefully analyzes all relevant policies.”However, Taiwan's position in global trade is unique. “Currently, 91% of Taiwanese exports to the US are intermediate goods, not consumer goods,” she explained. “These include servers, electronic components, and networking equipment—essential for AI and 5G networks. Our trade with the US is complementary and healthy.”While Taiwan could benefit from US-China tensions by strengthening trade with America, it must also ensure that it does not become collateral damage in any broader economic conflict. “We remain proactive in maintaining a smooth and effective dialogue with every US administration,” Lee said.Taiwan's Silicon ShieldPerhaps the most significant development in US-Taiwan economic relations is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's $100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five cutting-edge fabrication plants in Arizona.“This is a milestone in US-Taiwan trade relations and a historical moment for TSMC,” Lee stated. “It strengthens Taiwan's relevance with the US and helps TSMC better serve its American customers, who make up 60% of its business.”When announced, Trump stated that TSMC's investment ensures the company – a key supplier of the world's most advanced semiconductors – can sidestep the tariffs he has considered applying to the global chip industry. His broader goal is to strengthen US manufacturing and solidify America's trade leverage over both competitors and allies.However, there are concerns that shifting semiconductor production overseas could weaken Taiwan's strategic importance. Lee dismissed such fears. “Even when all overseas manufacturing lines are completed by 2030, 80% of TSMC's production will still remain in Taiwan, and the most critical technology will be kept on the island.”Taiwan's dominance in chip production remains staggering: 60% of the world's total chips are made in Taiwan, 92% of the world's advanced chips (such as 5 nanometer and 3nm semiconductors) come from Taiwan, and 99% of the world's AI chips are produced by Taiwanese companies.“That's why the semiconductor chief industries and TSMC is always referred to as ‘Taiwan's silicon shield' as a protection of our national security,” she told the Post.Taiwan, Ukraine, and lessons learnedTaiwanese leaders have watched the war in Ukraine with deep concern, drawing direct parallels to their own situation with China. However, they are determined not to be caught off guard.“The Ukrainian people are very resilient,” Lee said. “This has been an awakening call for Taiwanese people – that our determination to defend ourselves is critical to our survival.“The future of Taiwan should be determined, decided by Taiwanese people,” Lee expressed to the Post. “That is the reason why we fight so hard to build democracy in Taiwan – and Taiwan and China: We don't have jurisdiction over each other. China did not rule Taiwan for a single day. We are enjoying different political systems, and Taiwan is independent by its reality.”In response to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the islands have significantly bolstered their defenses. By increasing its defense budget to 3% of GDP, extending military conscription from four months to one year, developing a domestic defense industry, and enhancing cyber defense against China's daily cyberattacks, the government hopes it will maintain the status quo and deter Beijing from any thoughts of attack.“The Chinese government conducts three million cyberattacks on Taiwan every day,” Lee revealed. “We have adopted countermeasures, including real-time debunking of disinformation campaigns and media literacy programs to teach our youth to identify fake news.”She also noted the disturbing rise of anti-Israel content on Chinese social media platforms like TikTok. “Pro-Hamas, anti-Israel content is freely spreading inside China. I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.
            



This is not the case, however, according to the island's representative in Israel, Abby Ya-ping Lee.Sitting down with The Jerusalem Post this week, Lee spoke with confidence about Taiwan's resilience, emphasizing that while global geopolitics are shifting, her archipelagic nation remains steadfast in defending its sovereignty and concentrating on deepening ties with like-minded allies.

So we are not only strengthening our national defense but also increasing our whole society's resilience.”For Taiwan, the lessons of Ukraine and Israel in dealing with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran have reinforced a fundamental truth: self-reliance is key. As the world watches Trump's evolving stance on foreign conflicts, Taipei is taking proactive measures, from military reforms to diplomatic initiatives, to safeguard its future.

Lee dismissed such fears. “Even when all overseas manufacturing lines are completed by 2030, 80% of TSMC's production will still remain in Taiwan, and the most critical technology will be kept on the island.”Taiwan's dominance in chip production remains staggering: 60% of the world's total chips are made in Taiwan, 92% of the world's advanced chips (such as 5 nanometer and 3nm semiconductors) come from Taiwan, and 99% of the world's AI chips are produced by Taiwanese companies.“That's why the semiconductor chief industries and TSMC is always referred to as ‘Taiwan's silicon shield' as a protection of our national security,” she told the Post.Taiwan, Ukraine, and lessons learnedTaiwanese leaders have watched the war in Ukraine with deep concern, drawing direct parallels to their own situation with China.

China did not rule Taiwan for a single day. We are enjoying different political systems, and Taiwan is independent by its reality.”In response to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the islands have significantly bolstered their defenses. By increasing its defense budget to 3% of GDP, extending military conscription from four months to one year, developing a domestic defense industry, and enhancing cyber defense against China's daily cyberattacks, the government hopes it will maintain the status quo and deter Beijing from any thoughts of attack.“The Chinese government conducts three million cyberattacks on Taiwan every day,” Lee revealed. “We have adopted countermeasures, including real-time debunking of disinformation campaigns and media literacy programs to teach our youth to identify fake news.”She also noted the disturbing rise of anti-Israel content on Chinese social media platforms like TikTok. “Pro-Hamas, anti-Israel content is freely spreading inside China. I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.

However, they are determined not to be caught off guard.“The Ukrainian people are very resilient,” Lee said. “This has been an awakening call for Taiwanese people – that our determination to defend ourselves is critical to our survival.“The future of Taiwan should be determined, decided by Taiwanese people,” Lee expressed to the Post. “That is the reason why we fight so hard to build democracy in Taiwan – and Taiwan and China: We don't have jurisdiction over each other. China did not rule Taiwan for a single day. We are enjoying different political systems, and Taiwan is independent by its reality.”In response to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the islands have significantly bolstered their defenses. By increasing its defense budget to 3% of GDP, extending military conscription from four months to one year, developing a domestic defense industry, and enhancing cyber defense against China's daily cyberattacks, the government hopes it will maintain the status quo and deter Beijing from any thoughts of attack.“The Chinese government conducts three million cyberattacks on Taiwan every day,” Lee revealed. “We have adopted countermeasures, including real-time debunking of disinformation campaigns and media literacy programs to teach our youth to identify fake news.”She also noted the disturbing rise of anti-Israel content on Chinese social media platforms like TikTok. “Pro-Hamas, anti-Israel content is freely spreading inside China. I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.
            



But the relationship is more than just symbolic. Economically, Taiwan and Israel are natural partners. “Taiwan is a leader in hardware, and Israel is a leader in software,” she noted. “Our business and technological cooperation opportunities are enormous. We see a lot of Israeli start-ups coming to Taiwan to find reliable partners, and we have a very business-friendly infrastructure for them.”  This synergy extends to security and democratic resilience. “Taiwan and Israel are standing on the forefront to defend the democratic way of life,” Lee said. “We have been the testing ground for democracy, facing cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and psychological warfare.”Trump's first monthsTrump's return to the White House has prompted intense speculation about his policies toward China and Taiwan. Lee, however, remains measured.“The US is Taiwan's most important partner in security, science, and technology,” she emphasized. “We pay a lot of attention to trade policies and will adapt quickly. A close and deep partnership between Taiwan and the US is essential for maintaining peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.”She pointed out that Trump's fundamental policies on Taiwan have remained consistent. “The US has long-standing policies on Taiwan – support for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo, and bipartisan Congressional backing. We have many good friends in the Trump administration who continue to engage with us and provide substantive support.”However, Taiwan is under no illusions about the volatility of geopolitics. “We are very clear, realistic, and efficient in optimizing our leverage to strengthen our partnership with the US,” Lee stated. “Taiwan's peace and stability are essential for global peace.”One of Trump's most aggressive policies has been his renewed economic war on China, particularly tariffs and restrictions on Chinese technology.Lee acknowledged that Taiwan is watching these moves closely. “Trump's trade policies aim to address issues such as trade imbalances, Chinese overcapacity, and state subsidies. Taiwan, as a trade economy, carefully analyzes all relevant policies.”However, Taiwan's position in global trade is unique. “Currently, 91% of Taiwanese exports to the US are intermediate goods, not consumer goods,” she explained. “These include servers, electronic components, and networking equipment—essential for AI and 5G networks. Our trade with the US is complementary and healthy.”While Taiwan could benefit from US-China tensions by strengthening trade with America, it must also ensure that it does not become collateral damage in any broader economic conflict. “We remain proactive in maintaining a smooth and effective dialogue with every US administration,” Lee said.Taiwan's Silicon ShieldPerhaps the most significant development in US-Taiwan economic relations is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's $100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five cutting-edge fabrication plants in Arizona.“This is a milestone in US-Taiwan trade relations and a historical moment for TSMC,” Lee stated. “It strengthens Taiwan's relevance with the US and helps TSMC better serve its American customers, who make up 60% of its business.”When announced, Trump stated that TSMC's investment ensures the company – a key supplier of the world's most advanced semiconductors – can sidestep the tariffs he has considered applying to the global chip industry.

Our trade with the US is complementary and healthy.”While Taiwan could benefit from US-China tensions by strengthening trade with America, it must also ensure that it does not become collateral damage in any broader economic conflict. “We remain proactive in maintaining a smooth and effective dialogue with every US administration,” Lee said.Taiwan's Silicon ShieldPerhaps the most significant development in US-Taiwan economic relations is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's $100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five cutting-edge fabrication plants in Arizona.“This is a milestone in US-Taiwan trade relations and a historical moment for TSMC,” Lee stated. “It strengthens Taiwan's relevance with the US and helps TSMC better serve its American customers, who make up 60% of its business.”When announced, Trump stated that TSMC's investment ensures the company – a key supplier of the world's most advanced semiconductors – can sidestep the tariffs he has considered applying to the global chip industry. His broader goal is to strengthen US manufacturing and solidify America's trade leverage over both competitors and allies.However, there are concerns that shifting semiconductor production overseas could weaken Taiwan's strategic importance. Lee dismissed such fears. “Even when all overseas manufacturing lines are completed by 2030, 80% of TSMC's production will still remain in Taiwan, and the most critical technology will be kept on the island.”Taiwan's dominance in chip production remains staggering: 60% of the world's total chips are made in Taiwan, 92% of the world's advanced chips (such as 5 nanometer and 3nm semiconductors) come from Taiwan, and 99% of the world's AI chips are produced by Taiwanese companies.“That's why the semiconductor chief industries and TSMC is always referred to as ‘Taiwan's silicon shield' as a protection of our national security,” she told the Post.Taiwan, Ukraine, and lessons learnedTaiwanese leaders have watched the war in Ukraine with deep concern, drawing direct parallels to their own situation with China. However, they are determined not to be caught off guard.“The Ukrainian people are very resilient,” Lee said. “This has been an awakening call for Taiwanese people – that our determination to defend ourselves is critical to our survival.“The future of Taiwan should be determined, decided by Taiwanese people,” Lee expressed to the Post. “That is the reason why we fight so hard to build democracy in Taiwan – and Taiwan and China: We don't have jurisdiction over each other. China did not rule Taiwan for a single day. We are enjoying different political systems, and Taiwan is independent by its reality.”In response to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the islands have significantly bolstered their defenses. By increasing its defense budget to 3% of GDP, extending military conscription from four months to one year, developing a domestic defense industry, and enhancing cyber defense against China's daily cyberattacks, the government hopes it will maintain the status quo and deter Beijing from any thoughts of attack.“The Chinese government conducts three million cyberattacks on Taiwan every day,” Lee revealed. “We have adopted countermeasures, including real-time debunking of disinformation campaigns and media literacy programs to teach our youth to identify fake news.”She also noted the disturbing rise of anti-Israel content on Chinese social media platforms like TikTok. “Pro-Hamas, anti-Israel content is freely spreading inside China. I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.

US President Donald Trump appeared to walk back some of his Gaza plan in a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin this week. At the White House meeting, Trump told Martin that “no one is expelling anyone from Gaza.”This leaves questions about what comes next for Trump's plan regarding Gaza. When he was inaugurated, he had said it was a demolition site. Later, he appeared to develop his views of Gaza as a place that was unlivable after the Hamas-Israel War.He said in early February, according to CNN, “I think that it's a big mistake to allow people – the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza – to go back yet another time, and we don't want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site, and the United States is going to own it, and we'll slowly – very slowly, we're in no rush – develop it.”  Later in February, Trump described the possibilities in Gaza. He said it could be the “Riviera of the Middle East.” However, this also involved re-settling many of the two million people who live in Gaza. There was talk of Egypt or Jordan accepting the people. “You're going to see that they're all going to want to leave,” the AP reported Trump saying. On February 19, this became, “It's a war-torn area. We're going to take it. We're going to hold it. We're going to cherish it.”Another comment indicated that Israel would need to deal with Gaza and then hand it over to the US. Trump also indicated that Israel could do what it wanted in Gaza. He also said Israel could let “hell break loose.” US PRESIDENT Donald Trump welcomes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House last month. While past US presidents have prioritized Israel's safety, Trump has positioned himself as one of the most pro-Israel leaders in modern history, the writer maintains. (credit: LEAH MILLIS/REUTERS)Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli politicians have appeared to embrace the Trump plan.Speaking to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations on February 16, Netanyahu noted, “I have to say that President Trump has presented a bold new vision and the only plan that I think can work to enable a different future for the people of Gaza, for the people of Israel, for the surrounding areas.” He elaborated, “Why not give Gazans a choice? Everybody said this is the largest open-air prison in the world. Not because of us. We let people leave. In fact, if you want to know, over the last couple of years, two years I think, 150,000 Gazans left. You know how they left? Because they bribed their way out, not through us. They bribed their way out. The rich could leave, but if other people wanted to leave, give them a choice, not forcible eviction, not ethnic cleansing. In a war zone, people leave.”Then he noted, “We tried to get the population to leave, to get them out of harm's way…if people want to leave, if they want to emigrate, it's their choice. And I think President Trump's plan is right on the dot.”France 24 noted on February 9 that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the Trump plan was “taking shape, with ongoing actions in coordination with the [US] administration.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Gazans won't be expelledNow that Trump has said that people are not being expelled from Gaza, questions remain about how the plan will take shape.On the one hand, officials continue to indicate that Israel will enable people to leave if they want. However, the question is whether Gazans want to leave and where they would go.Do countries want to take in more than a token number of Gazans? Do they want hundreds of thousands? Is there any evidence that large numbers of people will leave? How will Israel facilitate this? The Trump plan was similar to the many times that Trump has said he supports Israel, and he has put forward a maximum position, but then indicated Israel has to be the one to do it.For instance, the “hell breaks loose” comments were also embraced by Israeli politicians. When it became clear that Israel would have to be the one bringing “hell,” the same people suddenly seemed to fall silent.For instance, on March 1, the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire ended. Israel has not returned to war in Gaza.Instead, Hamas has appeared to receive a Ramadan ceasefire and doesn't have to return any hostages.Almost 60 hostages are in Gaza. Israel doesn't seem to place any urgency on returning them. Reports indicate Israel is waiting on the Trump administration's envoy Steve Witkoff to try to help get a deal. Witkoff was key to the deal in January that saw 33 hostages released in 42 days.However, Witkoff has many things on his plate. He is also dealing with the US push for a ceasefire deal between Ukraine and Russia.The relationship between Israel and the new Trump administration has been unique. Israel sided with the US on a vote at the UN that did not condemn Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Many other countries had embraced the vote or abstained. Israel joined a small number of countries in backing the US.Unlike many countries that have sought to either push back against the Trump administration's initiatives or assert their own policies, Israel appears to mostly be waiting for the Trump administration to make things happen.In Gaza, Hamas got a ceasefire, and Israel got nothing in March. This is in contrast to last Ramadan when Israel agreed to reduce the intensity of the war on Hamas but kept up some pressure.On the Trump plan for Gaza, Israeli officials appeared to leap to embrace it without a full discussion of how it would be implemented. The same thing happened with the hostages.Meanwhile, most countries in the region are asserting their own policies. Egypt has led Arab states to push their own initiative on Gaza. European countries have said they are nonplussed with the US policy regarding Ukraine.This doesn't mean these countries are going to confront the US very much, but they are showing they have their own policies. This is also true regarding the new tariff conflicts with the US.The Trump administration has a doctrine. However, it also wants to get deals. It puts out maximum positions as an opening. Then it waits to see how it has stirred up the proverbial grass. This is the method of the Trump doctrine.When countries embrace the Trump position completely, they paint themselves into a corner. This is because the White House can't wave a magic wand and make everything happen.For instance, when it comes to Gaza, the US isn't going to defeat Hamas for Israel. The US can try to help bring the hostages home, but perceptions that it seemed to see the hostage issue as more urgent than Israel likely appears strange in the region.Back in 1976, when Israel embarked on the Entebbe raid, its leaders put a priority on returning hostages. They didn't wait for the White House to give a green light and make tough statements. Israel appears to have achieved more when it was willing to assert itself and also work with the US and other countries, rather than adopt a kind of “waiting for Godot” policy of seeing what the White House says next.Gaza is a major challenge. In the end, it will require Israel to come up with a plan. In the absence of that, it's unlikely much will change in Gaza.

This is also true regarding the new tariff conflicts with the US.The Trump administration has a doctrine. However, it also wants to get deals. It puts out maximum positions as an opening. Then it waits to see how it has stirred up the proverbial grass. This is the method of the Trump doctrine.When countries embrace the Trump position completely, they paint themselves into a corner. This is because the White House can't wave a magic wand and make everything happen.For instance, when it comes to Gaza, the US isn't going to defeat Hamas for Israel. The US can try to help bring the hostages home, but perceptions that it seemed to see the hostage issue as more urgent than Israel likely appears strange in the region.Back in 1976, when Israel embarked on the Entebbe raid, its leaders put a priority on returning hostages. They didn't wait for the White House to give a green light and make tough statements. Israel appears to have achieved more when it was willing to assert itself and also work with the US and other countries, rather than adopt a kind of “waiting for Godot” policy of seeing what the White House says next.Gaza is a major challenge. In the end, it will require Israel to come up with a plan. In the absence of that, it's unlikely much will change in Gaza.
				



In Gaza, Hamas got a ceasefire, and Israel got nothing in March. This is in contrast to last Ramadan when Israel agreed to reduce the intensity of the war on Hamas but kept up some pressure.On the Trump plan for Gaza, Israeli officials appeared to leap to embrace it without a full discussion of how it would be implemented. The same thing happened with the hostages.Meanwhile, most countries in the region are asserting their own policies. Egypt has led Arab states to push their own initiative on Gaza.

Two days before US agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student and Palestinian activist asked his wife if she knew what to do if immigration agents came to their door.Noor Abdalla, Khalil's wife of more than two years, said she was confused. As a legal permanent resident of the US, surely Khalil did not have to worry about that, she recalls telling him.  ""I didn't take him seriously. Clearly I was naive,"" Abdalla, a US citizen who is eight months pregnant, told Reuters in her first media interview.US Department of Homeland Security agents handcuffed her husband on Saturday in the lobby of their university-owned apartment building in Manhattan. Khalil's arrest is one of the first efforts by President Donald Trump, a Republican who returned to the White House in January, to fulfill his promise to seek deportation of some foreign students involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement.

They told the judge that was a violation of Khalil's constitutional free speech rights.Noor Abdalla, 28, wife of Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil who was detained by ICE, holds a photograph of their wedding day after an interview with Reuters in New York City, U.S., March 12, 2025.

A close aide of ousted Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and vice president of United States Awami League Rabbi Alam said on Wednesday that she will return to the country as PM. He also asked Muhammad Yunus, chief advisor of Bangladesh's interim government to “go back where he came from” while talking to news agency ANI.

Alam raised concerns over the current situation in Bangladesh, saying that it is “under attack” and urged the international community to act up.

“Bangladesh is under attack, and it needs to be addressed by the international community. A political uprising is fine, but that is not what has been going on in Bangladesh. This is a terrorist uprising,” he told ANI.

Alam also expressed gratitude to the Indian government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing “safe” travel passage to Sheikh Hasina, adding that many Bangladeshi leaders are sheltered in India.

“Many of our leaders are sheltered here in India, and we are very thankful to the Indian government for providing the alignment. I also thank PM Narendra Modi for providing a safe travel passage for our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. We are thankful to the people of India,"" Alam said.

‘Sheikh Hasina will be back as PM'Referring to the student-led protests last year that turned violent and led to the ouster of Sheikh Hasina and Bangladesh's PM, Alam said they “made a mistake” because they were “manipulated”.

""We want to ask the Bangladesh Advisor to step down and go back to where you came from. You, Dr Yunus, do not belong in Bangladesh. This is the message for the people of Bangladesh that Sheikh Hasina is coming back, she is coming back as the Prime Minister,” he said. “The young generation, you've made a mistake, you've made some bad things, but that's not your problem, you have been manipulated,” he added.

US President Donald Trump has warned France and other European Union countries that he will impose a 200% tariff on all liquor imports to the United States, including champagne and wines.

Donald Trump's warning came in response to the European Union's 50% tariff on US whisky.

""The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky. If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S,"" he wrote on Truth Social.

On Wednesday, Donald Trump vowed to take back wealth “stolen” by other countries, drawing quick retaliation from Europe and Canada.

“The United States of America is going to take back a lot of what was stolen from it by other countries and, frankly, by incompetent U.S. leadership,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday. “We're going to take back our wealth, and we're going to take back a lot of the companies that left.”

The EU announced its countermeasures on Wednesday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was “applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,” or about $28 billion.

Those measures, which cover not just steel and aluminium products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods, are due to take effect on April 1, reported AP.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer responded by saying that the EU was punishing America instead of fixing what he viewed as excess capacity in steel and aluminium production.

“The EU's punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States – and indeed international security – and is yet another indicator that the EU's trade and economic policies are out of step with reality,” he said in a statement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday made his first comments on Washington's plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. During the press briefing, he started with ""words of gratitude"" for US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with other state heads, for paying attention to the Ukraine conflict despite having ""a lot on our plates"".

""First of all, I would like to start with words of gratitude to the president of the United States, Mr Trump, for paying so much attention to the Ukraine settlement. All of us have lots on our plates, but many state leaders, the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the Prime Minister of India, president of Brazil and South African Republic. They devote a lot of time to this issue, and we are thankful to them because it's all for the noble cause of stopping hostilities and preventing human casualties,"" he said.

PM Modi, during a meeting with Trump at the White House last month, stressed that ""India is not neutral"" in its stand on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. ""India is not neutral. India is siding with peace. I have already said to President Putin that this is not the era of war. I support the efforts taken by President Trump,"" the Prime Minister had said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India have been stressing that this is ""not an era of war but of dialogue and diplomacy"". Since the Ukraine conflict began in February last year, PM Modi has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a number of times.

The United States, meanwhile, has called for Russia to agree to the ceasefire proposal without any conditions.

Putin, however, said that while he was ""for"" the proposed ceasefire, but ""there are nuances"", and he had ""serious questions"" about how it would work.

Trump said Putin's statement was ""promising"" but ""not complete"".

""He put out a very promising statement but it wasn't complete,"" Trump, who was meeting NATO chief Mark Rutte at the White House, told reporters when asked about Putin's remarks.

Ukraine agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire at talks in Saudi Arabia this week, bowing to pressure after a showdown between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on February 28.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and injured, displacing millions of people, reducing towns to rubble and triggering the sharpest confrontation between Moscow and the West in decades.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A British citizen, who came to Delhi to meet a man she befriended on Instagram, was raped by him at a Mahipalpur hotel. The police have arrested the accused, Kailash, in a rape case and his friend, Wasim, has been charged with molesting the UK tourist.

Police have said the woman had come to India for a holiday in Maharashtra and Goa. She called Kailash from there and asked him to join her. Kailash said he could not travel and asked her to come to Delhi. The woman reached Delhi on Tuesday and lodged at a hotel in Mahipalpur. She then called Kailash and he reached the hotel with his friend Wasim. He allegedly raped her that night.

The next morning, the woman approached the Vasant Kunj police station and registered a complaint. As per guidelines, police have informed the British High Commission about the incident and they are assisting the UK national too.

Kailash, it is learnt, works at a private firm. The woman has told police that he struggled to speak English and used Google Translate to communicate with her.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Miami Beach mayor also proposes withdrawing grant after O Cinema screened Palestinian-focused documentary

The mayor of Miami Beach is attempting to evict an independent cinema from city-owned property after it screened No Other Land, the film about Palestinian displacement in the West Bank that just won the Oscar for best documentary.

Steven Meiner's proposal would terminate O Cinema's lease and withdraw $40,000 in promised grant funding. In a newsletter sent to residents on Tuesday, Meiner condemned the film as “a false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents”.

Meiner had previously urged the O Cinema to cancel scheduled screenings of the documentary, citing criticism from Israeli and German officials. According to the mayor's newsletter, O Cinema's CEO, Vivian Marthell, allegedly agreed to withdraw the film from programming, citing “concerns of antisemitic rhetoric”, but Meiner claimed she reversed her decision the following day. The screenings sold out and the cinema added additional dates in March.

“Our decision to screen NO OTHER LAND is not a declaration of political alignment. It is, however, a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard,” Marthell told the Miami Herald.

The documentary, which won the Academy Award for best documentary feature last week, follows the destruction of Palestinian villages in the occupied West Bank and chronicles the unlikely friendship between a Palestinian activist, Basel Adra, and Israeli journalist, Yuval Abraham, who co-directed the film.

Tensions over free speech and Palestinian activism nationwide have been further heightened this week after Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia student activist and green-card holder who helped lead the Palestinian solidarity movement during the college encampments last year, was detained by immigration authorities. The US president, Donald Trump, has alleged without evidence that Khalil has links to “pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity”.

A White House official told the Free Press that Khalil, who was arrested without charge, poses a “threat to the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States” and the “allegation here is not that he was breaking the law”.

A recent Gallup poll shows support for Israel has plummeted to a 25-year low, while Palestinian sympathy has surged.

Kristen Rosen Gonzalez, a Miami Beach commissioner, said she shared the mayor's negative assessment of the film but cautioned against a “kneejerk reaction” that could trigger “costly legal battles”, and noted O Cinema's “longstanding commitment to the Jewish community”.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida has called the mayor's retaliation against O Cinema unconstitutional. “The government does not get to pick and choose which viewpoints the public is allowed to hear, however controversial some might find them,” Daniel Tilley, the branch's legal director, told Axios.

Free speech advocates are also mobilizing against what they see as dangerous government overreach targeting constitutional rights.

“Screening movies to make sure they conform to local censors' tastes is a practice we left behind with the red scare,” said Adam Steinbaugh, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire).

“If the first amendment doesn't mean that a movie theater can show an Oscar-winning film, something is seriously wrong.”

Miami Beach has faced past controversy over artistic expression in 2019, when the city removed a portrait of Raymond Herisse, a Black man fatally shot by Beach police, from a city art project.

The mayor's proposal to cancel the cinema's lease is set for a commission vote next Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Researchers say environmental impact from Kakhovka dam explosion comparable to Chornobyl nuclear disaster

The destruction of a large Ukrainian dam in 2023 triggered a “toxic timebomb” of environmental harm, a study has found.

Lakebed sediments holding 83,000 tonnes of heavy metals were exposed when the Kakhovka dam was blown up one year into Russia's invasion, researchers found.

Less than 1% of these “highly toxic” heavy metals – which include lead, cadmium and nickel – are likely to have been released when the reservoir drained, the scientists found. They said the remaining pollutants would leach into rivers as rains wore down the sediment, threatening human health in a region where river water is widely used to make up for shortages in municipal water supplies.

The lead author, Oleksandra Shumilova, said the scale of the environmental impacts was comparable to the Chornobyl nuclear disaster.

“All these pollutants that were deposited on the bottom can accumulate in different organisms, pass through the food web, and spread from vegetation to animals to humans,” said Shumilova, a scientist at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries. “Its consequences can be compared to the effects of radiation.”

The researchers linked on-the-ground measurements with remote sensing data and hydrology models to map the environmental impacts of the dam's destruction, which flooded the region and killed 84 people. They estimated water from the breach killed 20-30% of floodplain rodents, along with the entire juvenile fish stock.

They said the reservoir released 9,000-17,000 tonnes of phytoplankton each day in the first week after the dam was blown up, driving an increase in water turbidity that led to the “probable loss” of 10,000 tonnes of macroinvertebrates.

The destruction of natural life detailed in the study appears to contrast with the striking images of wildlife that has returned to the reservoir since the dam burst. White willows and black poplars have reforested the land, and wild boars and other animals have taken over areas that people still avoid. Fish that have not been seen for decades, such as sturgeon and herring, have returned to the water.

The researchers expect that the area will reach a level of biodiversity equivalent to 80% of an undammed ecosystem within five years.

“It's not recovery, it's better to use a word such as re-establish,” said Shumilova. “It means that it will develop its own way, but not necessarily to the initial conditions.”

The Kakhovka dam, which was built in the 1950s on the Dnipro River, was destroyed on 6 June 2023 while under Russian occupation. Its reservoir supplied water to cool the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and irrigate southern Ukraine.

Ukrainian ecologists have debated whether the dam should be rebuilt after the war – and how much land should be flooded if it is – with some arguing for the new ecosystem to be left alone as part of a growing movement to rewild human-disturbed areas. Shumilova said that the unresolved question of heavy metal contamination complicated this approach, because it was unclear whether the vegetation was enough to keep the exposed sediments in place.

“It's still something that people have to investigate,” she said. “Presently, it's difficult because of the war – it's difficult for scientists to go there to take samples and conduct experiments.”

Shumilova, a Berlin-based researcher whose home town of Mykolaiv was cut off from water for a full month at the start of the war, said the study findings were relevant for peacetime removals of large dams, as well as for other wars between industrialised countries.

Water has repeatedly been used as a weapon of war in Ukraine, with attackers and defenders having blown up dams for military gain. Legal scholars say the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, which Ukraine blames on Russia, and which Russia disputes, could constitute an environmental war crime.

Shah Maruf, a law researcher at the University of Dhaka who has published research on the legal consequences of the Kakhovka dam's destruction, said the new findings “suggest that the damage is ‘widespread, long-term, and severe', fulfilling one of the key requirements for an environmental war crime”.

But he added that the speed of the ecosystem's recovery could affect the strength of the case. “If the recovery is faster – and if that was anticipated by the perpetrator while attacking – that may compromise the finding of ‘long-term' damage in the context of environmental war crime.”

Last month, a separate study exploring the effects of the Kakhovka dam destruction on the Black Sea ecosystems observed some habitats and species replenishing, but found “significant habitat destruction, disturbances and pollutant damages remain”.

Carol Stepien, an ecologist at the Smithsonian Institution and co-author of the study, said Ukraine's freshwater, estuarine and marine species “evolved under conditions of longtime flux”, exposing them to a range of temperatures, salinity levels and habitat qualities. This “may aid their resilience and recovery”, she added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The defense secretary has empowered his lawyer Tim Parlatore to remake the judge advocate general's corps

The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is expected in the coming weeks to start a sweeping overhaul of the judge advocate general's corps as part of an effort to make the US military less restricted by the laws of armed conflict, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The changes are poised to have implications across the military, as Hegseth's office considers changes to the interpretation of the US rules of engagement on the battlefield to the way that charges are brought under the military justice system.

The defense department is currently in the process of nominating new judge advocate generals (Jags) for the army, navy and air force after Hegseth fired their predecessors in a late-night purge last month, and the overhaul is not expected to start until they are in place.

But remaking the Jag corps is a priority for Hegseth, who on Friday commissioned his personal lawyer and former naval officer Tim Parlatore as a navy commander to oversee the effort carrying the weight and authority of the defense secretary's office.

The commission is as a reservist in the Jag corps and he will continue to run his private practice outside his military obligations. Parlatore previously defended Donald Trump for mishandling classified documents and former Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher on war crimes charges.

The overhaul of the Jag corps will be aimed at retraining military lawyers, the people said, so that they provide more expansive legal advice to commanders to pursue more aggressive tactics and take a more lenient approach in charging soldiers with battlefield crimes.

Part of that approach reflects Parlatore's views on Jag officers, whom he has described to associates as effectively becoming involved in decision making and failing to exercise discretion when deciding what charges to include in military prosecutions.

One of the complaints has been that Jags have been too restrictive in interpreting rules of engagement and took the requirement that soldiers positively identify a target as an enemy combatant before opening fire to mean soldiers needed to identify the target having a weapon.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The criticism of the Jag corps has come from both Hegseth and Parlatore, the people said. Hegseth has made reworking the rules of engagement a tenet of how he intends to lead the defense department and about the need to restore a “warrior ethos” to a US military leadership he sees as soft.

Some of those rules were a deliberate policy shift by the US military, after senior officers such as Gen David Petraeus came to believe that civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan were turning the local population against US forces and drawing support to the enemy.

But in his book, The War on Warriors, Hegseth derisively referred to the lawyers as “jagoffs” and expressed frustration with the laws of armed conflict as being too restrictive for frontline soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, which allowed the enemy to score battlefield victories.

And in Trump's first term, Hegseth privately and publicly as a host on Fox and Friends appealed to Trump to pardon US soldiers accused of committing war crimes, including Gallagher, who was accused of murdering a captive Islamic State fighter in Mosul.

Hegseth's views as expressed in his book are shared by Parlatore, who saw the Gallagher case as an example of overzealous prosecution and suggested he could reform the Jag corps because he had experience as both a former officer and defense lawyer.

Parlatore made clear to the defense secretary's office that he was not pushing for the US to not abide by the Geneva conventions and the uniform code of military justice even if the US's enemies ignored them. But he intends to change how they are interpreted, the people said.

The legal positions of Jags has often been fraught, including in the George W Bush administration after the September 11 terrorist attacks, when Jags resisted the administration's view that Bush could lawfully direct the military to ignore the Geneva conventions when handling detainees.

The Bush administration claimed it was taking the justice department's legal interpretations and moved to cut out military lawyers from deliberations, and then tried to subordinate them to politically appointed civilian general counsels for their branches.

In 2004, Congress passed laws that made it illegal for anyone at the Pentagon to interfere with the ability of Jags to “give independent legal advice” to secretaries and chiefs of staffs for their branches. But it did not constrain a reform of the Jag corps from within.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

When she took over after her brother Gianni's murder, few expected her to last 27 years and become a household name

When Donatella Versace took over the house of Versace in the aftermath of her brother Gianni's murder, most observers privately assumed that her reign would be no more than a postscript. The bottle-blond younger sister, with no formal training and a drug addiction that was the fashion industry's worst kept secret, was seen as a sentimental appointment by a shell-shocked family.

She proved everyone wrong. Versace is now defined as much by Donatella as by Gianni. She steps down from designing after 27 years as an icon in her own right, one of the most successful female designers in modern fashion history. Sober for 20 years, she has steered Versace to become a global household name, valued at $2bn (£1.6bn) when it was sold to Capri Holdings six and a half years ago.

Versace found her voice as a designer and as a champion of LGBTQ+ rights. She was praised for taking a stand against Italy's anti-gay policies after saying in a speech in 2023: “Our government is trying to take away people's rights to live as they wish.”

She looked destined to be consigned to the fashion history books with the untimely death of Gianni Versace. But her talent and determination have helped the brand thrive as a living force that still has the power to set trends, and made it potent and desirable to a generation of consumers who have only ever known her as its designer. Gianni recognised and championed her instincts – the safety pin as a Versace motif was an idea she had brought to his atelier – and her fluency with the codes of the house fuelled a growing self-confidence.

With an appetite for pop culture, many of Versace's defining moments, from Jennifer Lopez in a jungle-green dress slashed to the navel in 2019 to a collection co-designed with Dua Lipa in 2023, have happened under her watch. She has been a hands-on presence in the design studio. “Versace is what it is today because of Donatella Versace,” said Emmanuel Gintzburger, the brand's chief executive, when the succession plan was announced.

In private, she is kind and generous, funny and self-aware. When a journalist enquired how old her adored jack russell was during an interview in 2016, she replied: “Audrey is eight – but can you write six?” Her cartoonish image – shellacked walnut skin, platinum hair, petite frame jacked up on spike heels – belies a lack of ego unusual in a star designer.

She has always seen herself as the custodian queen of Versace, with a responsibility to keep her brother's spirit alive. That she is handing her job title to Dario Vitale, a well-respected designer and image maker who has played a major role in the success of Miu Miu, one of the hottest brands in the world, demonstrates her desire to champion the Versace name, not just her own. “I am excited to see Versace through new eyes,” she said in a statement.

Donatella will remain a Versace figurehead as chief brand ambassador. She inspires fierce loyalty in her glamorous circle, and will continue to leverage the A-list names she has on speed dial. In 2017, when she reunited Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington and Claudia Schiffer on her runway, she revealed that the moment in 1991 when the supermodels lip-synced to Freedom in a Versace show, re-enacting their roles in the video to George Michael's song, was something she had suggested to her brother. “The combination of fashion and personality was magic,” she recalled of that show. A very Donatella kind of magic.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Raphael Satter had his OCI card taken away after publishing a story critical of an Indian businessman

A US journalist has taken the Indian government to court after his Indian overseas citizenship was unilaterally cancelled, after the publication of a story critical of a prominent Indian businessman.

Raphael Satter, who covers cybersecurity for the Reuters news agency in the US, received a letter from India's ministry of home affairs in early December 2023, accusing him of producing work that “maliciously” tarnished India's reputation and informing him that his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card had been cancelled.

OCI status is given to foreign citizens of Indian origin, or those married to Indian nationals, and allows for visa-free travel, residency and employment in India. Satter received his OCI through marriage. The cancellation of his OCI status means he is no longer able to travel to India, where members of his family live.

In recent years, the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, led by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has been accused of revoking OCI privileges for those it has deemed critical, part of what Human Rights Watch has called a campaign of “politically motivated repression”.

Journalists, academics and activists have been a particular target. Several high-profile journalists have been forced to leave the country after their OCI cards were revoked and academics have been turned away at the Indian border.

According to the letter sent to Satter in December 2023, his OCI status was revoked for his alleged “practising [of] journalism without proper permission” and for work that had been “maliciously creating adverse and biased opinion against Indian institutions in the international arena”.

Satter, who works in Washington DC, denies ever conducting journalism in India and has only travelled to the country to visit family.

The Indian government provided no specifics to Satter's lawyers on how his journalistic work had been deemed a national security threat to India. However, Satter's lawyers noted that the cancellation of his OCI came at exactly the same time that a defamation case had been filed against him in India for a story he had written on the Indian cybersecurity company Appin and its co-founder Rajat Khare.

Satter's investigation for Reuters, titled “How an Indian startup hacked the world”, exposed the workings of Appin, alleging it had become “a hack-for-hire powerhouse that stole secrets from executives, politicians, military officials and wealthy elites around the globe”.

Rajat Khare's US representative, the lawfirm Clare Locke, rejected any association between its client and the cyber-mercenary business, telling Reuters that Khare “has never operated or supported, and certainly did not create, any illegal ‘hack for hire' industry in India or anywhere else”.

During the course of his inquiries into Appin and Khare, Satter said that he had received a series of threats made by individuals associated with the company, “one of whom alluded to potential ‘diplomatic action' unless I abandoned my reporting”.

“The petitioner and his employer, Reuters, began receiving threats from individuals linked to a company called Appin, which has hacked organisations in India and abroad,” Satter's court petition says.

On the same day that Satter received the notice of the OCI cancellation, a Delhi judge granted an injunction against the story, forcing it to be temporarily taken down. It was restored 10 months later. Karuna Nundy, the lawyer representing Satter, said the timing clearly “linked” the two events. She emphasised that, under Indian law, defamation is not grounds for OCI cancellation.

Khare has been active in pursuing news organisations that have published articles on the activities of Appin. According to an investigation by Reporters Without Borders, at least 15 media outlets investigating Appin received legal notices and five have been subjected to legal proceedings.

The New Yorker and the Sunday Times are among those who have faced legal action by entities representing Khare, who also has initiated legal proceedings in Switzerland against a story that mentioned his name. Reporters Without Borders described the magnitude of these gag lawsuits as “unprecedented”.

The first court hearing for Satter's case was heard in Delhi this week. In a statement sent to the Guardian, Satter said the Indian government's decision to cancel his OCI had “effectively cut me off from members of my family and a country I hold in great affection and respect”.

Satter was insistent that the decision was a “mistake or on a misunderstanding” by the ministry of home affairs and that he had only decided to go to court after not receiving any response to his appeal to the government for more than a year.

“I am confident that, once the integrity of my journalism is demonstrated before the Indian courts and the true and correct facts are brought to the fore, the ministry of home affairs will see fit to restore my OCI card,” he said. The ministry of home affairs did not respond to requests for comment about Satter's case.

The Indian government now has until the next hearing, on 22 May, to respond to the petition and give legal justification for Satter's OCI cancellation.

The Modi government has cancelled more than 100 OCI cards while in power for the last decade. Among them was the journalist Aatish Taseer, after he wrote a cover article for Time magazine criticising the prime minister.

“The Indian authorities should not be attempting to silence critics by revoking residency rights or other means,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, the deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “Instead, the authorities should have the maturity to accept legitimate criticism and work on reforms.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Homes searched in inquiry into alleged corruption at European parliament relating to Chinese technology giant

Several people have been arrested and homes searched as part of an investigation into alleged bribery and corruption at the European parliament relating to the Chinese technology giant Huawei, Belgian prosecutors have said.

The investigating judge in charge of the case has asked for seals to be fixed to the offices of two European parliament assistants alleged to be involved.

“The alleged bribery is said to have benefited Huawei,” Belgium's federal prosecutor said in a statement on Thursday afternoon, after an earlier statement that did not mention the company.

The first statement said that several individuals had been arrested for questioning over their alleged involvement “in active corruption within the European parliament”, as well as forgery and use of forgeries. The prosecutor said the alleged offences were “committed by a criminal organisation” and had been practised regularly and discreetly from 2021 to the present.

Since the first Donald Trump administration, European countries have faced intense pressure from the US not to use Huawei equipment in their 5G networks on national security grounds.

Huawei has been contacted for comment, but has yet to make a statement on the reports.

People involved in the alleged criminal “cash for influence” scheme are suspected to have been paid for taking political positions or to have received “excessive gifts” such as food, travel expenses and invitations to football matches. All this was done for “promoting purely private commercial interests in the context of political decisions”, the prosecutor said.

Investigators are also examining whether money laundering took place, as they suspect intermediaries may have received payments to disguise the trail.

The allegations were first reported by the Belgian media and the investigative outlet Follow the Money, which said that about 15 current and former MEPs were “on the radar” of investigators.

The authorities said “several people” had been arrested for questioning, including one male suspect in France under a European arrest warrant, but declined to give further details. More than 21 searches were carried out by more than 100 police officers across Belgium and in Portugal.

A European parliament spokesperson said: “We have received a request for cooperation from the Belgian authorities to assist the investigation, which the parliament will swiftly and fully honour.”

Transparency campaigners said the allegations were as serious as the Qatargate scandal that shook the European parliament three years ago, when a Greek vice-president of the parliament, Eva Kaili, and an Italian former MEP, Pier Antonio Panzeri, were among suspects charged by police with corruption and money laundering over activities said to benefit Qatar.

In January 2025, the Belgian former MEP Maria Arena said she had been charged with participating in a criminal organisation as part of the same investigation.

But he adds that the new minerals deal with Ukraine “will get us something back, a lot back,” even as he complains “we were treated very unfairly” by Europeans.

Rasmus Jarlov, the chairman of Denmark's defense committee, has criticized Nato secretary general Mark Rutte for “joking with [Donald] Trump about Greenland” following a meeting between the two leaders during which Trump said the annexation of the island “will happen.”

During their meeting in the White House's Oval Office, Trump was asked about the potential annexation of Greenland, to which he replied: “Well, I think it will happen. I'm just thinking, I didn't give it much thought before, but I'm sitting with a man that could be very instrumental… Mark, we need that for international security … as we have a lot of our favourite players, cruising around the coast.”

Rutte then said: “I don't want to drag Nato into it,” but agreed that Greenland and the Artic Circle pose security value, pointing to China and Russia's growing presence in the area.

In response to Trump and Rutte's comments, Jarlov said: “We do not appreciate the Secr. Gen. of Nato joking with Trump about Greenland like this. It would mean war between two Nato countries. Greenland has just voted against immediate independence from Denmark and does not want to be American ever.”

Ukraine will not agree to a frozen conflict with Russia, according to Ukraine's president chief of staff, Andriy Yermak.

“We said very clearly that we will never agree to a frozen conflict,” Yermak said, Reuters reports on Thursday. Yermak's comments come amid talks between Ukraine and the US in Saudi Arabia. Both Ukraine and the US have jointly proposed a 30-day ceasefire in the 3-year war.

Yermak added that European representatives will also take part in the peace process, saying, “The main thing is that Ukraine is not alone, Ukraine is with its partners… We agreed with our American partners that representatives of Europe will definitely take part in the peace process.”

Russian president Vladimir Putin has said that Russia was technically “in favour” of the proposed ceasefire on Ukraine, but heavily caveated that with “nuances” and “serious issues” that need to be resolved before the proposal can be progressed further (16:51 and 17:13).

He further listed a number of practical issues, including on resolving the Ukrainian “incursion” in Russia's Kursk region and on monitoring any violations, as well as “addressing the roots of the crisis,” prompting fears he could be about to put forward maximalist Russia's demands on Ukraine and European allies (17:25 and 17:41).

Responding to his comments, US president Donald Trump said they were “promising,” but “not complete” (17:48). He added that it would be “very disappointing” if Russia rejects the offer, and appeared to pick up on Putin's suggestion the pair have a call to hash out the differences.

Putin is understood to be talking to Trump's senior aide Steve Witkoff in Moscow tonight.

In first Ukrainian public response to Putin's comment, Zelenskyy's most senior aide said Ukraine will not agree to a frozen conflict and insisted Europe would have to be involved in peace talks (19:19).

Separately, Trump also made explosive comments about Greenland saying he thought annexation of the island “will happen” as he appeared to dismiss Denmark's rule over the island (19:06).

Finally, the German parliament held a heated debate over the incoming government's sweeping plans to increase the country's defence and infrastructure spending and making changes to the constitutional debt break (12:36, 13:00, 13:17, 13:33, and report)

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, as I hand the blog over to Maya Yang, who will guide you through the evening.

I just wanted to quickly pick up on Trump's comments about the Greenland election where he said that “the person that did the best is a very good person as far as we are concerned, so we will be talking about it and it is very important”…

Well, I'm not sure about that.

The Demokraatit party, which won the election, had the following paragraph in its election manifesto:

US President Donald Trump has now repeatedly mused about buying Greenland.

Let's be clear: Greenland is not for sale. Not today. Not tomorrow. Never, ever.

Our country is not a commodity, and the idea of ​​buying us shows a profound lack of respect for our values. We are a proud nation that works hard for our freedom and future.

They then went on to say they wanted to “cooperate and trade” with others, including the US, “but it must always be done on our terms and with respect for who we are.”

They concluded:

Trump can drop the idea. Greenland is not for sale.

Vladimir Putin has said he has many questions about the proposed US-brokered ceasefire with Ukraine and appeared to set out a series of sweeping conditions that would need to be met before Russia would agree to such a truce.

The Russian leader suggested that Ukraine should neither rearm nor mobilise and that western military aid to Kyiv be halted during the 30-day ceasefire.

At the same time, Putin said that he agreed in principle with US proposals to halt the fighting and complemented Trump for his efforts to stop the war.

By avoiding an outright rejection of Trump's ceasefire proposal, Putin appears to be balancing between not openly rebuffing Trump's push for peace while also imposing his own stringent demands – potentially prolonging negotiations.

In the meantime, Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said that Ukraine will not agree to a frozen conflict with Russia.

“We will not go for a frozen conflict, our US partners are also against such a scenario. We are against Minsk 3, and Europe will be included in the peace process,” he said.

In a TV clip, posted also on his social media accounts, he further said that Ukraine had agreed with the US that representatives from Europe will definitely take part in the peace process.

And that's it for comments from Trump-Rutte meeting at the White House.

Trump also gets asked about fears among some Nato allies about the aggressive position of Russia and if he thinks these fears are justified.

No, I think [so].

When this gets done, it's done, they're going to all want to go home and rest. 

I don't see it happening.

And we'll make sure it doesn't happen. Not going to happen, but we'll make sure it doesn't happen.

Trump also gets asked about his leverage on Russia.

He insists he “does have a leverage,” but doesn't want to talk about it because “we're talking to him and based on the statements he made today, they were pretty positive.”

I hope Russia is going to make the deal too. …

I don't think they're going back to shooting again. I really believe if we had … if we get a peace treaty, a ceasefire treaty I think that leads to peace, that's going to really lead to peace.

I don't think anyone wants to go back [to shooting]. …

And I think if, if President Putin agrees and does a cease fire, I think we're going to … be in very good shape to get it done.

Trump repeats again that he stepped up the US support for Ukraine and “stopped” the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.

On Greenland, Trump gets asked about his vision for potential annexation of the island.

“Well, I think it will happen. I'm just thinking, I didn't give it much thought before, but I'm sitting with a man that could be very instrumental,” he says, as he turns to Rutte saying “Mark, we need that for international security … as we have a lot of our favourite players, cruising around the coast.”

Rutte distances himself from his comments on annexing Greenland, but says Trump is right talking about growing risks in the North Arctic.

Trump is then asked about the recent elections in Greenland, and says “it was a good election for us.”

“The person that did the best is a very good person as far as we are concerned, so we will be talking about it and it is very important,” he says.

The president says the US “is going to order” 48 icebreakers, and that would help to strengthen US position “as that whole area is becoming very important.”

“So we are going to have to make a deal on that and Denmark is not able to do that [offer protection],” he says.

He then mocks Denmark saying they have “nothing to do with that” as “a boat landed there 200 years ago or something, and they say they have rights to it?” “I don't know if that is true.”

“We have been dealing with Denmark, we have been dealing with Greenland, and we have to do it,” he says.

He again suggests Nato could be involved given its bases there, asking defence secretary Pete Hegseth if he should send more troops there. “Don't answer that Pete,” he laughs.

Trump also gets asked about Nato, and he praises Rutte for making the alliance step up.

Nato is stepping up through this man.

This man is a man that only knows how to step up. And we have the same goal in mind.

We want the war ended, and he's doing his job. He only knows how to do a good job. That's one thing. That's why I fought for him to get that job, because they had some other candidates that I'll tell you would not have done a very good job.

Rutte jokes he will need a clip of his comments for his family archives.

Trump then repeats his line that US spends too much even though “we are on the other side of the ocean.”

But he adds that the new minerals deal with Ukraine “will get us something back, a lot back,” even as he complains “we were treated very unfairly” by Europeans.

Trump reveals a bit more of what was going on in negotiations on the ceasefire as he says that “a lot of individual subjects have been discussed.”

Well, we'd like to see a cease fire from Russia. And we have, you know, not been working in the dark.

We've been discussing … Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement. There's a power plant involved. You know, very big power plant involved. Who's going to get the power plant and who's going to get this and that?

And so, you know, it's, it's not an easy process. But phase 1 is the ceasefire.

He goes on:

We've been discussing concepts of land because you don't want to waste time with the ceasefire, if, it's not going to mean anything. So we're saying: look, this is what you can get, this is what you can't get.

They discuss Nato, and being in Nato, and everybody knows what the answer to that is. Know that answer for 40 years, in all fairness.

So a lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed. Now we're going to see whether or not Russia is there, and if they're not, it'll be a very disappointing moment for the world.

On Putin's first reaction, he says it was “a very promising statement, but it wasn't complete,” and adds “I would love to meet with him or talk to him, but we have to get it over with fast.”

As part of his opening statement, Trump talks about Nato and how countries need to step up and pay their fair share (including, once again, a pointed praise of Poland for spending above targets).

He says that his comments that “I won't protect if you are not paying” got you criticism from Russia, but “if [I didn't say that,] nobody would have paid.”

He then goes back to Ukraine and Russia, and says:

We're getting words that things are going okay in Russia, but that doesn't mean anything until we hear what the final outcome is. 

But they have very serious discussions going on right now with President Putin and others, and hopefully they all want to end this nightmare.

…

So we hopefully are going to be in a good position sometime today to have a good idea. 

We'll have we know where we are with Ukraine, and we are getting good signals out of Russia as to where we are with Russia, and hopefully they'll do the right thing.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Farmers sweat as they await word on whether Donald Trump will extend tariffs to $6.2bn in meat exports

Australian farmers are anxiously waiting to hear whether $6.2bn in meat exports will be hit in the next round of Trump tariffs, as Anthony Albanese says the fight to reverse American imposts on steel and aluminium could last months.

Amid escalating fears of a global trade war that would hit exporting nations such as Australia particularly hard, the chief executive of Cattle Australia (CA), Chris Parker, said he was “extremely concerned by the protectionist comments from the US president regarding potential implementation of tariffs on agricultural products”.

“Promoting free trade and market access is a fundamental issue for CA, and any new initiative that is a barrier to international trade is something that we will vigorously oppose on behalf of Australia's beef producers,” Parker said in a statement.

Sign up for Guardian Australia's breaking news email

Parker said while he had been closely following the rapidly evolving situation in the US “for some time”, the lack of information made it impossible to estimate the potential hit to the industry.

“Australia has worked hard to gain market access and negotiate trade agreements around the world, which provides the beef export sector with some resilience – we do not want to see that compromised,” he said.

The Australian National University honorary professor and non-resident fellow at the Lowy institute, Jenny Gordon, described Donald Trump's tariffs as “bonkers”, but agreed retaliation would only hurt Australians more.

“To take a generous view of Trump - which I know is very hard to do - he is actually trying to respond to an American constituency who feels really harmed by the neo-liberal economic growth agenda that's been going on over there for the last three, four decades,” Gordon said.

“But his policy solutions are bonkers because they won't work. They're internally inconsistent. So on one hand, he says we're going to have all these tariffs to make all this tariff revenue to be able to cut taxes – noting that the tax cuts are for the rich. At the same time, he says we're going to onshore everything. So America will produce everything at home. Either have lots of tariff revenue, or you're producing everything at home – you don't get both.

“Then the other problem is, even if you are producing everything at home – and the US conceivably can do that, unlike Australia – they'll be a lot poorer. So the US is really shooting themselves in the foot.”

Gordon, a former chief economist at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said retaliatory tariffs would simply lead to Australians paying more for imported goods.

She argued the best option would be to use the World Trade Organisation to mount a unified defence of free trade alongside other trade-reliant countries, such as South Korea, Japan and even China.

The United States is Australia's number one international market for beef, lamb and goat meat. Australian producers sold $6.2bn in beef and meat to the US in 2024, or nearly 30% of the $39bn total in that year.

Meat is the second largest export to the US after gold, followed by $1.9bn in pharmaceutical sales (which includes products from well known companies such as CSL and Cochlear).

In comparison, aluminium and steel exports to the US – which were slapped with 25% US tariffs this week – were together worth $812m in 2024, according to ANZ analysis.

The Albanese government this week ramped up its rhetoric after Trump's decision to go ahead with higher taxes on metal exports, despite official efforts to secure a similar exemption won in 2018 during the president's previous term.

The industry minister, Ed Husic, this week branded Trump's tariffs on Australian steel and aluminium a “dog act” but business groups have backed the government's determination not to follow in Canada and China's wake and retaliate to American trade aggression.

Albanese on Thursday preached patience, saying, “The last time around it took many months of negotiations and lobbying in order to achieve an outcome.”

“We'll continue to advocate over coming days and weeks, and if need be, months as well, to put our strong position. What we won't do is to punish Australians by lifting prices, which is what tariffs would do,” Albanese told ABC radio.

The three states that drive beef and sheep meat production and export are Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales.

The general manager of international markets at Meat & Livestock Australia, Andrew Cox, said the red meat industry “supports free and fair trade” and that the US is “a highly valued and long-term trading partner”.

“We are watching the trade environment very closely and are avoiding speculation about any tariffs that would drive up prices of food,” Cox said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Exclusive: Jotham Napat said pact must be taken ‘back to the drawing board' and should reflect climate change as security issue

Vanuatu's new prime minister has said his government intends to “revisit” a security agreement with Australia, arguing it does not reflect his country's priorities including climate change and travel mobility for its citizens.

Jotham Napat, who was elected in February, said the pact with Canberra had to be taken “back to the drawing board” as he sought a “win-win situation” in a renegotiated deal.

“Climate change for us is a security issue that is not reflected in the security agreement,” Napat told the Guardian.

“It's something that we would like to revisit and be able to discuss openly with the Australian government.”

The bipartisan security deal, signed in 2022 but yet to be ratified by either nation, aims to strengthen cooperation in areas including disaster response, policing, cybersecurity and border security. Climate change is mentioned once in the document, under a section on “Environment and Resource Security”.

In addition to greater reference to climate change, Napat said he also wanted “an official waiver-free agreement with Australia” as part of a new deal so citizens could more easily travel between the two countries.

He had already spoken about these terms to Australian officials including the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, and they were “happy for the two countries to revisit the security agreement”.

In a statement to the Guardian, an Australian foreign affairs department spokesperson said the government “welcome[s] recent comments by Vanuatu's leaders on strengthening the bilateral relationship” and was “listening to Vanuatu's priorities”.

Australia's push for security and policing agreements with Pacific countries – including Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu, Solomon Islands, Fiji – has been widely viewed as part of its effort to counter China's growing influence in the region. Beijing has expanded its security, diplomatic and economic presence across the Pacific, most recently signing a wide-ranging strategic partnership with the Cook Islands that covers areas including deep-sea mining, education and transport.

When asked about China, Napat said Vanuatu did not “have any preferences” in development partners: “We treat Australia the same as China and the United States.”

Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at the Lowy Institute, said Vanuatu was well positioned to take advantage of the geopolitical competition.

“Vanuatu has a lot of leverage right now – Australia needs these sorts of security partnerships,” he said. “It's looking to formalise existing activities and to elevate existing agreements wherever it can in a bid to build strategic insulation from China's encroachment.”

China had been taking an “opportunistic approach” to expanding security partnerships in the Pacific, Sora said, relying on individual Pacific leaders to take up its open offers for further support. “China is looking to elevate its political ties and then for that to open the way for closer security cooperation across the Pacific.”

Vanuatu's bid to secure new commitments with Australia comes as the US looks to retreat from significant pledges it has made to Pacific countries, particularly around economic development and climate action.

Donald Trump has ordered the withdrawal of his country from the Paris climate agreement, a move Napat said was deeply troubling for Vanuatu, a country on the frontlines of climate change.

“For us, it's about our survival,” he said, adding that he would like to convince Trump “not to withdraw because everybody depends on the Paris agreement”.

Napat also said his government had not yet received confirmation on whether US aid to Vanuatu would be cut, but hoped that Washington would reconsider any plans to scale back support.

Under Joe Biden's presidency, the US widened its presence in the Pacific, opening new diplomatic posts, negotiating a security deal with PNG, and vowing to deepen economic aid. Sora said some of these initiatives were unlikely to continue under the Trump administration.

“What is likely to happen based on recent developments coming out of Washington is that the US will maintain a narrow security interest in the Pacific,” Sora said.

“But we're not likely to see the United States live up to its commitments on engaging with economic development and climate change.”

Beyond security and diplomacy, Napat said his new government's priority was ongoing recovery efforts after the devastating 7.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Vanuatu in December in 2024. The downtown of the capital, Port Vila, remains largely closed as damaged buildings are still being cleared and rebuilt.

“We are hoping that before the middle of this year, we should be able to open the main central business district,” Napat said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Key points of 30-day ceasefire agreed by US and Ukraine, with ball ‘now in Russia's court'

Ukraine has said it is ready to accept a US proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia.

Details of the deal – agreed after talks between senior US and Ukrainian officials in the Saudi city of Jeddah – have not been released in full but here is what is known about the terms:

The key part of a joint statement released after the Jeddah meeting was that Ukraine was willing to “enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire which can be extended”.

That goes further than a previous suggestion from Kyiv for an initial air and sea ceasefire, which left open the possibility of ground warfare to continue.

Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Tuesday after the talks, the US president, Donald Trump, said the deal was for “a total ceasefire”.

The talks were in large part focused on repairing a relationship between the US and Ukraine (rather than combatants Russia and Ukraine) after a disastrous Oval Office blow-up between Trump and Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

That fight led the White House to suspend military aid, including deliveries of ammunition, and to cut off vital intelligence sharing for Ukraine.

In that sense, the talks were a success for Kyiv. The joint statement said Washington “will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine”. 

However, Zelenskyy's key demand was that the US would provide it with security guarantees – essentially a commitment to protect it if Russia were to renege on any ceasefire or peace deal.

The phrase “security guarantees” was absent from the joint statement, an omission noticed by world leaders. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, hailed the progress made in the Jeddah talks but cautioned that Kyiv needed “robust” security guarantees.

Zelenskyy said in a late-night video address that security guarantees would be agreed at a later time.

Trump has exploited the Russian invasion of Ukraine to put pressure on Zelenskyy to sign a deal to give the US a 50% stake in revenues from the sale of Ukraine's mineral wealth. The US president was furious that Zelenskyy had not already signed, which stoked tensions leading up to the Oval Office argument.

It was expected that the Jeddah talks might spur Zelenskyy to sign that deal as a concession to Washington, but it seems that the Ukrainian leader has managed to play for more time.

The statement said the two presidents “agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources”.

According to the joint statement, the ceasefire will include the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children to Russia.

After the talks, Zelenskyy, in his televised statement, said Ukraine was committed to seeking peace but that it was “up to the United States to convince Russia to do the same”.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state who led the negotiations, said the ball was “now in Russia's court”.

Vladimir Putin will now be forced to decide whether to conclude a temporary ceasefire or risk souring relations with the new Trump administration.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

European leaders are working to bolster the Ukrainian military and recruiting partners for a “coalition of the willing” to serve in a postwar Ukraine.

LONDON — European leaders, buoyed by progress in talks between Washington and Kyiv and enjoying praise from U.S. officials, are pushing for a larger role in President Donald Trump's drive to halt the war between Russia and Ukraine and discussing how their forces can help secure a post-conflict landscape.

French and British officials, initially sidelined in the U.S. effort, helped coax Washington and Kyiv back to talks after the relationship appeared to break down last month. Now they're working to bolster the Ukrainian military and recruiting partners for a “coalition of the willing” to back Ukraine, while continuing to seek a European say in U.S. discussions with Russia. All these will strengthen Kyiv's position in negotiations and deter Russia from breaching any deal, they say.

Revived U.S.-Ukrainian talks this week yielded a preliminary agreement on a 30-day ceasefire. Russia hasn't committed to it yet, and many here are skeptical that Moscow will deal in good faith. But it has led Washington to resume military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv — and has dramatically improved the tone between the two governments, whose ties had seemed in danger of rupturing entirely.

“The signs of Europe focusing on this are very real,” said Bronwen Maddox, director of the  think tank Chatham House. “It's been an impressive change.”

Now leaders are trying to build on the momentum. “This is the moment when Europe must pull its full weight for Ukraine, and for itself,” French President Emmanuel Macron told European and NATO military leaders in Paris on Tuesday. He beseeched them to accelerate planning.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting a summit by video this weekend to discuss the still-undefined international force that would back any long-term truce.

Russia has opposed the deployment of NATO troops in Ukraine. “NATO countries are not neutral,” Sergei Markov, a hawkish Kremlin-connected analyst, told the BBC on Wednesday. NATO soldiers on Ukrainian territory would not be peacekeepers, he said, and “would be killed by Russian soldiers.”

Some European officials say their willingness to put boots on the ground sends a message to Russia and also to Trump, who is pushing Europe to do more for its own defense. Starmer's office says several countries have signaled they would contribute by providing soldiers, materials or both.

The idea of a European force in Ukraine backed by air and sea power has gained support, but it's certainly not unanimous. Italy, led by right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has opposed sending soldiers. She has not decided whether to attend Starmer's video conference, Italian media reported.

Some countries have been reluctant to commit to greater military involvement without a better understanding of what U.S. backing they might expect. Trump has not ruled out a role for European troops but has said little about whether the United States would support them.

European officials describe U.S. political and logistical backing as vital amid questions about how a European force should respond if Russia breaks a deal or attacks the force itself.

London and Paris want to pool the capabilities of several countries for a force powerful enough to deter Russia from reigniting a full-blown conflict. Some European diplomats say a concrete plan would provide a means to negotiate with the Trump team on a possible “U.S. backstop.”

A peace deal could unfold in multiple phases, others have said, with more countries joining the coalition as plans advance. The proposed one-month ceasefire could be a first step.

It's time to “move from concept to plan,” Macron told military leaders, according to his office. The army chiefs of more than 30 European and NATO countries gathered in Paris without the United States on Tuesday to discuss Ukraine's postwar “security architecture.”

About 15 countries were ready to move ahead with planning, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu told reporters Wednesday. He did not name them. There was consensus, he said, that the first task was to shore up “the Ukrainian army itself, its capacity, equipment, training and format.” (Russia, in contrast, has called for demilitarization.)

Military planning would go well beyond a possible troop deployment, he said; it would also, for example, “urgently” address security in the Black Sea and of nuclear sites in Ukraine.

The talks have included a broad range of countries — Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the Nordic and Baltic states. Some, such as NATO ally Turkey, have expressed openness to pooling resources.

On the diplomatic front, Europeans are hoping to build on what they see as a triumph of fence mending since Zelensky's disastrous Feb. 28 visit to the Oval Office.

Trump's abrupt tilt toward Moscow and his hostility to Zelensky in the early weeks of his presidency blindsided and sidelined European leaders. But they have since pushed on several fronts to assert more influence.

European leaders met in London days after the White House confrontation. Macron's proposals for a one-month ceasefire helped clear a pathway to the agreement between Washington and Kyiv on Tuesday. British officials have been coaching Zelensky on repairing the breach with Trump and embracing the approach.

European leaders and Zelensky say such a truce could serve as a test of Russia's interest in ending its war in Ukraine. At the least, the agreement appears to have shifted the narrative of the negotiations. Trump had called Zelensky a dictator and accused him of standing in the way of peace.

Now, European leaders have said repeatedly, “the ball is in Russia's court.”

The proposal has been presented at the talks as an American one, but some diplomats here quietly call it the “European plan” and hope it is a sign that Europe's struggles to sway Trump's peace process are beginning to bear fruit, at least for now.

A senior British official familiar with the efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said London began a full-court press immediately after the Oval Office blowup. Jonathan Powell, Starmer's national security adviser, personally engaged the Ukrainians and discussed the text of a proposal to send to the Americans, this official said.

“We think it clearly led directly to the invitation for Zelensky to join the discussions in Jeddah [Saudi Arabia] that has led to some pretty swift progress in restoring aid and intelligence,” the official said,

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio singled out Britain and France as European powers he has worked with closely on the Trump administration's efforts to end the war in Ukraine.

“They've been very helpful, and, frankly, we've worked very closely with them on the prelude to this meeting and hopefully in the days to come,” Rubio said Tuesday during his flight to Saudi Arabia.

Francis reported from Brussels. John Hudson in Jeddah contributed to this report.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

            Authorities have ramped up their efforts by air, sea and land to track down the 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student who went missing six days ago while vacationing in the Dominican Republic resort town of Punta Cana.
    


            Sudiksha Konanki, 20, vanished at the beach of the Riu República Hotel in the early hours of March 6, sparking a frantic search involving authorities from the Dominican Republic, the United States and India, where Konanki's family is originally from.
    


            Nearly one week after she was last seen, there are few concrete clues about what might have happened to her.

            The Dominican Republic National Police formed a “high-level commission” to work on the investigation, alongside the general prosecutor's office, the FBI and the international liaison of the US Embassy, the national police said this week.
    


            Authorities are investigating Konanki's disappearance as an “accident” and conducting a “special search operation in the ocean,” Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader said in a news conference this week.
    


            “We are concerned,” he said. “All government agencies are searching.”
    


            The Dominican Republic receives more than 11 million visitors per year and prides itself on being a safe place for tourists, Abinader said. “We are one of the safest countries, not just in Latin America, but in the world in every aspect,” he said.
    


            Konanki's disappearance – and authorities' search for her in the water and on land – comes nearly two months after the deaths of four tourists who were swept away by strong currents off the coast near Punta Cana, according to the Dominican Republic's civil defense agency.
    


            The four tourists disappeared off the Arena Gorda beach in Bávaro, an area of resorts in Punta Cana, and their bodies were recovered in January, the civil defense agency said in a social media post. The four drowned January 18, The Associated Press reported. Two other people also were swept away with the four but survived, the civil defense agency said.
    


            At the time of the January drownings, a red flag was flying at the beach to warn of dangerous ocean conditions, such as strong currents and rough seas, the AP reported.
    


            The sheriff's office in Virginia's Loudoun County, where Konanki's family lives, told CNN it was advised the water was rough in Punta Cana on the night Konanki went missing last week, but it could not confirm whether any warnings were in place.
    


            CNN has sought comment from Dominican Republic authorities about the conditions on March 6.
    


            Konanki traveled to the Dominican Republic with five other female students from the University of Pittsburgh on March 3, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office.
    


            On March 6 around 4:15 a.m., surveillance cameras captured a group of people – Konanki, five other women and two men – entering the beach, the Dominican Republic National Police said in a release. The group had been drinking in the hotel's lobby around an hour earlier, a source with the national police told CNN.
    


            Cameras later captured five women and one man leaving the beach around 4:55 a.m. – but not Konanki, two sources close to the investigation told CNN.
    


            Konanki appears to have stayed behind with a man in his 20s, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation. Surveillance video showed the man leaving the beach area just before 9 a.m. Thursday without Konanki, the two sources close to the investigation said.
    


            Authorities have been interviewing the man, though he is not considered to be a suspect at this time, the law enforcement source said. He was being kept in a hotel room under police watch as the probe continues, but he is not officially detained, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.
    


            He told authorities they both went into the ocean but he felt sick, got out of the water and fell asleep on a lounge chair, according to the source.
    


            Another law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said the man was interviewed by police several times and provided different details but there were no significant inconsistencies in his recounting of the events that night. The source said translation issues may have been a reason for the differences.
    


            When Konanki didn't come back to her room, her companions searched for her, according to the law enforcement source. The group reported her missing to hotel staff around 4 p.m. Thursday, the RIU hotel chain said in a release.
    


            Konanki's sarong-style cover-up was found on a lounge chair on the beach, but there were no signs of violence, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.
    


            Konanki's disappearance came a day after a power outage started at the hotel, the facility's operator, RIU Hotels & Resorts, said Wednesday. Power was restored to 70% of the facility by early March 5 – two hours after the outage began – and was fully restored at 2:13 a.m. on March 6, the company said.
    


            In the days since, a massive search effort involving dogs, drones and helicopters does not appear to have produced any solid leads about Konanki's whereabouts.
    


            Konanki's father, Subbarayudu Konanki, said his daughter is a “very nice girl” and “wanted to pursue a career in medicine.”
    


            She was visiting Punta Cana for spring break ahead of premed studies, her father said.
    


            Originally from India, the Konanki family has been in the US since 2006 and are permanent residents living in Virginia.
    


            Those in her hometown are praying for her safe return.
    


            “It's already four days and everybody's so worried,” family friend Shekar Pendem, who has known Konanki since she was 3, said in an interview with CNN affiliate WUSA Monday.
    


            The Dominican Republic Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating whether Konanki's disappearance could extend “beyond a possible accidental event,” officials said Wednesday.
    


            “As with any disappearance under the circumstances of the case at hand, we are applying a holistic investigation protocol that examines all variables,” Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso said.
    


            On Monday, Dominican police said they were re-interviewing people who had been with Konanki and employees of the hotel where they were staying.
    


            As of early Tuesday, more than 300 officers, specialists, tactical units and aquatic search teams were searching the surrounding area of the hotel for any information about the woman's whereabouts, according to a post on social media by Dominican Republic National Police.
    


            The Dominican Republic navy is searching along the coast about 24 nautical miles from the hotel where Konanki was reported missing, General Commander Agustín Morillo Rodríguez told CNN on Wednesday. The night Konanki disappeared, sea conditions were dangerous with high waves, he said.
    


            The government has made available “all the necessary resources” to find Konanki, police said, including teams of forensic technicians who are analyzing images from video surveillance cameras in the area. An alert has also been circulated to law enforcement worldwide to help locate her.
    


            Subbarayudu Konanki and his wife, Sreedevi, returned to Virginia this week after flying to Punta Cana with two family friends, according to Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman. Her father has asked authorities to widen the investigation.
    


            Investigators spoke with the parents on Tuesday, and the sheriff met with her dad and other family members on Wednesday, Chapman said.
    


            “They do not want to accept the fact that she may have drowned,” Chapman told Fox News on Wednesday. “We're looking into every possibility here. I think it's premature and I think it's actually unfair for anybody to come to that conclusion so quickly.”
    


            The father's formal request notes that the student's belongings, including her phone and wallet, were left with her friends, “which is unusual because she always carried her phone with her,” he wrote in the report, according to radio station WTOP, as reported by the AP. It's unclear where this information came from.
    


            Konanki's father told CNN earlier he wants local authorities “to also investigate other possibilities including whether this is a case of kidnapping or human trafficking.”
    


            Civil Defense spokesperson Jensen Sánchez told the AP the search “is underway at sea because it's presumed she drowned.”
    


            He noted it can take more than a week for a body to surface in warm waters, the AP reported.
    


            Detectives with the sheriff's office have traveled to the Dominican Republic, Chapman told NBC on Tuesday. Investigators have spoken with hotel personnel, lifeguards and others who may have been present at the time that she went missing, Chapman said.
    


            “We decided to send our own detectives down there with them (FBI) so that we're not missing anything. We want to make sure … we're getting the information firsthand,” Chapman said in the interview with NBC. “Some of the information that we've gotten so far – it has been a little disjointed, inconsistent, and we want to get it firsthand.”
    


            “We don't think she would be able to survive for more than three days in the water,” Subbarayudu told CNN on Sunday. “I think something else might've happened to her.”

Apprehensions between ports of entry along the southern border have fallen sharply since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.

Tracking Illegal Border Crossings

The 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border has become the center of a political quagmire in recent years, with immigration regularly tracking as one of the most polarizing subjects in American discourse.

President Donald Trump and his policies sit squarely at the center of these tensions: Illegal immigration has been one of the president's favorite subjects to talk about since the start of his first successful White House campaign in 2015, and has become entwined with his approach to areas including crime, trade and foreign policy. Upon his return to the Oval Office in January, Trump took a number of actions aimed at stopping what he's often called an “invasion” at the southern border, after attempted crossings rose to very high levels under former President Joe Biden.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection describes these crossing attempts as “encounters,” essentially meaning recorded events involving migrants and agency officials. Within that broad designation are two currently applicable categories:



Elliott Davis Jr.March 12, 2025



Apprehensions don't always lead to an arrest, as noted by USAFacts, and could involve an asylum claim where migrants have the right to ask for protection due to fear of persecution or harm in their home country. Trump, however, effectively halted asylum access on Day One of his second term.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection typically releases encounters data around the middle of each month, and the publication covers the previous month's worth of figures. U.S. News is tracking monthly apprehensions by the Border Patrol at the southwest border to provide context behind the numbers and the rhetoric that usually surrounds them.



Border Patrol apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border fell by 71% from January to February.

Trump's first full month in office featured a precipitously steep decline in illegal crossings, with only about 8,000 apprehensions logged between ports of entry. Pete Flores, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement that his team “achieved historic lows” that month.

“The Invasion of our Country is OVER,” the president wrote in a social media post referencing the February numbers prior to their official release. As of March 13, his proclamation declaring a border invasion and barring “aliens engaged in the invasion” from entry remained in effect.

READ: 



Border Patrol apprehensions at the southwest border fell by 39% from December to January.

The Trump administration was quick to highlight and take credit for the decrease, though activity at the southern border had been much quieter for several months, starting after Biden issued an executive order last summer that severely limited asylum access. Trump was also only in office for the last third of January.

Still, the number of illegal crossings did fall more sharply after he returned to the Oval Office, and experts told U.S. News that Trump's moves to restrict asylum access certainly contributed to the decline.

Sonja Hutson, Richard Milne and Monica Mark

PublishedMarch 13 2025

This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Lights out at Northvolt'

Sonja Hutson Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, March 13th and this is your FT News Briefing. New data shows just how hard it is to cut US government spending. And Europe's electric battery darling has gone belly up. Plus, we look at how China is trying to edge out American soft power in Africa. I'm Sonja Hutson, and here's the news you need to start your day. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

US federal spending increased by $40bn in February year-over-year, and it hit a new record. That's according to Treasury data out yesterday. This comes despite efforts from Elon Musk to cut spending. His so-called Department of Government Efficiency claims to have saved $100bn already. But only a handful of departments reported any decreases in spending in February. One of them was the Department of Education, which cut $6bn. Now it is still early days in Doge's efforts. A source told the FT that a lot of lay-offs might not be reflected in last month's data. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Sweden's Northvolt has filed for bankruptcy. It marks the end of Europe's best hope for competing with car batteries from Asia. Northvolt was once considered Europe's best funded start-up, but it's now unable to secure enough financing to continue. Here to explain what went wrong is the FT's Richard Milne. Hi, Richard.

Richard Milne Hi there.

Sonja Hutson So tell us about the hopes that were pinned on this company when it first launched back in 2016.

Richard Milne Yeah. So it was started by a couple of former Tesla executives who wanted to make sure that Europe — in a technology that's absolutely crucial to the car industry — had a player to go alongside all the Asian players from China, Japan, Korea and Tesla. And they found a good site in Sweden with plenty of green energy. They got in a lot of money, sort of $15bn, from governments and investors. But then it started to go wrong and the wheels have sort of gradually and then very suddenly come off.

Sonja Hutson Yeah. How did the wheels come off? What happened?

Richard Milne I mean, it's a real mixture of things. I think they tried to do too much too fast. They were trying to build at one stage as many as six factories. They had issues with Chinese equipment. There were complaints from workers that we spoke to that there was poor management, there were poor safety standards. And then, you know, on top of all this, you've had a slow down in the electric vehicle market, and that led to a stage where investors, sort of led by Volkswagen, were wary of putting more money into this, you know, vision of making batteries in northern Sweden.

Sonja Hutson So where does Northvolt's bankruptcy leave everyone who was involved in this project?

Richard Milne I mean, essentially it's gonna be liquidated. It's got a number of assets that are interesting. It's got its battery factory in northern Sweden that's produced more than a million cells. It's got a very advanced R&D facility called labs in central Sweden. So I think the expectation is that a lot of the people that they were talking to at the end, who almost certainly included truckmaker Scania and maybe some of the parts of the Volkswagen Group, could well be picking over the bones. 

And then equity shareholders are essentially totally wiped out by this, so the billions of dollars that are disappearing from Goldman Sachs, Volkswagen, pension funds, particularly in Sweden. This is pretty dramatic. And this is probably causing more than a few investors to wonder about green investments elsewhere and how wise they are. But I think the bigger picture is that the Chinese in particular, see this as an opportunity to take even more market share, if they can.

Sonja Hutson Does Europe actually need to make its own batteries? I mean, others seem to be doing it better and also more cheaply.

Richard Milne So I do think this is a really crucial technology for Europe. I mean, the automotive industry employs 13 or 14mn people in Europe. And so I think if Europe just gives up in this area, that is gonna have knock-on effects across the automotive supply chain. I spoke to Tom Johnstone, the chair of Northvolt, who was pretty clear that, you know, Europe needs to pony up the cash on this. Now, my observation would be, you know, we've got war in Ukraine. There's a lot of worry about defence spending, you know. Can Europe have two thoughts in its mind at the same time, or will it just give in and take the easier solution of China? I mean, I think that's gonna have enormous implications for the future of industry in Europe.

Richard Milne Yeah, thanks so much.

Sonja Hutson US inflation fell more than expected in February to 2.8 per cent. In January, it was 3 per cent. The drop gives the Federal Reserve a little bit of breathing room when it comes to interest rates. The central bank faces the very unenviable task of trying to bring down inflation by keeping rates higher, but not so high that they trigger a recession. And the Fed has to do this while President Donald Trump rattles markets with his own economic agenda. Futures markets are now pricing in at least two rate cuts this year, and feeling pretty confident about maybe a third. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

For decades now, the US and China have been competing for influence in Africa, and the road goes through Zambia, almost literally. The two superpowers have been investing in a pair of cross-continental railways that are meant to carry critical minerals across central Africa. But with the US now stepping back in overseas aid, can China capitalise on the void left behind? I'm joined by the FT's Monica Mark to talk more about this. Hey, Monica.

Monica Mark Hi, Sonja.

Sonja Hutson So tell me about these railways that both the US and China have been investing in. What's the history there?

Monica Mark So this is a pair of colonial-era railways that are backed by the world's two biggest economies, and they run from a part of Africa known as the south-central Copperbelt, which is really rich in copper, cobalt and other minerals that are critical to the green transition. So essentially, everyone needs these minerals. The Lobito Corridor cuts from the Republic of Congo across to the western coast of Africa through Angola, and it's backed by the US. And then on the other direction, we have the Tazara rail, which was built in the 1970s by China, and that can ferry goods to the east coast, and from there can go to China and to the Middle East.

Sonja Hutson And what's happening with the two competing railways now? You know, I mentioned earlier that the US has started to pull back a lot of its aid efforts in Africa.

Monica Mark So both of these rails needs to be upgraded. They're pretty old, the Lobito one is over a century old. The US had been backing it partly through its foreign assistance programs, which Donald Trump has now halted. And he's frozen developments, the $43bn budget of USAID, has been torn to shreds. So we don't know essentially what's gonna happen with Lobito for now, because there's loans that need to be disbursed that are in question now. And what experts believe now is that this is a precursor to how US foreign assistance might start looking going forward from here.

Sonja Hutson What about China? How is it adjusting its stance now after all of these decades of investing in Africa?

Monica Mark So China in 2013 launched the biggest and most ambitious and most expensive infrastructure building project that the world has ever seen with the Belt and Road Initiative. And this is a really grand plan to sort of spend trillions of dollars in expanding China's soft power, but also just Chinese money, basically in the form of loans. What happened is there was a series of high-profile defaults under this program. So China has realised that it needs to start doing business a bit differently under this Belt and Road Initiative. And what it's doing, it's a kind of linear model where it actually does smaller loans. And there's an official phrase in China now, small and beautiful. And rather than big policy banks coming in, private companies are coming in and taking smaller stakes, or they are building and then operating the projects themselves. So then there's more incentive for them to make sure that this project is actually gonna be completed, and it's gonna be profitable.

Sonja Hutson OK. So China has this new approach to funding infrastructure projects in Africa. The US, on the other hand, is pulling back. What does that mean for the competition between the two superpowers for influence on the continent?

Monica Mark That is a difficult question to ask, and I think that's what everyone's waiting to see. How is this gonna play out? Which is why Tazara's gonna be really interesting to watch, because it could end up being a sort of bellwether for what the Chinese approach to Africa might look like. With Trump it's very difficult to say what's gonna happen. The US was doing a lot of its humanitarian work in Africa through USAID. That's now gone, so definitely some soft power has been lost. And now the questions about whether Lobito's going to continue, I would imagine that there were a lot of African governments who are kind of gonna be just watching and wondering, is this a reliable partner for us to be doing projects with, whether it's financial or otherwise, across Africa?

Sonja Hutson Monica Mark is the FT's South Africa bureau chief. Thanks, Monica.

Monica Mark Thank you.

Sonja Hutson Before we go, more of the mobile gaming industry: is Pokémon going to Saudi Arabia? A Saudi-owned developer is buying the hit app and a handful of others for $3.5bn. Pokémon Go was an overnight success when it came out in 2016. Millions of people took to the streets to play this augmented reality game. The deal is part of Saudi Arabia's plan to diversify its economy and become a global hub for gaming. It now has stakes in a ton of major companies, including Nintendo and Activision Blizzard.

Oops, something went wrong

The federal government could be in for a shutdown in less than two days after Senate Democrats offered up a plan to play hardball and oppose a House bill that would keep the government open until September alongside spending cuts.

The counteroffer from Democrats — with the votes of at least a few of them required for any bill to pass — would keep the government open for a month but it faces little chance of final passage in time with Senate Republicans likely to block it and House lawmakers having already departed Washington anyway.

Sen. Chuck Schumer and his colleagues tried to plot a strategy Wednesday — with reporters stationed outside able to hear audible shouting at one point — with the Democratic leader then emerging to say, ""Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to invoke cloture on the House CR.""

But Republican leaders are confident they have Schumer and his colleagues cornered with Senate GOP leader John Thune saying of Democratic shutdown threats Thursday morning: ""It's time for Democrats to fish or cut bait.""

Thune also told reporters he was open to an amendment vote on the Democrat's one-month plan.

The standoff appears likely to lead to multiple votes in the coming days with economic and political prognosticators reacting with a mix of increased odds in the chances of a shutdown — alongside a jaundiced but unsettled view of what the effect might be on the economy either way.

""Historically, government shutdowns have had limited market reaction,"" analysts at Raymond James wrote in a note to clients this week. ""That is likely to remain the case, but adding to the significant amount of uncertainty coming out of DC is unwelcome in the current market climate.""

That climate is one of economic unease following recent sell-offs that put markets in correction territory, cuts to S&P 500 year-end targets, and a trade war breaking out on multiple fronts with President Trump seemingly unconcerned about the impact of it all on markets.

It isn't helping that Wall Street is also increasingly worried about stagflation and that Trump, in recent days, has also refused to rule out a recession.

""Taking a shutdown off the table could slightly improve sentiment amid a tough week for markets,"" Tobin Marcus of Wolfe Research wrote in his own note.

Overall, plenty of observers have raised the odds of a shutdown in recent days with additional reminders that the uncertainty is unlikely to dissipate anytime soon.

As of Monday midday, prediction market Polymarket put the odds of a shutdown this weekend at 45% and competing site Kalshi assessed the chances of one before the end of the calendar year just above 50/50.

The coming brinksmanship is set to cap a week of standoffs on Capitol Hill that began with 1-in-3 odds of a shutdown as House Republicans announced a plan to muscle through their plan with slim margins and plenty of initial skepticism that they could succeed.

But succeed they did, with a 217 to 213 vote that advanced the stopgap measure.

In the end, House Speaker Mike Johnson only saw one member of his own party, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, oppose the bill and one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, move to support the GOP plan.

But the path to passage in the Senate, which requires the consent of 60 of the chamber's 100 senators, was always more complicated. Schumer weighed in Wednesday to say Democrats would be opposed.

""Our caucus is unified,"" he said, pushing instead the one-month plan ""that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass.""

The situation is further heightened by budget cuts in the House GOP plan that could affect an array of programs — mostly notably a proposed $1 billion cut to the budget of Washington, D.C.

That move has led to unease in the nation's Capitol in recent days on fears it could lead to things like cuts in government services and forced teacher layoffs or furloughs.

A ""recess at the Capitol"" protest focused on this school issue even took place Thursday morning focused on the school issue.

There is also ample fear among Democrats that Trump and Elon Musk and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought, who would have outsized power in the event of a shutdown, could use the shutdown as a pretext for further or laying off even more federal workers.

As for next steps, Senate Democrats appear to be pushing for a standalone or amendment vote on their monthlong plan (without things like D.C. cuts) before any final passage vote, but Republicans are able and likely willing to block such an approach.

Assuming that initial vote fails, a vote on the seven-month funding bill is then likely to be considered with the question being whether enough Senate Democrats — approximately eight are expected to be needed to avert a shutdown — would be willing to vote for the package to keep the government open.

In any case, the drama is set to continue for Washington and economic observers up until almost the literal last minute after Senator Thune filed cloture on the House plan on Wednesday night — but Senate rules will likely mean a final vote isn't possible until Friday.

Duke coach Jon Scheyer said Thursday that x-rays on Cooper Flagg came back negative after the Blue Devils' superstar freshman left the team's ACC Tournament quarterfinal game against Georgia Tech with a sprained ankle.

Flagg sustained the injury with 2:46 remaining in the first half after rolling his ankle coming down for a defensive rebound. He immediately grabbed at his ankle and lay writhing in pain on the court as trainers tended to him. Flagg was eventually helped off the floor with assistance back to the locker room area and later placed in a wheelchair to be taken to an exam room.

At halftime, Duke listed him as doubtful to return with an ankle injury before eventually ruling him out. 

Duke rallied from a double-digit deficit without him on the floor to win 78-70.

""He sprained his ankle,"" Scheyer said postgame. ""X-rays were negative, which is great. We just have to understand there's going to be swelling and see how he recovers and how we go from there.""

Flagg was unable to initially put much, if any, weight on the leg after the incident, which is not uncommon for ankle sprains. He punched a chair on the bench in frustration and screamed before being taken back to the locker room. In an encouraging sign, Flagg did return to the bench walking under his own power and without a boot.

When asked about his status for Friday's semifinal game, Scheyer did not come across as optimistic he'll be sending his star freshman onto the floor. 

""Well, I already know how he's wired. And look, to be honest with you, I would have to be, like, convinced by everybody in the locker room when I go back there that he should play,"" Scheyer said. ""It's not worth it. It just isn't. Again, he was swollen already. It's not about being ready to go tomorrow. That's not the most important thing for us. We've got to see if we can get him right for this run that we can make in the tournament. But I would have to be really convinced that we should even consider seeing if he can go tomorrow. He may not be able to go anyway. He probably won't be able to go anyway. But I think it's a real long shot. A real long shot.""

Flagg leads Duke in scoring, rebounding, assists and blocks this season for a Blue Devils team that won the ACC title outright and entered the postseason with a 28-3 overall record. Flagg finished the regular season in style with a 15-point, nine-rebound, six-assist, four-block game in Duke's sweep of rival North Carolina. 

Duke's injury woes against Georgia Tech alone are staggering with Selection Sunday just days away. Earlier in the game, junior forward Maliq Brown also suffered an injury in an apparent aggravation of a nagging shoulder injury. He was taken to the hospital and is dealing with a dislocated shoulder. 

CBS Sports Bracketologist Jerry Palm expects Duke to be tight-lipped about Flagg's injury over the weekend, if he does not play again in Charlotte, to possibly preserve its spot as a No. 1 seed. 

""If he's out only this game, no big deal,"" Palm said. ""If he is expected to miss significant time, that's different."" 

Flagg, a betting favorite to win National Player of the Year and the projected No. 1 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, is the first major conference freshman to lead his team in all five major statistical categories since Ben Simmons did so for LSU in 2015-16, underscoring his irreplaceable production. 

The big question with Flagg is of course how much, if at all, the injury lingers, and to what extent it may impact him. He was able to walk back to the bench from the locker room area while only slightly favoring his ankle, which could in theory bode well for his future availability as Duke marches into the postseason as one of the favorites to win the NCAA championship. Championship odds for Duke in some places went from +300 to +770 in a matter of minutes in the wake of Flagg's injury, before resettling at +350 when cameras showed him walking without a severe limp. 

In a cruel world in which this injury ends up being worse than anticipated and Flagg misses the tournament, etching his name along Kenyon Martin as an all-time what-if, here are the stakes: Flagg would be the 5th player ever to win National Player of the Year (AP, Wooden or Naismith) and not play in the NCAA Tournament (1963-64 Gary Bradds, 1969-70 Pete Maravich, 1974-75 David Thompson, 1999-00 Martin).

However, Duke's roster aside from Flagg is far from barren. There are four other five-star prospects on Duke's current roster including two other projected lottery picks for 2025 led by guard Kon Knueppel, the team's second-leading scorer, and center Khaman Maluach, a 7-foot-2 big man who is second on the team in rebounding and blocks.

Auburn is tied for Duke as the favorite to win it all (+350), with Houston and Florida (+700) following.

A Virginia high school athlete has been charged with assault and battery following a baton incident that resulted in another competitor suffering a concussion at a recent track meet. 

Lynchburg Commonwealth's Attorney Bethany Harrison announced that I.C. Norcom High School senior Alaila Everett has been charged Wednesday. 

The incident took place during the second leg of the 4x200-meter relay race at the Virginia State High School League Indoor State Championships in Lynchburg on March 4. In a video of the race, Brookville High School junior Kaelen Tucker -- who suffered a concussion and possibly a fractured skull -- was hit in the back of the head by Everett's relay baton in the midst of the race. Tucker collapsed to the ground after being struck.

In speaking to WTKR News 3 in Norfolk, Everett stated that striking Tucker was an accident.

""She was touching me to the point where I was pumping my arm, and the baton was hitting her arm,"" Everett said. ""I lose my balance -- my whole body turns, and then I pump my arms, so she got hit.""

Tucker also spoke to WTKR News 3 with a different recollection of the incident.

""As we got around the curve, she kept bumping me in my arm,"" Tucker said. ""When we finally got off the curve, I slowly started passing her, and she hit me with a baton.""

As a result of the viral video, Everett revealed that she has been harassed and received death threats. Everett's team ended up disqualified from the race as a result of the incident.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Kon Knueppel scored 28 points as No. 1 Duke overcame injuries to star Cooper Flagg and Maliq Brown to beat Georgia Tech 78-70 on Thursday and advance to the ACC Tournament semifinals.

Isaiah Evans scored 14 points on four 3-pointers and Khaman Maluach added 14 points and nine rebounds for the Blue Devils (29-3), who have won nine straight.

Flagg appeared to land awkwardly on Baye Ndongo's foot as he came down with a rebound late in the first half. The ACC player of the year retreated to the Duke bench and punched a seat in frustration. After being helped to the locker room, Flagg returned to the Duke bench in the second half without a boot on his foot. He did not return to the game.

Brown went down with a shoulder injury in the first half.

Duncan Powell led Georgia Tech (17-16) with 24 points.

Duke missed its first 13 shots from beyond the arc and fell behind 26-12, matching the season's largest deficit. They trailed 26-17 when Flagg left the game, but cut the lead to five at halftime. Duke pushed its lead to seven early in the second half when Tyrese Proctor stole a pass and delivered a high-flying one-handed dunk in transition.

Georgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets bench was outscored 21-6.

Duke: The Blue Devils showed they have some firepower without Flagg and Brown on the court. After missing its first 13 3s, Duke went 7 of 17 the rest of the way.

Knueppel drove, scored and drew a foul for a 3-point play with about five minutes left in the game to put Duke up by 11.

Georgia Tech was outscored 28-12 to start the second half.

Georgia Tech can hope for an NIT bid. Duke will face the North Carolina/Wake Forest winner on Friday.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Chuck Harris and Matt Cross scored 12 points apiece and sixth-seeded SMU beat No. 14 seed Syracuse 73-53 on Wednesday night in the second round of the ACC Tournament.

SMU (23-9) advances to play third-seeded Clemson in a quarterfinal matchup on Thursday.

Boopie Miller and backup Keon Ambrose-Hylton each scored 10 points for the Mustangs who shot 53.2% (25 for 47).

J.J. Starling scored 16 points and Jyare Davis 14 for Syracuse (14-19).

The Mustangs' win was in stark contrast to their March 4 home win over Syracuse when they led for only 1:28 and needed a tip-in from Ambrose-Hylton with 2.9 seconds left to seal a 77-75 win.

On Wednesday, SMU started the second half with a 7-0-run and recorded its first double-digit lead to make it 38-28 when Harris hit a jumper with 16:20 left. The Mustangs maintained safe distance and extended the lead to 53-38 on B.J. Edwards' layup with 6:07 remaining.

The largest lead of the first half belonged to SMU when Kario Oquendo buried a 3-pointer with 1:52 left to give the Mustangs a 31-22 advantage. Syracuse quickly countered with 3's from Starling and Davis in a 40-second span. SMU led 31-28 at halftime.

The Orange got its largest first-half lead at 5-0 in the game's first minute-and-a-half.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  Hunter Dickinson had 23 points and 13 rebounds, Zeke Mayo poured in 24 points, and sixth-seeded Kansas rallied to force overtime before holding off No. 14 seed UCF 98-94 on Wednesday night in the second round of the Big 12 Tournament.

AJ Storr scored a season-high 19 points before fouling out in the closing seconds of OT, and KJ Adams had 15 points and seven boards for the Jayhawks (21-11), who narrowly avoided dropping their conference tourney opener for a second straight year.

Instead, they will face third-seeded Arizona on Thursday night in a rematch of a game Kansas won last weekend.

Jordan Ivy-Curry pulled UCF to within 94-93 when he converted a three-point play with 18.2 seconds to go, and Mayo missed the second of two foul shots at the other end. But UCF big man Moustapha Thiam came up short on a jumper with a chance to tie the game, Kansas got the rebound and Dickinson made the second of two free throws with 2.4 seconds remaining.

The Knights' Deebo Coleman was quickly fouled. He made the first foul shot with 0.9 seconds left to make it 96-94, but when he tried to intentionally miss the second to give his team a chance, Coleman failed to hit the rim and the Jayhawks got possession.

David Coit was fouled and added two more free throws for the final margin.

Keyshawn Hall led UCF (17-16) with 25 points. Darius Johnson had 22 before fouling out with a minute to go in regulation.

The Jayhawks blew a 13-point second-half lead, then had to rally once UCF pulled ahead with 7 minutes to go. The teams traded buckets down the stretch, and Ivy-Curry's 3-pointer tied the game 83-all with 14.1 seconds left in regulation.

Kansas tried to set up a winning play, but Adams stepped on the baseline on his drive, giving the Knights a shot. Ivy-Curry raced up the floor and got a decent look from the wing, but his 3-pointer came up well short as time expired.

UCF came a long way from January, when it lost 99-48 to the Jayhawks at home. It had won four of its past six games.

Kansas has gone with a shortened lineup late in the season and it seems to be paying off for the Jayhawks.

Thiam's miss from about 6 feet along the baseline with a few seconds left in overtime would have tied the game.

Three players fouled out of the game. Kansas guard Dajuan Harris also finished with five fouls.

The Jayhawks play Arizona on Thursday night. They beat the Wildcats 83-76 last Saturday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  VJ Edgecombe had 19 points and 10 rebounds, Norchad Omier added 12 points and 14 boards, and seventh-seeded Baylor rolled to a 70-56 victory over No. 10 seed Kansas State in the second round of the Big 12 Tournament on Wednesday night.

Jayden Dunn also scored 18 points for the Bears (19-13), who built a 20-point lead early in the second half and then cruised into a quarterfinal matchup with ninth-ranked and No. 2 seed Texas Tech on Thursday night.

David N'Guessan had 20 points and Dug McDaniel finished with 14 for the Wildcats (16-17), who edged Arizona State in the first round but were unable to keep the momentum going against the same team that rallied from 12 down to beat them in January.

The Bears ended the first half Wednesday night on a 9-0 run to take a 41-24 lead into the locker room. Kansas State was just 1 for 12 from beyond the 3-point arc at that point, and veteran forward Coleman Hawkins - who scored 26 points against the Sun Devils - was 0 for 4 from the field and quickly growing frustrated.

Kansas State closed within 58-46 with 8 minutes to go, but Hawkins was whistled for a flagrant foul contesting Edgecombe's dunk, and Jeremy Roach added a basket after his foul shots to help Baylor pull away again.

Kansas State finished 3 of 25 from beyond the arc. Hawkins and McDaniel were each 1 for 6.

Baylor improved to 15-2 when holding an opponent to 70 points or less this season.

Baylor was leading 32-24 with 2:40 left in the first half when it scored the next nine points to take control.

Baylor got 27 points from its bench. Kansas State only got four.

The Bears will play the Red Raiders on Thursday night. Texas Tech beat them 73-59 last month.

Filed under:

Monique Akoa-Makani signed a rookie-scale contract with the Mercury Tuesday — becoming the latest international player to get an opportunity in the WNBA. 





The Phoenix Mercury have added another guard to their roster; Monique Akoa-Makani, a Cameroonian guard who most recently played for the French club Charnay Basket. On that club, she averaged 14.6 points, 5.3 assists, and 4.2 rebounds per game. 

Per the WNBA transactions page, the Mercury signed Akoa-Makani to a rookie-scale contract. She's the 6th international player the Mercury have signed, joining Kitija Laksa (Latvia), Sami Whitcomb (Australia), Sevgi Uzun (Turkey), Murjanutu Musa (Nigeria), and Anna Makurat (Poland). The signing — while likely not particularly consequential for the Mercury's championship odds considering Akoa-Makani's youth and relative inexperience —does signal the league's continued move toward international players. 

The WNBA, while still largely dominated by American players, has trended toward more international players in recent years, with players like Ezi Magbegor (Australia), Kamilla Cardoso (Brazil), Bridget Carleton (Canada), Aaliyah Edwards (Canada), Leonie Fiebich (Germany), and Nyara and Satou Sabally (Germany) serving as just a few examples of high-impact international players. Fiebich turned into one of the WNBA's most impactful rookies and was a key part of why the New York Liberty won the 2024 championship. 

Free agency signings have trended international in unprecedented fashion; the Connecticut Sun, for example, have signed 3 international players, headlined by French standout Leila Lacan. The Seattle Storm have signed two — Magbegor and Chinese standout Li Yueru. Across the league, front offices are increasingly taking notice of overseas talent, as the game continues to globalize. 

France, in particular, appears to have several high-profile WNBA prospects in the works. Carla Leite, a 19-year-old French guard who the Golden State Valkyries selected in their expansion draft, is one prospective impact player. Janelle Salaun, a 6'6 forward, is another. Dominique Malonga, a 6'6 center who could dunk at 16, is one of the most exciting prospects in recent WNBA history, as detailed in a Ringer piece by Mark Schindler. 

The NBA has become increasingly international in recent years, with some of the best players in the world coming from overseas — like Luka Doncic (Slovenia), Nikola Jokic (Serbia), Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece), Joel Embiid (Cameroon), Victor Wembenyama (France), and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Canada), among others.

Inevitably, women's basketball will eventually follow suit to become a more globalized game — and France very well could be at the forefront. In the meantime, the Mercury are the latest in a long list of teams that have signed an increasing number of international players to their 2024-25 WNBA rosters.

The woman who accused Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy of assault has been granted a temporary restraining order against the football star. 

Attorneys for Tia Jones, a track and field athlete who was previously engaged to Worthy, 21, confirmed the order to The Associated Press on Wednesday, March 12. 

“Ms. Jones has chosen to use her voice to speak up for herself,” Angelica Cogliano, one of Jones' legal representatives, told the AP. “In doing so, she looks forward to the facts and circumstances of that night coming to light through the formal legal process, and getting the justice that she deserves.”

The attorneys added that Jones is “fully cooperating with law enforcement as they continue to actively investigate the violence that occurred.”



Worthy's attorneys, Chip Lewis and Sam Bassett, responded in a statement to NBC's Pro Football Talk.

“We are aware of the civil court (not criminal court) filing by Ms. Jones and her criminal defense team,” they said. “Mr. Worthy denies each of the allegations by Ms. Jones. Unfortunately, false allegations continue to be made, this time in civil court. Today the accuser returned items stolen from Mr. Worthy's residence while he was in jail and there are items still missing from when he was incarcerated. Mr. Worthy maintains his innocence and stands by the conclusions of the District Attorney after law enforcement's review of Ms. Jones' unfounded allegations.”

Worthy was arrested on Friday, March 7, and held in jail on a charge of choking a family member. The following day, the District Attorney in Texas' Williamston County  announced his office would not be accepting the case. 

“After further investigation by the Williamson County Sheriff's Office and further discussion with a third-party witness, Mr. Worthy and his attorneys, this case is being declined at this time pending completion of the investigation by the Williamson County Sheriff's Office,” District Attorney Shawn Dick said in an email. “Mr. Worthy and his lawyers are fully cooperating with this investigation.

The note continued, “We will continue to evaluate the case. As is our practice with all declines, should you develop additional information indicative of probable cause in this case, our office will consider that information and may present the case at that time to a Williamson County Grand Jury.”

Worthy's attorneys have maintained their client's innocence, alleging Jones has refused to vacate Worthy's home after he learned of her alleged “infidelity.”

“The complainant further destroyed a room in the residence, scratched Mr. Worthy's face and ripped out parts of his hair, which there is photographic evidence of,” the attorneys claimed in a statement. “Worthy told law enforcement at the time of the incident he did not want to press charges against the complainant.”

Worthy broke his silence about the allegations on Sunday, March 9, sharing a selfie of himself laying in bed via his Instagram Story. “New beginnings,” he captioned the image.

The Bachelorette producers were allegedly deciding on the next lead before the show's break, according to former Bachelor star Nick Viall.

“I know one of the people they were seriously looking at [and] it would have been awesome,” Viall, 44, claimed on the Thursday, March 13, episode of his “The Viall Files” podcast. “We're not going to tell you … but it would have been awesome. It would have been amazing.”

According to Viall, the potential lead was “from an older season” of The Bachelor.

“When I found out, I was really disappointed they decided not to move forward with it,” he said.



As Grant Ellis' season of The Bachelor winds down, news broke in February that a new season of The Bachelorette will not air this year. A reason for the hiatus, as well as a return date, has not been confirmed.

Even if The Bachelorette would continue later in 2025, a leading lady has not been formally revealed. That hasn't stopped the rumor mill from speculating about a potential decision.

“I was shocked because I heard they picked the lead,” former Bachelorette Rachel Recchia alleged on the “Almost Famous” podcast in February. “I heard the lead was decided and it made sense to me who they picked. Again, rumors. I saw this on Instagram. Normally, I feel like we hear stuff on the inside. I didn't hear anything [about the pause].”

According to the 29-year-old Bachelor Nation alum, the show picked a lead “two months ago.”

“They knew who it was going to be. … I heard a name,” Recchia added. “I heard from someone who usually knows, normally it's a good source, but I don't know.”

Speculation has also swirled that Maria Georgas, a fan-favorite from Joey Graziadei's season 28, had been tapped to take over the mantle. Viall, meanwhile, denied on Thursday that the woman in consideration was Georgas, 30.

Georgas previously claimed that she turned down the role of Bachelorette before Jenn Tran headlined the latest season.

“I was offered the role. It was mine until I said it wasn't,” Georgas claimed on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in May 2024. “It became very overwhelming to the point where I had to decline. It was set in stone. I was in it. When everyone around me was so supportive of me being in this position and everyone wanted this for me, I took a second. I'm like, ‘Why am I not happy? Why am I not excited about this?'”

She has not publicly addressed the speculation about joining the franchise again.

Meghan Markle is making a return to the podcast space.

The Duchess of Sussex's podcast, “Confessions of a Female Founder,” with Lemonada Media will launch on April 8, per a press release obtained by Us Weekly. (Deadline was the first to report the news on Thursday, March 13.)

The eight-part series, which drops episodes weekly, will feature conversations with female founders and friends, who will share stories about the ups and downs they faced from starting a company to selling it.

“Confessions of a Female Founder” gives listeners a glimpse of behind-the-scenes stories from female founders, as well as Meghan's own company, As Ever.



“I'm so proud of what we're creating, and the candid conversations that I'm able to have with other female founders as we unpack the twists and turns of building a business,” Meghan, 43, said in a statement. “Through my friendships and relationships, we're able to dive into the type of insights that everyone wants to know as they're building a business, and that I'm able to tap into as I'm building my own business with As ever.”

“As female founders ourselves, Steph and I are grateful to get a chance to build alongside Meghan the exact podcast we needed when we started Lemonada,” Lemonada's CEO and cofounder, Jessica Cordova Kramer added, while Lemonada's Chief Creative Officer and cofounder, Stephanie Wittels Wachs said, “Meghan is such a warm and welcoming person, and you feel that in her interviews. She creates a comfortable space for her guests to bring fascinating personal stories to the table and open up in a way they likely haven't before publicly. Listeners can expect conversations that are way more break room than boardroom.”

The news comes one year after she formed a deal with Lemonada Media to re-release her “Archetypes” podcast and a new show. (Meghan launched her “Archetypes” podcast in August 2022 via Spotify, who terminated the deal one year later.)

“[She] wants to do mostly philanthropic-type content,” a source exclusively told Us in February 2024 of Meghan's plans. “She considers herself too academic for entertainment-only. She doesn't want the podcast to be celebrity-driven, though she'll have some stars on.”

The insider shared that Meghan will “do some inner reflecting” on the show and “will share stories” from her own life.

Outside of the podcast arena, Meghan recently released her Netflix show With Love, Meghan, which offers a look into her Montecito, California, life with husband Prince Harry. In the eight-part series, Meghan shares tips on baking, cooking, crafting and hosting, while receiving visits from her famous friends.

Less than one week after the release, Netflix confirmed to Us that With Love, Meghan, will return for season 2.

Meghan took to Instagram to gush over the news. “Oh, how I love ASMR!” she captioned clips from season 1. “If you're loving Season 1, just wait until you see the fun we cooked up on Season 2! Thanks for joining the party, and an endless thanks to the amazing team and crew who helped bring it all to life! @netflix.”

It's hard to imagine anyone other than Mark Harmon playing the role of Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs on NCIS, but he wasn't the first choice!

The 73-year-old actor played the iconic character on the JAG spinoff series for 19 seasons, becoming the second to last original series regular to depart the show. 

In a recent feature from The Hollywood Reporter on the long-running and hit CBS drama series, creators Donald P. Bellisario and Don McGill, as well as several executives revealed that there were other names before Mark's who were mentioned for the part.

The contestants for Hulu's new reality competition TV show, Got To Get Out, were just announced...and there's nine celebrities participating!

Here's the synopsis: Twenty people under one roof, $1 million dollars in prizes up for grabs. To win it, they've GOT TO GET OUT…but that's much easier said than done.  Lies and lunacy collide in this exhilarating competition series where an outrageous mix of reality icons and crafty gamers must conspire to get out. In this house, time is money. As the clock ticks up, so does the prize money. The longer they stay, the greater their chance to earn more. They can split the money equally in the end, or at any point in time, try to make their escape with the accumulated money all for themselves, leaving others to start again at $0.  From wild strategies and temptations to shifting alliances and unbelievable escape attempts, the players will try any and every way to make it out of the gate and win the prize.

All 8 episodes will debut on Hulu on Friday, April 11.

The BBC has offered 'accelerated voluntary redundancy' to the majority of staff in its sports department as it seeks to drastically reshape its output and focus on digital content, Mail Sport understands.

As part of the proposals, set to come in from the summer, long-running news channel staple Sportsday is to be axed along with a series of presenting roles in significant changes one insider has claimed will 'effectively kill sports news on television'.

The broadcaster believes the moves will allow it to focus on growing its audience. In total, it is seeking to close 27 roles and create 27 roles as it seeks to transform its sports news coverage with more emphasis on reactive stories via streaming and original journalism rather than traditional TV coverage.

At a meeting on Wednesday plans to drastically reduce the number of sports bulletins and end the days of the flagship News at 6 and 10 programmes crossing to BBC HQ at MediaCity for sports updates at the weekends were shared.

In the short-term, three presenters and two correspondents are expected to be made redundant while there will also be job cuts to producers on the output and news gathering sides of what is set to be a significantly-altered operation. 

The majority of BBC Sport staff will be permitted to seek what has been described as 'accelerated voluntary redundancy' amid a wider picture of rapid change.

First broadcast in 2001, Sportsday is shown up to 12 times daily from Monday to Thursday, 11 times on Friday and twice daily at the weekend. 

Recognisable around the globe, it includes news, results and action from major sporting events. 

Following the changes, there will also only be one sports bulletin on the BBC's news channel through the day, at 1.30pm, and another at 11.45pm.

Director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski, who joined the broadcaster last June, is thought to be driving the changes. He led the meeting at MediaCity, in Salford, which was also viewed via videolink. The atmosphere amid some in the department post-meeting has been described to Mail Sport as 'funereal'.

The BBC's Breakfast show, meanwhile, will continue to feature a sports presenter.

'It feels like they are killing sports news on television,' a source claimed. 'Those involved are distraught. It came as a shock and it's fair to say that none of them saw it coming. They're basically decimating the output of sports news on television.'

A BBC spokesperson said the 'proposed changes' would 'allow us to enhance our storytelling and live event coverage to ensure we remain relevant and deliver more value for audiences across the UK'.

Talks are currently ongoing between BBC bosses and trade unions. The measures are part of a plan to cater to a bigger audience. Reactive stories on streaming platforms, along with more original journalism, are expected to feature prominently.

While it might not be the flashiest way to chart the rapid growth of women's professional sports, a building boom is showing that investors are paying attention.

There's already a dedicated women's soccer stadium in the National Women's Soccer League and another one is planned. The WNBA has seen a jump in new practice facilities — including a purpose-built training center for the Indiana Fever, Caitlin Clark's team.

These new facilities, often designed specifically for women, help teams attract and retain elite talent while also allowing for possible new revenue streams, like sponsorship opportunities.

“I would argue in the last two and a half years, we've made more progress than anyone thought would be possible. And our work is not done,” NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman said.

The NWSL's Portland Thorns and the city's yet-unnamed WNBA team for 2026 are among the teams that have benefitted. The Bhathal family, which owns both teams, is building a $150 million training facility to be used by both teams — a unique partnership between the two leagues.

Just 10 years ago, stories about the lack of proper facilities in the NWSL began to surface. Former players for Sky Blue, which later rebranded as Gotham FC, practiced on a field with a porta-potty for a restroom. Former U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo blogged in 2016 about some of the dismal conditions she experienced while playing in the league.

Last year, the NWSL's Chicago Stars were left scrambling after a music festival was booked for Bridgeview Village that would have disrupted fans attending a home match. While the music festival later moved, the incident highlighted the issues some teams have with stadiums that are not their own. Many pro women's teams must share facilities with men's teams or other entities.




The arrival of Clark supercharged the WNBA last year, with league attendance nearly doubling over 2023. The Fever in January announced a new $78 million training facility to open in 2027 that will give the team its own space apart from the NBA's Pacers.

The Chicago Sky, which has practiced at a public recreation center, will move into its own training facility ahead of the 2026 season.

The NWSL's Kansas City Current opened the first purpose-built women's soccer stadium last year. Denver, which was awarded the league's 16th team and begins play in 2026, pledged to build a privately-financed stadium as part of its expansion bid.

Bay FC is building a training center on Treasure Island, a former military base in the San Francisco Bay. Earlier this year, Angel City opened the NWSL's largest practice facility at Cal Lutheran University, which includes a 5,400-square-foot gym and even a children's playroom.

“There's not too many players, but for those of us that have been in the NWSL since its inception, we've played through a lot. We've played through understaffed teams, inadequate facilities, turf so hot it melted the bottom of my cleats,” Angel City forward Christen Press said. “We've played through investigations and abuse. We've played without a players association, without the opportunity to collectively bargain. We've played without respect and dignity, and we did it because we believed in a day like today.”

Infrastructure is a natural outgrowth of the investment pouring into women's sports as interest rises. Athletes are even joining in: New York Liberty star Sabrina Ionescu recently joined the ownership group of Bay FC, and tennis star Serena Williams bought a stake in the WNBA's new Toronto team.

Karina LeBlanc, who went from goalkeeper to general manager of the Portland Thorns and now works for the Bhathal family's RAJ Sports, said increased visibility creates more fans, fans create more interest, and interest translates to investment.

“Everybody plays a role. Whether you're a fan who's buying a ticket, whether you're turning on the TV, everyone can have impact on the investment of women's sports,” LeBlanc said. “And investment doesn't just have to be financially, it's the energy, it's the time, it's all of it. And in this time and moment right now, if we all lean into the little part that we can do, just watch it in 10 years.”

Such investment is reflected in team valuations. After the Bhathals acquired Portland's WNBA expansion team for $125 million, bids for a 16th franchise were expected to reach $200 million and beyond. Disney CEO Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay, dean of USC's journalism and communications school, acquired a controlling interest in Angel City FC last year at a $250 million valuation.

While in the past women's sports have been championed to promote equity and representation, the conversation has shifted as revenue projections have surpassed $1 billion globally. It's now big business.

“In order to maintain the recent growth and investment, those in and around women's sports must continue to move it beyond using sports as an advocacy tool and far more toward treating their assets as compelling businesses with economic upside,” said David M. Carter, founder of the Sports Business Group and adjunct professor of sports business at USC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news","Eagles signing a veteran edge rusher in free agency","https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/joshua-uche-free-agency-pass-rush-chiefs-brandon-graham-josh-sweat/654508/","Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:59:01 GMT","

The Eagles are signing veteran edge rusher Joshua Uche to a one-year deal, a league source confirmed to NBC Sports Philadelphia.

ESPN's Adam Schefter was the first to report the agreement.

Uche, 26, was a second-round pick in 2020 out of Michigan and played the first four and a half years with the Patriots before being traded to the Chiefs for a sixth-round pick in October. 

Uche has 20 1/2 career sacks and 34 quarterback hits in his five-year NFL career. His best season came in 2022, when he had 11 1/2 sacks with the Patriots.

After getting traded to the Chiefs in 2024, Uche barely played. He played just 87 defensive snaps in the regular season after the trade, 50 of which came in the regular season finale, and was inactive four times. Uche did not play for the Chiefs at all in the 2024 postseason and was inactive for Super Bowl LIX against the Eagles.

In his only career game against the Eagles in the 2023 season opener, Uche sacked Jalen Hurts. The Eagles got a close look at Uche during their joint practice against the Patriots in New England in August before the 2024 season. Uche was active and even got in a little scuffle that day.

In that impressive 2022 season, in addition to 11 1/2 sacks, Uche generated 49 pressures and had a career-best pressure rate of 18.5%. Even though his sack numbers dipped, Uche had a pressure rate of 15.3% in 2023 and was at 13.6% in New England last year before the trade to Kansas City. The Eagles will hope to get Uche back to playing at that level in Vic Fangio's defense.

Leading into free agency, ProFootballFocus identified Uche as an underrated free agent option: 

“The Michigan product had a breakout season in 2022, when he earned an eighth-ranked 87.8 PFF pass-rushing grade (among 100 qualifying edge defenders that season) and recorded a second-ranked 21.1% pressure rate at the position.

“Even though Uche was a one-dimensional player who only contributed on pass plays, that made him a valuable piece who consistently manufactured pressure on third downs. But Uche's career since then has taken a downturn, and even a mid-season trade to the Chiefs in 2024 didn't help. Regardless, Uche is only 26 years old, and his previously displayed potential should encourage a team to bet on him.”

After losing Josh Sweat to the Cardinals in free agency earlier in the week, this is a move to bolster the Eagles' edge rusher position. The Eagles also still have Nolan Smith, Jalyx Hunt and Bryce Huff on the roster. We're still waiting to hear if Brandon Graham is going to retire or come back for one more season.

ATTLEBORO, Mass. (WJAR) — An Attleboro High School student is hoping school leaders reconsider his punishment after he admits he made a rude gesture at last week's playoff basketball game against Springfield Central.

Patrick Lennon, a high school senior, enjoys supporting his friends on the court. But after the close game ended in a loss for Attleboro, he says things got tense and he flipped off the other team.

""Emotions were rising and I guess I got ahead of myself,"" Lennon said. ""I do not condone what I did. It was just the heat of the moment. I should be getting in trouble, but I think the punishment is too harsh.""



As for his punishment, Lennon is not allowed to attend school sporting events, according to a source close to the matter.

An online petition asking school leaders to reconsider is circling in the community. More than 480 people had signed, as of Wednesday night.

""I think it fits the bill,"" Joe Vega said. To me, it's huge unsportsmanlike conduct. I mean, the kid is still going to school which is fine. He's not expelled.""

""To me, it seems very harsh,"" said City Councilor Nicholas Lavoie, but only agreed to speak with NBC 10 as a lifetime Attleboro resident and a youth sports coach. ""I coach Blue Pride. I coach to be respectful, but playoffs, tempers run high, things get crazy on both sides and I think we just have to be a bit more mature when we're handing punishments to kids.""

The school district shared the following statement to NBC 10:



""Attending school sports events is a privilege. Students participating in after-school, school-sponsored events are subject to the student code of conduct, as referenced in the student handbook. Beyond that, we are unable to comment in any way on individual student discipline cases.""

A source close to the matter claims the student received more than one warning about behavior at the basketball game.","{'href': 'https://turnto10.com', 'title': 'Turn to 10'}"

TOPICS:

LANSING, Mich.  — A group of Republican lawmakers are expressing their concerns with the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) for how they handle transgender women in women's sports. It follows an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in February 2025, called “keeping men out of women's sports”.

The president's executive order threatens a loss of federal funding for any school that chooses not to follow it. It says, in part, “rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.”



“Today, protecting women's sports has become a politically charged issue but it shouldn't be,” Rep. Jaime Greene (R) said.

In response, Michigan House lawmakers took a vote Wednesday relating to transgender women in women's sports. A resolution that encourages MHSAA to follow President Trump's recent executive order.

A resolution that was adopted with 66 yays and 43 nays.

“They deserve to know that their state government has their back,” Emily Dievendorf (D) a Michigan State Representative said.

Though majority ruled, there were Democrats who were not in favor. One said the executive order is not about fairness, protecting women's sports or safety because there is no threat. Meanwhile, Republicans say it's about safety and tradition.

News channel 3 has confirmed with MHSAA that just two transgender girls apply for and receive waivers to participate on girls' teams for the fall season.

“As a former varsity tennis player, soccer player and cheerleader I witnessed firsthand the evolution of women's sports,” Greene said.

Michigan Republican senators held a meeting on the same topic last week. Again, the resolution passed by the house Wednesday only urges the MHSSA to adhere to President Trump's executive order.","{'href': 'https://wwmt.com', 'title': 'WWMT-TV'}"

Sports analytics is fueled by fans, and funded by teams. The 19th annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference (SSAC), held last Friday and Saturday, showed more clearly than ever how both groups can join forces.

After all, for decades, the industry's main energy source has been fans weary of bad strategies: too much bunting in baseball, too much punting in football, and more. The most enduring analytics icon, Bill James, was a teacher and night watchman until his annual “Baseball Abstract” books began to upend a century of conventional wisdom, in the 1980s. After that, sports analytics became a profession.

Meanwhile, franchise valuations keep rising, women's sports are booming, and U.S. college sports are professionalizing. All of it should create more analytics jobs, as “Moneyball” author Michael Lewis noted during a Friday panel.

“This whole analytics movement is a byproduct of the decisions becoming really expensive decisions,” Lewis said. “It didn't matter if you got it wrong if you were paying someone $50,000 a year. But if you're going to pay them $50 million, you better get it right. So, all of a sudden, someone who can give you a little bit more of an edge in that decision-making has more value.”

Would you like to be a valued sports analytics professional? Here are five ideas, gleaned from MIT's industry-leading event, about how to gain traction in the field.

1. You can jump into this industry.

Bill James, as it happens, was the first speaker on the opening Friday-morning panel at SSAC, held at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston. His theme: the value of everyone's work, since today's amateurs become tomorrow's professionals.

“Time will reveal that the people doing really important work here are not the people sitting on the stages, but the people in the audience,” James said.

This year, that audience had 2,500 attendees, from 44 U.S. states, 42 countries, and over 220 academic institutions, along with dozens of panels, a research paper competition, and thousands of hallway conversations among networking attendees. SSAC was co-founded in 2007 by Daryl Morey SM '00, president of basketball operations for the Philadelphia 76ers, and Jessica Gelman, CEO of KAGR, the Kraft Analytics Group. The first three conferences were held in MIT classrooms.

But even now, sports analytics remains largely a grassroots thing. Why? Because fans can observe sports intensively, without being bound to its conventions, then study it quantitatively.

“The driving thing for a lot of people is they want to take this [analytical] way of thinking and apply it to sports,” soccer journalist Ryan O'Hanlon of ESPN said to MIT News, in one of those hallway conversations.

O'Hanlon's 2022 book, “Net Gains,” chronicles the work of several people who held non-sports jobs, made useful advances in soccer analytics, then jumped into the industry. Soon, the sport may have more landing spots, between the growth of Major League Soccer in the U.S. and women's soccer everywhere. Also, in O'Hanlon's estimation, only three of the 20 clubs in England's Premier League are deeply invested in analytics: Brentford, Brighton, and (league-leading) Liverpool. That could change.

In any case, most of the people who leap from fandom to professional status are willing to examine issues that others take for granted.

“I think it's not being afraid to question the way everyone is doing things,” O'Hanlon added. “Whether that's how a game is played, how we acquire players, how we think about anything. Pretty much anyone who gets to a high level and has impact [in analytics] has asked those questions and found a way to answer some.”

2. Make friends with the video team.

Suppose you love a sport, start analyzing it, produce good work that gets some attention, and — jackpot! — get hired by a pro team to do analytics.

Well, as former NBA player Shane Battier pointed out during a basketball panel at SSAC, you still won't spend any time talking to players about your beloved data. That just isn't how professional teams work, not even stat-savvy ones.

But there is good news: Analysts can still reach coaches and athletes through skilled use of video clips. Most European soccer managers ignore data, but will pay attention to the team's video analysts. Basketball coaches love video. In American football, film study is essential. And technology has made it easier than ever to link data to video clips.

So analysts should become buddies with the video group. Importantly, analytics professionals now grasp this better than ever, something evident at SSAC across sports.

“Video in football [soccer] is the best way to communicate and get on the same page,” said Sarah Rudd, co-founder and CTO of src | ftbl, and a former analyst for Arsenal, at Friday's panel on soccer analytics.

3. Seek opportunities in women's sports analytics.

Have we mentioned that women's sports is booming? The WNBA is expanding, the size of the U.S. transfer market in women's soccer has doubled for three straight years, and you can now find women's college volleyball in a basic cable package.

That growth is starting to fund greater data collection, in the WNBA and elsewhere, a frequent conversation topic at SSAC.

As Jennifer Rizzotti, president of the WNBA's Connecticut Sun, noted of her own playing days in the 1990s: “We didn't have statistics, we didn't have [opponents'] tendencies that were being explained to us. So, when I think of what players have access to now and how far we've come, it's really impressive.” And yet, she added, the amount of data in men's basketball remains well ahead of the women's game: “It gives you an awareness of how far we have to go.”

Some women's sports still lack the cash needed for basic analytics infrastructure. One Friday panelist, LPGA golfer Stacy Lewis, a 13-time winner on tour, noted that the popular ball-tracking analytics system used in men's golf costs $1 million per week, beyond budget for the women's game.

And at a Saturday panel, Gelman said that full data parity between men's and women's sports was not imminent. “Sadly, I think we're years away because we just need more investment into it,” she said.

But there is movement. At one Saturday talk, data developer Charlotte Eisenberg detailed how the website Sports Reference — a key resource of free public data —has been adding play-by-play data for WNBA games. That can help for evaluating individual players, particularly over long time periods, and has long been available for NBA games.

In short, as women's sports grow, their analytics opportunities will, too.

4. Don't be daunted by someone's blurry “eye test.”

A subtle trip-wire in sports analytics, even at SSAC, is the idea that analytics should match the so-called “eye test,” or seemingly intuitive sports observations.

Here's the problem: There is no one “eye test” in any sport, because people's intuitions differ. For some basketball coaches, an unselfish role player stands out. To others, a flashy off-the-dribble shooter passes the eye test, even without a high shooting percentage. That tension would exist even if statistics did not.

Enter analytics, which confirms the high value of efficient shooting (as well as old-school virtues like defense, rebounding, and avoiding turnovers). But in a twist, the definition of a good shot in basketball has famously changed. In 1979-80, the NBA introduced the three-point line; in 1985, teams were taking 3.1 three-pointers per game; now in 2024-25, teams are averaging 37.5 three-pointers per game, with great efficiency. What happened?

“People didn't use [the three-point shot] well at the beginning,” Morey said on a Saturday panel, quipping that “they were too dumb to know that three is greater than two.”

Granted, players weren't used to shooting threes in 1980. But it also took a long time to change intuitions in the sport. Today, analytics shows that a contested three-pointer is a higher-value shot that an open 18-foot two-pointer. That might still run counter to someone's “eye test.”

Incidentally, always following analytically informed coaching might also lead to a more standardized, less interesting game, as Morey and basketball legend Sue Bird suggested at the same panel.

“There's a little bit of instinct that is now removed from the game,” Bird said. Shooting threes makes sense, she concurred, but “You're only focused on the three-point line, and it takes away all the other things.”

5. Think about absolute truths, but solve for current tactics. 

Bill James set the bar high for sports analytics: His breakthrough equation, “runs created,” described how baseball works with almost Newtonian simplicity. Team runs are the product of on-base percentage and slugging percentage, divided by plate appearances. This applies to individual players, too.

But it's almost impossible to replicate that kind of fundamental formula in other sports.

“I think in soccer there's still a ton to learn about how the game works,” O'Hanlon told MIT News. Should a team patiently build possession, play long balls, or press up high? And how do we value players with wildly varying roles?

That sometimes leads to situations where, O'Hanlon notes, “No one really knows the right questions that the data should be asking, because no one really knows the right way to play soccer.”

Happily, the search for underlying truths can also produce some tactical insights. Consider one of the three finalists in the conference's research paper competition, “A Machine Learning Approach to Player Value and Decision Making in Professional Ultimate Frisbee,” by Braden Eberhard, Jacob Miller, and Nathan Sandholtz.

In it, the authors examine playing patterns in ultimate, seeing if teams score more by using a longer string of higher-percentage short-range passes, or by trying longer, high-risk throws. They found that players tend to try higher-percentage passes, although there is some variation, including among star players. That suggests tactical flexibility matters. If the defense is trying to take away short passes, throw long sometimes.

It is a classic sports issue: The right way to play often depends on how your opponent is playing. In the search for ultimate truths, analysts can reveal the usefulness of short-term tactics. That helps team win, which helps analytics types stay employed. But none of this would come to light if analysts weren't digging into the sports they love, searching for answers and trying to let the world know what they find.

“There is nothing happening here that will change your life if you don't follow through on it,” James said. “But there are many things happening here that will change your life if you do.”

AUSTIN, Texas — Between July 11 and Nov. 4, 2024, the Texas athletics department admitted to NCAA violations concerning sports betting, per documents acquired by the Austin American-Statesman.

Although the identities of the five individuals implicated in the violations have been concealed, they encompass two football players, a non-student-athlete affiliated with the women's tennis program, a student assistant and an athletic department employee whose role is unspecified.

The Statesman's reporting found that the five people placed impermissible wagers totaling $14,885.76. The individuals wagered money on athletes' statistics through PrizePicks, a daily fantasy sports site.

Sports betting is illegal in Texas; however, the app PrizePicks is legal.

NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes, coaches and athletics staff from betting on, or providing information that could influence betting on, any NCAA-sponsored sport.

According to Global Sports Advocates, the potential penalties for student athletes betting on NCAA events include:","{'href': 'https://spectrumlocalnews.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News'}"

Two weeks before the Tampa Bay Rays begin their 2025 season playing at minor league ballpark Steinbrenner Field, team owner Stuart Sternberg announced on social media that the franchise ""cannot move forward"" with a new ballpark and development in St. Petersburg, Florida.

""After careful deliberation, we have concluded that we cannot move forward with the new ballpark and development project at this moment,"" Sternberg wrote in a statement. A series of events beginning in October that no one could have anticipated led to this difficult decision.""

""We continue to focus on finding a ballpark solution that serves the best interests of our region, Major League Baseball, and our organization,"" he continued.

— Tampa Bay Rays (@RaysBaseball) March 13, 2025

Sternberg added that the city of St. Petersburg is working to restore Tropicana Field, which was significantly damaged during Hurricane Milton, and the team will play there in 2026.

The Rays' announcement comes ahead of a March 31 deadline for the team to put forth $700 million toward a $1.3 billion new ballpark development in the region's Historic Gas Plant District. Construction on the project was to begin over the winter, but Hurricane Milton and disagreement between the team and the St. Petersburg City Council over costs for the development stalled those plans.

In December, the city council voted to approve bonds that would help fund the new ballpark project. The vote, which passed by a 4-3 margin, effectively called the Rays' bluff as the team attempted to back out of the original deal in an effort to restructure its financial obligation.

“We put it out there, we're in. We're a partner in this. Hopefully, the [Pinellas County Board] will follow suit, council member Brandi Gabbard said at the time, via The Athletic.

“And then it will be up to the Rays to decide. It will be up to them to go back to their partners — go back and find other funding. And then when they can't perform, it'll be up to them to come back and say they can't.”

The Pinellas County Board voted the project forward two weeks later, which put the onus on the Rays to come up with their financial obligation toward the ballpark development.

The Rays' announcement was made amid reports that MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and other team owners are pressuring Sternberg to sell the team. The league reportedly wants the franchise to remain in Florida, whether in downtown Tampa or Orlando.

At least two ownership groups have emerged to express interest in buying the franchise, The Athletic reports. One of the groups includes the family of Edward DeBartolo Jr., members of which still have a stake in the San Francisco 49ers, in addition to former New York Yankees minority owner Joe Malloy. In the meantime, Sternberg is attempting to recruit minority investors.

Plans to repair Tropicana Field continue, with St. Petersburg recently approving an additional $950,000 toward a pre-construction phase of the project. Total costs for the city are expected to be $56 million, with the project expected to be completed in January 2026.

A big second-half performance powered a Cooper Flagg-less Duke past Georgia Tech in Thursday's ACC tournament quarterfinal in Charlotte.

The No. 1 Blue Devils (29-3) found their shooting rhythm in the final 20 minutes after a poor first-half showing en route to a 78-70 win over the Yellow Jackets (17-16).

Duke completed the second-half comeback without the services of Flagg, who left the game late in the first half after injuring his ankle following a rebound.

With the Blue Devils trailing, Flagg grabbed a rebound and landed awkwardly. After spending time on the bench getting treatment, he left for the Duke locker room needing assistance.

Flagg was taken for further examination and for X-rays in a wheelchair by medical staff and later ruled ""doubtful"" to return.

Early in the second half, Flagg exited the Duke locker room not wearing a boot and able to walk on his own. He would find a seat on the Blue Devils' bench where he would watch the remainder of the game.

Duke head coach Jon Scheyer said Flagg suffered an ankle sprain and that X-rays were negative. He did not say when Flagg would play again, only that they will determine his status going forward after they see how bad the swelling gets in his foot.

Flagg recorded only two points on 1-of-7 shooting before his injury.

Duke trailed Georgia Tech 31-26 at the half after missing their first 13 3-point attempts and going 36.7% from the field. That all changed over the final 20 minutes where they outscored the Yellow Jackets 52-39 and finished the game shooting 23.3% from 3-point range and 43.5% from the field.

Duke's Kon Knueppel led all players with 28 points. Khaman Maluach and Isaiah Evans each added 14 points for the Blue Devils.

The 18-year-old Flagg is projected to be the No. 1 pick in June's NBA Draft. In his freshman season with Duke he was named ACC Player of the Year, ACC Rookie of the Year and voted first-team All-ACC and to the ACC All-Defensive and All-Freshman teams.

Duke will next face the winner of Wake Forest and North Carolina in Friday's semifinal.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Peoria Manual senior Dietrich Richardson is the latest standout to suit up for the Rams. The 6-foot-7, 195-pound guard, who is the nephew of former Illini D.J. Richardson, is a Bradley signee and averaging 18.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 5.8 assists this winter.

PEORIA — Brandun Hughes and Willie Coleman were among those that took center stage at State Farm Center when Peoria Manual was beginning its boys' basketball dynasty.

That core helped the Rams claim the 1994 Class AA state championship, the first of four straight state titles the program would claim.

While the last two of those championship games were contested at Peoria Civic Center, just 21/2 miles from Manual's campus, Dietrich Richardson and Terrance Paige have helped the Rams back to Champaign this year. For the first time in 30 years.

“Having a chance to represent the community and also having a chance to go out on the main stage and show that all the work that we put in is paying off,” Manual coach Marvin Jordan said. “It's been an end goal for all of us this whole year.”

Manual (23-12), which will face Dyett (25-7) in a Class 2A semifinal game at 3:45 p.m. Thursday, was a mainstay in Champaign in the late stages of coach Dick Van Scyoc's career and the beginning of Wayne McClain's time as Manual's coach.

Van Scyoc's tenure with the Rams ended with their 1994 state title, which followed third-place finishes in 1986 and 1988 and a state runner-up result in 1991. Jordan — who helped Manual to the 2010 2A state title game before playing at Niagara in college — is hoping to lead the Rams to their first state title since 1997. That one capped a four-year run of excellence by Manual.

“I didn't pursue to go and play professionally,” Jordan said. “Once I got back home, I was right back into my high school gym, checking on those guys and making sure they're working out. Because the goal from our community is to get to college.”

So far, so good for Jordan, now in third season as his alma mater's head coach.

“I'm very excited for all of that work to be paying off,” Jordan said. “Guys are able to take a step back and actually look to see that (if) we put the work in, we can make it happen. Being able to understand that is probably the best for me.”

The Rams' ties to Champaign run deep.

McClain — who was an assistant coach at Illinois from 2001-2012 under Bill Self and Bruce Weber and served as Champaign Central's coach during the 2013-14 season — guided the Rams through the final three years of their four-peat. Manual's 1996-97 team finished as USA Today's top team in the country.

The program has produced standout former Illini like Jerry Hester, Sergio McClain, Marcus Griffin, Frank Williams and Da'Monte Williams.

“A lot of alums. It's definitely a tradition,” Jordan said. “Because again, we all learn so much in that gym. If we ever we come back and we're close enough, we're stopping by to visit, regardless if the gym is open. A lot of times we have guys in there working out, but then when the alums come back, the guys are in there are all ears.”

Richardson — a Bradley signee — and Paige have handled the bulk of the offense for the Rams this season, as Richardson averages 18.1 points while Paige contributes 11.4 points per game.

“We have a lot of players who can get their own shots and create shots for others,” Jordan said. “So with having that many of us, I like to keep it an open offense. I like to run, and I'm a big believer in hitting the open guy. Keep it as simple as possible to get the best results.”

The 6-foot-7 Richardson also leads the Rams in rebounds (240) and assists (168), including 18 points, five rebounds and a pair of assists in the team's 52-29 win against Williamsville on Monday night in the Springfield Super-Sectional. A win that clinched Manual's first trip to state since 2019.

“He's been our offensive catalyst,” Jordan said. “He's just been a tremendous leader on both ends of the ball. Having someone like him with leadership to teach a lot of the guys who are younger and have less experience than him, they have a great leader to learn from.”

Reggie Postlewaite, Joshua Humbles and Amare Breedlove round out the remainder of the Rams' starting lineup.

Tony Bradford and Caden Latta have contributed by averaging 8.1 points and 5.3 points off the bench, respectively.

“I don't want to single any one player out,” Jordan said. “As a coach, you don't know if all the guys are going to buy in or how the season is going to go at the beginning. ... This team gets it. They understand. A lot of that was from being a part of the teams in the past and being guys with experience.”

Manual has clicked off nine consecutive wins entering the state tournament, with a Big 12 Conference wins against Danville and playoff wins against Clinton, Tremont, Macomb, Sherrard and Williamsville.

That stretch followed a seven-game losing streak that included a 49-46 loss at Champaign Central at the buzzer on Jan. 31, narrow Big 12 losses to Normal Community and Peoria and a slim setback against Morton.

“We did a lot of learning in that segment,” Jordan said. “In my gym and our program, it's not wins and losses. It's winning and learning. In that time, we did a lot of learning. I feel like each game out there was a different lesson, and I knew that it would help us.”

And the tradition-rich Rams — the only boys' basketball team in IHSA history to win four straight state titles — aren't feeling the heat ahead of their 13th state finals appearance.

“I don't think I would call it pressure at all,” Jordan said. “We've been battle-tested all year, and I think that we've worked hard enough to overcome that. We can hang our hat on the actual work that we've done and not guess and wonder if we would come out and play with the intensity that we want to.”

Still living in Danville more than two decades after retirement, Gene Gourley continues to have an affect on his many former players.

Santa Clara wants to make it easier for low-income youths to play sports by paying their fees.

Watch NBC Bay Area News 📺 Streaming free 24/7

The Santa Clara City Council voted unanimously Tuesday, with Councilmember Raj Chahal absent, to make the Wade Brummal Scholarship program easier to access and more streamlined. The program helps low-income families pay sports-related fees.

Changes include a streamlined application process for youth sports groups, turning the paper form into an electronic submission, as well as more clear guidelines on the scholarship's uses. Councilmembers also amended the fee application approval process to allow city employees to approve requests up to $2,500. Anything above that amount needs approval from the city's Parks and Recreation Commission.

""My goal is that any kid that wants to play should be able to play, but the kid whose parents can pay, they should be paying a reasonable amount,"" Councilmember Suds Jain said during the meeting. ""That's my philosophy about this.""

The city established the scholarship in 2015 and imposes a $25 fee on non-Santa Clara residents participating in local sports groups to provide scholarships for residents who can't afford it. The scholarship has about $235,000 in its fund, according to the city.



Mike Walke, executive board president of the Police Activities League, said the changes make the scholarship program easier to access.

""I'm in favor of the final result, it has clear guidelines and procedures that everybody can follow,"" Walke told San Jose Spotlight.

Walke and dozens of representatives from other nonprofit youth sports groups met with the city's parks and recreation department multiple times over the course of about a year to discuss the field fees and scholarship program. Walke said while discussions were tense at times, there were efforts on both sides to understand each other's concerns and come to a solution for everyone.

Parks and Recreation Commissioner Vikas Gupta said the program has been underutilized by the city's nonprofit youth sports groups because of the cumbersome application process and general lack of awareness.

""It's kind of hard to project how it's going to play out,"" Gupta told San Jose Spotlight. ""When (nonprofits) have disadvantaged youth in their membership, hopefully they will be able to relay that information to them and share that they in fact are able to support them through the scholarship.""

He said the city has a history of prioritizing services to residents, including supporting youth sports, but it can't subsidize the programs fully, so compromises were made.

Last year, the city began charging a $14 per hour fee to use fields. Multiple nonprofit youth sports groups, including the Police Activities League, spoke out against the fees, claiming it was a large financial burden, especially on low-income families who might not be able to afford the increase.

Improving the scholarship is one way the city can ease the burden for low-income families whose children want to play sports. The other is adjusting the field fees, which was approved by parks commissioners Monday.

The proposal includes lowering the amount nonprofit youth sports groups are charged from $14 an hour to $8 an hour. Walke said he would've preferred to not have to pay for fields, as the youth sports groups did before 2024, but added the lower amount is more manageable.

""Zero amount would be wonderful but that's not ever gonna come back, so being realistic,"" Walke told San Jose Spotlight. ""Times are changing, so does everything around you.""

The City Council will review the proposed field booking fee updates at a meeting in April.

Sports Editor

With the IHSA boys' basketball state tournament back in Champaign starting with six state semifinal games on Thursday at State Farm Center, we got 21 well-regarded high school coaches from across the state of Illinois to weigh in on the sport they love:

Provided

St. Ignatius boys' basketball coach Matt Monroe.

St. Ignatius boys' basketball coach since 2016 who led the Wolfpack to the Class 3A state tournament in 2022 and 2023, placing third in 2022 and fourth in 2023

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player in Illinois I've ever seen is ... Derrick Rose. Illinois basketball has featured so many incredibly talented and accomplished high school basketball players. Over the years, I have been lucky to have seen, coached and coached against so many amazing players. Some of the best have included Jereme Richmond, Patrick Beverley, Jalen Brunson, Kevin Garnett, E.J. Liddell, Brandon Paul, Jahlil Okafor, Jabari Parker, Phoenix Gill and Jon Scheyer. But if I had to pick one player, I would have to go with Rose. He was an exciting player to watch, led his Simeon teams to multiple state championships and became a cultural icon within the Chicago basketball community.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... the first thing that comes to mind are the IHSA boys' basketball state finals. I went to the state finals with my dad when I was young, and it was an awesome experience being able to coach St. Ignatius in the 3A Final Four the first two years it returned to Champaign.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Bruce Weber. I remember watching Lou Henson's Flyin' Illini when I was younger and have some great memories of those awesome teams. I was a student-manager at DePaul University when we hosted the NCAA Sweet 16 the year that Illinois made the championship game. I was in the building working the event during their epic comeback against Arizona and it was one of the greatest games I've ever witnessed live. A few years later, I got to meet Coach Weber a number of times because he was recruiting a couple of players I coached. Even after reaching some incredible heights, he couldn't have been more kind, gracious and humble in all our interactions. That really made a positive impression on me.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... what happens on the day of our games. However, competing against our opponents on game nights is just part of what we do. A lot of time goes into planning practices, watching scout film, meeting with coaches, studying the game, taking care of administrative tasks, monitoring academic progress, mentoring players and more. Those are the unseen hours. While winning is always the goal, and as coaches we put our hearts and souls into doing everything we can to give our teams the best possible chance to be successful on game nights, winning is not the most important part of coaching. The most important aspects of coaching are building lasting, positive relationships with everyone in your program and using basketball to teach important life lessons. At the end of the day, if you keep the main thing the main thing, it will lead to success on the court as well.

Andy Douglas has led the Quincy boys' basketball program during the last 11 seasons after playing for the tradition-rich Blue Devils in the late 1990s.

Quincy boys' basketball coach of 11 seasons and nephew of former Illini great Bruce Douglas has led his alma mater to five regional titles and two sectional titles since 2018

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player I've ever seen in Illinois is ... I had a front row seat to watch Joey Range play Quentin Richardson in the state championship game in 1998. We just won third place that year and stuck around to watch that game. Those two going back and forth was impressive. It's hard to choose between those two players, so I will go with Range and Richardson. They were men amongst boys and had their way with the competition.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... I was not even a year old when my mom and dad took me to my first Illini game. We were there to watch my uncle, Bruce Douglas, play. Derek Harper hit a shot at half-court at the buzzer to win the game. I've been a fan ever since. I love that place and love being able to take my son and family to a game every once in a while.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... when I was young, I had the opportunity to meet coach Lou Henson. He was Illini basketball for years and will always be a staple for the program. As I have grown older, I have an appreciation for Brad Underwood. To be able to do it as long as he has and to adapt with the times is huge.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... this is more than a ‘two hours a day at practice' type of job. The amount of time and energy that gets put in on a daily basis is crazy. There are not too many people out there that would work for less than $6 an hour. At the high school level, we are not coaching for the pay. We genuinely love and care about the kids we coach and want to help teach them life lessons and skills that they can carry on with them when the ball stops bouncing.

Provided

Waukegan boys' basketball coach Ron Ashlaw.

Waukegan boys' basketball coach who coached former Illini Jereme Richmond when Waukegan placed second in Class 4A in 2009 and third in 4A in 2010

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player in Illinois I've ever seen is ... probably Marcus Liberty of Chicago King in the 1980s, followed by Jereme Richmond of our Waukegan Bulldogs during the 2009 and 2010 seasons. My favorite high school player of all-time is Brian Houston of Chicago St. Gregory in the mid-1980s. Toughest warrior I had even seen on the basketball court. He played like he was 6-7 for a player truly 6-3.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... I always think of the 1989 Flyin' Illinois Final Four team, the trip to see the state finals with my father when I was a high school player and going to the state finals as a young starting-out freshman coach at Chicago St. Benedict. In those days, we even had a drill called ‘The Road to Champaign' that we utilized frequently in practice. Plus, several trips there to see the Illini during the 2010-11 season.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Bruce Weber. He was extremely kind and helpful during my early years at Waukegan, as his program and staff were heavily involved in the life and career of one of our Bulldogs in Jereme Richmond. I always felt that his 2004-05 team ran some of the best pure, true motion offense of any team I have ever seen play, before and since, which is what we have always tried to implement with our teams.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... probably 80 percent of building a season and a team happens outside of the four lines. Building program culture, instilling team standards, managing personalities, gluing parts together, encouraging and motivating over the long road of a season. All of that must be accomplished before the first whistle blows, and the first X's and O's are drawn up.

Highland boys' basketball coach Deryl Cunningham.

Highland boys' basketball coach who was a Parade All-American at St. Joseph's in 1989 and went on to play in college at DePaul and Kansas State

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player in Illinois I've ever seen is ... Marcus Liberty. He was a 6-foot-8 presence in the 1980s and handled the ball silky smooth like a guard. He was simply before his time.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... I think of the Flyin' Illini. It's the way I grew up and watched the games in my high school era.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Bill Self. His team had an extra edge. He brought the fire back into the program before moving on to Kansas.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... how much time that really goes into the players and program behind the scenes.

Provided

Glenbrook South boys' basketball coach Phil Ralston when he coached Geneva at the 2015 IHSA boys' basketball state tournament in Peoria.

Glenbrook South boys' basketball coach since 2017 who also led Geneva and Grant. Has more than 400 career wins and guided Geneva to a fourth-place finish in Class 4A in 2015

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player I've ever seen in Illinois is ... I've seen an awfully lot of really amazing high school players, but Jalen Brunson's performance in the state tournament his junior year in 2014 might have been the most amazing performance I had ever seen in one game. Or maybe Jon Scheyer's 21 points in 75 seconds. I've had two players of mine that scored over 50 points — Nate Navigato at Geneva and Dom Martinelli at Glenbrook South. I might never coach players that put on such amazing performances. I'm still in awe of what I witnessed.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... given that for most of my coaching career, the Civic Center in Peoria served as the site of the the IHSA state tournament, it has a special place in my heart because my Geneva team played there in 2015. However, now that the state finals are at State Farm Center, it is truly one of the best college venues in the country and is perfect for the state finals. Ironically, Glenbrook South's Titan Dome was designed as a mini-replica of the Assembly Hall.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Lou Henson. To me, Illini basketball will always be Coach Henson's teams. I had the opportunity to meet him personally when I was on staff at Northwestern University. There could not have been a more classy person — but that could have been easy given that his teams beat the Wildcats while I was there. I really enjoyed Bruce Weber, too, and his 2005 team might have been one of my favorite Big Ten teams. He's such a tremendous coach, and it was amazing that he made such an amazing impact in such a short period of time at Illinois.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... there is so much more that goes into high school coaching outside of what people see at games. The amount of time that is put in for training, scouting, building relationships and team bonding. Building a successful program often depends on a coach's ability to build a winning culture that often has numerous outsiders who unintentionally are tearing apart what coaches are trying to build. When a coach is able to get his team to stop listening to the outsiders — friends, family, AAU coaches and teammates and people on social media — and only focus on each other, their team's bench and the 84 feet by 50 feet on the court, then something truly magical can occur.

Provided

Rockford Auburn boys' basketball coach Bryan Ott.

Rockford Auburn boys' basketball coach who has won 468 games with the Knights since 1999 and has a third-place finish in Class 4A in 2012 and a fourth-place finish in 4A in 2016

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player in Illinois I've ever seen is ... Derrick Rose. It's an incredibly tough question because there's been so many exciting players over so many years, but Rose won back-to-back state championships at Simeon. A dynamic scorer but also an amazing creator for his teammates. He was unselfish and hard-nosed. Everything you would want from a high school basketball player who just so happened to be a great athlete. It was clear he was headed for the NBA.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... I still think of it as Assembly Hall and all the state tournaments I attended as a high school student and then as a young coach. I will never forget my first time watching a game there. I had just finished my junior year of high school, and our team went down to watch the tournament. I was amazed by everyone there: Ben Wilson, Kenny Battle and Kevin Duckworth. But most of all, the lob pass on the baseline out of bounds, over the top of the backboard, to Everette Stephens. Years later, as a high school assistant, watching the defensive efforts of Tai Streets and Thornton versus Farragut and Kevin Garnett. I don't know if Garnett was ever guarded that well in his entire pro career.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... still Lou Henson. Coach Henson resurrected the program, making it nationally relevant once again. Obviously, the Illini had many disappointing finishes in the NCAA tournament in those years. Bob Knight received much attention for his teams' defensive toughness, but I think Illinois under Henson was every bit as tough. From the outside looking in, Coach Henson appeared to be a fair-minded, completely humble individual who was always deflecting praise to this players. The Flyin' Illini remains my favorite collection of players of all-time. All of them from this state and they seemed destined to win the national title.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... I'm not sure anyone who does not hold this position can possibly understand the amount of time a head coach pours into the players and into the craft of coaching itself. The public may see the excitement of game nights and imagine drawing up plays on a marker board, but misses the day-to-day grind of teaching skills, drilling offense and defense and building relationships based on sweat equity. Coaching is not a hobby. Coaching may be paid as a small stipend, and the season may be only four months long, but coaching is truly a year-long endeavor. The head coach essentially has two full-time jobs: whatever career or vocation that pays the bills, and then a coaching position that one better treat as a full-time occupation in order to simply present a competitive product on the floor. No one does this job long if they don't truly love the challenge of developing players and building a team.

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player in Illinois I've ever seen is ... I had the opportunity to watch Andre Iguodala when he was at Springfield Lanphier. He was a freak athlete who played at a different speed. He was a man amongst boys, a five-tool player who was high flying and defended amongst the best of them.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... I think of Dee Brown, Deron Williams and Luther Head. I grew up a die-hard Illini fan.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Bill Self. I loved the way he approached the game. I loved his philosophy. I loved his toughness he had about him, but also the way he treated his players.

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player in Illinois I've ever seen is ... Joey Range from Galesburg. I watched him a lot when I was in college. He had the total package of being able to play inside and outside. He played a lot like LeBron James at the high school level. With his size, strength and athleticism, Joey could do everything on a basketball court.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... I always think of Andy Kaufmann's shot against Iowa. I remember watching it on TV live and as a Hawkeye fan, I remember being heartbroken. I always think of that shot when I'm inside of Assembly Hall.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Bruce Weber. When I was a young coach at Bismarck-Henning and Galesburg, Coach Weber always was willing to share so much with high school coaches. He truly was a developer of talent and men. I always admired how he ran his program, and his teams always felt like family.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... I think the general public fail to realize how close-knit that teams get through the season. We spend so much time with each other, it really becomes like a family. We don't always agree or like each other, but in the end, we all love each other. There isn't much better in life than being part of a team.

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player I've ever seen in Illinois is ... Howard Nathan from Peoria Manual. His combination of speed, skill, basketball IQ, toughness and selflessness was fun to watch. He was a fierce competitor and teammate. He was a pleasure to watch.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... the first thing that comes to mind was watching my father officiate three IHSA state tournaments as a Hall of Fame official. I remember going downstate with him and falling in love with players like Ben Wilson, Ed Horton, Kenny Battle, Levertis Robinson, Steve Bardo, Nick Anderson, Everette Stephens and Marcus Liberty. My first heroes in basketball.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Lou Henson. What talent he had, and to have that many great players and be able to coach them was fun to watch as a teenager.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... that these players are 14-17 year-olds and going through all the things teenagers go through off the court. Although they look like adults, they are young men trying to learn and find themselves while enjoying success and overcoming adversity.

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player I've ever seen in Illinois is ... Derrick Rose. I got the chance to see him play when I was coaching at Marshall County High School in Kentucky and he and Simeon played in the Marshall County Hoopfest. Holy smokes, he was on another planet from anyone I have ever seen play.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... the IHSA state tournament is the first thing I think of. When they opened those doors and we walked up that tunnel to take the floor last year, it was a view I will never forget.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... this is an easy one for me being a southern Illinois guy: Bruce Weber. I had the chance to get to know him when he was at SIU, and he is just a first-class person who is a great basketball coach.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... the time that goes into preparing for a game, especially a postseason game. The coaches spend countless hours watching film and coming up with a game plan. Sometimes, it doesn't work out, but most people have no idea how much time and effort has gone into preparing for that game.

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player I've ever seen in Illinois is ... as a coach, Mark Smith from Edwardsville. To be on the bench and his performance in his senior year will be something I will never forget. As a fan of basketball, it is Shaun Livingston.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... growing up an Illini fan and then attending the UI, Assembly Hall has always been a special venue. Now as a high school coach, it's the goal and destination of a great season. My best memory there is watching the Wake Forest game during the 2004-2005 season. It's a special place.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Bruce Weber. When he became the Illini coach, I sent him an email as a student at the UI letting him know I was going to go into coaching. I never expected a response, but he sent me a full-page email back letting me know what a great profession it can be and how to impact kids. It was very inspirational.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... what they see on the court on Tuesdays and Fridays is a really small part of what we do. The day-to-day interactions with our players, the program building, fundraising, supporting your coaching staff and the practice planning and decisions that all go into running your own program are endless.

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player I've ever seen in Illinois is ... I'm biased, but Colin Falls from Loyola is definitely in the picture. He was a 2,000-point scorer who did it all for his high school team from freshman through his senior year before he became the all-time leader in three-pointers made in the Big East when he played at Notre Dame.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... it's the symbol of getting downstate in the best high school basketball tournament in the country. We have a picture of State Farm Center in our locker room and meeting room.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Bruce Weber. I really enjoyed watching his teams compete and the 2004-05 Illini team was a great team. Coach Weber was also a very good guy who was easy to talk to.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... it's a non-stop job that has little down time even in the offseason. Coaches families' sacrifice a lot of time, but also benefit from the addition of this extended family that is our team. It's the absolute best job in the world, and we are very fortunate to have it.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... to me, it is still Assembly Hall. I grew up going to Illini games with my family. A lot of core memories for me in that building. My wife was a cheerleader for the Illini, so I think of her when I hear Assembly Hall. Plus, our third-place finish in 2023 ended on that floor. I love that building.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Brad Underwood. I love his energy and approach to coaching. He coaches players hard and holds them to high expectations.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... I think of the ultimate goal: playing in the state tournament.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Lou Henson. I grew up watching his teams in the 1980s and 1990s. The Flyin' Illini put Illinois basketball back on the map and were an electric team on both ends of the floor. How could you not admire Lou-doo!

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... the amount of time put in outside of practice and game time. It's more than just show up and practice or play. The endless hours scouting and prepping for practice and game is not realized by others. People also don't realize the relationships coaches build with their players on a personal level. You get to know them and see them at their highs and lows. They also get to see you, as a coach, in those moments. Besides the preparations and the competition, that is what I love about being a coach: you get to help grow youngsters into young men and teach them lessons that hopefully will benefit them years after they are graduated.

➜ The best high school boys' basketball player I've ever seen in Illinois is ... Derrick Rose. He was such a dynamic player on both ends of the floor. He was an incredible scorer from all three levels and had phenomenal court vision as well. What separated him from other great players was his willingness to play defense. He always got after it on the defensive end of the floor utilizing his speed and athleticism to pressure the ball all night.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... I think of Illini basketball. I have been to Illini games in every decade since the 1980s. The atmosphere is always amazing.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... I grew up during the Flyin' Illini Lou Henson days, so I will go with Coach Henson.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... how close we are with our players. We spend more time with our teams during the season than we do our own families.

➜ The Illini men's basketball coach I've admired the most is ... Lou Henson. My best buddy from Pittsfield High School went to the UI and was on the Orange Squad for Coach Henson. He would get to dress something like every third home game, and if it was a blowout, would get in for a minute or two. Once Lou came down to put him in the game and said, ‘You see what Kendall Gill is doing, go in and do what Kendall is doing.' Of course, we got quite a kick out of that. Lou was always very gracious to my father and me.

➜ The one aspect of coaching most people don't realize is ... after the game is over or the bus gets back, you head home and get going on washing all of the uniforms, warmups and bench towels while you work on film from the game and for your next opponent.

In terms of coaching, one of the best players I've ever coached against was Ethan Happ at Rockridge, who went on to play at Wisconsin. We held him to like 25 points and 30 rebounds one night, and walked out with a one-point win in a sectional final. He was really, really good.

➜ When I hear the words State Farm Center ... the Flyin' Illini come to mind. I grew up in Philo and I had plenty of opportunities to watch them play. I know there's debate on who has had the best team at Illinois, but that was my team,

With Selection Sunday just days away, the Madness is nearly upon us. Men's college basketball conference tournaments are now in full swing and most of the nation's top teams will be in action on Thursday.

The day started with a scary moment in Duke's ACC opener against Georgia Tech. Projected No. 1 NBA Draft pick Cooper Flagg sprained his ankle and needed to be helped off the court just before halftime. The Blue Devils held on for a nervy win, but coach Jon Scheyer was noncommittal on Flagg's status moving forward.

Later on Thursday, two-time defending national champion UConn returns to Madison Square Garden to try to remind everybody why the Huskies are so dangerous in March.

This week may just be a prelude to the Big Dance, but there's a crush of worthwhile action to tune in for in the power conferences and beyond. (Scroll for live updates.)

The Hogs fought valiantly to get back into their second-round game against the Rebels, but they ultimately came up short after two missed free throws in the waning seconds and then the 3-pointer by Pedulla.

Coach Cal's team will have a nervous few days as the Hogs are firmly on the NCAA tournament bubble.

Duke head coach Jon Scheyer said Flagg suffered an ankle sprain and that X-rays were negative. He did not say when Flagg would play again, only that they will determine his status going forward after they see how bad the swelling gets in his foot.

More on Flagg's injury right here

The Cougars' torrid run continues. That's their ninth consecutive win and advances them to the Big 12 semifinals, where they'll play the winner of Colorado vs. Houston.

Meanwhile, we have a shootout between Iowa State and BYU. The Cyclones are projected to be a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament while the Cougars are likely looking at a No. 5 seed.

The Red Storm are as hot as any team in the country as we near March Madness. They've only lost one game in 2025 and rolled right through Butler in their Big East tournament opener.

St. John's is playing at a high level, just rolled past Butler by 21, 78-57 at first round of Big East tournament. Big East POY Rj Luis gets 20 and lock down defense paves the way.

Per John Ewing of BetMGM, Duke was the most-bet team on Thursday as a 23.5-point favorite. The Blue Devils won by eight after Cooper Flagg's first-half injury.

The Blue Devils got more than they bargained for in their ACC tournament opener, but they survived and will face the winner of Wake Forest-North Carolina on Friday.

The bigger question is the severity of Cooper Flagg's ankle injury and how long he'll be out.

As Duke-GT winds down, here's a look at other notable live games ongoing:St. John's 74, Butler 51Oregon 61, Indiana 54Iowa State 68, BYU 61Ole Miss 42, Arkansas 34

The Blue Devils are firing on all cylinders now. After an alley-oop from Kon Knueppel to Khaman Maluach, Isaiah Evans drilled a 3-pointer to push Duke's lead to double digits.

The Yellow Jackets stopped the bleeding and are still hanging in there after Duke's blitz out of the break.

The Blue Devils are shooting the ball much better in the second half after missing their first 13 3-point attempts and going 36.7% from the field in the opening 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, in on-court action, the Blue Devils scored the first 12 points out of the locker room and have taken the lead early in the second half. Kon Knueppel and Sion James hit 3s as Duke is finally finding the mark from deep.

That's one way to respond after losing your star player.

With 3:56 left in the first half, Georgia Tech is up 26-12 and Duke's poor shooting is the story.

The Blue Devils are 26% from the field and 0-for-13 from 3-point range. Cooper Flagg has just two points on 1-of-3 shooting.

NEW YORK (AP) — RJ Luis Jr. scored 20 points and No. 6 St. John's romped to a 78-57 blowout of Butler in their Big East Tournament quarterfinal Thursday.

One game after posting the program's first triple-double this century, Kadary Richmond finished with 15 points, nine assists and eight rebounds for the Red Storm (28-4). Aaron Scott also scored 15 for St. John's, which has won seven straight games — and 17 of 18 since the new year.

Coming off the school's first outright Big East regular-season title in 40 years, the Johnnies hold the top seed at the conference tournament for the first time since 1986. They'll play No. 4 seed Xavier or fifth-seeded and 25th-ranked Marquette in the first semifinal Friday night at Madison Square Garden.

After going 23 years without reaching the Big East semis, the Red Storm have made it twice in two seasons under 72-year-old Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino. The resurgent Johnnies are seeking their fourth Big East Tournament title and first since 2000.

Patrick McCaffery had 16 points to lead No. 9 seed Butler (14-19), a 75-69 winner over eighth-seeded Providence in the first round Wednesday. Finley Bizjack scored 10 before leaving with an apparent ankle injury at the 14:59 mark of the second half.

WNBA star Caitlin Clark, wearing a Butler baseball cap, sat just behind the scorers' table near the team's bench. Clark's boyfriend is Bulldogs assistant coach Connor McCaffery.

Patrick McCaffery, who fought thyroid cancer while playing at Iowa, cried on his brother's shoulder after exiting his final college game.



  Takeaways
 

Butler: Since joining the Big East for the 2013-14 season, the only time the Bulldogs reached the conference tournament semifinals was 2018.

St. John's: Improved to 19-0 at home, including 10-0 at MSG. The last time the Johnnies finished unbeaten at home was the 1931-32 season.



  Key moment
 

Luis, the Big East Player of the Year, scored all eight of his first-half points in 2 1/2 minutes, part of a 15-0 spurt that gave St. John's an 18-3 lead with 12:29 remaining before the break. Butler never got closer than eight the rest of the way.



  Key stats
 

St. John's, which never trailed, held the Bulldogs to 34.5% shooting and outscored them 44-18 in the paint along with 15-0 on fast breaks.



  Up next
 

St. John's swept Marquette and Xavier during the regular season, but went to overtime once against each one.

➜ Their road to Champaign ... has seen the Crusaders win four of their five postseason games by double digits and celebrate a sectional title on their home court with their fans. Brother Rice traveled to Pontiac on Monday night and easily defeated Peoria 60-41 to clinch its spot in Champaign after topping Lemont 53-41 last Friday night to win a sectional title.

➜ Their go-to players are ... a senior tandem that has the Crusaders feeling confident. Marcos Gonzales is Brother Rice's clear leader, averaging 18.6 points, 5.7 rebounds and 3.0 assists. Jack Weigus complements Gonzales by averaging 16.1 points and sinking a team-high 88 three-pointers.

➜ Their coach is ... compiling a string of 30-win seasons to start his tenure at a program that will bring home its first state trophy. Conte Stamas, who has also coached at Lyons Township and Evanston, has a 91-14 record so far with the Crusaders. His first two teams went 30-5 and 31-3, but didn't reach Champaign, with Brother Rice last making state in 2005.

➜ Coach speak: “These last two weeks, we've really picked up our defense. All year, I've not been really pleased with our defense, and we seem to be just living on outscoring people. But these last two weeks, it's like the light bulb went off and we've started to defend really, really well.”

➜ Their road to Champaign ... is a long time coming. Mainly because St. Patrick has never reached the state tournament. Now, they'll bring a state trophy back to Chicago after the Shamrocks outlasted Chicago Mt. Carmel 49-48 in a super-sectional game on Monday night on the Illinois-Chicago campus. St. Patrick is averaging 79.6 points in its postseason run.

➜ Their go-to players are ... seniors in E.J. Breland, Nevaeh Hawkins and Anthony Favia. Breland is the Shamrocks' leading scorer by averaging 14.1 points and making 100 three-pointers this season. Hawkins (10.4 points, 5.5 rebounds) and Favia (9.8 points, 2.2 assists) are also solid options St. Patrick can rely on.

➜ Their coach is ... someone who has devoted most of his life to St. Patrick. Mike Bailey has 656 wins in his coaching career, with 560 of those coming in charge of the Shamrocks. A position he first started in 1994 and a position in which he has guided St. Patrick to 30 winning seasons. On top of reaching Champaign, this team also has the most wins in school history.

➜ Coach speak: “St. Patrick High School playing down in Champaign on St. Paddy's Day weekend. It gets no better than that. I think the town of Champaign better be ready when the Shamrocks roll in, because St. Pat's knows how to celebrate St. Paddy's Day.”

➜ Their road to Champaign ... has featured routs. The last two trips to Champaign have produced state championships in Class 2A in 2023 and 3A in 2024, and the Rams are the favorite again this year. Winning all five of their postseason games by an average of 35.2 points, including a 68-28 victory against Kaneland on Monday night in the super-sectional in Hoffman Estates, is proof of that favorite status.

➜ Their go-to players are ... guys who know how to play in State Farm Center. Makai Kvamme averages 11.0 points, 3.3 rebounds and 4.9 assists as a senior leader. Rashuan Porter is a 6-7 junior post presence averaging 12.4 points and 7.1 rebounds. But junior guard Rykan Woo might be the Rams' most important player this weekend, averaging a team-high 15.0 points on a veteran roster.

➜ Their coach is ... already a coach with state titles and two third-place finishes. And that's just since 2019. All the more impressive for Tom Kleinschmidt since all those state trophies have happened in the last four state tournaments because the pandemic canceled the 2020 and 2021 events. The former DePaul standout boasts a 296-104 record in 13 seasons coaching the Rams.

➜ Coach speak: “As a school we've had some fortune. We had a football state champion this year. We had a girls' volleyball Final Four team. Our cross-country teams have won state titles and runners-up. Our baseball team has been to the Final Four, and then this is our fourth consecutive year getting downstate for basketball. I'm pretty proud of that.”

➜ Their road to Champaign ... isn't entirely unexpected. But almost. Glenwood didn't reach 20 wins until it beat Springfield 44-36 in a regional semifinal game on Feb. 26. Close wins have followed, with the next four victories by the Titans coming by a combined 24 points. A 43-41 victory against Triad on Monday night in Springfield has the Titans and their fans relishing the program's first trip to state since 1975.

➜ Their go-to players are ... ones who boast good size. Cameron Appenzeller is a 6-5 senior guard averaging 13.5 points and 5.8 rebounds, Jonathan Helm is a 6-4 senior forward averaging 12.6 points and a team-high 7.3 rebounds and 6-7 senior forward Mason Neumann adds to the height department and production department for Glenwood by averaging 8.7 points and 4.8 rebounds.

➜ Their coach is ... a familiar face on the Glenwood sidelines. Todd Blakeman first got the job with the Titans in 2005 and then coached the next 16 seasons, compiling a 270-200 record that featured a sectional title in 2013 and five regional titles. Then, he stepped aside in 2021 only to return ahead of the 2023-24 season. Now, he will give Glenwood its first state trophy this weekend.

➜ Coach speak: “Chatham Glenwood's pretty rich with multiple sports and its tradition in those sports. They've been to the state tournament in soccer and football and everything else pretty much, but this is our first time being to the state finals in basketball, and it's a pretty big deal for our community and school.”

Glenwood coach Todd Blakeman

In early 1993, Michigan basketball coach Steve Fisher did a double take when he walked by the newly opened NikeTown store along Chicago's Magnificent Mile.

“The front window was plastered with Fab Five stuff,” Fisher told Yahoo Sports.

There were Michigan jerseys for sale bearing the jersey numbers worn by Chris Webber, Juwan Howard and Jalen Rose. There were the black socks that the Fab Five had helped popularize. And there were the royal blue and purple Air Flight Huaraches that Nike had given to Michigan players to wear before anyone else and that at least one Fab Five member considered the quintet's unofficial signature shoe. 

At the time, Fisher viewed the storefront display as evidence that corporations were treating the Fab Five brand as a marketable commodity but that his players weren't seeing any of the profits. Now he also sees it as proof that the members of college basketball's most celebrated recruiting class would have made a killing in the NIL market if they played in the modern era.

“They were marketed by other people from the time they came out of high school,” Fisher said. “I can't fathom how much they would command now, but it would be a new high, I would imagine.”

For decades, the NCAA stubbornly refused to allow college athletes to become paid endorsers or to monetize their success beyond school-funded scholarships. Only in response to mounting legal and political pressure four years ago did the NCAA relent and at last loosen its name, image and likeness policies.

The rule change instantly laid bare exactly how much generations of college athletes had been underpaid and undervalued. Despite objections from the NCAA, NIL deals predictably became de facto pay-to-play devices, with donors and collectives footing the bill for athletes rather than the universities themselves.

Men's basketball players often land the most lucrative pay-to-play deals, those in the NIL space told Yahoo Sports, because one or two standouts can drastically improve a program. Deals well into the six figures are common for high-major starters. Top-tier transfers received as much as $2 million last offseason. Highly touted prospect A.J. Dybantsa reportedly had an asking price of $5 million before choosing BYU over Alabama, Kansas and North Carolina.

“I wouldn't be surprised if you see more basketball schools drop their drawers to go get a big-time player like that,” said AthleteZ PR founder Megan Curry, a former Adidas executive who transitioned into the NIL space four years ago.

For top-tier athletes with big personalities and visible platforms, the endorsement market is also a profitable pathway. You've seen commercials featuring Paige Bueckers sipping Gatorade, Cooper Flagg shooting jumpers in New Balance sneakers and Livvy Dunne tumbling in Vuori leggings and joggers.

With the NCAA tournament tipping off in less than a week and the landscape of college athletics evolving so rapidly, Yahoo Sports sought to tackle an intriguing question: Which past men's college basketball legends would have earned the most money in the modern NIL era? To answer that, Yahoo Sports asked eight experts in the NIL space to rank their top candidates. The only rules were to keep it strictly to men's basketball players from after the NCAA tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.

Below are the results of that informal poll. It's a top eight that includes everything from draft busts to NBA superstars.

Jimmermania first swept an unsuspecting nation the night of January 26, 2011.

That's when Fredette cemented his reputation as college basketball's most feared scorer at the expense of Kawhi Leonard and previously unbeaten San Diego State. The BYU senior torched the fourth-ranked Aztecs for 43 points, pulling up, going right or going left, off balance or off the wrong foot, from the paint or from impossibly deep range.

Video clips of Fredette's most audacious shots instantly set social media ablaze. Kevin Durant described Fredette as the “best scorer in the world.” Rap star Nelly called Fredette “the truth.” Steve Nash gushed on Twitter, “Jimmer Fredette? Man, that name's straight outta Hoosiers. No wonder he never misses.”

As Fredette's fame grew, it became more difficult for him to venture out in public. He resorted to enrolling in online courses after weeks of getting mobbed on campus and showing up to classes an hour late. He ordered most meals via delivery to avoid constantly being interrupted mid-bite by autograph seekers. He checked into hotels using an alias and left BYU's home arena undercover after games to avoid being spotted.

“My now-wife, at the time my girlfriend, had to drive her car to a secret entrance so that I could leave because there were so many people waiting outside,” Fredette told Yahoo Sports in a 2018 interview.

Between Fredette's distinctive name and aesthetically pleasing playing style, sports business experts say he'd have been a goldmine in the NIL era. They argue brands would have jumped to associate with Fredette until his star fizzled in the NBA.

Said Austin Walton, CEO and founder of Next Sports Agency, “He'd have made millions and millions of dollars today.”

Wardell Stephen Curry II wasn't always a one-name superstar. The son of ex-Charlotte Hornets sharpshooter Dell Curry grew up in the heart of ACC country without receiving a single ACC scholarship offer.

The cult of Curry began to grow at Davidson with every impossibly deep 3-pointer and every scoring barrage. Fans packed arenas across the Southern Conference to witness Curry's exploits. Then a national audience fell in love with the wisp of a guard when he racked up 128 points in four NCAA tournament games to carry Davidson within a missed 3-pointer of the 2008 Final Four.

A baby-faced Curry went on ""Late Night"" with Conan O'Brien that March. He was best known as Dell's son when that NCAA tournament began. By the end he became so popular that Dell was relegated to Steph's dad.

The buzz about Curry even tempted the NBA's biggest star to make a couple special trips to see Davidson play. LeBron James sat courtside for Davidson's Sweet 16 rout of Wisconsin and for the Wildcats' victory over NC State the following December. James leaped out of his seat after an acrobatic Curry layup, spoke glowingly of the young guard's crowd-pleasing game and even exchanged cell phone numbers with the Davidson star.

“Whenever we heard he got a text from LeBron, it was just the coolest thing,” Curry's Davidson teammate, Andrew Lovedale, told Yahoo Sports in 2023.

Those in the NIL space say that Curry would have been besieged with endorsement offers had his college career come 15 years later. The year after spearheading Davidson's Elite Eight run, Curry averaged 28.6 points and showcased the point guard skills NBA teams wanted to see.

“If an NCAA tournament hero comes back the next year, it opens up a lot more possibilities,” Rob Sine, co-founder and CEO of the NIL agency, Blueprint Sports, told Yahoo Sports. “I don't know if anybody knew he was going to be what he is now, but he was already doing things we'd never seen before.”

At the end of a pep rally celebrating their first national championship, the stars of that 2005-06 Florida team made a stunning announcement. Projected first-round picks Joakim Noah, Al Horford and Corey Brewer revealed they were postponing their NBA dreams and coming back to Gainesville to chase a second straight championship.

“We're back, baby!” Noah shouted, drawing a roar from the O'Connell Center crowd.

Fort Lauderdale-based sports attorney Darren Heitner was a student at the University of Florida at the same time that Noah, Horford and Brewer were considering their future. Heitner laughs when he considers how many millions those future first-round picks could have commanded in the modern NIL era.

Last offseason, Heitner reviewed the $2 million contracts that Great Osobor signed when he transferred to Washington and that Coleman Hawkins signed when he transferred to Kansas State.

“Don't get me wrong, they're talented players,” Heitner told Yahoo Sports, “but they didn't have the national acclaim nor a championship under their belt. So yeah, I would expect Al Horford, Joakim Noah and Corey Brewer to command at least that much.”

Then there's the endorsement side.

While Heitner admits “brands would have jumped at the opportunity” to associate with Florida's returners as a group, he argues that Noah would have been most marketable individually. The 6-foot-11 future lottery pick evolved into college basketball's ponytailed antihero, revered by some for his on-court bravado and political consciousness yet reviled by others for his untamed locks and chest-beating antics.

""He's the most hated player in college basketball,"" Brewer told reporters days before Florida became the second team since John Wooden-era UCLA to win back-to-back titles.

Says Heitner now, “He would have been in line for millions of dollars.”

He's not just perhaps the greatest freshman of college basketball's one-and-done era. He's also one of the most marketable.

At the beginning of Davis' junior year of high school, he was a 6-foot-3 guard with a single offer from Cleveland State. Over the next year-plus, he famously grew eight inches, blossomed into an elite shot blocker and rebounder and attracted interest from just about every major program in college basketball.

Forget for a moment that Davis was the best player on a 38-2 Kentucky team that captured John Calipari's lone national championship. Or that he became one of three freshmen ever to be named college basketball's national player of the year. What sets Davis apart from other college basketball legends from a marketability standpoint was his infamous unibrow.

What started with a few Kentucky fans making T-shirts with the silhouette of the unibrow over Davis' No. 23 went on to spawn an entire cottage industry. Numerous unibrow-themed T-shirts popped up at Kentucky home games with slogans like ""Brow down,"" ""Bow to the brow"" and ""Fear the Brow."" More adventurous fans shaved a replica unibrow into their chest hair or drew unibrows onto their faces in permanent black marker. Davis' mother even wore a Mardi Gras-themed mask to the SEC tournament title game with a drawn-on-brow over the eye holes.

""I just embrace it,"" Davis told Yahoo Sports before the 2012 Final Four. ""The fans enjoy it and the signs are everywhere now. They've been making everything out of it. I've even seen a baby with a unibrow on Twitter.”

Were it possible back then, Heitner believes that brands would have latched onto Davis' unique look just like fans did.

“Everyone was talking about it back then,” said Heitner, who has drafted and reviewed countless NIL contracts. “I think a lot of companies could have found creative ways to take advantage.”

Last March, during an interview on ESPN Radio, Laettner revealed his distaste for how college basketball has evolved since his playing days.

“They gotta take out the NIL,” Laettner said. “They gotta wipe that out. They gotta change the transfer portal.""

Laettner argued that coaches can't develop “any type of culture at a school” when they have to overhaul their rosters every year and reteach their offensive and defensive system. That's why Villanova's Jay Wright, Alabama's Nick Saban and other college basketball and football coaching legends have retired, Laettner contested.

“I think I saw something with Nick Saban where he said the first thing a recruit says to him now is how much money are you going to get me, “Laettner said. “I mean, it's just horrible.""

The irony of that rant is that Laettner would have benefited as much as anyone in his era if the loosening of NIL rights arrived three decades earlier. Laettner was a four-time Final Four participant, a two-time national champion and college basketball's player of the year as a senior. He hit maybe the most iconic shot in college basketball history, the buzzer-beating turnaround jumper that capped a 10-for-10 shooting performance and won Duke the 1992 East Regional final over Kentucky.

Above all else, Laettner became the player opposing fans most loved to hate. He was brash. He was cocky. He was a bully. He always won. He famously stepped on one opposing player and got away with it. He became a symbol of silver-spoon Duke entitlement even though he actually grew up in a blue-collar, working-class household.

Laettner embraced being the bad guy. Corporations could have used that to their advantage.

“Laettner was a massive, massive name and that Duke team in general, they were celebrities,” said sports marketing executive Michael Ehrlich, founder and CEO of the brand consultancy and talent representation firm Playbook Marketing. “One of my favorite marketing mantras is ‘either love me or hate me, but feel me.' You either loved Laettner or hated Laettner. That drives conversation, brand value and dollars.”

In summer of 1985, former LSU men's basketball coach Dale Brown traveled to West Germany to deliver motivational speeches to U.S. soldiers. Brown had just finished holding a basketball clinic at a U.S. Army base in the town of Wildflecken when he felt a tap on his shoulder.

Looking the tall, hulking figure in front of him up and down, Brown earnestly asked, “What rank are you, soldier?”

“Coach, I'm 13 years old,” a young Shaquille O'Neal replied.

An incredulous Brown introduced himself to O'Neal's stepfather that day, gave him a business card and made a point to stay in touch. Before long, Brown became the first to offer O'Neal a scholarship after he moved to San Antonio and blossomed into a goliath of a superstar.

Over the next few years, the rest of the basketball world became familiar with the powerful yet nimble kid who Brown met in Wildflecken. He became the top center recruit in his class. Dick Vitale lost his mind watching him block a shot in the McDonald's All-American game and then go coast-to-coast for a rim-shaking dunk.

At LSU, O'Neal became a phenomenon beloved as much for his fun-loving personality as for his high-flying blocked shots and thunderous dunks. The 7-foot-1 center averaged 27.6 points, 14.7 rebounds and 5.0 blocks as a sophomore. The next season, he put up similar numbers and won national player of the year.

O'Neal went on to endorse anything and everything as an NBA superstar, from Burger King, to Pepsi, to Reebok, to Icy Hot. That would have started when O'Neal was at LSU had the NCAA allowed it, marketing experts say.

“He was a freakish athlete with a larger-than-life personality,” said Chris Brown, chief operating officer of Blueprint Sports, which matches college athletes with NIL opportunities. “Those are the guys that stand out for me.”

One month before he unveiled the most celebrated freshman class in college basketball history, Michigan coach Steve Fisher took his players to the school's outdoor track to time how fast they could each run a mile.

Fisher vividly remembers the shock of finding a horde of reporters gathered alongside the track waiting to capture footage of the Fab Five doing mundane preseason conditioning.

“We had all the local TV outlets, ESPN, even the New York Times,” Fisher said. “That just goes to show how much hype they received.”

The interest only mushroomed as Webber, Rose, Howard, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson led Michigan to back-to-back national title game appearances. When Michigan's team bus arrived at Penn State in February 1993, hundreds of Penn State fans greeted them to ask for photos or autographs. A couple weeks later in Tucson, Arizona, Fisher recalls a memorabilia collector sending a bevy of 10-year-old boys with big bags of basketballs for the Fab Five to autograph.

“I compare it to traveling with the Beatles,” Fisher said.

While the Fab Five's basketball legacy is significant, its cultural impact was even more massive. Rose was the jester. Howard was all-business. Webber scowled on the court and flashed a megawatt smile away from it. Together, the black-socked, baggy-shorted Fab Five impacted basketball style at every level of the sport.

Before the Fab Five, black socks were for the “shuffleboard crowd,” Fisher said with a laugh. After the Fab Five started wearing them in games, everyone else did too.

“It became crazy,” Fisher said. “You couldn't find a pair of black socks in the store. Truly, you couldn't find them.”

The excitement about Zion Williamson began to build before he was even old enough to obtain a driver's license. The 6-foot-7, 285-pound manchild became the rare athlete who amassed a national following while he was still in high school.

Standing-room-only crowds flocked to his tiny South Carolina private school to see him play. YouTube clips of his blocked shots and 360 dunks amassed millions of clicks. The rapper Drake even followed Williamson on Instagram and posted photos of himself wearing the 16-year-old's Spartanburg Day jersey.

Starring for one of college basketball's most visible programs accelerated the pace of Williamson's ascent to stardom. Viewers couldn't get enough of the projected No. 1 overall pick with the size and power of an NFL defensive end and the footwork and agility of an NBA-bound small forward.

Celebrities such as Barack Obama, Floyd Mayweather and Jay-Z made special trips to watch Williamson play. Tickets for marquee Duke games went for for thousands of dollars on the secondary market. The frenzied response to Williamson spraining his left knee when his shoe split open against North Carolina provided a true measure of his impact. Investors reacted by unloading Nike stock, causing shares to tumble by as much as 1.7% the following day.

When Williamson's lone season at Duke ended one victory shy of the Final Four, sports marketing experts were left scratching their heads trying to think of a previous NBA prospect with as much mass appeal. Some mentioned LeBron. Others went even further back in history.

“I guess you go back to Shaq, maybe?” Bob Dorfman, creative director at San Francisco-based Pinnacle Advertising, told Yahoo Sports at the time. “But more recently, I can't think of anybody. I haven't seen anybody have as much attention surrounding him in recent years.”

Even though injuries have hampered Williamson in the NBA, those in the NIL space say that shouldn't take away from projections of what he could have earned at Duke. All but one of the NIL experts polled by Yahoo Sports had Williamson among their top three potential earners. Many had him atop their lists.

“When Zion was playing in college, he was the name,” said AthleteZ PR founder Megan Curry. “I think brands would have jumped all over him.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Until Saturday Newsletter 🏈 | This is The Athletic's college football newsletter. Sign up here to receive Until Saturday directly in your inbox.

Today in college football news, welcome to that time of year when neighbors are proud to show off their very loud yard-work devices.

EA Sports' college football franchise returned last summer with off-the-charts sales numbers, but also with plenty of obvious room for improvement.

Some of that had to do with absent features that had been in the series' pre-hiatus era, such as the ability to play as an FCS team, a high school recruit or 11 Stanford trees in Mascot Mode, along with various details like trophy cases and mass substitutions.

Advertisement

But the game was also noticeably without features that had never been part of the series, though they're common in sports games overall. Despite finally being able to (openly and legally) include real players, thanks to NIL, last year's edition didn't depict real coaches. Its makeshift stand-ins were connected to playbooks and skill levels that reflected real-life styles, but other than that, these were just NPCs in polo shirts.

That seems to be changing this year, with a leaked photo of a potential EA Sports cover shoot at the Rose Bowl (an event confirmed by Chris Vannini's reporting) emerging on Instagram. The pics appear to include Arizona State's Kenny Dillingham, Georgia's Kirby Smart, Ohio State's Ryan Day, Ole Miss' Lane Kiffin and Penn State's James Franklin, along with 10 current players, a handful of mascots and previous EA legends Reggie Bush, Denard Robinson and Tim Tebow.

 

 

A post shared by Tubby (formerly bringncaaback) (@tubbycfb)


Is every coach in the game? We'll stay tuned. As noted before, if UNC's Bill Belichick is here, it'll be his first video game appearance since 2001 — despite having been the coach of Madden's New England Patriots almost that entire time.

Vannini has more details on the leak.

🌀 (That's henceforth our portal emoji. Thank you to readers Mary and Sarah for suggesting it.) With the portal set to open again next month, here is the QB situation at every Power 4 school.

🕺 This is gonna get roasted so hard every time West Virginia loses a game this season: Rich Rodriguez bans TikTok dances.

🐶 Kirby Smart explains why he has not fired the eternal object of every Georgia fan's blame, OC Mike Bobo.

😈 Arizona State, the next Clemson? Culturally speaking, no, I don't believe so. But in football?

💰 “A new system outside the NCAA to regulate and enforce the rules that will take effect when colleges can begin making direct payments to athletes is being built by the power conferences.” (My emphasis added.)

🏀 This is March:

For decades, SEC men's basketball was a national punchline — other than Kentucky and sometimes Arkansas or Florida, at least, though they rarely outshined Tennessee's women. Within the South, Kentucky's fondness for men's hoops was itself a different punchline, as if UK was settling for something besides the one correct sport. The whole thing presented the SEC as a bunch of cavepeople who only liked sports that involve punts. (To be clear, punts rule.)

Advertisement

In particular, Auburn and Alabama have long had the country's most football-focused rivalry. Not necessarily football's greatest rivalry (because I think the greatest is the one that happens to be your favorite), but, like, Ohio State and Michigan fans have always been aware that they have basketball programs, you know? Meanwhile, the Iron Bowl's hoops department produced little besides that cool photo of Charles Barkley eating pizza.

And now look at it. Days away from Selection Sunday, Auburn is a lock for a men's No. 1 seed, and Florida is favored for another, though Alabama and Tennessee are fighting for it as well. (Here's today's latest Bracket Watch.)

Florida and Tennessee and the SEC's Big 12 imports being good at hoops is one thing. But the Iron Bowl teams? Both? At the same time?

This season, the Iron Bowl of Basketball has produced both an AP No. 1 vs. No. 2 game and a game-of-the-year contender. Both teams have byes ahead of a potential SEC tournament championship matchup on Selection Sunday. The football backdrop, meanwhile: Bama's post-Nick Saban flirtation with mortality and Auburn football having been .500-ish every year since 2019. Yeah, get buckets instead!

To be clear, this hoops success is new, but not that new. They've each made a Final Four within the past five years. Still, as this rivalry continues to ascend into the rafters, which are things that do not hover over football fields, I turned to Kennington Smith III, who covers the Tide for The Athletic, and Justin Ferguson, proprietor of the Auburn Observer, with a couple questions I'd been wondering.

1. Why are these two so good at hoops these days, after decades of mostly mediocrity?

Kenny: “Alabama's commitment to strong coaching, which has led to elite recruiting, is the catalyst. Beginning with the Avery Johnson era, this includes some of Alabama's highest-ranked classes ever. Current coach Nate Oats' coaching ability has transcended the program, and his NBA play style and analytics-forward thinking have made Alabama a true destination program in high school recruiting and the transfer portal.”

Justin: “It all comes back to Bruce Pearl, who inherited one of the worst high-major programs in America but had the undeniable charisma and the proven experience to give administrators and fans reasons to buy in. Pearl's ability to recruit elite high schoolers and scout hidden gems in the portal has created a cycle of title-winning teams that have top-end talent but almost always bring back multiyear veterans.”

 2. Obviously this will always be a football state, but does it feel like basketball has a sustainable portion of local mindshare?

Kenny: “Oats' recent extension, which places him in the 10 highest-paid coaches in the country, and the ongoing construction of a new practice facility point toward the university's commitment. Roster-wise, Alabama signed the No. 2 high school class and No. 7 portal class in 2024 behind a strong NIL investment.

“Auburn and Alabama's ascension has elevated basketball in the state, and it feels like that interest is here to stay. Oats may or may not be at Alabama for the next several years, but it shouldn't be too difficult to persuade another high-level coach to Tuscaloosa.”

Justin: “Pearl's sustained success at Auburn is proof that this place can compete at the highest level in basketball, and there's no reason to believe that will go away after he's done on the Plains.”

In light of the IBOB, I asked you in Tuesday's newsletter: What would be the equivalent College Football Playoff matchup between two traditional basketball schools?

Several of you responded by proposing fitting rivalries such as Kentucky-Louisville or noted football school Indiana against Purdue. You also sent in lots of combos that involved UCLA, UConn and Villanova, along with reader Jay's Cincinnati-Xavier and Ashlee's Gonzaga-St. Mary's. Any of those pairings that involve non-FBS teams would truly tip the scales.

My favorite example of a basketball-first rivalry becoming a nationally crucial football game, though, is Wade's suggestion of Kansas-Missouri — because that one actually happened.

Amid the great upheaval of 2007, the best season ever produced by any sport, BCS No. 4 Mizzou (quarterbacked by The Athletic's Chase Daniel) beat No. 2 KU, clinching a spot in the Big 12 championship, where a win in a rematch against Oklahoma would guarantee a title shot. (Spoiler: Welp.)

That means the 2007 Border War was virtually a football quarterfinal, the equivalent of Alabama and Auburn meeting in basketball's Elite Eight.

Also, when I proposed this question, I knew which basketball rivalry would come to mind first for most of you. As reader Tim put it:

“The answer is so obvious, I tried to think of an alternative just so you wouldn't have 5,000 of the same emails. I failed. I'm hoping everyone else didn't ignore your call due to their ultimate choice not mattering, a la voting for Jill Stein or Ross Perot. Anyway, it's Duke-North Carolina.”

It works in every way: These state rivals have the definitive men's hoops matchup (which actually makes it too good of a comp for the Iron Bowl, a rivalry that does not outrank Michigan-Ohio State), along with football programs that have accomplished very little since the 1940s.

I also like it because the idea of them meeting in an expanded CFP no longer feels like impossible fanfic. If Belichick can stabilize a perpetual underachiever, and if Duke can keep nudging toward 10-win seasons …

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news","Rays fans react to news of stadium deal falling through","https://sports.yahoo.com/article/rays-fans-react-news-stadium-175800755.html","Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:58:00 GMT","

Fan reaction was immediate and sad to the news that the Rays will not meet the March 31 deadline to move forward with a stadium.

There were lots of calls to “sell the team,” but also hurt reactions.

“Embarrassing,” Pete Sarone posted in response to the team's post on X. “Tampa Bay deserves better. The fans. The region. The players. All deserve so much better.”

The Rays made the news official in a post on X on Thursday with a statement from owner Stuart Sternberg.

“After careful deliberation, we have concluded we cannot move forward with the new ballpark and development project at this moment,” he said. “A series of events beginning in October that no one could have anticipated led to this difficult decision.”

Some reactions noted that fans bear blame, too.

“Worst attendance in MLB. Rays fans getting what they deserve,” was posted by Pip on X.

Losing the team could be a gut punch, fans said.

“You know it's bad when we have to appeal to (Rob) Manfred (commissioner of Major League Baseball) to get this under control,“ Kyle Lease responded. ”Hopefully, it is a swift and decisive outcome, losing baseball in Tampa Bay would be catastrophic.”

There was also anger for the ownership.

“What a lame and disingenuous statement,” wrote Will Olson. “Just be honest with the fans, and not blaming the hurricane. Maybe it is time to get more investors or dare I say, sell the team.”

On X, Jeremy T of St. Petersburg directed his response to the owners: “Thanks for wasting untold amounts of public time and money to negotiate an insanely lopsided, wildly generous deal from an area decimated by hurricanes, only to walk away when you proved to be even more greedy than theoretically possible.”

There was a bittersweet quality to some reactions.

“I've been a fan since they became a team and have been to games every year and playoff games almost every time,” said Brandon resident Brenton Shepard, a longtime member of the 25,000-member Tampa Bay Rays Fan Club on Facebook.

He was more wistful about the news.

“I say this with all sincerity and without animosity. I am appreciative of what Stu has done to turn this wavering organization into a respectable, winning franchise. On and off the field,” Shepard said. “With that said, knowing the information that is readily available about the future of the organization, I am more confident than I have ever been that this team will find a home in the Tampa Bay area.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

No. 1 Duke Beats Georgia Tech 78-70 After Losing Flagg, Brown to Injuries in ACC Quarterfinals

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson)

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Kon Knueppel scored 28 points as No. 1 Duke overcame injuries to star Cooper Flagg and Maliq Brown to beat Georgia Tech 78-70 on Thursday and advance to the ACC Tournament semifinals.

Isaiah Evans scored 14 points on four 3-pointers and Khaman Maluach added 14 points and nine rebounds for the Blue Devils (29-3), who have won nine straight.

Flagg appeared to land awkwardly on Baye Ndongo's foot as he came down with a rebound late in the first half. The ACC player of the year retreated to the Duke bench and punched a seat in frustration. After being helped to the locker room, Flagg returned to the Duke bench in the second half without a boot on his foot. He did not return to the game.

Brown went down with a shoulder injury in the first half.

Duncan Powell led Georgia Tech (17-16) with 24 points.

Duke missed its first 13 shots from beyond the arc and fell behind 26-12, matching the season's largest deficit. They trailed 26-17 when Flagg left the game, but cut the lead to five at halftime. Duke pushed its lead to seven early in the second half when Tyrese Proctor stole a pass and delivered a high-flying one-handed dunk in transition.



  Takeaways
 

Georgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets bench was outscored 21-6.

Duke: The Blue Devils showed they have some firepower without Flagg and Brown on the court. After missing its first 13 3s, Duke went 7 of 17 the rest of the way.



  Key moment
 

Knueppel drove, scored and drew a foul for a 3-point play with about five minutes left in the game to put Duke up by 11.



  Key stat
 

Georgia Tech was outscored 28-12 to start the second half.



  Up next
 

Georgia Tech can hope for an NIT bid. Duke will face the North Carolina/Wake Forest winner on Friday.

UEFA says it will look into the possibility of reviewing the double touch rule that helped lead to Atletico Madrid's loss in a penalty shootout against Real Madrid in the Champions League

UEFA Wants to Review Double Touch Rule That Was Costly for Atletico in Champions League Shootout

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

MADRID (AP) — UEFA will look into the possibility of reviewing the double touch rule that helped lead to Atletico Madrid's loss in a penalty shootout against Real Madrid in the Champions League.

UEFA said on Thursday it will enter discussions with FIFA and the International Football Association Board ""to determine whether the rule should be reviewed in cases where a double touch is clearly unintentional.”

The International Football Association Board (IFAB) is soccer's rules-making panel.

UEFA's statement came a day after Atletico Madrid lost 4-2 in the shootout against city rival Real Madrid in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Champions League. Atletico won 1-0 after regulation and extra time to force the shootout. Real Madrid won the first leg 2-1 last week at home.

With Atletico down 2-1 in the shootout in Metropolitano Stadium, forward Julián Álvarez touched the ball twice — although barely — while taking his kick and scoring. 

Álvarez's left foot slipped and contacted the ball slightly before he shot with his right foot. The referee did not initially see the double touch and allowed the goal to stand.

Real Madrid players immediately called the referee's attention to check on a double touch.

Video review intervened quickly and reversed the original call after determining the double touch.

Atletico wasn't so sure it happened even after watching different replays. The club made an official inquiry with UEFA to have the incident reviewed.

“Although minimal, the player made contact with the ball using his standing foot before kicking it, as shown in the attached video clip,” UEFA said after Atletico's inquiry. “Under the current rule (Laws of the Game, Law 14.1), the VAR had to call the referee signalling that the goal should be disallowed.”



  The rule
 




The double touch rule exists to keep players from moving the ball closer to the goal on penalties.

The rule by IFAB states “the ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves,” and “the kicker must not play the ball again until it has touched another player.”

If the infraction happens outside of a shootout, an indirect free kick is awarded to the other team.

Without the rule, players could potentially attempt to dribble the ball closer to the net before taking their shots.



  Similar case in South America
 

A similar case happened in a penalty shootout in the round of 16 of the 2023 Copa Libertadores.

River Plate player Pablo Solari also slipped and touched the ball twice before scoring, prompting VAR to disallow the goal that ended up leading to the elimination of the Argentine club against Brazil's Internacional.

There were also doubts about a possible double touch in a penalty taken by an Athletic Bilbao player in last year's Copa del Rey final, as well as one taken by Lionel Messi in the final of the 2022 World Cup in a match officiated by Szymon Marciniak, the same referee from Wednesday's Champions League derby in Madrid.

None of those two penalties were disallowed.



  Atletico skeptical?
 

Neither Atletico coach Diego Simeone nor Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said they saw the double touch when it happened on Wednesday, though Madrid players at the midfield line, including Kylian Mbappé, were quick to point it out to the referee.

Simeone tried not to make a big deal about the VAR decision, but he said in the post-match news conference that he had never seen video review intervene like that in a penalty shootout. He said he wanted “to believe that if the VAR intervened it's because it saw something.”

The coach asked reporters in the post-match news conference to raise their hands if they thought Álvarez touched the ball twice.

“There you go, no one has raised their hands,” Simeone said, “Next question.”

Álvarez has not yet spoken publicly about his penalty shot.

The NFL's new year officially kicked off Wednesday, two days after teams began spending big money in free agency

Commanders, Bears, Patriots Among the Biggest Winners in NFL Free Agency So Far

The NFL's new year officially kicked off Wednesday, two days after teams began spending big money in free agency.

Here are some of the winners and losers so far:



  Winners:
 






  Washington Commanders
 

The Commanders made two major moves through trades, acquiring star wide receiver Deebo Samuel and five-time Pro Bowl left tackle Laremy Tunsil to surround Jayden Daniels with even more talent on a team that reached the NFC championship game. They added defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw, cornerback Jonathan Jones and defensive tackle Eddie Goldman. Washington also kept a few of its own key players, re-signing linebacker Bobby Wagner and tight ends Zach Ertz and John Bates along with backup quarterback Marcus Mariota.



  Chicago Bears
 

After Caleb Williams was sacked a league-high 68 times, the Bears overhauled their offensive line. They acquired All-Pro left guard Joe Thuney and guard Jonah Jackson in trades before signing center Drew Dalman. Chicago also bolstered the defensive line, bringing in defensive tackle Grady Jarrett and edge rusher Dayo Odeyingbo.



  New England Patriots
 

New coach Mike Vrabel has plenty of new players to help a defense that finished in the bottom third last season. The Patriots gave defensive tackle Milton Williams a $104 million deal, adding the Super Bowl star along with edge rusher Harold Landry, linebacker Robert Spillane and cornerback Carlton Davis. They didn't give Drake Maye a new receiver yet — maybe Cooper Kupp later — but gave him more protection, signing offensive tackle Morgan Moses. 



  Minnesota Vikings
 

Despite letting quarterback Sam Darnold walk away, the Vikings end up on the winning side because they bolstered both lines, adding center Ryan Kelly and guard Will Fries, and defensive tackles Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave. Minnesota also retained cornerback Byron Murphy, signed cornerback Isaiah Rodgers and special teams ace Tavierre Thomas.

The decision to let Darnold leave and the departure of Daniel Jones means J.J. McCarthy takes over as the starting quarterback for a team that won 14 games. The Vikings are expected to add a veteran QB and Aaron Rodgers remains an option until he signs elsewhere or retires.



  Tampa Bay Buccaneers
 

Star receiver Chris Godwin gave the Buccaneers a hometown discount to stay in Tampa Bay, to continue to play alongside Mike Evans and catch passes from Baker Mayfield. They landed edge rusher Haason Reddick in a low-risk, high-reward move, giving a two-time Pro Bowl selection coming off a holdout-marred season a one-year, $14 million deal. The Bucs also kept their offensive line intact, retaining left guard Ben Bredeson.



  Losers:
 






  Dallas Cowboys
 

America's Team are the bargain shoppers of the NFL. Greg Hardy was the last free agent from another team who received more than $5 million in average annual salary. That was in 2015. Now, $5 million is backup QB money. The Cowboys did spend $80 million to retain defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa on a four-year deal. They also re-signed wide receiver/return specialist KaVontae Turpin and safety Markquese Bell. Dallas added a few players from other teams, signing running back Javonte Williams, guard Robert Jones and defensive tackle Solomon Thomas. Linebacker Kenneth Murray Jr. and cornerback Kaiir Elam were acquired in trades, bolstering the defense.

Edge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence is a big loss. Cornerback Jourdan Lewis, edge rusher Chaunce Golston, running back Rico Dowdle and offensive tackle Chuma Edoga also left in free agency. The failure to extend Micah Parsons' contract is even more costly now that Myles Garrett has set the market for edge rushers at $40 million per year.



  Philadelphia Eagles
 

The Super Bowl champions lost several key players on a defense that ranked No. 1 last season and smothered Patrick Mahomes in the biggest game. Williams and edge rusher Josh Sweat, who combined for 4 1/2 sacks on Mahomes, got significant deals from other teams. Cornerback Darius Slay was released and safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson was traded. The Eagles also lost Rodgers, running back Kenneth Gainwell and traded backup quarterback Kenny Pickett. Philadelphia's biggest move was retaining All-Pro linebacker Zack Baun. The Eagles acquired guard Kenyon Green, a 2022 first-round pick, in the trade for Gardner-Johnson and signed running back AJ Dillon to back up Saquon Barkley.



  San Francisco 49ers
 

The 2023 NFC champions have plenty of holes to fill after trading Samuel and losing several key players, including guard Aaron Banks, safety Talanoa Hufanga, cornerback Charvarius Ward and linebacker Dre Greenlaw. They released Hargrave, defensive tackle Maliek Collins, defensive end Leonard Floyd and nine-time Pro Bowl fullback Kyle Juszczyk. Backup tackle Jaylon Moore and running back Elijah Mitchell also signed with new teams. San Francisco added wide receiver Demarcus Robinson, backup tight end Luke Farrell and backup QB Mac Jones to replace Joshua Dobbs.



  Houston Texans
 

Protecting C.J. Stroud was a problem last year but the Texans traded their best lineman, shipping Tunsil to the Commanders. They cut guard Shaq Mason and traded away another starter, sending Green to the Eagles. Laken Tomlinson was signed to a one-year deal to fill Green's spot. The Texans retained defensive tackle Mario Edwards and edge rusher Derek Barnett along with other role players. They added edge Darrell Taylor, defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins and a few special teams players. Acquiring Gardner-Johnson and wide receiver Christian Kirk help, but the Texans still must address the offensive line.



  New York Giants
 

The Giants appear on this list only because they still don't have a quarterback, though everyone is waiting on Aaron Rodgers to make a decision. They could end up with Russell Wilson, another veteran or a rookie in the first round of the draft next month. Safety Jevon Holland and cornerback Paulson Adebo upgrade the secondary.

Renowned author and columnist John Feinstein has died at the age of 69. Feinstein's brother confirmed his death to the Washington Post, where he was a columnist and worked as a police reporter early in his career.

Most recently, he filed a Thursday column for the Post on Michigan State men's basketball coach Tom Izzo, a day before the Spartans are scheduled to play in the 2025 Big Ten tournament.

Feinstein authored 44 books during his career on virtually every sport, including college basketball, college and pro football, baseball, tennis, golf and the Olympics.

He is perhaps best known for ""A Season on the Brink,"" published in 1986, which chronicled the 1985-86 Indiana University men's basketball team and head coach Bob Knight, providing what is considered the definitive portrayal of the often controversial Knight.

That Indiana team went on to lose in the first round of the NCAA tournament but won the national championship the following season. ""A Season on the Brink"" was eventually adapted into an ESPN TV film in 2002.

Feinstein's celebrated books include ""Hard Courts"" (1990), depicting a year on the men's and women's professional tennis tours; ""A Good Walk Spoiled"" (1995), which followed 17 professional golf players during a year on the PGA Tour; and ""A Civil War,"" (1996) telling the story of the 1995 Army-Navy game and the season that preceded the annual rivalry game.

Later in his career, Feinstein wrote several young adult mystery novels that took place in sports settings such as the Final Four, the U.S. Open tennis tournament, the World Series and the Super Bowl.

In addition to his writing, Feinstein was also a broadcaster, hosting a show on SiriusXM's Mad Dog Sports Radio channel before moving to CBS Sports Radio, and made frequent appearances on NPR, ESPN and the Golf Channel, along with numerous sports radio and television talk shows.

As news of Feinstein's death began to circulate, many of his colleagues and admirers posted tributes and condolences on social media. More are sure to come.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Steubenville's Aiden Davis drives in against East Liverpool's Cohen Pease during his 30-point effort in Big Red's 88-72 win at the Potter Fieldhouse on Feb. 7. (Special to the Journal/Jimmy Joe Savage)


COLUMBUS — The Ohio Prep Sports Media Association has announced the eight finalists for the 2025 Ohio Mr. Basketball Award. The winner will be announced  Wednesday, March 20.

Voting is currently under way for the 226 registered OPSMA members and will end at noon Monday, March 17. First-place votes get three points, second-place votes two points and third-place votes one point.

Ohio's Mr. Basketball was selected by the Associated Press from 1987-2016. Since 2017 it has been presented by the Ohio Prep Sports Media Association.

Aiden Davis

Steubenville

The 5-foor-11 senior guard is signed to play collegiately at perennial Division II power West Liberty. He was an all-around player for Division III regional qualifier Steubenville, leading the team in scoring, averaging 17.9 per game, and rebounds, averaging 5.3 per game, while being second on the team in assists (3.1 per game) and steals (1.7). He was named the East District Player of the Year. He netted a game-high 26 points in the East/Southeast District championship against previously unbeaten Miami Trace and earlier in the season set the school record for 3s in a game, making eight against Dover. He made 86 3s on the season, shooting 42% from beyond the arc. Prior to transferring back to Steubenville, he was an All-State first team selection in West Virginia for Wheeling Park, where he holds the school records for career 3s in just three seasons there, 3s in a single season and school marks for points in a season by a junior and sophomore. He finishes his high school career with 1,975 career points. Davis was also nominated for the 2025 McDonald's All-American Games.

Marcus Johnson

Garfield Heights

A finalist last year for Mr. Basketball, the 6-foot-2 junior guard is already committed to Ohio State and nationally ranked in the Class of 2026. He averaged 29.7 points through the regular season, leading Garfield Heights to a 19-2 record and third straight Lake Erie League title. Johnson helped the Bulldogs to two regional finals in Division I before moving to the new Division III this season as the top seed in the Northeast District. In addition to his scoring, Johnson averaged 5.7 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 2.2 steals. He broke his father's single-game school record of 52 points with 55 points in a win at Maple Heights late in the regular season. Father and coach Sonny Johnson is a former Mr. Basketball winner in 1998. Now, Marcus finds himself trying to become the first father-and-son combination to win the honor after his dad.

Trey Drexler

Brunswick

The 6-foot junior point guard averaged 20.7 points and 3.2 assists while leading the Blue Devils to the outright championship in the Greater Cleveland Conference, largely considered one of the best public-school leagues in Ohio. Holding offers from Kent State and Akron, the left-hander made 103-of-125 free throws (.824) and 57 3-pointers and had top games of 38 points against 2024 D-I regional champion Delaware Hayes and 33 against regional finalist Shaker Heights. Drexler has 1,225 career points and could challenge the Medina County record of 1,842 as a senior.

Devin Brown

Olentangy Orange

The 6-foot-6 senior guard/forward was the Central District Division I and District 11 coaches player of the year. Is averaging 13.8 points, 5.4 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 3.0 steals while shooting 46 percent from the field (40 from three-point range) as the driving force for a deep, balanced 24-2 state semifinalist with no losses in-state and quality wins over defending state champion Cleveland St. Ignatius and runner-up Centerville and district champions Olentangy Liberty (twice), Upper Arlington (twice), Dublin Coffman (twice), Westerville North, Groveport and Hartley. Brown, who plays virtually any position, signed with Davidson. In his final three seasons, he led Orange to two regional finals and a final four.

Cameron Elwer

Delphos St. John's

The 6-foot-1 junior guard averages 28.6 points, 5.9 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. Shooting 62 percent from the field, 56.7 percent from 3-point line and 94.1 percent from free-throw line. Already DSJ's all-time leading scorer and second all-time in Midwest Athletic Conference history in scoring. Two-time MAC Player of the Year. Has an offer from the University of Toledo; interest from other MAC schools so far.

RJ Greer

Kettering Alter

The 6-foot-3 senior guard and North Carolina State recruit averages 18.9 points, 2.8 assists and 2.1 steals. Helped lead the Knights to the Division II state title last season after transferring from Springboro. D-II Second team All-Ohio last year. Greater Catholic League Co-Ed player of the year in 2025. Shooting 50.6 percent from the field, 38.2 from three-point ranges, and 85.2 percent on free throws.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news","Report: Aaron Rodgers is a ""possibility"" in Minnesota","https://sports.yahoo.com/article/report-aaron-rodgers-possibility-minnesota-155406067.html","Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:54:06 GMT","

As Aaron Rodgers strolls the beach in a Darth Vader cape, he's apparently not thinking only about the possibility of playing in Pittsburgh.

On Wednesday, TheAthletic.com reported that the Vikings are considering the possibility of signing Rodgers — and that Rodgers is ""intrigued"" by the possibility of playing for the Vikings.

The move could complete the Brett Favre arc. Which should be reason alone for Rodgers to not want to do it. Then again, if he can accomplish in Minnesota that which Favre couldn't (i.e., get to the Super Bowl), Rodgers would have a clear late-career edge over Favre when ranking the two of them among the all-time greats.

The Vikings would be taking a very real risk by hitching their wagon to Rodgers. Beyond assuming the full Aaron Rodgers Experience, they'd be delaying by another year the development of J.J. McCarthy. And they'd be welcoming a potential conflict between the way coach Kevin O'Connell runs his offense and the way Rodgers executes any offense he's asked to run.

For now, the Steelers and Giants remain the primary options for Rodgers. As his decision lingers, the chance remains that the Minnesota option will morph into a reality.

And as someone who first discovered the NFL in the early 1970s and developed a partiality for purple helmets on the heads of players like Chuck Foreman, Fran Tarkenton, Alan Page, and the others from a team that went to three Super Bowls in four years, my official response if Rodgers lands in Minnesota would be this: Fly, Eagles, Fly.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Just asking: Is Rick Pitino the best coach in the history of college basketball?

From Yahoo Sports' Dan Wetzel:

Pitino is rarely mentioned in such a debate in part because his 758 career victories, his .712 winning percentage and even his two NCAA titles (one of which the NCAA ""vacated"" due to sanctions) fall far short of other contenders.

Duke's Mike Krzyzewski won 1,202 games with a .766 winning percentage at Duke and Army, while taking home five national titles. John Wooden won 10 national championships at UCLA. Bob Knight won 902 games and three titles at Indiana despite coaching only one player who would ever become a NBA All-Star (Isiah Thomas).

Meanwhile, Adolph Rupp won 82.2% of his games at Kentucky, and in a more modern era, Roy Williams was victorious 77.4% of the time at North Carolina and Kansas. There are others.

As such, Pitino rarely finds his name among the greatest of the greats. He wasn't a college lifer though, entrenched for decades at a single program.

Part of this was his NBA dalliances (eight seasons with the Celtics and Knicks). And part of it was due to the various scandals that seemed to crop up across the decades, leaving him to be seen with caution by some schools.

That meant either re-climbing the coaching ladder or even bouncing him out of the college game (from 2018-2020, for example, he coached in the Greek Professional League and won two titles).

Yet where consistent longevity is costing him in sheer numbers, the job-hopping and rebuilds he constantly produces offers a different résumé point. The guy can coach anyone, anywhere, at any time.

The 72-year-old is in his second season with St. John's. He took over a storied but middling program and is about to lead them to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2019. The Johnnie's are 27-4 and won the Big East regular season title … by three games.

This will be the sixth different school Pitino has led to the NCAA tournament — the most of any coach — joining Boston University (1983), Providence (1987), Kentucky (1991), Louisville (2003) and Iona (2021).

It took five seasons as a young coach at BU, but other than that each program he has led made it within two years of being eligible for March Madness.

And while some of the schools have had historic success and great resources, none were in good shape when he arrived. In the season prior, the programs went a combined 76-105 (.419). Kentucky was even saddled with crippling sanctions, including a two-year postseason ban.

He's been innovative — his embrace of the 3-point shot with Providence, where guard Billy Donovan would drive and kick out, was decades ahead of its time. He's been relentless — his teams always play full-throttle defense, often with a full-court press.

He's been resilient — he coached in an era where the NCAA once charged him as an assistant at Hawaii with giving players coupons for free food at McDonalds to today's open market transfer portal where players could buy their own restaurant. None of it mattered. Has whistle; will win. Always.

Now he heads to the Big East Tournament again, looking to win the league again, in the same Madison Square Garden where after a high school game in 1970 he signed on the scorer's table his scholarship papers with the University of Massachusetts.

Bottom line: Pitino's numbers and accomplishments may never register up there with the other greats of the college game. But if you needed someone to take over a listless program, who else are you calling?

Portland — Mikal Bridges' buzzer-beating three in overtime lifted the Knicks to a 114-113 victory over the Trail Blazers — and earned the 10th ""Double Bang"" ever from Mike Breen.

Seattle — Brandon Mountour scored the fastest goal in NHL overtime history, finding the back of the net just four seconds into the extra period to complete the Kraken's 5-4 comeback win over the Canadiens.

Indian Wells, California — Wild card Belinda Bencic, who returned from maternity leave just five months ago after the birth of her first child, stunned No. 3 Coco Gauff to reach the quarterfinals at the ""Fifth Grand Slam.""

Houston — Mason Plumlee and Steven Adams were both ejected from the Rockets' 111-104 win over the Suns after the two giants wrestled each other to the ground during a scuffle.

Behind the lens: Here's photographer Hannah Peters on how she lined up this shot…

I checked the weather report the night before and the sunrise was right around the time of this event. I knew I needed to get there early if I were to make the most of it.

There were only a few athletes that were getting high enough on the jump to line up perfectly with the sun. I was perched on the side of a hill, adjusting myself in between each rider to try to get the perfect angle.

I was constantly looking at the position of the light, changing my exposure to create the silhouette and adapting my aperture to emphasize the rays from the sun.

Then it came down to a bit of luck and timing — I needed the right athlete doing the right trick at the right time, all while flying through the shape of the sun.

The 13th NWSL season kicks off on Friday, and it should begin much like the last one ended: with 12 teams chasing Orlando and Washington.

The favorites: The Pride and Spirit both set the league record with 18 wins last season before meeting in the championship game, where Orlando won its maiden title. There's no good reason why they can't run it back again.

Orlando lost just twice last year, a stunning turnaround after five straight sub-.500 seasons, and the Pride's core — led by Brazilian legend Marta and Zambian star Barbra Banda — remains intact.

Washington, which beat Orlando in last week's Challenge Cup, has the makings of a juggernaut. The Spirit boast seven USWNT members, including MVP finalist Trinity Rodman and reigning ROY Croix Bethune.

Others to watch: Last year's third, fourth and fifth-place finishers headline our next three most interesting teams to watch.

The Kansas City Current were every bit as dangerous as the frontrunners last year, led by newcomer Temwa Chaŵinga, who scored a league-record 21 goals en route to winning MVP. Now in Year 5, the 2022 runners-up seek their first title.

Gotham FC are hard to pin down. The 2023 champs finished just four points behind Orlando last year, but then saw half a dozen key contributors leave in the offseason. Still, they've retooled with a number of shrewd signings and might surprise some people.

Speaking of hard to pin down, the North Carolina Courage haven't made it out of the first round since winning two straight titles in 2018-19. But they took a clear step forward last year and traded for rising USWNT star Jaedyn Shaw this offseason to help lead their attack.

Topic:Cryptocurrency

US authorities have alleged that the Garantex cryptocurrency exchange had been used to process at least $152.5 billion in funds since 2019, which also allowed international criminal organisations to launder money. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic)

Indian intelligence authorities have arrested a Russian resident the US Justice Department has accused of money laundering.

US law enforcement says Aleksej Besciokov and another Russian national operated a $152.5 billion cryptocurrency exchange that helped criminal entities like terrorist organisations to launder funds.

After Mr Besciokov 's arrest in the Indian state of Kerala, Washington is expected to pursue his extradition to the US.

India's top crime fighting bureau says its authorities have arrested a cryptocurrency exchange administrator accused by the United States of money laundering conspiracy and violating sanctions.

The US, Germany and Finland took down the online infrastructure used by the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, the US Justice Department said in a statement last week, adding that two administrators of the exchange were charged.

One of those administrators was 46-year-old Aleksej Besciokov, a Russian resident and Lithuanian national who was charged with money laundering and also faced accusations of violating sanctions and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, the Justice Department said on Friday.

The US agency also said that another 40-year-old Russian national and United Arab Emirates resident, Aleksandr Mira Serda, was also charged with money laundering and conspiracy.

""According to court documents, between 2019 and 2025, Besciokov and Mira Serda controlled and operated Garantex,"" the US Justice Department said in the statement last week.

""Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to US victims.

""According to the indictment, Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that criminal proceeds were being laundered through Garantex and took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities on its platform.

Mr Besciokov was arrested in the southern Indian state of Kerala on Wednesday, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said, adding that he was wanted by US authorities. 

The CBI said that at Washington's request, India's foreign ministry had a provisional arrest warrant issued.

It also said that Mr Besciokov was planning to flee India, but it was not immediately clear why he was in the country. Washington is expected to pursue Mr Besciokov's extradition.

The ACCC will increase its scrutiny of Australia's supermarkets, retailers, airlines and essential services, and its chair has voiced concerns there could be an uptick in financial scams as US President Donald Trump relaxes cryptocurrency regulations.

""I can confirm Aleksej Besciokov, one of the administrators of Garantex, was arrested in India at the request of the United States,"" a US Justice Department spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday local time.

The department also said last week that on March 6, US law enforcement including the country's Secret Service seized three website domains that were being used to support Garantex's operations.

""The seizure of these domains will prevent these sites from being used for money laundering and additional crimes,"" the department's statement said.

""Individuals visiting those sites now will see a message indicating that the site has been seized by law enforcement.

""US law authorities have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex's servers, including customer and accounting databases. In addition, US law enforcement has also frozen over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex's money laundering activities.""

The US Justice Department says charges of conspiracy and money laundering carry maximum jail term penalties of 20 years, while the charge of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business carries a maximum five-year jail term.

A Lithuanian man, who was wanted in the US for a massive cryptocurrency fraud, has been arrested in Kerala, officials said on Wednesday. The accused, Aleksej Besciokov, had set up a cryptocurrency exchange 'Garantex', allegedly to launder the proceeds of criminal activities such as ransomware, computer hacking, and narcotics transactions.

Besciokov was arrested when he was planning to flee the country, officials said.

According to the US Secret Service documents, Besciokov, over the period of nearly six years, allegedly controlled and operated Garantex, which facilitated money laundering to the tune of at least $96 billion (over Rs 8 lakh crore) in cryptocurrency transactions by transnational criminal organisations (including terrorist organisations) and violated sanctions.

""Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to US victims,"" it said.

Officials said that Besciokov was Garantex's primary technical administrator and was responsible for obtaining and maintaining the critical infrastructure of the platform as well as reviewing and approving transactions. He was wanted by the US on many charges, including conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of Title 18 of the US Code, conspiracy to violate the US International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and Conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money services business.

He was sanctioned by the US in April 2022.

Earlier this week, the Ministry of External Affairs received a provisional arrest warrant at the request of US officials. Following this, a joint effort of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Kerala police arrested Besciokov from Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram.

He will be produced before the Patiala House Court soon, officials said.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Authorities in India have arrested a cryptocurrency exchange administrator wanted by the US for allegedly helping cybercriminals launder money and violate sanctions. 

Aleksej Besciokov, a Lithuanian citizen and Russian resident, was arrested in the southern state of Kerala on Tuesday, India's top investigative agency said.

According to the US Justice Department (DOJ), he was one of the administrators of Garantex, a Russian cryptocurrency exchange, and was responsible for reviewing and approving its transactions.

Besciokov is in custody and has not yet made a statement. Garantex could not immediately be reached for comment. 

Besciokov was ""residing in Russia"", according to DOJ's recently-released indictment, and it is unclear when and why he came to India. 

India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said in a statement that it issued a provisional arrest warrant against him at Washington's request. 

Besciokov will now be produced in a court in Delhi, it said. It is not clear when he will be extradited to the US. 

The United States, in coordination with Germany and Finland, had taken down the online infrastructure used by Garantex, the DOJ said last week. 

It added that Garantex processed at least $96bn (£74.10bn) in cryptocurrency transactions since 2019 and that it allegedly received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds, which were then used to ""facilitate several crimes"", including hacking, ransomware, terrorism and drug trafficking. 

The DOJ also accused the Lithuanian national of violating sanctions and operating an ""unlicensed money transmitting business"". 

Last week, US officials charged Besciokov along with the exchange's Russian co-founder Aleksandr Mira Serda with money laundering.

Garantex was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in 2022. 

But soon after, Besciokov and other administrators ""redesigned"" its operations to ""evade sanctions"" and induce American businesses into working with them, DOJ said.

            At a White House summit last week, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick spoke passionately about the Trump administration's plans to embrace cryptocurrencies, a largely unregulated industry that has historically operated on the fringes of finance.
    


            “Technology is at the foundation of the Trump presidency,” Lutnick said, addressing two dozen crypto CEOs. “We're using the blockchain. We're using bitcoin. We are going to use digital assets to pound forward, and Donald Trump is leading the way.”
    


            The summit was remarkable in part because of the shift in tone from the White House, which under previous administrations, including Trump 1.0, largely kept crypto companies and their volatile digital tokens sidelined. Suddenly, with President Donald Trump's re-election, the government is not only open to the industry — it's actively cheering for it.
    


            But Lutnick's longtime industry ties have come under scrutiny as he pushes the Trump administration's pro-crypto priorities, many of which have questionable benefits for anyone besides existing crypto holders.
    


            Among those existing holders is Cantor Fitzgerald, the family-run Wall Street firm Lutnick headed for decades before handing the reins this year to his 27-year-old son, Brandon.
    


            Cantor Fitzgerald is the primary banking partner for Tether, a controversial stablecoin issuer whose token of the same name is by far the most heavily traded digital asset.

            And the firm is expanding its crypto holdings. On Tuesday, Cantor Fitzgerald announced it was setting up a new bitcoin financing business to provide leverage to institutional investors holding the asset.
    


            The firm also recently acquired a stake — now valued at more than $1.58 billion — in MicroStrategy, the biggest corporate holder of bitcoin on the planet, according to a new report from Accountable.US, a progressive government watchdog group, that was shared exclusively with CNN. Cantor's crypto holdings also include more than $87 million in iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.
    


            It's not clear whether Lutnick personally holds crypto assets.
    


            His 92-page financial disclosure listed holdings in more than 800 entities — all of which he pledged to sell within 90 days of being confirmed, in compliance with conflict-of-interest laws.
    


            It's not clear what the status of that process is.
    


            The Commerce Department didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. Cantor Fitzgerald also didn't respond to a request for comment.
    


            Lutnick's crypto promotion while in office falls into an ethical gray area, according to experts who spoke with CNN.
    


            “He ought to stay out of anything that Cantor Fitzgerald is doing and let other people handle that at the Commerce Department,” said Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush. “Now, I'm going to tell you: There's no law that requires him to do that.”
    


            By putting Cantor Fitzgerald in his adult son's control, Lutnick complied with conflict-of-interest laws that compel Cabinet members to divest certain holdings. Under the law, “divest” could include selling the assets, putting them in a trust or gifting them to a family member — excluding spouses or children under 18.
    


            “The law only requires you to disclose and to divest,” said Hui Chen, an anti-corruption expert and former federal prosecutor who resigned from the Justice Department under Trump's first administration. “But that doesn't mean you can't shape things for the long run that ultimately will benefit you.”
    


            That issue is hardly unique to the Trump administration, Chen notes. “But this administration has certainly posed a lot of conflict questions.”
    


            Despite Trump's populist messaging on the campaign trail, his administration is one of the wealthiest in US history, with more than a dozen billionaires and mega-millionaires on staff.
    


            “Having a lot of billionaires who are closely tied to what they'll be regulating raises a lot of questions,” said Jordan Libowitz, the vice president for communications at the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington or CREW. “And they have been, for the most part, unclear on exactly what they'll be doing in terms of divestment and recusal.”
    


            Cantor Fitzgerald's $1.5 billion stake in MicroStrategy, which last month renamed itself Strategy, is a bitcoin proxy holding — a popular way for mainstream investors to ride the crypto wave without the logistical and security headaches of actually holding digital assets.
    


            Strategy's founder, Michael Saylor, was one of about two dozen crypto leaders to attend the White House summit, and he is one of bitcoin's most vocal evangelists. For the past five years, Saylor's software company has amassed a roughly $40 billion stockpile of bitcoin — an estimated 2% of all bitcoin in circulation.

            Strategy's stock trades in lock step with bitcoin. In announcing the company's new name and sharpened focus on the asset, Saylor declared: “We are a bitcoin treasury company.”
    


            Shares shot up more than 10% earlier this month after President Trump announced plans on March 2 for a “crypto reserve” that would include bitcoin and other tokens.
    


            But that initial burst in value quickly faded amid industry hand-wringing over the makeup of the planned reserve.
    


            As prices slumped, Lutnick spoke to the media to clarify that bitcoin would have a unique status in the reserve once it was formally announced. It would be a bitcoin reserve, not a grab bag of crypto tokens — an important distinction for investors who view bitcoin as a kind of digital gold.
    


            “A bitcoin strategic reserve is something the President's interested in … and I think you're going to see it executed (at the summit)” Lutnick told Pavlovic Today on March 5, two days before the crypto summit. “So bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently — positively, but differently.”
    


            Sure enough, the following day, Trump signed an executive order establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” along with a stockpile of other digital assets. Bitcoin, which is prone to volatile trading, went up slightly in response.
    


            The digital asset, in step with financial markets, soared to record highs after Trump's re-election but has in recent weeks struggled to shake off anxieties about the president's ever-shifting trade policy — for which Lutnick is also a top spokesman.
    


            Under Trump's executive order, the United States would essentially consolidate all the bitcoin it has seized through criminal and civil forfeitures and hold it as a reserve asset, similar to the way gold and petroleum are stockpiled, as a hedge against future financial instability.
    


            This is a controversial idea among economists, lawmakers and even some pro-crypto analysts.
    


            Critics question the wisdom of linking the full faith and credit of the US government to a purely speculative, highly volatile asset. They argue that the reserve is little more than a scheme to backstop the value of bitcoin, thereby juicing the portfolios of early investors.
    


            “Who does having a strategic crypto reserve benefit? It's not your everyday Americans, right? It benefits these guys,” Libowitz said, referring to current bitcoin holders.
    


            Of course, with any innovation, early investors are poised to profit, Chen notes. But the question around bitcoin is more nuanced, given its lack of regulation and unproven benefits.
    


            “I think the question is: How robust is the evaluation about the risk to the government when it puts its weight around this form of currency? … Who is doing that analysis? Are the people doing that analysis unbiased?” she said.
    


            A White House official didn't respond to specific questions about a risk assessment, telling CNN in an email that the bitcoin reserve is the best way to protect the digital assets already in the government's possession.
    


            The Accountable.US report found that at least four senior Trump officials disclosed total ownership of up to $7.7 million in cryptos including bitcoin, ether and solana, all of which spiked when Trump announced a crypto reserve plan on March 2. That surge would have boosted these officials' investments by as much as $800,000, according to the report.
    


            Two senior Trump officials, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, have pledged to divest up to $1 million in crypto investments, but, according to the report, they have yet to file certifications showing that they have unloaded these currencies. (Both of their ethics pledges state they will divest by early to mid-April).
    


            A Treasury spokesperson told CNN in an email Wednesday that “the secretary has already divested of this Bitcoin Trust” and that “he will file his certificate of compliance with the Office of Government Ethics by the required deadline.”

            A spokesperson for Gabbard's office told CNN the director is committed to her pledge to divest before her April 15 deadline.
    


            President Trump himself is a recent convert to the crypto world.
    


            The first family are direct beneficiaries of World Liberty Financial and at least two memecoins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA, that have raised concerns across the political spectrum about the potential for corruption. By its nature, crypto offers a particularly easy way to, anonymously or otherwise, funnel money into entities that could potentially enrich the president and his family.
    


            Those concerns escalated late last month when the Securities and Exchange Commission, America's top financial regulator, said it would no longer pursue its civil fraud case against crypto mogul Justin Sun.
    


            Before the SEC put its case on hold, Sun had boasted on social media that he'd dropped $75 million on World Liberty tokens — an investment that could set the Trump family up to eventually collect tens of millions of dollars. (The SEC has declined to comment on the case.)
    


            “This is, I guess, going to be the new approach — hands off crypto, not enforcing fraud … and I don't think it's going to end well,” Painter, the law professor, told CNN at the time. “The SEC is going to back off — because that's what the Trump administration wants — on whatever enforcement they are able to do. I think it's a very worrisome situation.”

An officer from the National Crime Agency (NCA) has been charged over the alleged theft of £60,000 worth of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. 

Paul Chowles, 42, from Bristol, is charged with 15 offences relating to the alleged theft of 50 Bitcoin during an investigation into online organised crime in 2017, Merseyside Police said.

The force said the Bitcoin would have been worth almost £60,000 at the time of the alleged offences.

Mr Chowles is due to appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on 25 April. 

He faces 11 counts of concealing, disguising or converting criminal property, three counts of acquiring, using or possessing criminal property, and one count of theft.

Bitcoin is the biggest and oldest type of cryptocurrency, having been invented in 2008.

According to online converters, 50 Bitcoin would now be worth more than £3m.

Malcolm McHaffie, head of the Crown Prosecution Service's special crime division, said: ""Criminal proceedings against this defendant are now active and he has the right to a fair trial.

A federal jury in the Northern District of California on Wednesday convicted cryptocurrency entrepreneur Rowland Marcus Andrade of wire fraud and money laundering connected to the sale of a token called AML Bitcoin.



The charges stemmed from an initial coin offering Andrade conducted for AML Bitcoin in 2017 and 2018. Early court filings covered by CoinDesk alleged Andrade, a Texas resident, falsely told investors that AML Bitcoin tokens would ultimately be converted into a tradeable AML Bitcoin currency — a cryptocurrency that never launched and was named to resemble the popular Bitcoin token.



The conviction marks the conclusion of one of the first and longest-running crypto ""pump-and-dump"" cases to involve U.S. federal prosecutors.



The Department of Justice named famed D.C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff a co-conspirator and he pleaded guilty in 2020, paying more than $50,000 in disgorgement and interest. Abramoff is better known for his involvement in a federal corruption scandal that resulted in his imprisonment and was depicted in the film ""Casino Jack.""



A statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice accused Andrade of diverting ""more than $2 million in proceeds from the sale of AML Bitcoin"" and using it on ""personal expenses, including the purchase of two properties in Texas and two luxury automobiles.""



According to the statement, Andrade also falsely claimed that the Panama Canal Authority was close to permitting AML Bitcoin to be used for ships passing through the Panama Canal when no such agreement existed.



""Fraudsters often tout new and innovative technology in order to raise money from investors. But raising money through lies and misrepresentations is neither new nor innovative. It's unlawful, plain and simple,"" said Acting United States Attorney Patrick D. Robbins. ""If you deceive investors to enrich yourself and spend their money on personal expenses, homes, and property, you will be held to account.""



Andrade is scheduled to be sentenced in July. According to the DOJ press release, ""he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the wire fraud count and 10 years in prison for the money laundering count, and forfeiture of all property that is traceable to his wire fraud and money laundering violations including property that Andrade bought in Texas.""

US President Donald Trump attends a the White House Crypto Summit in Washington, DC.

Since taking office, Donald Trump has made transforming federal policy on cryptocurrency a priority for his administration.

The Securities and Exchange Commission dropped lawsuits against two of the biggest crypto companies in the U.S. and dismissed investigations into others.

Last week, Trump announced the creation of a reserve of Bitcoin and other digital currencies — an estimated $17 million stockpile made up of Bitcoin that the U.S. has seized in legal cases over the years. And on Friday, he held a summit at the White House for CEOs, investors, and executives from the crypto industry.

It's a far cry from his previous statements about crypto. In 2021, Trump called crypto a scam and ""potentially a disaster waiting to happen."" 

So, what changed? What personal investments does the President have in the crypto industry?

SALT LAKE CITY — A bill protecting people's ability to use cryptocurrency to pay for transactions at businesses in Utah is waiting for the governor's signature, but the bill's sponsor says the legislation is missing some key components.

Bill sponsor Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, said he's happy the bill passed overall but is disappointed that part of the bill that would have let the state invest in Bitcoin had to be removed.

Teuscher said this bill is a result of the Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force, which included the attorney general and state treasurer, along with other leaders in the digital innovation space.

HB230 includes protections for digital assets, such as cryptocurrency and NFTs. These protections include ensuring Utahns can assess and use their digital assets and protecting digital mining company rights.

Another part of the bill would have given the state treasurer the ability to invest in digital assets that have a market cap of over $500 billion for the state's rainy day fund.

However, after passing in the Utah House, the rainy day fund investment option was removed before passing through the Senate. Teuscher said the treasurer may have been concerned about pressure to invest.

“I think the treasurer kind of had an about face on this,” Teuscher said, “as it got closer to the finish line, I think, he was afraid that it might put some undue pressure on him to actually invest in blockchain even though it was permissive. It was at his discretion of whether or not to invest.”

Teuscher also said the treasurer might have felt like the rainy day fund would not be a good place for blockchain investment to happen, since in an emergency the funds will need to be quickly liquidated.

But, the representative said he feels the same arguments about risk could be used for gold investments as well. Currently, the treasurer invests up to 10% of the rainy day fund in precious metals, including gold or silver.

Teusher also pointed out there may have been a problem with people understanding how the blockchain works, leading to especially older members feeling uncomfortable around the investment section of the bill.

“If you looked at the vote in the House when it still had those provisions,” Teuscher says, “it was almost like if you were, you know, over 45, you voted against it, and if you were under 45, you voted for it.”

If this section had remained, Utah would have been the first state in the nation to use state funds to invest in digital assets. Teuscher said around 20 other states have pitched, or plan to pitch, similar bills in their legislative sessions.

“With this bill and others that we've passed over the last few years,” Teuscher said, “I think the rest of the country has really seen Utah as a leader in this space … I would have liked to see Utah really lead out on this. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get it to the finish line.”

He said he plans to pitch the provision again in a future session.

In the bill's current form, one section Teuscher is especially excited about is protections around digital mining.

03/13 update below. This post was originally published on March 11

Bitcoin and crypto prices have moved sharply lower, following stock markets, as fears swirl the bitcoin price could be teetering on the verge of a major crash.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has dropped under $80,000 per bitcoin, dragging down the wider crypto market that's now erased $1 trillion of value in just a month (even as bullish traders bet on a U.S. president Donald Trump “game-changer”).

Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, the chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock has warned Trump's trade policies will stoke inflation—pouring cold water on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025.

""I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic—and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me—that it's going to have elevated inflation,"" BlackRock's Larry Fink told CeraWeek conference attendees, it was reported by Reuters.

03/13 update: U.S. inflation has slowed to 2.8% in February from a year earlier, boosting the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates but failing to offset fears that U.S. president Donald Trump's global tariff trade war will push up prices through 2025. 

The latest consumer price index (CPI) reading came in below January's 3% and the 2.9% expected by economists, according to a Reuters poll.

“Today's lower-than-expected CPI should be bullish, signaling faster rate cuts, but crypto hasn't reacted strongly,"" Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, said in emailed comments. 

""Weeks of market fear require more than a single good print to regain confidence. The real issue is Trump's aggressive tariffs, which risk making inflation stickier while also crashing markets and triggering layoffs, particularly by the Doge department of government efficiency. This puts the Fed in a bind: High inflation from tariffs makes rate cuts harder. Market crashes and job losses pressure the Fed to cut rates sooner. Cutting too early could reignite inflation, making future policy tougher. Stocks are bouncing back, but crypto remains sluggish. Investors want stronger support from the White House or Fed, especially after last week's crypto summit failed to reassure markets. Until clearer signals emerge, fear and uncertainty will weigh on crypto market sentiment.""

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs economists have upped their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15% to 20%, pointing to Trump's economic policies as the “key risk."" Yardeni Research economists have also raised their recession odds, increasing them from 20% to 35% due to ""Trump 2.0's head-spinning barrage of executives orders, firings, and tariffs.""

Last week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is in no rush to cut rates, with the labor market still strong and inflation on a bumpy path toward its 2% goal.

The CME FedWatch Tool shows the market is heavily betting the Fed leaves rates on hold at its March meeting next week but is split over whether rates will be cut in May.

On Wednesday, the latest U.S. inflation data in the form of the consumer price index (CPI) will drop, with consumer prices expected to have ticked up in February, according to Bloomberg, highlighting the Fed's slow progress on battling inflation and potentially raising the specter of stagflation—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises.

""This market downturn is largely driven by broader economic concerns, including fears of a U.S. recession and persistent inflation,"" Sean Dawson, head of research at decentralized options trading platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments.

“The market is facing significant challenges as the macroeconomic environment worsens, and crypto assets are no exception. With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming weeks will be critical for assessing how the broader economic situation impacts digital asset prices and trading behavior.""","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

Bitcoin maximalists like Strategy's Michael Saylor often tout the cryptocurrency as a form of digital gold, a safe haven asset that can protect holders from financial storms. 

Donald Trump's White House has echoed the argument that Bitcoin's scarcity makes it ideal as a store of value.

That narrative has now been challenged — again — after the digital asset's price nosedived alongside tech stocks like Meta, Nvidia, and Elon Musk's Tesla. By contrast, gold has surged to record heights.

In short, Bitcoin is behaving less like digital gold and more like a glorified tech stock, market watchers say.

“If Bitcoin equals ‘digital gold,' then time to act like it. Otherwise, it will reinforce the narrative that it's simply a high beta asset,” said ETF Store President Nate Geraci on X. “Most of crypto equals tech play [in my opinion]. So it currently is and will be caught up in a broader tech sell-off.”

The debate about Bitcoin's role as a safe haven asset comes as it shed 15% of its value over the past month. 

It now trades at roughly $82,000. Some experts even suggest it will plunge as low as its previous March 2024 high of $74,000.

The overall crypto market's value dropped 18% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has dropped 11% in the same period. 

Trump triggered the plunge after instating, retracting, then reinstating, re-retracting, and re-reinstating tariffs against the US' closest trading partners Mexico and Canada. 

The back and forth prompted Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly to describe US trade policy as a “psychodrama.”

This is not the first time Bitcoin has failed to live up to its reputation as a safe haven. During the March 2020 Covid-induced crash, the asset plunged more than 50% in a two-day period.

Still, the digital gold narrative has picked up speed of late. 

The White House referred to Bitcoin's safe haven potential in Trump's executive order to create a national stockpile of the asset. 

“Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve,” it said. 

The argument is that the country will be able to hedge against financial instability by storing up the cryptocurrency. It holds gold and petroleum for the same reason. 

Other top officials, like Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hum a similar tune. 

In December, Powell said, “it's just like gold, only digital.”

Industry heavyweights like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Euro Pacific chief economist Peter Schiff have echoed that sentiment over the years.

Others adopt a more measured approach. 

In May, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas described Bitcoin as investment hot sauce, something to add to a traditional portfolio made out of stocks and bonds. 

What made it interesting to him, compared with other spicy alternatives, “is this underlying story about hedging the devaluation of the dollar.” 

“To me, Bitcoin is like gold, but as a teenager,” Balchunas told The Block.

However, its recent price action says otherwise — and supporters are getting antsy. 

“Can't act like a high beta asset with every sell-off,” Geraci said.

United States President Donald Trump recently announced the U.S. would establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve of Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, Solana and Cardano. This move, he said, would make the U.S. ""the crypto capital of the world.""

Once a vocal crypto-skeptic, Trump now frames his support as an embrace of technologies that champion freedom and innovation.

However, the problem with Trump's view is that it assumes crypto will lead to the elimination of financial intermediaries. By replacing trust with transparency, cryptocurrency promises to put individuals in charge of their monetary transactions.

Our research demonstrates that this is only a partial view. In reality, crypto is dependent on social practices behind the technology.

Crypto-believers often blame greedy financiers as the cause of the Great Recession in 2008. But we argue that crypto is not immune to these same risks.

Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital money that trades on a blockchain. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that allows users to trade pseudo-anonymously.

Public blockchains operate on a distributed peer-to-peer network. This network provides each user a complete record of transactions that is updated in real time. Users can send digital cash between themselves without relying on a centralized authority.

Since each user has a full record of transactions, the system promises full transparency. But our research demonstrates that public blockchains, and the cryptocurrencies that run on them, do not actually replace trust with transparency.

Speculation, manipulation and market crashes remain very real dangers, regardless of whether the financial system is centralized or decentralized.

We studied the communications between the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the early Bitcoin community. We found the development and implementation of cryptocurrencies relies on negotiations between individuals. Who has a final say on which line of code will prevail depends on a social hierarchy dominated by insiders.

Centralization of power in the hands of insiders is still a major issue in the cryptocurrency space. This is particularly an issue for emerging cryptocurrencies like memecoins. Memecoins are a type of cryptocurrency named after internet memes or similar jokes. They draw their value entirely from speculation.

The Trump Organization recently launched memecoins $TRUMP and $MELANIA. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has concluded that memecoins do not qualify as securities, and therefore are outside its regulatory purview. Not only are memecoins risky, but they come with a significant risk of insider trading.

A recent case study on the memecoin $LIBRA shows how influencers, anonymous developers and centralized exchanges facilitate market distortions, often at the expense of retail investors.

When cryptocurrencies are outside the scope of regulation, individuals behind the technology can profit from insider information. This is less of a risk with widely traded cryptocurrencies like Ether and Bitcoin, but investors should be aware that any technology is reliant on the people who design the code and regulate its changes.

Personal views towards privacy, for instance, can impact governance decisions. These beliefs can have important implications for the value and usability of any technology, cryptocurrencies included.

Our research suggests cryptocurrency insiders can artificially inflate the value of their coins by talking them up, effectively creating value out of nothing.

By using economic and accounting language to describe Bitcoin, the early Bitcoin community effectively turned a string of zeroes and ones into something that could be measured, valued and recognized. Economists argue that even fiat currency is backed by a type of belief—trust in institutions.

Bitcoin, too, relies on belief, but a different kind. Its value is based users' collective confidence in the technology and security of the network, a phenomenon known as the network effect. As more people adopt Bitcoin, its perceived value rises, creating a self-sustaining cycle of belief and value based on market demand.

Recently, American stockbroker and anti-crypto advocate Peter Schiff accused Trump of manipulating the cryptocurrency market following the announcement of the strategic crypto reserve. Schiff has called for a congressional investigation into Trump and his team to determine who may have profited from the announcement, which triggered a massive increase in crypto prices.

Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, their values are highly susceptible to herd behavior, and public sentiment has a significant effect on cryptocurrency returns.

Our research and other studies like it have shown that cryptocurrency is subject to important value changes based on announcements by a small group of influential individuals.

We caution anyone interested in investing in crypto to do their homework by examining the underlying economics of a coin, getting to know the team behind it and evaluating their risk tolerance before moving forward.

With thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, distinguishing between a promising investment, a speculative gamble or even scams is crucial.

Despite the uncertain and unpredictable nature of digital assets, one thing is certain: the conversation around crypto is far from over.

Oops, something went wrong

Some cryptocurrency investors worry about data security in the future. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) owners often tout the largest coin's unchanging qualities as a major selling point. But if Bitcoin's technical platform never changes, how can it meet unexpected challenges and adapt to new security threats? In particular, won't Bitcoin's encryption soon crumble under an assault from quantum computing systems?

So there's something you should know before you write off Bitcoin entirely, or dive into it head first. Bitcoin can have the system stability cake and eat incoming threats too.

Bitcoin is indeed changing over time, and should be safe from quantum computing attacks in the long run. It's just very unlikely to make sudden turns into dangerous or economically unsound moves, such as changing its inflation-proof coin-minting process.

Quantum computers should eventually disrupt many industries. A powerful system of this type is perfect for finding patterns in seemingly random data. They will crack the genetic code of genetic diseases, provide the most accurate weather forecasts ever, and bring clarity to the chaos of financial markets.

And of course, they will be able to crack the encryption algorithms at the heart of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

If and when that happens, that must be the end of Bitcoin as you know it. Scoundrels and miscreants will be able to change, delete, or insert data into Bitcoin's blockchain ledger, moving billion-dollar fortunes with the click of a quantum-powered mouse.

This wouldn't be such a scary situation if Bitcoin's technology wasn't so unchangeable. You often hear crypto bulls touting the firm cap of 21 million Bitcoins as an immovable guard against inflation. Once the last fraction of the 21-millionth digital coin has been minted, there simply won't be any more production. With 19.83 million Bitcoin already created, that's 94.4% of all Bitcoin that ever will exist.

So Bitcoin isn't changing. When the bad actors finally get their hands on game-changing quantum computers, Bitcoin's data security must fall.

The end.

Hold your horses, dear investor.

The computing platform behind Bitcoin can indeed change over time. The Bitcoin Core software that manages the blockchain ledger and the Bitcoin mining procedure is up to version 28.1 these days. The latest update fixed a few bugs and added some developer-friendly features. It was released on October 2, 2024, to be followed by a more substantial ""major version"" in the spring of 2025.

These changes could indeed involve very important features and software bits, including the limit of 21 million coins and the encryptions methods in use.

And there are already encryption methods that are hard to crack with quantum computing systems. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the first federal standards for quantum-hardened encryption in 2022. Development efforts toward this goal started in 2016. IBM (NYSE: IBM) included these quantum-resistant algorithms in the z16 mainframe systems the same year, and will make these encryption solutions mandatory over time. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is quietly rolling out data security with quantum-safe algorithms, too.

There's absolutely no reason to believe that the Bitcoin developer community will let the whole system run into quantum-based hacking issues. Long before quantum computers grow powerful enough to pose a real threat, the old-school SHA-256 hash function will be replaced by a quantum-safe alternative.

The key thing to remember is that updates only happen with a proper majority approval. More than half of the systems running the Bitcoin blockchain need to install the new version in order to achieve consensus on approving each transaction on the public ledger. A so-called 51% attack is possible, but only if you control more than half of the world's Bitcoin mining power -- a tall order even for trillion-dollar tech giants or governments. And before that, every software update goes through a meticulous process of planning, development, testing, and installation.

And it would not be in the community's best interest to adopt software versions with unwanted features. The 21-million coin cap is safe, because upping that limit would immediately lower the value of the Bitcoin holdings and mining systems that made it possible to change that particular number.

So Bitcoin developers have the freedom to tackle technical challenges, including the future threat of hackers with quantum computers. The system is also sophisticated enough to resist unwanted software changes. No project, system, or organization is ever 100% safe against every threat, and that's only more true in the unfamiliar cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin investors shouldn't lose sleep over this particular issue, though.

Quantum computers won't break the Bitcoin platform any time soon, and they're still many years away from posing a serious threat. That's more than enough time to dodge the entire problem with the appropriate software tweaks.

Oops, something went wrong

Warren Buffett is famous for his patience, as well as his sharp focus on finding investments that are priced at the right valuation, and equipped to continue gaining in value for years and years. Something he isn't as famous for is that he detests all forms of cryptocurrency, even Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).

But that doesn't mean you can't apply some of his investment principles to evaluating cryptocurrency investments. In fact, it's probably a smart idea to take his perspective, at least with some assets. Here's what you'll need to do to get a more Buffett-esque twist when you're looking at crypto.

Many of Buffett's best investments have been a feature of his portfolio for many years. Take Coca-Cola, for example, which he bought in 1998, or American Express, which he first purchased in 1991. There aren't any cryptocurrencies with that kind of vintage of being in existence. The closest would be Bitcoin, which was launched in 2009.

The point of Buffett holding investments for so long is that it allows the company's competitive advantages to play out and increase the stock's value as it inevitably wins against its competitors over time. That way, he gets the benefit of compounding growth, and someone else is doing the work each day to make it happen.

You can use this same idea very easily: Which cryptocurrencies, if any, have drivers that'll sustain their growth for years to come? As mentioned before, the only coin that's been proven to do that over any period of time that's sufficiently long to be Buffett-approved is Bitcoin. Others might achieve this eventually, but for now, it's the only one with enough of a history, and it's the only one with supply dynamics that are likely to continue forcing its price upward over the long term.

Buffett is a stickler for buying stocks at an appropriate valuation.

In crypto, this equates to not buying assets when everyone is talking about them and sentiment is high. There is minimal focus on the underlying investment thesis and more focus on price action. It's rarely a good deal to buy coins that are actively being bid up.

Instead, take Buffett's approach. You don't need to try to time the market. You just need to make sure that you're not buying at the points of a coin's life when there's a baked-in hype tax. If there's a real mechanism by which the coin can generate value over the long term, and not just hype, it'll recover from any lows that its price hits anyway.

So be patient and invest slowly, preferably while prices are nowhere near their recent highs. For Bitcoin, a perfect example would be buying in early 2023, right after the bear market.

Take a look at this chart:

It's fine to buy as prices are rising, as long as you're diligent about dollar-cost averaging (DCAing) when prices are falling too. It's more important to be invested for the long haul than it is to nail the perfect dirt-cheap valuation entry that Buffett tries to do with stocks. The science of crypto valuation isn't nearly as mature as stock valuation, so aim for being in the right ballpark rather than hitting the bullseye.

Buffett has a lot of different holdings. But he doesn't buy stocks every day. He screens annual reports, calculates valuations, determines if there's an asset worth owning, and then patiently waits for the opportunity to purchase it at his preferred price. That means doing nothing most of the time. And it means not buying something that looks juicy until he sees signs that the fruit is actually ripe.

You should be taking a similar approach with cryptocurrencies. There is no rush to buy anything that is worth holding for more than a few years. Today may not be the right day to invest in something, given your capital, your portfolio's positioning, and your current level of risk exposure. The more deliberate you can be, the better your results will be.

Helping Shape the European Financial Services Industry Since 2002

The deal, which involves acquiring a minority stake in Binance, marks MGX's initial entry into the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has secured a $2bn investment from MGX, a technology investor headquartered in Abu Dhabi, UAE.

This transaction marks the first institutional investment in Binance and stands as the largest single investment ever received by a company within the cryptocurrency sector. Specifically, it is also the most significant amount paid using stablecoins.

This deal signifies MGX's initial entry into the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors as it acquires a minority stake in Binance. The collaboration aligns with MGX's strategy to support blockchain technology's ongoing societal transformation.

By joining forces with Binance, MGX aims to drive advancements where artificial intelligence (AI) converges with blockchain and finance.

Binance is a global platform for cryptocurrency trading, which is claimed to have over 260 million users in more than 100 countries.

It offers multiple services, ranging from trading and finance to education and other digital solutions. Binance's goal is to enhance financial accessibility worldwide through the use of cryptocurrency.

Binance CEO Richard Teng said: “This investment by MGX is a significant milestone for the crypto industry and for Binance. Together, we are shaping the future of digital finance. Our goal is to build a more inclusive and sustainable ecosystem, with a strong focus on compliance, security, and user protection.

“Binance remains committed to working with regulators worldwide to establish transparent, responsible, and forward- thinking policies for the crypto industry. Our ongoing investments in security and compliance reinforce our mission to foster a secure and trusted digital financial ecosystem.”

MGX focuses its investments on accelerating developments in AI and related technologies through global partnerships, particularly in the UAE. The company invests across various sectors such as semiconductors, infrastructure, software, tech-enabled services, life sciences, and AI applications.

Binance employs around 1,000 people in the UAE, part of its approximately 5,000 global staff, indicating its presence in the region. The company has a significant trading volume and user base, with cumulative trading exceeding $100 trillion.

The investment by MGX is intended to support AI-driven blockchain projects and encourage developments in decentralised finance (DeFi) and the digital economy.

MGX managing director and CEO Ahmed Yahia said: “MGX's investment in Binance reflects our commitment to advancing blockchain's transformative potential for digital finance.

“As institutional adoption accelerates, the need for secure, compliant, and scalable blockchain infrastructure and solutions has never been greater. Binance has long been a driving force in cryptocurrency innovation, from exchange technology and tokenization to staking and payments.

“Together, we are committed to building a more inclusive and robust digital finance ecosystem.”

For Michael Saylor, piling into Bitcoin worked. 

The chair and co-founder of Strategy got in early, buying up the asset since 2020 and sitting on about $9 billion in gains.

Others that piled into Bitcoin years ago, such as Tesla, Jack Dorsey's Block and Japan's Nexon, are also sitting on healthy returns.

But newcomers trying to mimic Saylor's tactic — which he says helps protect from currency debasement and acts as a hedge against inflation — haven't been so lucky.

Bitcoin has seen wild price swings this month as investors fret about US President Donald Trump's flip-flopping policies and the broader US economy. 

The price is down about 25% from its all-time high.

Strategy employs a somewhat complex debt and equity toggling mechanism to protect against price fluctuations — something some other firms holding Bitcoin aren't replicating. 

Here are five companies that are losing money on their Bitcoin investments.

Video-sharing platform Rumble is the most recent firm to snag some Bitcoin, announcing the acquisition of more than $17 million worth of the asset on March 12.

Yet the firm's purchase price of $91,000 per Bitcoin means that its investment is already down around 9%. 

Rumble's Bitcoin holdings are relatively minor, at just 0.6% of its $2.3 billion market capitalisation. 

The firm says it is diversifying its treasury with Bitcoin to protect against “dilution through endless money-printing.”

And Rumble's Bitcoin buying may not be over. The firm's board of directors approved purchases up to $20 million in November.

Rumble did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Hong Kong-based Ming Shing Group is an unlikely firm to be buying up Bitcoin. 

It's a small investment holding company engaged in the provision of trades services like plastering, tile laying, and brick laying.

Yet in recent months the firm has scooped up $69 million worth of Bitcoin through a subsidiary — that's almost as much as the firm's $74 million market capitalisation.

Director Wenjin Li said the firm bought Bitcoin to boost its asset growth and create additional value for shareholders.

However, the firm's Bitcoin buys came at an average cost of $89,250, meaning its position is currently around 7% underwater. 

Ming Shing Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Semler Scientific started off as a firm engaged in the early detection and treatment of chronic diseases.

In May 2024, it started funnelling its cash reserves into Bitcoin.

Like Saylor's Strategy, the firm has issued more shares in order to buy up more Bitcoin, a move it says is “highly accretive” to stockholders.

However, recent large purchases have pushed up costs. 

Semler Scientific's average purchase price now sits at $87,850, about 5% higher than Bitcoin's current price. 

The $265 million worth of Bitcoin on the firm's books comes in at a whopping 82% of its market capitalisation. 

Semler Scientific did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Chinese chip designer Nano Labs is another firm going all in on crypto. 

It has acquired $30 million worth of Bitcoin through a subsidiary, and in February sold $5.9 million worth of shares satisfied in Bitcoin and Tether stablecoin USDT, per a press release. 

It's not just Bitcoin Nano Labs has been buying. On January 21, the firm announced that it had bought 47 of President Donald Trump's memecoin. 

Nano Labs said the symbolic purchase, which cost it a little over $1,100, celebrates Trump's election and reflects the firm's appreciation for his supportive stance toward the cryptocurrency industry.

Nano Labs' Bitcoin buys aren't doing so well, however. Its average purchase price of $99,700 puts its holdings 16% above current prices, the widest negative return on the list. 

The firm's Bitcoin holdings come in at 35% of its market capitalisation. 

Nano Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Singapore-based Genius Group calls itself a Bitcoin Treasury Company, with the goal of accumulating 1,000 Bitcoin by the end of the year.

Genius Group says it wants to replicate the success of firms like Strategy and Metaplanet by buying Bitcoin and potentially issuing debt and shares to buy even more.

So far, the firm holds 440 Bitcoin, worth a little more than $36 million. 

However, the firm's average purchase price of $95,455 puts its holdings 13% underwater. 

Still, Genius Group boasts that the value of its held Bitcoin is higher than its market capitalisation on a per-share basis.

The firm Bitcoin holdings are worth 158% of its $23 million market capitalisation.

Genius Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                            Cryptocurrency News – REAL News ® – TCAT                        

Bitcoin dominance surged to 62% today, reflecting a significant shift in the cryptocurrency market. Despite an overall increase in the market cap by 1.77%, the trading volume has seen a notable decline of 15% over the past 24 hours, indicating a cooling in market activity. This increase in Bitcoin's dominance comes as the price of Bitcoin itself has risen by around 2%, moving from its lows of $76K yesterday to surpass the $80K mark, now hovering in the $83K range.



The surge in Bitcoin dominance suggests that investors are gravitating toward the relative safety of Bitcoin amid an otherwise sluggish market. When Bitcoin dominance recently dropped to a year-low of 55%, the market saw a short bull run, with several altcoins recording significant price surges and Bitcoin reaching its all-time high. However, this surge seems to be short-lived, and the current market sentiment is weaker, with altcoins struggling to maintain any substantial upward momentum. The current market environment has caused traders to favor Bitcoin, solidifying its position as the dominant force in the market.

In addition to Bitcoin's resurgence, the overall cryptocurrency market cap has only experienced a modest increase of 1.77%, bringing it to approximately $2.71 trillion. This increase is relatively small compared to the volatility seen in previous periods, suggesting that the market may still be in a state of caution. The 15% drop in trading volume is another red flag, signaling a decline in trader activity and a potential lack of market confidence. At its peak, the daily trading volume in the crypto market was around $420 billion. Currently, however, it has dropped significantly to $101.28 billion, reflecting a cooling of market activity and a possible indication of trader fatigue.

This decline in trading volume and the increase in Bitcoin dominance come at a time of increased global macroeconomic concerns. The market is being influenced by a variety of external factors, including rising trade tensions stemming from new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and fears of an impending recession. These factors are causing traders to be more cautious about taking on the risk associated with cryptocurrencies, leading to a more conservative investment approach.

Despite efforts to move forward with cryptocurrency regulation and Bitcoin reserve creation under the Trump administration, the current market sentiment remains tepid. This has led to a generally cautious outlook for the cryptocurrency industry. The fear and greed index for the crypto market currently stands at 21, which reflects a strong fear sentiment. This suggests that most market participants are wary of making large investments, and the overall market outlook remains bearish.

If this sentiment persists, it is possible that the crypto market could experience further downturns in the coming weeks. Without a significant catalyst to propel the market forward, such as positive regulatory news or a major technological advancement, Bitcoin's price may fall back into the $70K range, and altcoins may continue to struggle. This could lead to more cautious behavior from traders, and further decline in market volume could follow.

In conclusion, while Bitcoin dominance has risen to 62%, reflecting a shift towards the king of cryptocurrencies, the broader market remains under pressure. The decline in trading volume and overall market sentiment points to potential challenges ahead for the crypto space. As global economic uncertainties continue to influence market sentiment, the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remains uncertain.

Bitcoin just dropped 24% from its all-time high — what happens next? Analysts say BTC is “very close to its local bottom,” but could a Black Swan event send it crashing even lower?

Table of Contents

Bitcoin's (BTC) price has been on a bumpy stretch. After hitting an all-time high of $109,114 in January when President Donald Trump took office and established a more pro-crypto administration, the market has taken a sharp turn.

As of Mar. 13, Bitcoin is sitting around $82,600, down 24% from its January peak, after plunging to a four-month low of $76,600 on Mar. 11.

The market is facing headwinds from multiple directions. Wall Street is leaning into risk aversion, U.S. recession fears are growing, and Trump's new tariff policies have added uncertainty to the mix.

Many investors were also disappointed by the lack of fresh BTC purchases under the Trump administration's strategic reserve plan, which some had hoped would provide a steady buying force for Bitcoin.

On the macroeconomic side, inflation data released on Mar. 12 offered a brief moment of optimism. The consumer price index rose by just 0.2% in February, slowing to an annual inflation rate of 2.8% — down from 0.5% in January. The core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, also landed at 3.1%, its lowest level since April 2021.

The market initially reacted positively to the softer CPI data. Bitcoin pushed above $84,000, and altcoins saw double-digit gains. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 also recorded slight upticks.

But the optimism didn't last. As the day progressed, BTC and equities erased most of their gains, weighed down by Trump's tariff war escalating against major trading partners.

In a dramatic move, Trump slapped a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports from Canada, prompting Canada to retaliate with 25% tariffs on $21 billion worth of U.S. goods.

Just hours later, the EU fired back with its own $28 billion in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, further intensifying trade tensions.

These actions have put investors on edge, shifting market sentiment toward a risk-off approach, where cash and safer assets like gold and bonds become more attractive than volatile plays like Bitcoin.

With all these forces at play, Bitcoin finds itself at a crossroads. Will it stabilize and gear up for another run, or are further corrections on the horizon? Let's dig deeper.

Since Feb. 13, spot Bitcoin ETFs have been under pressure, with money flowing out at an aggressive pace. While there were a few days of net positive inflows, they were small in volume compared to the heavy outflows on most days.

The worst hit came on Feb. 25, when ETFs saw their largest single-day outflow ever — over $1 billion, marking a clear risk-off sentiment among institutional investors.

Despite the outflows, as of Mar. 12, BlackRock's IBIT remains the dominant ETF in the market, holding nearly 568,000 BTC. Fidelity's FBTC and Grayscale's GBTC follow, managing 197,500 BTC and 196,000 BTC, respectively.

Adding a political layer to the Bitcoin narrative, at least six members of President Trump's cabinet hold Bitcoin, either directly or indirectly through ETFs.

Among them, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has the largest disclosed stake, with a Bitcoin Fidelity crypto account valued between $1 million and $5 million.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent holds between $250,001 and $500,000 worth of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. While Bessent has pledged to divest his holdings within 90 days, his position highlights the growing connection between Bitcoin and top-level U.S. policymakers.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's open interest, a crucial metric showing the total value of outstanding BTC derivative contracts, has been in a downward spiral.

After peaking at $70 billion on Jan. 22, following Bitcoin's new all-time high, open interest has been on a steady decline. As BTC tumbled, OI followed, dropping to a low of $45.7 billion on Mar. 11, the same day BTC hit its four-month low.

However, in the last two days, open interest has started climbing back, adding over $1 billion as of Mar. 13, in sync with BTC's price recovery.

The heavy ETF outflows and dropping open interest paint a picture of institutional hesitation and reduced speculative activity over the past few weeks.

Bitcoin's rally in January was fueled by strong ETF inflows and high-leveraged positions, but as soon as macro uncertainty and Trump's trade war escalated, the market turned defensive.

The latest open interest rebound is a potential signal that traders are cautiously re-entering long positions, but the recovery is slow. A sustained increase in both OI and ETF inflows will be critical for Bitcoin to regain momentum.

Bitcoin's recent pullback from its all-time high has been sharp, but historical trends and technical indicators suggest that this could either be a temporary bottom or the beginning of a deeper correction.

Technical analyst CryptoCon points out that Bitcoin has now reached historically low RSI Bollinger Band % levels, a point where BTC rarely stays for long.

Bitcoin has now made a full return to critically low RSI Bollinger Band % levels, and it doesn't like to stay there for long.This comes after the completion of phase 4, the ATH break like January 2013, December 2016, and November 2020.What we're seeing now is looking just… pic.twitter.com/Bb6XJlJTGE

To break this down — Relative Strength Index measures momentum, while Bollinger Bands show volatility. When the RSI Bollinger % reaches extreme lows, it suggests that Bitcoin is at an oversold level, meaning the downside pressure is likely exhausting itself.

In previous cycles, when BTC hit similar RSI Bollinger % lows, it marked a strong local bottom before the next leg up.

According to CryptoCon, Bitcoin has just completed Phase 4, a part of the market cycle where price breaks past the previous all-time high—something we saw in January 2013, December 2016, and November 2020.

In all three of these cycles, BTC had a correction after the breakout before rallying to a new high within the next 9 to 12 months.

He believes that this market cycle is behaving exactly like March 2017, when BTC faced a deep correction but then recovered to rally further. If that's the case, this means we are still months away from a cycle top.

However, this optimistic outlook is far from universally accepted. Doctor Profit, another respected analyst, lays out two possible scenarios for BTC's next move.

In a normal market environment, BTC's local bottom should form between $68,000 and $74,000, as confirmed by the Market Value to Realized Value indicator.

The MVRV indicator measures whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued by comparing the current market price to the average purchase price of all BTC in circulation.

Right now, the MVRV suggests that BTC is approaching a strong bottom zone, meaning downside risk is limited unless something drastic happens.

That's where the Black Swan risk comes in. While Doctor Profit initially believed a Black Swan event was highly unlikely, recent economic shifts — such as Trump's aggressive tariff moves, global trade war concerns, and broader recession fears — make him less certain.

A severe global economic downturn, a financial crisis, or a major crypto industry collapse could push Bitcoin much lower, possibly toward $50,000. While he still leans toward the first scenario, he no longer rules out a full-blown market wipeout.

The signs are mixed. Bitcoin's historical cycles suggest this is a healthy pullback before another rally, but global conditions have rarely been this unstable.

For now, investors should stay cautious, watch key support levels, and be prepared for heightened volatility.

While historical data favors a recovery, markets don't move in a vacuum, and external shocks can override even the strongest technical indicators. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

                    A Lithuanian national Aleksej Besciokov, wanted by the U.S., arrested in a coordinated operation between the CBI and Kerala Police.

Indian authorities arrested at Washington's request a cryptocurrency exchange administrator accused of money laundering conspiracy and violating sanctions, India's top crime fighting bureau said on Wednesday (March 12, 2025).

The United States, Germany and Finland took down the online infrastructure used by the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, the U.S. Justice Department said last week, adding that two administrators of the exchange were charged.

One of those administrators was Aleksej Besciokov, a Russian resident and Lithuanian national who was charged with money laundering and also faced accusations of violating sanctions and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, the Justice Department said on Friday.

Besciokov was arrested in Kerala, India's Central Bureau of Investigation said, adding he was wanted by U.S. authorities. The CBI said that at Washington's request, India's Foreign Ministry had a provisional arrest warrant issued.

It added Besciokov was planning to flee India. It was not immediately clear why he was in India. Washington is expected to pursue Besciokov's extradition. His representative could not immediately be reached.

""I can confirm Aleksej Besciokov, one of the administrators of Garantex, was arrested in India at the request of the United States,"" a U.S. Justice Department spokesperson told CNN.

The exchange has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since April 2019, the U.S. Justice Department said last week.

Garantex was sanctioned by the U.S. in April 2022.

Blockchain research company TRM Labs said in a blog post last week that the takedown of Garantex ""marks a major milestone in the fight against illicit finance"" but cautioned that sanctioned exchanges often attempt to evade restrictions by creating new entities.

Cabinet members' Bitcoin holdings spark debate over ethics and influence in Trump's pro-crypto governance approach.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Several members of Donald Trump's cabinet have significant Bitcoin holdings, with their combined investments valued in the millions, according to their financial disclosure reports.

These disclosures show that cabinet members have gained exposure to Bitcoin through direct purchases on crypto exchanges and investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The presence of crypto-friendly figures in the administration aligns with Trump's goal of positioning the US as a dominant force in the digital asset industry.

During this short term of his presidency, Trump has introduced several policies, including plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, to strengthen America's foothold in the sector.

Kennedy holds the largest Bitcoin investment among cabinet officials, reporting a Fidelity crypto account valued between $1 million and $5 million.

He has been vocal about his support for Bitcoin, previously stating that a significant portion of his personal wealth is in the asset.

Kennedy previously advocated for the US Treasury to acquire Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, proposing a strategy to accumulate 550 BTC daily until the nation holds 4 million BTC in reserve.

Bessent's financial report lists BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF investment worth between $250,001 and $500,000 in his portfolio.

However, as outlined in his ethics agreement, he has agreed to divest from these holdings within 90 days of his confirmation.

In past statements, Bessent described Bitcoin as an investment option for younger, disillusioned investors in the traditional financial system.

Duffy disclosed multiple Bitcoin investments, including direct holdings valued between $250,001 and $500,000. He also stated that he has Bitcoin stored in a Gemini wallet within the same value range.

Additionally, he has a $50,001 and $100,000 stake in the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund.

These government officials' substantial Bitcoin holdings raise ethics concerns, considering the Trump administration's pro-crypto approach to governance.

US lawmaker Elizabeth Warren recently warned that the Trump administration's “actions have the potential to benefit billionaire investors, Trump Administration insiders, and speculators at the expense of middle-class families.”

Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Also known as ""Akiba,"" Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change.

The Currency analytics


                            Cryptocurrency News – REAL News ® – TCAT                        

Bitcoin (BTC) has reached a critical point in its current market cycle, with signs that it may be deviating from the patterns of previous halvings. Historically, Bitcoin's price would surge following a halving event, but the current cycle has been marked by uncertainty. Instead of the explosive rallies seen in previous cycles, the cryptocurrency is showing more subdued price movements, largely influenced by macroeconomic factors and institutional participation.



Bitcoin's current cycle is noticeably different from past ones. Historically, Bitcoin saw strong rallies after each halving, particularly during the 2012-2016 and 2016-2020 cycles. However, this cycle has been more complex. The price saw an initial surge beginning in October and December 2024, followed by consolidation in January 2025 and a correction in late February 2025. This has raised questions about whether Bitcoin has already reached its peak for this cycle.

The increasing presence of institutional investors, alongside political and economic shifts, has influenced Bitcoin's price trajectory. While Bitcoin has moved beyond its retail-driven speculative boom, it is now treated as a more mature asset class, which has altered its price dynamics. These changes suggest that Bitcoin may not follow the same path as in previous cycles, and that its growth could be stabilizing over time.

One of the key indicators pointing to a shift in Bitcoin's cycle dynamics is the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The LTH MVRV ratio measures the unrealized profits of long-term holders and has been decreasing over time. During the 2016-2020 cycle, the ratio peaked at 35.8, showing extreme profits among long-term holders. In the current cycle, however, the LTH MVRV has only reached a peak of 4.35, indicating far less liquid profit.

This declining trend across cycles suggests that Bitcoin's explosive growth phases may be coming to an end. As institutional investors and governments become more involved, Bitcoin's market behavior is shifting toward more stability and less extreme volatility. This is a sign that the long-term growth of Bitcoin is stabilizing, but it does not necessarily confirm that the cycle has peaked.

The rise of institutional investors in the Bitcoin market has contributed to its more stable price movements. Unlike earlier cycles, where retail-driven speculation led to sharp price fluctuations, institutional involvement introduces a more structured and less volatile market environment. As Bitcoin's market capitalization grows, it requires significantly more capital to drive the same percentage gains seen in previous cycles.

Despite this shift, experts remain optimistic about Bitcoin's long-term prospects. Increasing state-level adoption, such as Texas passing Senate Bill 21 to establish a state-controlled crypto reserve, signals growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin. Additionally, geopolitical factors and regulatory changes, including Trump's pro-crypto stance, are reshaping the environment in which Bitcoin operates.

While Bitcoin's current cycle may not follow the same pattern as past halvings, it does not mean that the cycle is over. Experts suggest that the recent corrections could simply be a phase of consolidation before Bitcoin embarks on another rally. However, due to the increasing influence of institutional investors, this rally may not be as explosive as in previous cycles. Instead, Bitcoin could experience more prolonged and sustainable growth, with fewer sharp price spikes.

As Bitcoin matures, the market is less likely to see the parabolic top that characterized previous cycles. Instead, price appreciation may be more gradual, reflecting Bitcoin's integration into the global financial system. While the path forward remains uncertain, it is clear that the traditional Bitcoin cycle dynamics are evolving.

Bitcoin's current cycle is markedly different from those of the past. Although the cryptocurrency has faced corrections, it may not have reached its peak just yet. Factors such as institutional involvement, geopolitical shifts, and changes in macroeconomic conditions have created a more complex market environment for Bitcoin. While this cycle may lack the explosive growth seen in previous years, Bitcoin's long-term outlook remains positive, with increased state-level adoption and evolving regulations signaling its growing role in the global financial system. Therefore, despite the recent downturn, Bitcoin's cycle is far from over.

Ethereum (ETH) traded around $1,860 in the Asian session on Thursday as its price remained largely subdued by bearish sentiment weighing on the general crypto market. However, expectations surrounding the potential approval of staking within US spot Ethereum ETFs could lift the top altcoin out of its recent weak performance.

The SEC acknowledged it has received Fidelity's proposal to allow staking within its spot Ethereum ETF (FETH). However, it's unlikely the agency will decide on the proposal soon, considering it recently postponed deciding on several crypto ETF applications.

The SEC postponed making decisions on Dogecoin, Solana and XRP ETF applications on Tuesday. The ETF Store president Nate Geraci suggested it is due process considering Paul Atkins, Trump's pick to chair the agency, has yet to get Senate approval.

Grayscale and 21Shares have also filed to allow staking within their spot Ethereum ETFs.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's next technical upgrade, Pectra, which will bring several UX improvement features to its blockchain, is getting closer after finalizing on testnets Holesky and Sepolia. Users now await the mainnet upgrade, and many anticipate it could mark a turnaround in ETH's price trajectory, which has severely underperformed Bitcoin and Solana.

""Improved tech does not distract from the overarching theme over the last two years – ETH's underperformance,"" noted K33 Research analysts in a Wednesday report.

""There are, however, potential bullish catalysts such as the incorporation of staking rewards into US spot ETH ETFs [...] This, more than technical upgrades, could be the necessary trigger for some ETH momentum and enable it to regain favor with market participants,"" they added.

Standard Chartered analysts have predicted that staking within Ethereum ETFs could drive ETH's price above $14,000 by year-end.

Ethereum saw $60.98 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations was $34.10 million and $26.88 million, respectively.

ETH appears to lack directional bias as bulls and bears struggle to gain hold of prices since it bounced off the $1,750 support. The top altcoin has to overcome the emerging resistance near $1,960 and surpass a key descending trendline resistance to strengthen the quest to recover $2,200.

However, a sustained consolidation around $1,900 and $2,000 could establish the range as a key resistance.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) are close to their oversold region, indicating dominant bearish momentum.

A daily candlestick close below $1,500 will invalidate the consolidation thesis and send ETH toward $1,000.

After the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, Ethereum users are looking towards the Pectra upgrade slated for early 2025. The upgrade will come in two phases, featuring improved wallet experience, an upgrade to the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), PeerDAS for scaling L2s, improvement of blob capacity, etc.

Forks are upgrades or changes to the codebase/architecture of a blockchain network. Considering blockchain networks have no central governance, forks are only carried out after developers and validators reach a consensus. Hard forks are substantial permanent changes in a blockchain protocol that create two parallel chains – one with the old rules and the new with the implemented changes. Developers can either upgrade their software to build on the new chain or remain on the old chain as a separate network. During a hard fork, users receive an equivalent amount of their tokens on the new blockchain network 1:1. Soft forks, on the other hand, are subtle changes on a blockchain network that are backwards-compatible, meaning the network still operates as a single entity even when some developers don't implement the new changes.

Famously scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 22 minutes, Ethereum improvement proposal EIP-7702 is an advanced way of marrying EIP-3074 and ERC-4337 to unlock massive adoption for Ethereum's smart wallet functionality. Slated to go live in the upcoming Pectra upgrade, EIP-7702 will implement an advanced version of account abstraction enabling features like batching that allows users to pay a one-off transaction fee for multiple actions, sponsorship to enable an account pay gas fees for other users and wallet recovery options if users misplace their seed phrase.

Layer 2 is a collective term for protocols that aim to scale Ethereum by processing batches of transactions off the Mainnet. After performing a series of mathematical computations to ensure their validity, these L2s send a compressed version of the transactions back to the Mainnet for final processing. As a result, Layer 2 networks reduce transaction fees and enhance the Mainnet's speed while reaping its security. Think of them like several personal assistants that help their boss to process a series of paperworks. These assistants send a summarised version of the paperworks to the boss who confirms and signs on them.

Layer 3 solutions are application-specific blockchains built upon existing Layer 2 networks to offer high scalability and interoperability. For example, an L3 can focus on tackling privacy, increased scalability, gaming, or some complex functionality while still ultimately deriving security from the Layer 1.

CONVERGE LIVE - Singapore, March 12-13 2025 - Request invitation

The CEO of crypto exchange Binance said he expects U.S. President Trump's ""pro-crypto"" legislation in the U.S. to spur regulators in other parts of the world to follow suit.

""We have moved from a period where there's big regulatory uncertainty and in many sense, some regulatory hostility towards the industry, to one where the largest economy of the world said 'we want to embrace crypto,'"" Binance CEO Richard Teng told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore on Thursday. 

Under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, regulators cracked down on the industry in an effort to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering.

""[If] you ask anybody in the crypto industry, people prefer the current administration compared to the last one,"" Teng said.

Chao Deng, CEO of crypto fund manager HashKey Capital, who spoke alongside Teng at the CONVERGE event, shared that view, saying that under Trump, ""the momentum is building, institutional [and] retail adoption [of crypto assets] is immense."" 

The comments came after Trump pressed ahead with an executive order to establish a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies for the U.S. using digital assets seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases. 

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that in addition to Bitcoin, the strategic reserve would include ether, XRP, Solana's SOL token, and Cardano's ADA coin.

The Binance CEO described the U.S. crypto reserve as a ""landmark"" issue. ""The messaging is the largest government … the biggest capital market in the world is now holding Bitcoin as part of the reserve, [that'll] cause many other governments to think through the issue, to sit up to say, should we start doing allocation into crypto and bitcoin?""

Bitcoin prices have fallen since Trump's announcement of a strategic crypto reserve as details of the plan fell short of expectations. Investor enthusiasm toward assets perceived to be risky has also softened more broadly due to concerns over the impact of Trump's tariff plans.

Teng downplayed the recent pullback in crypto markets as a ""tactical retreat,"" as — like any other asset class — it is not ""immune"" to macroeconomic situations. Nonetheless, Washington's embrace of the digital assets and Trump's nomination of several crypto-friendly legislators will provide ""strong"" long-term drivers, he said.  

Since his victory in November, Trump has focused on appointing government leaders who support the cryptocurrency sector. Venture capitalist David Sacks was tapped by Trump to be the White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar.

According to Teng, during the last administration, you had ""Operation Choke Point 2.0"" in progress — an alleged effort by regulators during the Biden presidency to pressure banks into severing ties with crypto. CNBC was unable to verify these claims.

Teng also said the industry faced ""regulation via enforcement,"" which made it extremely tough for it to grow. 

Hashkey Capital's Deng agreed that a return of banking services for crypto companies in the U.S. is one of the most important changes to come from the election. 

""They encourage and they allow banks to be involved with crypto. This is a very huge step for the crypto and Web3 industry,"" he said, adding that banks will now feel more comfortable working with crypto-related clients.

The Central Bank of Russia has proposed restricting cryptocurrency transactions to ""particularly qualified investors"" who possess over RUB 100 million (US$1.1 million) in securities or have earned more than RUB 50 million (US$560,000) per year.

Source: The Moscow Times

Details: For other citizens, cryptocurrency transactions may be prohibited, with penalties introduced for violations. 

The regulator reaffirmed that ""the Central Bank of Russia still does not consider cryptocurrency as a means of payment"". It also plans to ban crypto transactions between Russian residents and impose regulatory requirements on financial institutions seeking to invest in digital assets.

Since 1 September 2024, Russia has allowed international settlements in cryptocurrency under an experimental legal framework. However, in late November, Vladimir Putin signed a law recognising digital currencies as taxable property.

Additionally, Russia legalised cryptocurrency mining on 1 November 2024, with new tax regulations for miners taking effect in 2025. However, the government has banned mining in the North Caucasus republics and occupied territories of Ukraine.

Background: Stablecoin issuer Tether recently froze RUB 2.5 billion (US$28 million) worth of USDT on the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, forcing the platform to suspend operations.

CONVERGE LIVE - Singapore, March 12-13 2025 - Request invitation

Emirati state-owned investment firm MGX announced a $2 billion investment into Binance, in what marks the cryptocurrency exchange's first institutional investment and the ""single largest investment"" ever paird in crypto.

In a joint press release, the firms said the minority stake would be paid for in stablecoins, making it the ""largest investment ever"" paid in cryptocurrency. Stablecoins are a type of digital asset designed to hold a constant value, typically with a peg to a fiat currency. 

Abu Dhabi launched the MGX investment firm last year with a focus on AI technology. In September, MGX partnered with the likes of BlackRock and Microsoft to launch a more than $30 billion AI fund, but it had yet to invest in the cryptocurrency industry and blockchain sectors. 

""MGX's investment in Binance reflects our commitment to advancing blockchain's transformative potential for digital finance,"" Ahmed Yahia, managing director and CEO at MGX, said in a statement.

The press release added that ""by partnering with the leading industry player, MGX aims to enable innovation at the intersection of AI, blockchain technology and finance.""

Binance and MGX did not immediately comment on the size of the stake or what stablecoin would be used for the payment. Binance has not responded to an inquiry on whether the deal had been completed.

As part of the UAE's broader ambitions to become a global technology leader, it has been growing into a regional crypto hub. 

Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, has grown its Middle East footprint as it faced regulatory hurdles and enforcement measures in other jurisdictions in recent years, 

According to the press release, Binance employs approximately 1,000 of its roughly 5,000 global workforce in the UAE. It adds that it now boasts over 260 million registered users and has surpassed $100 trillion in cumulative trading volume. 

Binance CEO Richard Teng is scheduled to take part in a panel session at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore at 2:40 p.m. local time (2:40 a.m. ET) on Thursday.

Bitcoin's (BTC) role in decentralized finance (DeFi) is growing as the world's largest cryptocurrency evolves from more than just a store of value, Binance Research said in a report Thursday.

The Bitcoin network is ""evolving into a broader decentralized finance ecosystem with the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi,"" analyst Moulik Nagesh wrote.

This is a sector that ""unlocks bitcoin's capital efficiency"" with the use of financial applications focused on lending, staking, stablecoins and decentralized exchanges (DEX's), the report said.

DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without the need for traditional intermediaries.

Binance noted that only ~0.8% of the bitcoin supply is currently being used in DeFi, and this presents a large ""untapped opportunity."" In fact, last year, Julian Love, a deal analyst at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, said the opportunity could be as much as $1 trillion.

Binance Research report said that Bitcoin needs layer 2s as the network lacks ""native programmability,"" unlike smart contract-based layer 1s. A layer 1 network is the base layer or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.

While there has been some progress on the development of Bitcoin layer-2 networks, these platforms need greater adoption and liquidity incentives to be able to scale up effectively, Binance Research said.

The network's security model is faced with ""long-term sustainability challenges"" as block rewards will continue to halve, the report said, thereby reducing miner incentives.

The long-term viability of Bitcoin DeFi is dependent on execution, the further development of layer-2s, and the ""ability to align with bitcoin's unique value proposition,"" the report added.

The ""Wall Street Journal"" reports this, citing sources familiar with the negotiations.

Representatives of the family of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, have begun talks to acquire a stake in the U.S. arm of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the negotiations. The move could tie Trump to the company, which pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations in 2023.

According to the newspaper, the founder of Binance Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty in court, is reportedly seeking a pardon from the Trump administration. Zhao, who remains Binance's largest shareholder, is said to have pushed the deal as part of a strategy to re-enter the U.S. market. It's unclear what form the Trump family's eventual participation might take, or whether the deal is contingent on Zhao being pardoned. One possibility is that the investment could be made through World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed cryptocurrency firm launched last September.

The talks reportedly began after Trump's election victory and involved a working group within Binance led by current CEO Richard Teng. The company's officials reportedly sought to develop a plan to overcome legal hurdles related to Zhao's conviction, which could impede operations in the United States and other regulated markets, such as the European Union. Sources cited by the “Wall Street Journal” indicate that Steve Witkoff, a longtime friend of Trump and the US administration's negotiator for the Middle East and the conflict in Ukraine, would have participated in the talks for a deal with Binance. A White House official, however, denied Witkoff's involvement, specifying that the latter is proceeding with the sale of his business interests. In 2023, Binance agreed to pay $4,3 billion in fines to settle a dispute with U.S. authorities, who accused the platform of facilitating transactions with sanctioned groups, including Hamas and the Islamic State, and of circumventing U.S. anti-money laundering regulations.

As part of the deal, Zhao stepped down as CEO, but retained controlling interest in the company. After his release from prison last September, Zhao moved to Abu Dhabi. The talks between Binance and Trump's family are part of a broader push by the U.S. president to embrace the cryptocurrency industry. Since taking office, Trump has signed a series of industry-friendly executive orders and promoted initiatives such as the White House Crypto Summit, aimed at strengthening the role of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. economy.

Early-rising UK stargazers are in for a celestial treat on Friday as a lunar eclipse takes place just before dawn. 

For most of the UK the eclipse will be partial as the Earth's shadow will not cover all of the Moon. For some far western regions, and across the Americas, the eclipse will be total, weather permitting

As the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, it will gradually darken before turning a dusky red, resulting in a stunning ""blood moon"". A weather front will bring some cloud overnight but there is a good chance skies will be clear enough to see it.

The last total lunar eclipse in the UK occurred in 2022.

The penumbral phase (when the Moon first enters Earth's outer shadow) will begin at 03:57 on Friday.

The partial eclipse - when the Moon starts moving into the darker part of Earth's shadow - will begin at 05:09.

Lunar eclipses are visible from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon at the time.

At 06:58 the eclipse will reach its true maximum; however, in almost all of the UK, the Moon will have already set below the horizon, so we won't be able to see this.

Very western areas like the Scottish highlands, west Cornwall and the very western parts of Northern Ireland may get a brief glimpse of total eclipse.

For those in North America, most of South America, and western Greenland, the eclipse will be total.

""Even if you have to get up super early to see it, I would definitely recommend that you try because seeing it in real life is really, really cool,"" says Imo Bell, astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.

A lunar eclipse happens when Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight and casting a shadow on the Moon's surface.

There are three main types:

People sometimes refer to a lunar eclipse as a ""blood moon"" because of the way the Moon can turn a deep, coppery red during the eclipse.

This is caused by a process known as ""Rayleigh scattering"" which also makes the sky blue and our sunsets red. It scatters more of the shorter blue wavelength light, allowing the longer red wavelength light to remain visible.

During a lunar eclipse, all of the light shining onto the Moon has come through Earth's atmosphere. It's as if every sunrise and sunset in the world is projected onto the lunar surface.

To get the best view of the eclipse, head to a clear, dark location.

""My top tip would be to make sure you have a good view of the western horizon, because the Moon will be in the west and it will be setting towards the western horizon,"" advises Imo Bell of the Royal Observatory.

Another top tip from Imo: it'll be dark so bring a light to help get around, but use a red torch if you can get hold of one. It helps keep your eyes adjusted to the dark. 

Also, of course, check the weather forecast.

""Even though some people might say it's not that unusual to get a lunar eclipse, as we can see one every few years, next time it comes around, it might be cloudy. So, if you can, definitely do get out and try and have a look,"" said Imo.

The next lunar eclipse visible in the UK will be on 7 September 2025.

We've seen a change to colder more unsettled weather and northerly winds over recent days.

A weather front will sink south overnight on Thursday into the early hours of Friday, bringing cloud, rain or hill snow to northern parts of the UK and obscuring the view of the sky for some.

However, there is a chance of the skies being clear enough to view the partial eclipse early on Friday, especially in the north of Northern Ireland and Scotland as well as the south of England and Wales.

By: Carlyn Scott, Science Communications Manager

A brown alga called Sargassum has inundated beaches in the Caribbean since 2011, impacting tourism, harming the
                     health of humans and marine life, and costing local governments millions of dollars
                     per year to clean up.

Scientists have been divided on the causes of the phenomenon known as the Great Atlantic
                     Sargassum Belt (GASB). But a new study published in Nature Communications may have identified what drove a tipping point that established this alga in the
                     tropical Atlantic Ocean.

The key drivers were wind, ocean currents, and nutrients, according to the international
                     team of researchers who published the recent study. Specifically, two consecutive
                     years of a strong negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a shift in atmospheric
                     pressure over the Atlantic that changes circulation and wind patterns, pushed Sargassum
                     into the tropics. There it found warm, nutrient-rich waters, and lots of sunlight,
                     all year-round.

“At first, the evidence is that just a few patches of Sargassum were being pushed
                     south by winds and currents during this NAO period of 2009-2010,” said co-author Frank Muller-Karger, Distinguished University Professor and biological oceanographer at the USF College
                     of Marine Science (CMS). “But these algae patches met the right conditions to grow
                     and perpetuate blooms when they reached the area close to the equator.”

Every year, patches of Sargassum come together in the tropical Atlantic, pushed by
                     the Trade Winds into an area where the ocean is rich in nutrients brought up from
                     deeper waters below, explains Muller-Karger. These Sargassum patches form a new, large
                     population in the region that spans from Africa to the Americas.

Authors of the recent paper in Nature Communications use a computer model that helped them to go into more details and test new scenarios
                     than was possible in a prior study published in Progress in Oceanography. That study first identified the possible influence of the NAO on the dispersal of
                     Sargassum. In both papers, researchers used models to simulate the transport of Sargassum from
                     the northern to the southern part of the North Atlantic, testing if the NAO was the
                     root cause of the first bloom that occurred in the tropical Atlantic in 2011.

“Both models showed that some patches of the Sargassum were swept up by the wind and currents from the Sargasso Sea toward Europe, then moved
                     southward, and from there were injected into the tropical Atlantic. There, this population
                     of algae, now separated from the Sargasso Sea, forms new blooms every year thanks
                     to having enough light, nutrients, and warmer temperatures,” said Muller-Karger.

                           Sargassum coverage and chlorophyll distribution after 2011. Sargassum was moved from
                           the Sargasso Sea to the tropics via currents depicted by arrows. Figure from Jouanno
                           et al. (2025).

These patches enriched with nutrients were identified as a driver of the GASB in a
                     2023 paper published in Nature Communications and co-authored by Chuanmin Hu, professor of physical oceanography at CMS.

Still, the question remained: What provided the nutrients to promote the growth of
                     Sargassum in the tropical Atlantic?   

Popular hypotheses included rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco, Niger, Congo, the
                     Mississippi, or even iron-rich dust from the Sahara Desert. But researchers lacked
                     sufficient data to support any of these theories.

To determine nutrient sources, the group of international researchers again turned
                     to computer models to analyze decades-worth of wind, currents, and three-dimensional
                     nutrient measurements collected in the Atlantic Ocean. These models successfully reproduced
                     the annual blooms.

The model showed that nutrients were supplied via an ocean process known as vertical
                     mixing, in which water masses mix on a seasonal basis due to shifting winds, bringing
                     deeper water that has higher nutrient concentrations to the surface. In this sunlit
                     surface layer photosynthesis occurs and Sargassum grows. This vertical mixing of waters in the tropical Atlantic fuels the massive blooms
                     that eventually ends up on the beaches of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf Coast.

                        Atlantic. The alga was pushed southward and injected into the tropics, where it proliferates
                        today, through a series of currents.  Video from Jouanno et al. (2025). 

“This was a surprising result,” said Muller-Karger. “We had posed the hypothesis before
                     that it is not the rivers that feed the formation of the Sargassum blooms in the tropical
                     Atlantic. This model supports that nutrients from slightly deeper layers in the ocean
                     feed the blooms.”  

Despite the recent and largely negative press Sargassum has received, the seaweed is not new to the Atlantic. Sailors in the 15th century
                     first recorded this Sargassum in the western North Atlantic, which they named the Sargasso Sea. However, the large-scale
                     recurring blooms of Sargassum that flow into the Caribbean every year are a new phenomenon.
                      

Julien Jouanno, lead author of the study and physical oceanographer at the University
                     of Toulouse, emphasized the complex changes in the circulation of the atmosphere and
                     the ocean that led to the transport of Sargassum from the Sargasso Sea to the tropical Atlantic.  

“At this stage, we cannot say for certain whether this abnormal event is a direct
                     result of climate change,” said Jouanno. “There are many moving parts in a computer
                     simulation, and we may still not have good representation of the factors that control
                     Sargassum growth and mortality.”  

Indeed, there are unanswered questions regarding the biology and ecology of Sargassum, and the species present within the GASB remains a mystery. Researchers hope that
                     by investigating the physiology and biology of Sargassum in the Sargasso Sea, they can understand how it might react to environmental changes.

Still, the authors remain hopeful that collaborative efforts can help advance the
                     study of Sargassum.  

“This analysis and the publication highlight the importance of international cooperation
                     in studying and dealing with the ‘Sargassum problem' in the Atlantic,” said Julio Sheinbaum, a physical oceanographer from Center
                     for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CICESE) at Ensenada, Mexico.

This publication was an international collaboration between University of Toulouse, the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education CICESE, Sorbonne University, and the University of South Florida.

                    Researchers use the world's most powerful supercomputers to simulate the inner workings of cellular machinery that restores DNA and prevents deadly diseases

Sunburns and aging skin are obvious effects of exposure to harmful UV rays, tobacco smoke and other carcinogens. But the effects aren't just skin deep. Inside the body, DNA is literally being torn apart.

Understanding how the body heals and protects itself from DNA damage is vital for treating genetic disorders and life-threatening diseases such as cancer. But despite numerous studies and medical advances, much about the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair remains a mystery.

For the past several years, researchers at Georgia State University tapped into the Summit supercomputer at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to study an elaborate molecular pathway called nucleotide excision repair, or NER. NER relies on an array of highly dynamic protein complexes to cut out, or excise, damaged DNA with surgical precision.

In their latest study, published in Nature Communications, the team built a computer model of a critical NER component called the pre-incision complex, or PInC. PInC plays a key role in regulating DNA repair processes in the latter stages of the NER pathway. Decoding NER's sophisticated sequence of events and the role of PInC in the pathway could provide key insights into developing novel treatments and preventing conditions that lead to premature aging and certain types of cancer.

“We're interested in the way cells repair their genetic material,” said lead investigator Ivaylo Ivanov, a chemistry professor at Georgia State University. “NER is a versatile pathway that repairs all kinds of different DNA damage using a three-stage process that relies on delicately balanced molecular machinery. Unfortunately, harmful mutations can develop that interfere with this machinery and cause severe human diseases.”

“Yet, the effects of genetic mutations can be strikingly different depending on their positions within the repair complexes. In some cases, mutations result in patients having UV light sensitivity and an extreme cancer predisposition. In other cases, they cause abnormal development and premature aging,” he said. “Why that happens is not completely understood at the molecular level. That's the mystery our computer modeling efforts aim to unravel.”

The three acts of repair

NER unfolds in three distinct stages: recognition, verification and repair. Each stage requires different groups of proteins to perform specific functions, much like a trauma team has different specialists needed to treat injured patients in the emergency room. In that way, the NER machinery can adapt and change its shape depending on the task at hand.

In the first stage, the NER protein XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum group C) acts like a first responder that locates the site of the damaged DNA, or lesion, and then twists the DNA helix to make the damage accessible. XPC then calls in other repair proteins to help initiate the second stage, called damage verification, or lesion scanning.

Here, the NER protein machinery shifts into its next shape. As XPC steps back, the protein complex called transcription factor IIH, or TFIIH (pronounced T-F-2-H), moves into position. TFIIH further unwinds the section of DNA and scans the newly exposed strand for lesions.

After that, it's in the hands of the surgeon — the PInC — in the third and final stage of repair.

With the “patient” stabilized and prepped for surgery, the operation to remove the damaged DNA strand can begin. Two enzymes, XPF and XPG (xeroderma pigmentosum groups F and G), position themselves precisely on each side of the lesion and act as molecular scissors to cut out the damaged segment of DNA.

Once the lesion is removed, new DNA is synthesized to fill in the gap left behind. Finally, the DNA backbone is sealed, and the damaged DNA is restored back to health.

“What we want to know is how the PInC forms after the lesion scanning phase,” Ivanov said. “How does it control the positioning of the two enzyme subunits that perform the dual incision of the damaged DNA strand? And importantly, is there any cross talk between the two enzymes? Do they sense each other?”

“That matters because once the damaged DNA strand is cleaved, it's vital that the repair process is completed by filling in that gap,” he added. “Otherwise, it will lead to cell death or to the introduction of double-stranded breaks, which are extremely harmful to the cell.”

Answering those questions required the researchers to solve the structure of the PInC. In biology, understanding protein structure is essential for understanding the behavior or function of protein assemblies. The shapes, sizes and interactions of proteins determine how they fit together to form large biomolecular assemblies.

“We integrated the structural model of PInC using data from a variety of biophysical techniques, notably cryo-electron microscopy,” Ivanov said. “But in the end, the computation is what puts everything together.”

Much like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the PInC model had to be assembled from known structures of constituent proteins, and all the individual pieces had to be put together in 3D. However, many of the PInC components had no known experimental structures.

To overcome this challenge, the researchers used a neural network-based model called AlphaFold2 to predict the unknown structures and the interfaces between the proteins that hold PInC together.

Summit's final simulations

“Computationally, once you assemble the PInC, molecular dynamics simulations of the complex become relatively straightforward, especially on large supercomputers like Summit,” Ivanov said.

Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics, or NAMD, is a molecular dynamics code specifically designed for supercomputers and is used to simulate the movements and interactions of large biomolecular systems that contain millions of atoms. Using NAMD, the research team ran extensive simulations. The number-crunching power of the 200-petaflop Summit supercomputer — capable of performing 200,000 trillion calculations per second — was essential in unraveling the functional dynamics of the PInC complex on a timescale of microseconds.

“The simulations showed us a lot about the complex nature of the PInC machinery. It showed us how these different components move together as modules and the subdivision of this complex into dynamic communities, which form the moving parts of this machine,” Ivanov said.

The findings are significant in that mutations in XPF and XPG can lead to severe human genetic disorders. They include xeroderma pigmentosum, which is a condition that makes people more susceptible to skin cancer, and Cockayne syndrome, which can affect human growth and development, lead to impaired hearing and vision, and speed up the aging process.

“Simulations allow us to zero in on these important regions because mutations that interfere with the function of the NER complex often occur at community interfaces, which are the most dynamic regions of the machine,” Ivanov said. “Now we have a much better understanding of how and from where these disorders manifest.”

Most of the molecular dynamics simulations were performed on Summit. However, after 6 years of production, Summit was retired at the end of 2024.

Looking ahead, Ivanov and his team plan to use Summit's successor, Frontier, the exascale-class supercomputer that debuted as the world's most powerful supercomputer when it came online in 2022.

Their work on Frontier will involve examining transcription-coupled NER, which is a DNA repair process that fixes damage in actively transcribed genes to ensure that essential proteins can continue being made.

In addition to Ivanov, the research team includes Jina Yu, Chunli Yan, Tanmoy Paul and Lucas Brewer at Georgia State University; Susan E. Tsutakawa and John A. Tainer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chi-Lin Tsai at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; and Samir M. Hamdan at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.

NATIONAL REPORT — Whether a single store or a large chain, operating expenses are something every convenience store retailer must deal with. Finding ways to streamline operations and increase efficiency can have a huge impact on an operator's bottom line and so, many c-store retailers are turning to technology to accomplish this goal.

""Operating expenses are expensive and one of the biggest is labor, which has become much more expensive since the pandemic,"" said Kay Segal, founding partner at Business Accelerator Team, a convenience retailing consultancy based in Phoenix. ""We need to rethink processes and use technology that can take repetitive actions away, and enhance the guest interaction.""

Technology, both in-store and at the headquarters level, is helping convenience retailers save on labor, monitor equipment, speed up training and onboarding of new employees, and improve customer satisfaction. In many cases, a company's operations and technology departments are coming together to execute plans.

[Read more: Thinking Like a Future-Forward Retailer]

""More and more, I'm hearing about solutions that provide retailers with the ability to take a proactive approach to their operations,"" said Ed Collupy, owner of Collupy System Solutions LLC, which offers consulting services to the industry. ""IoT [Internet of Things] and remote management systems where devices are monitored, such as temperatures and equipment status, or accessed from headquarters, allow retailers to take corrective action sooner rather than later.""

Adding new technology also can remove tasks from staff that are better handled with data, giving store employees and managers more time to interact with customers onsite, according to Ed Burcher, a partner at Business Accelerator Team. One example is automated ordering and replenishment, which he said is more accurate with real-time inventory and sales data.

""This applies to all product lines, including foodservice and ingredients,"" Burcher said. ""IoT, and now AI [artificial intelligence], may seem like overused terms, but they are areas where convenience stores can apply technology, connectivity and data to improve their operations.""

Atlantis Management Group, which has 300 stores, 100 of which are company owned, is focused on giving its store managers more time to interact with shoppers.

""We are looking to get the manager out of the back office and more in the front of the store and forecourt,"" said Rick Rigby, chief technology officer for the Mount Vernon, N.Y.-based company. ""We are using tablets and mobile tools to free them up.""

Customer interaction and satisfaction can be improved by increasing transaction speed as well, using mobile apps for ordering and payment, and self-checkout, according to Burcher.

Additionally, he pointed out that using data ""to gain more insight into shopping behaviors to improve the store and digital experience for the guest"" can improve operations in real-time and provide ongoing feedback to the operator that can be acted upon at the store level.

""Whether you call it improved data analytics or AI, technology can be applied at many touchpoints for the guest and staff to improve the experience,"" Burcher said.

Atlantis Management uses InStore.ai's artificial intelligence audio tool to gather information from customers shopping in its stores and provide feedback to its operations team for areas of improvement, according to Rigby.

""Technology can help with customer service by tracking guest interactions and reviewing transactions for opportunities,"" Burcher noted. ""This involves reviewing actual transactions and providing feedback and dashboards to the staff and store. These reviews can be used not only in a call center environment, but also at the point of purchase in-store.""

With foodservice becoming such an integral part of many convenience store's offering, finding ways to streamline and improve operations in this high-margin category is crucial. C-store retailers still struggle to compete with the integrated technology available to quick-service restaurants that links customer ordering, food preparation, supply chain and more.

""Some retailers are investing in developing their own solutions or starting up integration projects that will unite kitchen management systems with back-office and POS [point-of-sale] systems,"" Collupy explained. ""There is still a lot of work to be done.""

Many c-stores today have automated food ordering through in-store kiosks, screens at the fuel pumps, mobile apps and online ordering. This data, which can be used with other systems, is helping operators forecast demand, create a detailed plan for food prep and get a better handle on inventory replenishment, according to Burcher.

""These systems can not only lead to having the right products available when needed, but also avoid waste by not overproducing,"" he said, noting that companies such as Supplyit offer an integrated solution that takes ""staff preferences out of the equation"" to create a detailed production plan for foodservice team members. ""This helps all facets of preparation and is probably most critical for hot items like breakfast and roller grill where is there is a very short shelf-life.""

Automating reordering and the monitoring of temperatures and equipment for food safety are other ways retailers are utilizing technology to streamline foodservice operations at the store level. Atlantis Management is in the early days of meeting with vendors to leverage foodservice technology such as temperature probes, Rigby shared.

At Kansas City, Mo.-based Fav Trip, which operates five stores, the retailer offers Caribou Coffee and is monitoring the machines to know how much coffee is being sold at what time, as well as for reordering purposes, according to President and CEO Babir Sultan.

""In the world of IoT, every piece of equipment can be connected to analyze usage, cleaning, stock levels, temperature and 'up time,' and report these metrics,"" Burcher said. ""This is being applied to programmable equipment to ensure proper time and temps for heating items and downloading the most up-to-date programs.""

Whether it's automating label printers for hundreds of stores or uploading a new recipe with cook times and temperatures for a new menu item or limited-time offer, automation in foodservice operations is aiding convenience retailers, he added.

Technology is playing a role in other facets of c-store operations, including labor optimization. For instance, Fav Trip streamlined its training process from a 20-page booklet down to three pages, and then eventually shifted to a technology-based approach.

""Now, we have them watch a video with a quiz at the end online, and it has reduced our training time. The feedback on it has been amazing,"" said Sultan, adding that the company tries to connect everything back to data, even its labor decisions. ""We use our internal data to see how many people we should have working at what times.""

Accounting processes are getting a technology overhaul as well. At both the store manager and headquarters level, Atlantis Management is working with its operations team and accounting department to consolidate and optimize forms, and take processes including invoicing and accounts payable from manual to automated, Rigby reported.

""Tools like Microsoft Power Automate and AI-powered Copilot are what we are using,"" he said, adding that these tools are being used also for notetaking, meeting summation, email automation and report writing for both managers and headquarters employees.","{'href': 'https://csnews.com', 'title': 'CSNews Online'}"

IRIS, the global provider of mobile F&B and guest experience platforms for the hospitality sector, today announces it has partnered with Coury Hospitality, the leading hospitality management company, to extend F&B mobile ordering across its portfolio following a 44% year-on-year increase in in-room dining sales.

Currently live in 12 Coury Hospitality-managed hotels, the new partnership agreement will see IRIS deliver the brand standard for F&B mobile dining to all the group's properties worldwide. Built to enable operators to deliver swifter, more efficient order processing, it is a seamless way for guests to order F&B items via their own device, without the need for an additional app.

The agreement follows the successful implementation of the IRIS mobile ordering solution at several Coury Hospitality hotels which has delivered an impressive 44% growth in in-room dining sales over the past year, demonstrating the platform's popularity and adoption.

Mobile ordering has enabled the hotels to capture more guest orders and boost guest spend, mainly driven by the ease of ordering and visibility of additional items and upsells which encourages guests to order more per transaction.

Commenting on the partnership, Nicole Haarklau, Director of F&B Operations, Coury Hospitality said, “The response from both guests and staff since we first introduced the IRIS F&B Ordering solution has been overwhelmingly positive. Delivery times have been reduced, and the growth in order volumes, revenue and guest satisfaction is testament to its accessibility and performance.

“Indeed, the number of orders made via mobile now significantly exceeds those made over the phone as guests have been swift to engage at an encouraging rate. The added convenience and time saved have really added to its appeal.

“As guests increasingly turn to mobile ordering it is vital that we partner with a provider that has the knowledge and capability to deliver a solution that enables us to meet this demand and critically, grow with us as we look to expand our portfolio in the future. The IRIS team have proven to be a valuable, dynamic ally with integrations across both our PMS and POS systems which has meant deployment and adoption by staff has been straightforward. We look forward to extending the partnership as they deliver the brand standard for mobile ordering across our portfolio in the future. “

Graham Rushin, VP Sales and Marketing at IRIS added, “Guest demand for mobile dining is accelerating at an unprecedented rate and the growth in digital order volumes and revenue speak for themselves. Across our portfolio we are continuing to invest in the development of solutions that enhance both the guest and staff experience so that ordering is seamless and hoteliers are equipped to realise their full revenue potential.

“Coury Hospitality has undergone an incredible period of growth and we look forward to continuing to work with the team to support and drive forward their plans for the future, delivering a brand standard for mobile ordering that will continue to exceed expectations across its portfolio.”

In Coury Hospitality-managed hotels, IRIS mobile in-room dining is accessible to guests via a QR code situated in strategic locations within guest rooms. The direct integration to the hotel's POS enables orders to be digitally delivered directly to the kitchens, reducing guest wait times and eliminating errors. Likewise, guests benefit from a more readily available menu to view, order and pay at their convenience.

Saildrone announced a partnership with Palantir Technologies to enable the scaling of autonomous systems to deliver maritime AI solutions in an era of mounting global threats and critically constrained shipbuilding capacity.

Saildrone operates the world's largest fleet of operationally deployed USVs, providing maritime domain awareness to the U.S. Navy, Department of Homeland Security, and international allies. The autonomous vehicles utilize edge-computing AI/ML algorithms to monitor activities both above and below the sea surface, detecting threats including narcotics trafficking, illegal fishing operations, and adversary submarines.

With a decade of operations and nearly two million nautical miles sailed globally, Saildrone has amassed a comprehensive dataset of maritime intelligence at the sea surface. Palantir's AI capabilities will fuse this proprietary dataset with other external sources, delivering insights for maritime intelligence, surveillance, and targeting applications.

A project on a subsea power cable to link continental Europe to the East Mediterranean will materialize, Greek foreign minister said on Thursday after meeting his Israeli and Cypriot counterparts.

Media reports earlier this week suggested that the project had stalled over territorial differences.

Greek power grid operator IPTO ADMr.AT is building the Great Sea Interconnector (GSI) cable, which will link transmission networks of Europe to Cyprus. It will later stretch to Israel through the Mediterranean Sea.

The topic of nuclear energy continues to be a hot-button item in Eagle Mountain.

The city is exploring the idea of integrating small modular reactors, or SMRs, among other forms of advanced power generation facilities within the city.

In January, the Eagle Mountain City Council halted on voting in favor or against a code amendment to the city's Regional Technology and Industry overlay zone.

The code change, according to city officials, could open the door in facilitating the use of a variety of energy options in the city, including battery energy storage systems, solar energy projects, electrical substations, power lines and small modular reactors.

However, Eagle Mountain city leaders wanted to allow more time to gather information about nuclear technology.

On Monday, the city hosted an energy town hall at Cedar Valley High School, featuring a panel of energy experts with an abundance of experience in the field.

Expertise among the six panelists include coal, renewable and battery storage, biofuels, oil shale, nuclear power, hydrogen and advanced combustion.

Mayor Tom Westmoreland moderated the discussion and presented a slew of questions from community members to the panel.

“We're not going to solve any problems tonight, but we're going to begin the discussion,” Westmoreland said during the town hall. “Definitely the place to start is by informing and educating ourselves and learning all that we can about energy so that we can make good decisions going forward.”

City leaders note the exploration of SMRs comes as Eagle Mountain examines sustainable and long-term energy solutions to meet the growing needs of its population and business landscape.

Matthew Memmott, an associate professor in chemical engineering at Brigham Young University, said nuclear technology such as SMRs are making headway but often face opposition from the public due to the perception regarding radiation.

“In reality, the world is awash with radiation, and if we can't handle even the slightest bit of radiation, we should not be living on the planet,” Memmott said.

Panelists noted the need for a modernized power grid with a capacity to meet the future energy demands that Eagle Mountain anticipates.

With safety being top of mind for many who are skeptical of allowing such technology to enter the area, due to the smaller footprint of modern SMRs, only the boundaries of the nuclear site would be required to evacuate.

“So for large (nuclear) plants, they actually plan the escape for how traffic has to move; that is done out to 10 miles,” said Jess Gehin, associate laboratory director at Idaho National Laboratory. “For modern SMRs, that is reduced down to the site boundary.”

Panelists also discussed regulatory frameworks, economic considerations associated with these energy solutions and potential health risks.

Eagle Mountain officials say nuclear energy, particularly through the deployment of nonwater cooled SMRs, is being considered for its potential to provide a stable and low-carbon power supply.

Currently, the city has not authorized any nuclear energy projects, but they aren't ruling it out for the future.

As Eagle Mountain continues to weigh the option, leaders encourage citizens to get involved in the decision-making process by attending public meetings and connecting with elected officials.

The City Council's next meeting will be held Tuesday at Eagle Mountain city hall, located at 1650 Stagecoach Run.

The full video from Monday's nearly two-hour long town hall can be viewed online at eaglemountain.gov.

India's Apollo Hospitals Bets on AI to Tackle Staff Workload

By Rishika Sadam

HYDERABAD (Reuters) -India's Apollo Hospitals will invest more in artificial intelligence tools to ease the workload for its doctors and nurses by automating routine tasks, including medical documentation, a top executive told Reuters.

Indian hospitals, which grapple with overworked doctors and nurses handling heavy patient loads, are increasingly using AI to boost diagnostic accuracy, predict patients' risk of complications, improve precision in robotic surgeries, provide virtual medical care, and streamline hospital operations.

Apollo, which has more than 10,000 beds across its hospital network, making it one of the largest in the country, set aside 3.5% of its digital spend on AI over the past two years and plans to increase it this year, Joint Managing Director Sangita Reddy said, without providing further details.

""Our aim is to free up two to three hours of time daily for doctors and nurses with AI interventions,"" Reddy said in an interview last month.

Apollo's AI tools, some of which are experimental and still in the initial stages, will analyse patients' electronic medical records to suggest diagnoses, tests and treatment. They will help transcribe doctors' observations, generate faster discharge summaries and create daily schedules out of nurses' notes.

The Chennai-based hospital chain is also working on an AI tool that will help clinicians prescribe the most effective antibiotic suitable to treat the illness.

Apollo, which aims to expand bed capacity by one-third in four years, will direct a part of the revenue from the additions towards boosting AI use without burdening costs, Reddy said.

The hospital hopes that the use of such AI tools will help lower nurses' workload as it tackles a 25% attrition rate among nurses, which it expects to increase to 30% by the end of fiscal 2025.

Other Indian hospitals such as Fortis Healthcare, Tata Memorial Hospital, Manipal Hospitals, Narayana Health, Max Healthcare, Medanta and Aster DM Healthcare have also invested in AI-powered tools.

But challenges such as high technology costs, diverse data sources and formats, limited availability of electronic medical records and profitability concerns have made it difficult for them to accelerate AI adoption, according to Joydeep Ghosh, a partner at Deloitte India.

Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.

It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.

Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported – up from zero previously.

She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.

""I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,"" she says. ""I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.""

The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.

Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.

The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.

But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.

Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher. 

""US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,"" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.

""It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.""

Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (£112bn) in 2023, according to official data.

Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.

While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise. 

At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.

""Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,"" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.

""But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.""

Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the ""the vast majority"" of the new tariffs will ""probably be passed on to the consumer"" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.

In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.

Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. ""There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.

""The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.""

During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.

Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.

Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.  

For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute. 

He plans to impose ""reciprocal tariffs"" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.  

There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.

Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.

She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can ""pivot"" again.

""That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.""  

The tariffs imposed by Donald Trump could not come at a worse time, says the steel industry body.

Wine and spirits will be taxed, Trump says, if the EU does not remove tariffs on US whiskey.

The Irish Whiskey Association urged the US and EU to engage in dialogue amidst an escalating trade war.

Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists fear they could spark a trade war.

The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly increased the volume of work that can be accomplished, leading to a substantial reduction in cost per transaction or unit of work. This decrease is estimated to be between 25-30%, Madhusudan Hegde, EVP & BPS Business Unit Head at Coforge BPS (business process solutions) told FE.

Furter, Coforge is actively shifting towards an outcome-based model, which moves beyond traditional task automation to complete case resolution. This transition is driven by AI, which enhances business outcomes beyond the conventional cost reduction of 30-40%.

Hegde said: “The shift from task automation to case resolution is due to AI – which enables us to deliver business outcomes. It's not just about 30-40% reduction in costs; efficiency is a given, but it's about business effectiveness and experience.”

Coforge is also leveraging agentic AI (artificial intelligence) and building its technology stack on specialised small language models (SLMs). This approach enables deeper domain-specific solutions tailored to individual clients.

“Deep domain is necessary to differentiate and build client-specific solutions. With our approach as an AI-first firm, we have been able to penetrate newer verticals like healthcare and retail beyond our banking, insurance, and travel sectors,” Hegde explained.

This transition is also expected to redefine the BPS industry by moving away from traditional automation methods towards AI-driven processes that enhance efficiency and productivity. 

“We see AI not just as freeing up human capacity; we see it as a capacity enabler. And actually it takes the average up for our people. So we become a performance enhancer,” he said.

Traditionally, revenue growth in the BPS sector was directly proportional to headcount growth. However, AI has broken this linear relationship, allowing firms to scale operations without an equivalent increase in workforce size.

“I see AI giving—this is the whole point where I think non-linearity of revenue with headcount is the future. I think human beings are still going to be important. It is about capability enhancement and driving performance. But I think that the curve has been broken,” Hegde said.

Additionally, the company is also actively expanding its Global Capability Centres (GCCs). “We've actually set up GCC for a large firm in Hyderabad, maybe scaled to about 500 people in less than three months. The plan is to get them to about a thousand more in the next few months from the standpoint,” Hegde said.

Power will be shut down to the entire campus in Lubbock, Texas, while repairs are underway, said Caitlynn Jeffries, a spokesperson for the university's police department.

“You can go ahead and go home for Spring break. We are closing school down for the next couple days,” Jeffries said.

The school also instructed faculty and staff to work remotely if possible until further notice.

Police have issued a warning to all phone users over a simple text that could put you in danger - no matter how legitimate it might look. 

Another day, another scam warning. It seems like determined criminals always have a new trick up their sleeve to trick innocent victims, so authorities took to Facebook this week to urge members of the public to remain vigilant.

This particular warning came from Hampden County Sheriff's Office in Massachusetts, though similar scams have been reported elsewhere in the US.

Advert

It all starts with a simple text from a number that's not in your phone contacts, and it explains that you're being contacted in relation to an ongoing investigation.

The text claims that the sender has repeatedly attempted to make contact, reading: ""This call is to notify [you] that this is our second attempt to be made to serve you a notice of action pertaining to an investigation being finalized against you.""

The text then goes on to encourage the recipient to call back for 'further details on the case or to change its active service status'.

Advert

""Please reference case number 1112525814,"" one example of the text reads, adding: ""Failure to contact them immediately will result in further legal action against you.""

Sheriff Nick Cocchi, of the Hampden County Sheriff's Office, issued a warning alongside a screenshot of the text on Facebook, telling the public that if they receive a similar text, they shouldn't trust it.

The post explained: ""Criminals are sending alarming messages, claiming the recipient is under investigation and demanding a call back to avoid ""legal action."" These scammers may also include fake case numbers and links that could install malware.""

Cocchi said the alarming nature of the text was all part of the scam, as he continued: ""These scammers want to scare people into acting before thinking. Law enforcement will never call, text, or email to demand money, resolve a warrant, or conduct official business. If you receive a message like this, do not engage—delete it and report it.""

Advert

The post added that even if the ID attached to the text might appear to be from a 'legitimate agency', it's likely that the scammer actually faked the ID using online services.

""The Hampden County Sheriff's Office will never request payment or personal information over the phone, via text, or online,"" the post added. ""Please share this warning with your family and friends, especially those who may be more vulnerable to scams. Stay safe!""

The warning from Cocchi comes as residents in North Carolina have been experiencing scam texts which claim recipients owe money on an outstanding toll.

Advert

The scam texts claim to be from E-ZPass, EZDriveMA, and FasTrak, ABC 11 reports, with some warning that if you don't pay the toll within 12 hours, the charges will increase and you'll be turned into The Registry of Motor Vehicles.

Steve Grobman, of the security company McAfee, told the outlet: ""We need to recognize that what scammers do is they focus on things that scare people and create a sense of urgency.""

Experts have warned that you should never click links sent in messages that could be from a scammer, and instead do your own research into whether the claims could be legitimate.

Microsoft pulled back on its internal effort to develop AI raising a red flag for the FTC

The US Federal Trade Commission is moving ahead with a sprawling antitrust probe of Microsoft that was opened in the waning days of the Biden Administration, signaling that Donald Trump's new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants.

FTC staff in recent weeks have continued to work on the investigation, meeting with companies and other groups to gather information, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential investigation.

The FTC sent Microsoft a so-called civil investigative demand, which is similar to a subpoena, late last year. The document, a copy of which was viewed by Bloomberg, compels the company to turn over reams of data about its AI operations, including the cost to train models and obtain data, going as far back as 2016. The agency sought details about Microsoft's data centers, its struggles to find enough computing power to meet customer demand and the company's software licensing practices.

The FTC is also scrutinising Microsoft's decision to slash funding on its own artificial intelligence projects after striking a deal with OpenAI, which could be perceived as hurting competition in the burgeoning AI market.

One company has heard regularly from the FTC on the issue of Microsoft's licensing practices since the investigative demand was sent, said one of the people. The FTC and lawyers for that company have discussed what information the agency could ask for in a more comprehensive, formal request. The company also received a shorter list of questions several weeks ago asking for documents the company provided to other regulators. The FTC is further seeking information about licensing rule changes Microsoft said will go into effect later this year, the person said.

The agency said in the information demand that it wants to determine whether Microsoft's profits from other parts of the business give it an edge over other AI companies. The agency also said it wants details about Microsoft's data center capacity constraints to better understand the costs behind cloud-computing services. Those details will help the agency determine whether to bring a case.

Since receiving the FTC demand, Microsoft may have sought to narrow the scope of the information it's being asked to turn over — a typical move by companies being probed by the agency. Such wide-ranging antitrust investigations can take years and don't always result in the agency bringing a case.

“We are working cooperatively with the agency,” said Alex Haurek, a Microsoft spokesman. The FTC didn't respond to a request for comment.

The evolution of the probe now rests in the hands of Ferguson and his new head of competition, Daniel Guarnera, who joined the agency from the Justice Department, where he worked on antitrust cases targeting Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Apple Inc. 

In his first public remarks since taking the chair position in late February, Ferguson said investigating the tech sector is his highest priority. Early moves include seeking information on censorship by tech companies.

Ferguson also backed a filing in January in support of billionaire Elon Musk, who sued to derail OpenAI's plans to restructure as a more conventional for-profit business. 

The civil investigative demand was crafted by FTC staff and personally signed off on by former Chair Lina Khan after the agency spent more than a year conducting informal interviews with Microsoft competitors and business partners, Bloomberg previously reported. 

Ferguson's FTC has inherited several other cases against big tech companies from Khan, including lawsuits against Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. On Wednesday, the agency asked a judge to delay a trial challenging Amazon's Prime subscription practices, citing resource constraints at the agency. The FTC quickly walked back comments that resource constraints at the agency will hamper its ability to start a trial in September.

A separate antitrust case against Amazon's retail business is set to go to trial in October 2026.

Intel on Wednesday named former board member and chip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its CEO and signaled the struggling but storied chipmaker was unlikely to split up its chip-design and manufacturing operations. The appointment, effective March 18, comes three months after Intel ousted CEO and company veteran Pat Gelsinger, whose costly and ambitious plan to turn the company around was faltering and sapping investor confidence. Tan, a former Intel board member, had been seen as a CEO contender thanks to his deep experience in the chip industry as well as a longtime technology investor in promising startups. He was approached by Intel's board in December to gauge his interest in taking up the job, Reuters had reported.

“Together, we will work hard to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before,” Tan said in a letter to Intel employees on Wednesday.

Intel shares surged 12% in extended trading on Wednesday, and analysts welcomed the move that they said was likely to bring some stability to the chipmaker. The company's stock had declined 60% in 2024.

Intel is undergoing a historic transition as it attempts to emerge from one of its bleakest periods.

While struggling to cash in on a boom in investment in advanced AI chips that has fired up the fortunes of market leader Nvidia and other chipmakers, the company is spending heavily to become a contract manufacturer of chips for other companies, leading some investors to worry about pressure on its cash flows.

Media reports in the past two months said chip rivals including Broadcom were evaluating Intel's chip design and marketing business, while TSMC has separately studied controlling some or all of Intel's chip plants, potentially as part of an investor consortium or other structure. Reuters reported on Tuesday that TSMC had approached some of Intel's biggest potential manufacturing customers about forming a joint venture to operate Intel's factories, after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC to help turn around the troubled chipmaker.

“This (Tan's appointment) is welcome news,” said Jack E. Gold, analyst and president of J. Gold Associates, which covers the chip industry.

Tan has an “intrinsic understanding of the semiconductor industry, both from a product design aspect as well as the needs of enabling chip manufacturing – an area that Intel Foundry needs help in making their tools more user-friendly and accessible for potential customers,” he said.

Gold and other analysts agreed that Tan's messaging looked like he wanted to keep the company together, though they said any transformation of the chipmaker would take years and require investors to be patient.

“Intel is a company I have long admired,” Tan said in his letter on Wednesday, expressing confidence in turning the business around.

Tan, 65, is a Malaysian-born executive who grew up in Singapore and holds degrees in physics, nuclear engineering and business administration.

He served as CEO of Intel supplier and chip-design software Cadence Design Systems from 2009 to 2021. During his term, the company's revenue and stock surged.

Tan left Intel's board last year over disagreements on how to turn around the company. He grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, Reuters previously reported.

Tan will rejoin the board, Intel said.

Tan “brings stability and experience to a role that needs someone of his caliber, which is why I believe the company will likely stay the course with his appointment and continue to develop foundry and product,” said Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.

Tan's appointment comes as Trump pushes for more manufacturing in the country, threatening tariffs on imports that have roiled global markets for weeks.

While Trump has made no direct comment about Intel publicly, he has said that Asian countries including Taiwan have snatched away the United States' edge in chipmaking. Earlier this month, Intel rival TSMC said at a press event with Trump that it plans to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the U.S. that involves building five additional chip facilities. Trump, though, is trying to kill a 2022 bipartisan law to give $52.7 billion in subsidies for chips, under which Intel has received grants.

The Financial Express



With Vodafone Idea's active subscriber loss moderating and net addition of data subscribers in December 2024, the struggling telco is likely to retain subscriber market share more effectively, according to analysts.

The telco, which is gearing up for commercial 5G launch this quarter, added 1.6 million data customers in December against a decline of 0.7 million users in the previous month, according to monthly subscription data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) earlier this week.

In the same month, rivals Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio saw flat movement in data subscriber base, which analysts said suggests normalisation of respective user base.

During its December quarter earnings call, Vodafone Idea chief executive Akshaya Moondra had noted that the telco is seeing momentum in data subscriber addition as its expands and upgrades it 4G network, and prepares to launch its 5G services.

Over the past few months, the telco has been activating 5G sites in a phased manner across key circles like Mumbai in the lead up to commercial 5G launch this month starting with Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi, followed by other priority circles.

Challenges for the cash-strapped telco, however, remain as it continued to see decline in active user base in keeping with the trend seen over the past several months. The telco lost 0.4 million active users in December as compared to 1.9 million the month before indicating moderation in active subscriber loss.

“Moderation in VIL's active subscriber loss and improvement in data subscriber addition in December may lead to a slower pace of market share accretion for Bharti and Jio in the future,” analysts from brokerage firm Jefferies said in a report.

Jio's market share rose to 40.42% in December (November: 40.15%) while Airtel was at 33.49% (November: 33.45%). Vodafone Idea's subscriber market share further shrunk month-on-month to 18.01% (November: 18.19%).

While Jio and Vodafone Idea lost active subcribers, Airtel saw net addition (+1.7 million vs. – 3 million in November), analysts from Morgan Stanley said in their report. Airtel's active subscriber gains were driven by net additions in circle A (2 million).

As a result, Airtel's share of active subscriber was up 36% (+17 basis points) while Jio and Vodafone Idea lost share at 42% (-14 basis points) and 16.6% (-3 basis points) respectively.

Overall, the telecom sector saw slowdown in active subscriber loss, suggesting moderation in volatility and SIM consolidation in the sector post the tariff hikes undertaken in last July analysts noted.

According to data released by the sector regulator, active subscribers base, accounted for 92.15% of the total wireless subscribers and subscriber base fell 0.29 million in December to 1.06 billion.

Experts also said that while the majority of the impact on telco subscriber base due to July 2024 tariff hikes has been absorbed, some volatility still remains.

“The sector's active subscribers moderated in December suggesting cool-off in volatility and sim consolidation in the sector post the tariff hikes undertaken in July 2024. (But) data subscriber base was flat month on month in December 2024, post a sharp jump in November 2024, suggesting some sim-consolidation,” Jefferies analysts said.

Overall, the mobile subscribers base rose by 2.01 million to 1.15 billion in December, according to data released by Trai. Growth was led the urban markets which saw 2.75 million subscriber addition while rural subscriber base shrunk by 740, 000.

Tata Technologies Ltd, a subsidiary of Tata Motors encountered a ransomware attack earlier this year that affected the company's network and forced it to suspend some of its services. Now, TechCrunch has reported that a ransomware group that goes by the name Hunters International has published what it claims to be data stolen from the Pune headquartered company.

According to TechCrunch, who claims to have seen the data published on the gang's dark web leak site said it includes personal details about current and former employees along with some confidential information like purchase orders and some contracts with customers in India and the United States.

The leaked data, which amounts to about 1.4TB in size includes more than 7,30,000 documents like Excel spreadsheets, PDF files and PowerPoint presentations. However, it is still unclear if the data shared by the Hunters International group is in any way related to the recent ransomware attack.

In a filing with the Indian stock exchanges, Tata Technologies had said that an investigation was underway “in consultation with experts to assess the root cause and take remedial action as necessary.”

For those unfamiliar, Hunters International is a relatively new ransomware-as-a-service group that offers its infrastructure to hackers and takes a cut of the ransom payments. It is also affiliated with the Hive gang, which may have previously leaked stolen data from Tata Power back in 2022.

Founded in 1989 as an automotive unit of Tata Motors, Tata Technologies focuses on automotive design, aerospace engineering and research and development and has an annual revenue of $600 million, operating in more than 18 locations in India, Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America.

Kim Kardashian alleged ex-husband Kris Humphries forced her to give up the 18-carat engagement ring that she paid for as part of their 2013 divorce settlement.

Kim Kardashian is not keeping up with her engagement ring from ex Kris Humphries anymore.

The reality star got candid on her short-lived marriage to the former NBA player, alleging that she ""had to"" surrender her 18-carat emerald-cut diamond ring as part of their 2013 divorce settlement.

""I didn't keep that,"" Kim shared during the March 13 episode of The Kardashians, explaining how she was still legally married to Kris—whom she split from in October 2011 after 72 days of marriage—when she became pregnant with her and Kanye West's oldest daughter North West. ""In order to divorce him, he said I had to give him the ring.""

The 44-year-old went on to allege that she paid for the ring, while Kris ""contributed a fifth"" of its cost during their relationship.

Although Lorraine Schwartz—who designed the ring—told Kim that she had made the ""best"" decision at the time, the SKIMS founder admitted she still had some lingering ire over the ordeal. As she noted, ""I would've loved a collection.""

So, where's the ring now? Kris ended up auctioning it off for $749,000 after settling his divorce with Kim.

""The ring is indeed Kris' property that he received through his marriage dissolution,"" his rep told E! News in 2013, adding in a separate statement that the Boston Celtics alum was ""very pleased with the final result"" of the auction.

Still, Kim has accumulated several significant jewelry pieces over the years. Her 14-carat cushion-cut engagement ring from first husband Damon Thomas actually belonged to mom Kris Jenner, while she kept a 15-carat ring from Kanye in the couple's 2022 divorce settlement.

""My first one that I got engaged with Kanye was a cushion-cut,"" Kim said, noting that the ring was the ""only piece of jewelry"" she didn't have with her when she was robbed at a Paris hotel in 2016. 

While her second engagement ring from Kanye—which featured a 20-carat emerald-cut diamond—was stolen during the harrowing robbery, Kim said the ""original ring that I got proposed to"" was the ""most important"" piece.

She added, ""That one I'm gonna give to Northie because she was with me when I got engaged.""

The model showed off her huge diamond ring on her Instagram Story following her engagement to longtime boyfriend Josh Kushner. The ring is estimated to cost between $200,000 and $500,000. The two tied the knot months after getting engaged in 2018.

The former Disney Channel star's beau Josh Dun proposed to her with this massive diamond engagement ring in New Zealand on Dec. 23, 2018. They marked the beginning of 2020 with a New Year's Eve wedding.

Three weeks after David Foster got down on one knee on an Italian mountaintop in 2018, the Smash actress shared a photo of her new bling on Instagram. The star lost her father soon after the engagement and wrote in the bittersweet post, ""My love wisely said to me the other day that 'death is the only thing that is 100 percent inevitable and the thing we are least prepared for.' So today we're celebrating life and not forgetting love."" Foster and McPhee became husband and wife in 2019. 

The model posted a selfie with her diamond sparkler and gold engagement band in July 2018. The model married Sebastian Bear-McClard in a secret NYC courthouse ceremony in February of that year. However, they broke up in 2022. 

Dancing with the Stars alum James Hinchcliffe got down on one knee for his Total Frat Movie sweetheart on July 23, 2018. The My Babysitter's a Vampire star posted a pic of the bling on Instagram joking, ""Just got served a life sentence #BeckyGetsHinched.""

On the ""No Excuses"" singer's 24th birthday, Spy Kids star Daryl Sabara proposed with a round diamond set on a diamond band that the two had previously picked out together. Trainor posted a video of the surreal proposal on Instagram writing, ""He proposed to me under a tunnel of beautiful Christmas lights and surprised me with my family and friends. I'm still in shock. I've never been this happy!"" They tied the knot in 2018.

Originally appeared on E! Online

Give your heart a break — Demi Lovato is doing just fine.

The “Cool for the Summer” singer traded the recording studio for the kitchen to give fans a cooking tutorial on TikTok, but not everyone seemed to focus on the demonstration.

“Today we are making a whole roasted chicken,” Lovato said in the video shared on the social media platform March 11. “It seems really overwhelming, but it's not. We're gonna have fun … and I'm telling myself this because I feel overwhelmed.”

While the pop star kept things playful as she prepared her ingredients and seasoned the raw meat, some fans expressed concern that she appeared to have an unsteady hand at times, including one user who commented, “I'm afraid of seeing her shaking that hard.”

But Lovato, 32, quickly put the speculation to rest by reassuring viewers that all was well, writing back in response, “I'm okay! I promise.”

The ""Sonny With a Chance"" alum has been open in the past about her mental health and battle with addiction dating back to her teenage years. In fact, she recently shared that she has little recollection of her life after the release of the 2008 Disney Channel movie ""Camp Rock,"" in which she costarred alongside the Jonas Brothers.

“I think I'd passed the threshold of what I could withstand emotionally and physically,"" she told The Hollywood Reporter in August. “I didn't realize that child stardom could be traumatic — and it isn't traumatic for everyone, but for me, it was.”

Lovato went on to describe her “worry” over how she treated those around her amid her struggles.

“It's easy to excuse that behavior because I was so young and in so much pain,” she continued, “but I'm really remorseful, and that's a guilt that stays with you forever.”

Fortunately, the singer appears to have found happiness with fiancé Jordan “Jutes” Lutes, to whom she got engaged in 2023 after over a year of dating. While the couple haven't publicly shared their wedding plans, they recently commemorated their engagement anniversary ahead of their walk down the aisle.

“1 year of being engaged to my favorite person,” Jutes wrote in a post on Instagram Stories in December, which Lovato reposted, adding, “I love you infinitely and cannot wait to call you my husband!!! Happy 1 year of being engaged baby!!”

Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande star in “Wicked.”


The Cinema Series at the 1891 Fredonia Opera House Performing Arts Center resumes after the theatre had been closed for six weeks to allow for the replacement of seats, with screenings of the hit musical film “Wicked” on Saturday and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. The film was nominated for 10 Oscars including Best Picture. 

In “Wicked,” Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), misunderstood because of her unusual green skin, has yet to discover her true power. Glinda (Ariana Grande) is a popular young woman, gilded by privilege and ambition, who has yet to discover her true heart. The two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely friendship. 

Following an encounter with the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, has unexpected and shocking consequences. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West.  

Newsday calls the film “percolating and popping with energy, it's just about everything a movie musical should be.”  Baltimore Magazine calls it “a wickedly good time at the movies.”  The Wall Street Journal calls it “the most entertaining film of the year and the most dazzling live-action Hollywood musical since ‘Chicago.' To put it in the kind of lingo used in Oz, I pronuncify it magnifical.”  Rated PG for some scary action, thematic material and brief suggestive material, “Wicked” runs two hours, 40 minutes.  

Tickets are available at the door for $7 (adults), $6.50 (seniors & Opera House members) and $5 (students) the night of each screening.  The Opera House is equipped with assistive listening headsets for the hearing-impaired.  Simply request one from any usher or staff member.  The Opera House Cinema Series is generously sponsored by Lake Shore Savings Bank.    

The 1891 Fredonia Opera House Performing Arts Center is a member-supported not-for-profit performing arts center with a mission to “present the performing arts for the benefit of our community and region … providing access to artistic diversity … and high-quality programming at an affordable price.”  It is located in Village Hall in downtown Fredonia.

As a father of five, Don Johnson is always looking for ways to guide his children. 

During an appearance on ""Good Morning America"" this week, the 75-year-old veteran actor, who is promoting his new Hulu show ""Doctor Odyssey,"" opened up about his thoughts on some of his kids following in his footsteps. 

""I warned them against it. I said, ‘This is not for you,'"" Johnson said, before telling the hosts of the Johnson family rule.

DON JOHNSON SAYS THREE THINGS ARE 'KEY' TO HIS LONG-LASTING MARRIAGE

""When Dakota [Johnson] was graduating from high school … we have a rule in the family,"" he continued. ""The rule is that if you don't go on to college and get a job, you're off the family payroll.

""Out of high school, I went to Dakota and said, ‘Do you want to go visit some colleges?' And she said, ‘I'm not going to college.' I said, ‘Oh, that's interesting. How are you going to look after yourself?' She said, ‘Don't you worry about it. I'm going to be an actress.'

""Three months later, she had that part in ‘The Social Network' and hasn't looked back,"" he added.

‘MIAMI VICE'S' DON JOHNSON'S SECRET TO A YOUTHFUL 74 IS BEING HAPPILY MARRIED: ‘A BAD MARRIAGE WILL AGE YOU'

The distinguished actor who found mega success as James ""Sonny"" Crockett in the 1980s TV series ""Miami Vice,"" has been married to wife Kelley Phleger since 1999. The couple share three children: Atherton Grace, Jasper and Deacon. He is also father to son Jesse Wayne Johnson from his relationship with Patti D'Arbanville and Dakota Johnson from his marriage to Melanie Griffith.

Before finding fame, the Golden Globe Award winner once recalled being down on his luck at the beginning of his career. 

Johnson told The Wall Street Journal in 2024 he ""spent years living below the poverty line"" and admitted he went for years getting ""cast in a lot of forgettable roles, including five unsuccessful TV pilots,"" before landing his role in ""Miami Vice.""

""I couldn't believe somebody had seemingly been jotting down my thoughts, feelings and emotions. The part was meant for me,"" he recalled. ""The audition went well, so well that I was convinced it was a sure thing.""

Johnson went on to star in the popular show for five seasons and received an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Det. James Crockett.

That same year, Johnson reflected on the ups and downs of fame during his career-making success on ""Miami Vice.""

""For a long time, I couldn't even go anywhere,"" he told People magazine. ""I had to isolate. The [women] know where you are. We had security 24/7.

""One day, I reflected on Elvis [Presley] and thought, ‘Isn't this kind of the way Elvis lived and died?' Not that I'm comparing myself to Elvis, but in terms of him not being able to have a personal life. So, I learned to manage it and vowed not to let it imprison me,"" Johnson said. 

On a personal level, however, Johnson said he has found the key to a successful marriage. 

""Marry right,"" he told People. ""A bad marriage will age you.""

In 2023, he revealed the relationship advice he once received from Bob Dylan. 

""Obviously, [Kelley]'s a saint. I was with Bob Dylan one time, and I was having relationship issues. And Bob looks up at me and goes, ‘Well, see, love is about kindness, trust and respect, isn't it?' And that's the embodiment of Kelley,"" Johnson told Parade about what makes Phleger perfect for him. 

""It's kindness, trust and respect, and we have that with each other. We're lovers and friends, and it's fun. She's an amazing woman.""

Along the way, Johnson has found the good in Hollywood in that he's cultivated a lot of strong relationships throughout the years, including his friendship with Bruce Willis. 

During his appearance on ""Good Morning America"" this week, Johnson recalled the moment he first met Willis while the ""Die Hard"" star was tending bar in New York City. 

""I'd go in there and sit with Bruce. ... Bruce was such a good storyteller, and he'd tell me about all the trials and tribulations of dealing with the drunks and the actors. ... And, you know, I got to be friendly with him,"" Johnson recalled. ""I said, 'You know what? You'd be awesome.'

Don Johnson said he discovered good friend Bruce Willis in a New York City bar.  (Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)

""So, I called the casting director … and I said, ‘This guy is interesting. He's special. Bring him in and read him.' She did and cast him in ‘Miami Vice' before he was ever in anything else.""

Johnson said he knew from the beginning Willis was special, saying, ""I could just tell.""

During an interview with Entertainment Tonight in February, Johnson briefly touched on Willis' health. 

""We're best of friends, and he's having a little bit of a struggle right now,"" he said of Willis, who was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2022. ""I take this moment to send him love.""

Justin Bieber is getting candid about the self-doubt that he often experiences following rumors about drug use and his mental health.

The 31-year-old pop star took to his Instagram Story on Thursday, March 13, to share a post detailing how he often feels undeserving of the success and praise he has received throughout the years despite being a megastar.

""People told me my whole life 'Wow Justin you deserve that' and I personally have always felt unworthy...Like I was a fraud,"" he wrote.

The ""Lonley"" singer admitted to being critical of others and feeling like he is deceiving them, writing, ""Like when people told me I deserve something it made me feel sneaky like...Damn if they only knew my thoughts... How judgemental I am, how selfish I really am...They wouldn't be saying this.""

The two-time Grammy Award-winning artist said he shared his inner thoughts to let people know they are not alone.

""I say all this to say. If you feel sneaky welcome to the club,"" he penned. ""I definitely feel unequipped and unqualified most days.""

The candid post comes following accusations from fans that the singer-songwriter was unwell and using hard drugs because of how he was presenting himself in public in February. However, Bieber's rep spoke to TMZ last month and vehemently denied these rumors.

His rep remarked that these rumors are ""exhausting and pitiful"" and show ""people are committed to keeping negative, salacious, harmful narratives alive"" despite the ""obvious truth.""

The former teen idol's rep told the outlet that he is focused on being a dad and making music, noting that 2024 was ""very transformative for him as he ended several close friendships and business relationships that no longer served him.""

The ""Peaches"" singer welcomed his first child, Jack Blues Bieber, with his wife, Hailey Bieber, in August 2024. Justin and the Rhode beauty founder tied the knot in 2018 and have shared small glimpses into their life on social media.

Mostly cloudy skies; remaining dry. .
                                

Partly to mostly cloudy overnight; there is a total lunar eclipse that peaks after midnight, so hopefully there are enough breaks in the clouds to view it. 

 Updated: March 13, 2025 @ 3:35 pm



Christina Haack is spending some quality time with her new boyfriend Christopher Larocca, and her latest Instagram caption may be cause for some concern.

“Chasing the sun with this one,” she wrote alongside photos with Larocca. “First time in 12 years I haven't had a shoot schedule… taking full advantage of the downtime.”

The interior designer's show Christina on the Coast is currently airing new episodes every week, and her house-flipping competition show The Flip Off recently aired its finale. Fans are eager for both shows to continue, but based on Haack's caption, they don't appear to be filming new content at the moment.

Christina Haack/Instagram

While Haack hasn't confirmed her exact plans for her future with HGTV, she definitely seems to be enjoying her time off. However, don't write her off completely. At the end of The Flip Off, she insisted to Tarek El Moussa and Heather El Moussa that she wanted a “rematch” after losing the competition.

Haack made her HGTV debut in 2013 when Flip or Flop premiered. At the time, she was married to Tarek, and the show featured them flipping houses together. With Tarek on the real estate side and Haack as the designer, they were the ultimate pair.

Although the exes, who share two children, split in 2016 and eventually divorced, they continued working on the show together and have gotten to an amicable place in their relationship. It came to an end in 2022, but they both branched out and began pursuing solo endeavors on the network. In addition to Christina on the Coast, Haack also had two seasons of Christina in the Country, although she confirmed that the series would not continue after her split from third husband Josh Hall in 2024.

Meanwhile, Tarek hosts Flipping 101 With Tarek El Moussa, as well as The Flipping El Moussas with Heather, whom he married in October 2021.

 Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Matty Healy just got a tattoo of his fiancée's name — but some Taylor Swift fans think it has a connection to the pop icon.

Healy and Swift famously had a brief fling from May 2023 to early June 2023, following her split from longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn that April. While the pop icon, 35, has been dating Travis Kelce since late summer 2023, the 1975 frontman has also moved on, getting engaged to Gabbriette Bechtel in June 2024.

Now, the ""Chocolate"" singer, 35, has permanently expressed his love for Bechtel, 27, with a tattoo of her nickname in all-capped, typewriter font on his knuckles.

It is the typewriter font that is causing a stir among Swift fans, as the 14-time Grammy winner used explicit typewriter imagery in the titular track from her 2024 album, The Tortured Poets Department. The song — as well as many of the tunes on the record — are heavily theorized to be about Healy.

In fact, some Swifties quoted ""The Tortured Poets Department"" directly in the comments of the TikTok video Healy's tattoo artist posted.

""Who uses typewriters anyway?!"" one fan wrote.

""You left your typewriter at my apartment,"" another quoted, referring to the opening line of the titular track.

Had the pleasure of tattooing Matty Healy from “The 1975”👇 If you would like to book a tattoo with @Limotat , fill our form to reserve your spot before he's fully booked or contact us: E-mail: malakatats@gmail.com ☎️ 323-394-3441 (10am to 7pm everyday) 830 N La Brea Ave, Los Angeles, 90038 or DM us here #mattyhealy #tattoo #the1975

""Not the typewriter font 😅,"" a third person commented.

""typewriter font is diabolical,"" another user shared.

Some imagined Swift's reaction.

""I just KNOW Taylor is climbing up the walls rn,"" wrote a fan.

""My girl Tay is throwing furniture across her pj,"" said another.

Others put themselves in Bechtel's shoes. ""If I was Gabi I'd be crashing out over the typewriter font,"" commented someone else.

Kim Kardashian recently unveiled which of her children will eventually receive her 15-carat diamond engagement ring from ex-husband Kanye West. 

The SKIMS founder, who shares North, 11, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, Psalm, 5, with the rapper, opened up about the wedding band in the latest episode of The Kardashians on Thursday (March 13), per People. Speaking to her sister Khloé, she revealed: 

Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris in 2016 and lost a handful of cherished personal items including a second (and much larger) engagement ring gifted to her by Ye. She did not bring the 15-carat engagement ring that he first used to propose when she was pregnant with North in 2013. 

""And so that one I'm going to give to Northie because she was with me when I got engaged. And she held it after and I took a photo. She was just a few months old.” 

The Kardashians star divorced West in 2022 after six years of marriage.

Sadie Sink will star in Spider-Man 4.

The Stranger Things actress has reportedly signed up to star alongside Tom Holland — who plays Peter Parker and his titular alter ego — in the next film in the franchise.

Although her role is being kept under wraps, Deadline reported it will be a ""significant"" part, and she will potentially be introduced as X-Men character Jean Grey.

The third movie in the franchise, 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home concluded with Peter making the decision to have the world, including MJ (Zendaya), forget that he was Spider-Man.

Tom previously teased the plot of the fourth film — which is scheduled for release on July 31, 2026 — is ""crazy"".

He said on Good Morning America: ""The idea is crazy. It's a little different to anything we've done before, but I think the fans are gonna really respond to it.""

And the Uncharted star teased he and Zendaya were ""bouncing around the room"" with excitement after reading the first draft of the script.

Speaking on the Rich Roll Podcast, he said: ""It needs work, but the writers are doing a great job.

""I read it three weeks ago, and it really lit a fire in me. Zendaya and I sat down and read it together, and we at times were bouncing around the living room like, 'This is a real movie worthy of the fans' respect.' But there's a few things we need to figure out before we can get that really going, but it's exciting.""

[[nid:715594]]

The 28-year-old actor added it was important for the team to consider that the flick had to fit into the wider story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

He explained: ""One of the things to bear in mind with Marvel is that your film is a small cog in a large machine.

""And that machine has got to keep running. And you need to make sure you can fit into that timeline at the right time to benefit the bigger picture.

""That's one of the challenges we're facing. The time in which we need to get that done is a tall order but definitely achievable with the fantastic people we have working on it now.""

He also revealed filming is due to start this summer.

During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in October, the host asked Tom what he knew about the movie, to which he simply said: ""It's happening.""

After Jimmy pushed for more information, he revealed: ""Yeah, next summer. Next summer we start shooting, everything's good to go, we're nearly there, super exciting. I can't wait.""

Bollywood actor Aamir Khan is celebrating his 60th birthday today. Aamir had a special conversation with the media in Mumbai on Thursday.

Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan were seen at Aamir Khan's house on Wednesday night before his birthday. When the media asked Aamir what they talked about among themselves, Aamir laughed and said, 'We talked about the media.' The superstar also said that if a good script is written, then all three Khans will work together. He also discussed the sequel of 'Andaz Apna Apna' with Salman.

Although Aamir has officially become a senior citizen at the age of 60, he says, 'I don't feel like a senior citizen.' He further said that he has been learning Indian classical music for the last two years. His guru is Sucheta Bhattacharya, under whose guidance he likes singing a lot.

Aamir talked to the media on his birthday and said that 60 years ago, he was born a day before Holi, and this time his birthday is falling on the day of Holi. The actor donned a black t-shirt and denim. 'I look thin in black clothes, so these days I mostly wear black,' he added. During the press meet, Aamir also sang a song from his 90s film 'Akele Hum Akele Tum' for the media.  

For the unversed, Aamir's upcoming film Sitare Zameen Par will be released this Christmas. He is also a part of Sunny Deol's Lahore 1947.

Lady Gaga wouldn't call herself a drag act just because of her ""wigs and makeup and costumes"".

The 38-year-old pop star is known for her iconic sense of style as a performer, but despite being embraced by the LGBQT+ community, she doesn't think comparisons to drag queens are totally accurate.

She told iHeartRadio's Las Culturistas podcast: ""I probably wouldn't use that word just because I do feel like it's a very specific art form that I'm not, that I don't like do.

""But there is to me also a drag element in what I'm doing, but I don't think that wigs and makeup and costumes always mean drag.

""I think it is a very beloved and specific art form, but not no… it's hard to say yes, because I would never want to take away from someone that's devoted their life to it…

""If I was gonna do it, I would have to like step it up in a big way.""

The Disease hitmaker still has a special bond with the LGBTQ+ community, which goes back to her school days.

She recalled: ""I think the one that is the most important to me is I had gay friends in high school and I didn't have a lot of friends in high school, and I went to an all-girls school, which means that when school was over, I used to walk eight blocks away to the boys' school, and they weren't out yet, but we were friends, and we would do the musicals together, and I found my people.""

Later, the singer felt that same connection as a performer, and she has insisted she wouldn't be herself as a pop star without her queer fans.

She explained: ""And then later in my career, when I started performing out, and I had LGBTQ + fans, I was like, oh, 'This is the community that loved me when I was a child, and this is the community that I'm meant to be a part of now'.

""So I don't think I would be Lady Gaga without the queer community.""

Ayo Edebiri received ""insane death threats"" after ""idiot"" Elon Musk shared ""fake"" news about her.

The 'Bear' actress claimed she was sent a torrent of online abuse after the tech mogul shared a report last year which claimed she would be replacing Johnny Depp as the central character in a new 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie.

Sharing a screenshot of the Tesla boss' X post from February 2024 - in which he shared the news story along with the caption, ""Disney sucks"", Ayo wrote on her Instagram Story: ""Just remembering when I got some of the most insane death threats and racial slurs of my life (idk if it's the #1 moment, but for sure top 3) for a fake reboot of a movie I had never even heard of because of this man. (sic)""

Referring to allegations Musk had offered a Nazi salute during a speech after Donald Trump returned to office earlier this year, she added: ""LMAO so not only is he a double s**g h**l-ing fascist, he's an idiot. but anyway.

""Life is, of course, a gift (sic)"".

Ayo also shared quotes from Bill Burr's NPR interview from earlier this week, in which he criticised Musk and declared him to be ""evidently a Nazi"".

He added: ""I just refuse to believe it was an accidental two-time Sieg Heil. And he does it at a presidential inauguration!""

The 29-year-old actress later shared a screenshot of her DM exchange with 'New Girl' writer Camilla Blackett, who insisted her pal would make a great lead in the film series.

Camilla wrote: ""Okay but what if I said you'd eat this up a lil bit?!

""It's not the worst fan casting! I see the vision kinda! You're licherally Caribbean!(sic)""

Ayo captioned the screenshot: ""@WaltDisneyFrozenHead wait no DEI, but I've changed my mind maybe we could make some money idk lmk.(sic)""

While the future of the family film series has yet to be confirmed, producer Jerry Bruckheimer confirmed last year that Jeff Nathanson is penning a new story.

He told Entertainment Weekly: ""I think he's cracked it. He's got an amazing third act. We just gotta clean up the first and second and then we'll get there. But he wrote a great, great third act.""

And the producer admitted he'd love to see Johnny Depp make a return.

He added: ""It's a reboot, but if it was up to me, he would be in it. I love him. He's a good friend.""

Amitabh Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt's film Brahmastra: Part One - Shiva collected Rs 257.44 crore at the box office in 2022. At the end of the film, its sequel Brahmastra: Part Two - Dev was announced, but after that, there was no special update. At Alia Bhatt's pre-birthday party, Ranbir made a big revelation about Brahmastra 2 while talking to the media.


Ranbir gave an update on Brahmastra 2

Ranbir said, 'Brahmastra 2 has been a long-time dream of director Ayan Mukherjee. The whole story is ready in his mind. Right now he is busy with War 2. As soon as this film is released, he will start preparing for Brahmastra 2.'

He further said, 'This film will definitely be made. We have not said much about this film yet, but soon interesting announcements will be made about it.'

Ranbir opens up about SLB's Love and War

Ranbir also talked about his upcoming film, Love and War. This will be his second film with Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Their first film together was Saawariya, which was released 17 years ago. Sharing the experience of working with Bhansali, Ranbir said, 'Working with him is special. I have not seen such a hardworking person. He understands the character, emotions, music and Indian culture very well. Working on his set is tiring and long, but as an artist, it gives satisfaction. He improves the art.'

Ranbir will be seen in these films

Vicky Kaushal will also be in the lead role along with Ranbir in Love and War along with Alia Bhatt. This film will be released in March 2026. Apart from this, Ranbir also has big projects like Ramayana and Animal Park. At the same time, Alia Bhatt will soon be seen in Alpha, which will be released on Christmas this year.

President Donald Trump threatened Thursday to impose 200% tariffs on alcohol from the European Union in response to the region's retaliatory 50% tariff on U.S. whiskey, further escalating tensions between two longtime trading partners. 

Trump also sharpened his rhetoric toward the E.U., which has for decades been one of the closest U.S. allies.

""The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.""

A spokesperson for the European Commission said the region's trade minister has already contacted his American counterparts  and that “calls are being prepared.”

Later Thursday morning, Trump posted: ""The U.S. doesn't have Free Trade. We have 'Stupid Trade.' The Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!""

After some early gyrations Thursday morning, the major U.S. stock indexes settled firmly in the red, with the S&P 500 approaching correction territory, almost 10% down from its all-time high in February. The tech-focused Nasdaq index was down 1.4%, now down more than 14% from is February high.

The U.S. remains the world's largest importer of both wine and champagne, with the former comprising $4.9 billion in annual sales and the latter more than $1.7 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. exports of wine rank fifth among all nations at about $1 billion, while its exports of champagne and sparkling wine total just $67 million, 12th in the world.

The impact of the tit-for-tat tariffs could weigh heavily on U.S. consumers, who depend on import of the goods, than manufacturers of them. 

In a statement, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which represents alcohol makers here, called on the president to come to an agreement with the EU over the impasse, noting that neither region's liquors have been subjected to tariffs for multiple decades.

""We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector. We want toasts not tariffs,” said Chris Swonger, Distilled Spirits Council President and CEO.  

Trump has made wielding tariff threats against stalwart U.S. partners a core practice of his early second administration. The latest volley shows he has no plans to halt doing so despite protests from economists and businesses groups alike about the repercussions of such policy. On Wednesday, Trump's largest tariffs regime — targeting all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. — came into effect. In response, the E.U. and Canada announced they would impose retaliatory duties on U.S.-made products. 

The president has repeatedly suggested the U.S.'s large trade deficit with the rest of the world is a sign of weakness. Trump has acknowledged that his tariffs strategy may lead to a period of ""transition"" for the U.S. economy, which has shown signs of wobbling in recent weeks, but that it will ultimately emerge stronger.  

Thursday morning, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added additional context to Trump's latest barb and the EU specifically targeting products from states with strong Trump support.  

""The President was totally annoyed that the Europeans did this, and so you're going to hear back from someone who emotionally cares about America,"" he said on Bloomberg Television. ""He cares about America, and he wants to take care of Americans. And why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon secretary, Harley Davidson motorcycle? It's disrespectful.""

Lutnick added Trump was looking to ""balance"" trade relations with the E.U.

""We are your largest, most important trading partner. Treat us with respect, and let's get a little balance,"" he said. 

Ernst Büscher, spokesperson for the German Wine Institute, said in an interview that a 200% would be a ""catastrophe,"" noting that the United States is the most important export market for German winemakers, accounting for about one sixth of exports. 

He added that when a tariff of 25 percent was placed on German wines during the first Trump administration, importers and winemakers shared that cost to shield U.S/ consumers from the price increase — but that would likely not be possible with a 200-percent tariff.

French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said in a statement Thursday that Trump was ""escalating the trade war he chose to launch.""

""France remains determined to fight back with the European Commission and our partners,"" he said. ""We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries.”

So far, market reaction to Trump's approach has been broadly negative. Major stock indexes have now erased their post-electoral gains, as investors rebel against the prospect of higher costs. On Thursday, stock futures immediately fell in response to Trump's latest announcement, though pared losses somewhat after a favorable inflation report.

Most academics say that the ability of U.S. consumers and businesses alike to import goods cheaply mostly leads to higher living standards and more efficient output for companies.

A member of the California National Guard monitors a checkpoint on Pacific Coast Highway, at Chautauqua Boulevard, minutes before it was shutdown in Santa Monica on March 12, 2025. Caltrans closed a segment of Pacific Coast Highway to residents and businesses in burn scar areas at noon Wednesday due to safety concerns from the incoming storm.

    SACRAMENTO, California (KCRA) -- A large tree fell onto an apartment building in Sacramento County, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department said.

Crews responded to the apartment building on Andrea Boulevard near Elkhorn Boulevard on Wednesday afternoon.

Officials said no injuries were reported, however, the county building department was requested to evaluate the structure.

Larry Price was inside of his first-floor apartment when the tree fell down. He said everything started shaking, so he ran to grab his daughter and wife.

“Man. It was scary. It was really scary,” Price said. “The whole house kept shaking. It was crazy. I thought it was the end of the world.”

The tree hit his unit, and at least three others, when it fell. He said the branches didn't make it inside of his apartment, but their patio and the belongings they keep out there were damaged.

He said it fell during the storm moving across the region around 4:30 p.m.

“It was raining really hard. It was very windy. Like very very very windy,” he said. “I've lived here for five years and I've known that tree was going to fall. I've been saying it every time we go outside.”

Video shows the tree had fallen on multiple balconies and caused some roof damage to the building.

It's unclear what the extent of the damage is.

The damage occurred as a strong storm system passed through the Sacramento Valley on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump hosts NATO secretary general Mark Rutte. The leader of the 32-member transatlantic military alliance meets Trump at a key moment for Europe and NATO, with Trump's apparent pivot toward Russia leaving members uneasy.

Trump meanwhile threatened 200% tariffs on European wine, champagne and spirits if the EU goes forward with a retaliatory tariff on American whiskey on April 1.

And the Trump administration has launched a review of organizations that provide temporary housing and other aid to migrants, suggesting they may have violated a law used to prosecute smugglers.

The IRS replaces its chief counsel with a lawyer more sympathetic to DOGE, AP sources say

The revenue service demoted William Paul because he disagreed with the Department of Government Efficiency's alleged push to share tax information with multiple agencies, according to two people familiar with the plans who are not authorized to speak publicly.

Paul will be replaced by Andrew De Mello, an attorney in the chief counsel's office who is deemed supportive of Elon Musk and DOGE, they said.

Paul is not the first government official to be demoted after voicing concern about access to sensitive systems and taxpayer data.

“The series of IRS officials who have put the law above their personal job security join a line of public servants, stretching back to Treasury and IRS leaders during the Nixon era, who have resisted unlawful attempts by elected officials to weaponize taxpayer data and systems,” Chye-Ching Huang, the executive director of New York University's Tax Law Center, said in a statement.

Democratic-led states sue to block Education Department layoffs

A coalition including 20 states and the District of Columbia says the Trump administration's sweeping Education Department layoffs are illegally dismantling an agency created by Congress.

The Trump administration cut the department's workforce in half, and the president has said he wants it shut down.

The federal lawsuit filed Thursday in Massachusetts says the layoffs make it impossible for the department to comply with its statutory requirements, will result in lost or delayed federal funding for public schools and leave the agency unable to administer college financial aid or enforce civil rights laws.

Senate committee backs Stanford health economist to lead NIH

Dr. Jay Bhattacharya once famously clashed with officials at the National Institutes of Health. Now he's up for a full Senate vote with the approval of the Senate's health committee.

Bhattacharya, who holds a medical degree but is not a practicing physician, was an outspoken critic of COVID-19 shutdowns and vaccine policies.

He sidestepped committee questions about drastic funding cuts and mass firings, and vowed to focus attention on chronic diseases and encourage scientific dissent at the $48 billion agency, the world's largest funder of biomedical research.

FDA nominee Marty Makary on track for confirmation after Senate panel vote

Dr. Marty Makary is on track to become the next commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.

The Republican-controlled Senate health panel voted 14-9 to advance his nomination to the Senate floor. Democrats Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and John Hickenlooper of Colorado joined Republicans in favor.

Makary — a surgeon, author and researcher — is known for his contrarian views and is closely aligned with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on many issues. Both are highly critical of food additives, ultraprocessed foods and the overprescribing of drugs.

Makary refused to be pinned down on specific actions he might take as commissioner, including on the abortion pill mifepristone.

G7 allies meet in Canada as Trump's policies shake unity

Top diplomats from the U.S., Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan are gathering as the bloc's once-solid unity is thrown into disarray by Trump's trade and foreign policies.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio will likely hear a litany of complaints. The meeting began just minutes after Trump threatened 200% tariffs on European alcohol if the EU retaliates against his steel and aluminum tariffs with a levy on American whiskey.

Relations between the U.S. and its closest allies are already strained by Trump's apparent pivot toward Russia. “Peace and stability is at the top of our agenda, and I look forward discussing how we continue to support Ukraine in the face of Russia's illegal aggression,” Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said.

China opposes tariffs on steel and aluminum and confirms talks with Walmart

China called U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum “unilateral and protectionist acts under the name of national security.”

Chinese commerce ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian confirmed Thursday that ministry officials had reached out to Walmart following reports that the giant U.S. retailer was seeking price cuts from its Chinese suppliers to offset the cost of Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods.

Walmart said in a statement that its conversations with suppliers were aimed at saving money for its customers and that it would work closely with the suppliers to “find the best way forward during these uncertain times.”

Trump withdraws his initial choice to lead CDC, a close RFK Jr. ally

The Senate health committee announced Thursday that it was canceling a hearing on former Florida congressman David Weldon's nomination to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the White House pulled the nomination because it became clear Weldon did not have the votes for confirmation.

Weldon has been closely aligned with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now Trump's health secretary, one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists. Weldon also has been a prominent critic of vaccines and the CDC, which promotes vaccines and monitors their safety.

Trump special envoy in Russia for high-level talks on Ukraine ceasefire

Steve Witkoff was in Moscow on Thursday, just the latest high-profile assignment for a real estate magnate turned White House foreign policy fixer.

The longtime Trump pal is also a key player in the Republican administration's efforts to end the war in Gaza.

Now he's expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a U.S. official who also confirmed Witkoff's arrival in Russia for the sensitive engagement. The official was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of the anonymity.

Ukraine agreed Tuesday to a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Trump said he hopes Russia will quickly agree.

US bourbon makers urge Trump to back off his trade war

“The US-EU spirits sector is the model for fair and reciprocal trade, having zero-for-zero tariffs since 1997,” says the statement by Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council.

“The U.S. spirits sector supports more than $200 billion in economic activity, 1.7 million jobs across production, distribution, hospitality and retail, and the purchase of 2.8 billion pounds of grains from American farmers,” it says.

“We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector. We want toasts not tariffs.”

U.S. wholesale inflation decelerated last month, but the progress may not last

The Labor Department reported that its producer price index — which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers — was unchanged from January to February, and core wholesale prices that exclude volatile food and energy costs dropped 0.1%, the first drop since July.

Thursday's numbers hit as President Donald Trump ramps up his trade war, threatening to send inflation higher.

Gasoline prices fell 4.7% last month, while food prices rose 1.7% from January to February, led by a 28% surge in the price of eggs

Trump takes aim at Europe's possible whiskey tax as his trade war heats up

Trump issued his threat on social media, saying he'd impose a 200% tariff on European wine, champagne and spirits if the European goes forward with a planned tariff on American whiskey on April 1.

Trump called the longtime U.S. ally “one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States.”

He said the 200% tax on U.S. consumption of the European products “will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.”

Jobless numbers don't yet reflect DOGE federal workforce cuts

It's not clear when job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency will show up in the weekly layoffs report, though some analysts expect them to surface in data in the coming weeks.

Those layoffs are part of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.

Senior U.S. officials set the government downsizing in motion weeks ago via a memo dramatically expanding President Donald Trump's efforts to scale back the workforce. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and now the Republican administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection.

Jobless numbers remain healthy for now

Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have remained mostly in a range between 200,000 and 250,000 for the past few years.

U.S. jobless claims filings fell by 2,000 to 220,000 for the week ending March 8, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's fewer than the 226,000 new applications analysts forecast.

The four-week average, which evens out some of the week-to-week swings, ticked up by 1,500 to 226,000.

The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of March 1 fell by 27,000 to 1.87 million.

UN humanitarian chief says many needy people around the world will die because of aid cuts

The U.N. humanitarian chief says more than 300 million people across the globe need humanitarian support and many will die because funding from the United States and others is drying up.

Tom Fletcher told a U.N. news conference that the cuts have caused “a seismic shock.”

The Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. aid agency, USAID, and terminated 83% of its programs.

Across the humanitarian community, he said, programs have been stopped and staff have been laid off including about 10% in February from nongovernmental organizations doing humanitarian work.

Fletcher said that in December global experts estimated that 300 million people needed help in 2025, and the U.N. prioritized 190 million it was aiming to reach, which would cost $47 billion.

That number increased to 307 million in recent days, he said, but with the funding cuts, he can't say with confidence that the U.N. will get anywhere near $47 billion. Now, U.N. colleagues in Geneva are trying to identify how to prioritize saving 100 million lives and how much that would cost.

Rubio could face an unfriendly reception from close G7 allies over Trump's policies

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio may be walking into unusually unfriendly territory this week when he meets his counterparts from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies — strong American allies stunned by President Donald Trump's actions against them.

Just hours after Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs kicked in — prompting responses from the European Union and Canada and threatening to ignite full-scale trade wars with close U.S. partners — Rubio arrived at the scenic Quebec town of La Malbaie on the St. Lawrence River for two days of talks starting Thursday with the top diplomats of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. All of them have been angered by the new American president's policies.

Rubio will likely be hearing a litany of complaints about Trump's decisions from once-friendly, like-minded countries in the G7 — notably host Canada, to which Trump has arguably been most antagonistic with persistent talk of it becoming the 51st U.S. state, additional tariffs and repeated insults against its leadership.

Trump hosting White House talks with NATO secretary general

Mark Rutte, who heads the 32-member transatlantic military alliance, will meet with Trump at a pivotal moment for Europe and NATO.

Administration officials are pressing ahead with talks with Moscow to sign off on a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire that Trump believes could usher in a permanent end to Europe's biggest land-war since World War II.

Thursday's talks also come as Trump's rhetoric on the alliance continues to leave members uneasy.

Trump last week suggested that the U.S. might abandon its commitments to the alliance if member countries don't meet defense spending targets, a day after his pick for NATO ambassador assured senators that the administration's commitment to the military alliance was “ironclad.”

The U.S. president also expressed doubt that NATO would come to the United States' defense if the country were attacked. However, the alliance did just that after Sept. 11 — the only time in its history that the defense guarantee has been invoked.

Education Department layoffs gut civil rights office, leaving discrimination cases in limbo

The Education Department's civil rights branch is losing nearly half its staff in the Trump administration's layoffs, effectively gutting an office that already faced a backlog of thousands of complaints from students and families across the nation.

Among a total of more than 1,300 layoffs announced Tuesday were roughly 240 in the department's Office for Civil Rights, according to a list obtained and verified by The Associated Press. Seven of the civil rights agency's 12 regional offices were entirely laid off, including busy hubs in New York, Chicago and Dallas. Despite assurances that the department's work will continue unaffected, huge numbers of cases appear to be in limbo.

The Trump administration has not said how it will proceed with thousands of cases being handled by staff it's eliminating. The cases involve families trying to get school services for students with disabilities, allegations of bias related to race and religion, and complaints over sexual violence at schools and college campuses.

Some staffers who remain said there's no way to pick up all of their fired colleagues' cases. Many were already struggling to keep pace with their own caseloads. With fewer than 300 workers, families likely will be waiting on resolution for years, they said.

Federal student loan site goes down after layoffs gutted Education Department

An hours-long outage Wednesday on StudentAid.gov, the federal website for student loans and financial aid, underscored the risks in rapidly gutting the Department of Education, as Trump aims to dismantle the agency.

Hundreds of users reported FAFSA outages to Downdetector starting midday Wednesday, saying they were having trouble completing the form, which is required for financial aid at colleges nationwide. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a group of people who handle colleges' financial aid awards, also received reports of users experiencing technical issues and having trouble completing the FAFSA.

The developers and IT support staff who worked on the FAFSA form were hard hit in the Education Department's layoffs Tuesday, along with staff buyouts and the termination of probationary employees. In all, the Education Department has reduced its staff by half, to roughly 2,000, since Trump took office.

The administration of US president Donald Trump continues to introduce polices that strip the government's support of US science, as Peter Gwynne reports

Two months into Donald Trump's second presidency and many parts of US science – across government, academia, and industry – continue to be hit hard by the new administration's policies. Science-related government agencies are seeing budgets and staff cut, especially in programmes linked to climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is also causing havoc as it seeks to slash spending.

In mid-February, DOGE fired more than 300 employees at the National Nuclear Safety Administration, which is part of the US Department of Energy, many of whom were responsible for reassembling nuclear warheads at the Pantex plant in Texas. A day later, the agency was forced to rescind all but 28 of the sackings amid concerns that their absence could jeopardise national security. 

A judge has also reinstated workers who were laid off at the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The judge said the government's Office of Personnel Management, which sacked the staff, did not have the authority to do so. However, the NSF rehiring applies mainly to military veterans and staff with disabilities, with the overall workforce down by about 140 people – or roughly 10%.

The NSF has also announced a reduction, the size of which is unknown, in its Research Experiences for Undergraduates programme. Over the last 38 years, the initiative has given thousands of college students – many with backgrounds that are underrepresented in science – the opportunity to carry out original research at  institutions during the summer holidays. NSF staff are also reviewing thousands of grants containing such words as “women” and “diversity”.

NASA, meanwhile, is to shut its office of technology, policy and strategy, along with its chief-scientist office, and the DEI and accessibility branch of its diversity and equal opportunity office. “I know this news is difficult and may affect us all differently,” admitted acting administrator Janet Petro in an all-staff e-mail. Affecting about 20 staff, the move is on top of plans to reduce NASA's overall workforce. Reports also suggest that NASA's science budget could be slashed by as much as 50%.

Hundreds of “probationary employees” have also been sacked by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which provides weather forecasts that are vital for farmers and people in areas threatened by tornadoes and hurricanes. “If there were to be large staffing reductions at NOAA there will be people who die in extreme weather events and weather-related disasters who would not have otherwise,” warns climate scientist Daniel Swain from the University of California, Los Angeles.

In his first cabinet meeting on 26 February, Trump suggested that officials “use scalpels” when trimming their departments' spending and personnel – rather than Musk's figurative chainsaw. But bosses at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) still plan to cut its budget by about two-thirds. “[W]e fear that such cuts would render the agency incapable of protecting Americans from grave threats in our air, water, and land,” wrote former EPA administrators William Reilly, Christine Todd Whitman and Gina McCarthy in the New York Times.

The White House's attack on climate science goes beyond just the EPA. In January, the US Department of Agriculture removed almost all data on climate change from its website. The action resulted in a lawsuit in March from the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York and two non-profit organizations – the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group. They say that the removal hinders research and “agricultural decisions”.

The Trump administration has also barred NASA's now former chief scientist Katherine Calvin and members of the State Department from travelling to China for a planning meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Meanwhile, in a speech to African energy ministers in Washington on 7 March, US energy secretary Chris Wright claimed that coal has “transformed our world and made it better”, adding that climate change, while real, is not on his list of the world's top 10 problems. “We've had years of Western countries shamelessly saying ‘don't develop coal',” he said. “That's just nonsense.”

US science in chaos as impact of Trump's executive orders sinks in




US science in chaos as impact of Trump's executive orders sinks in

At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), staff are being told to cancel hundreds of research grants that involve DEI and transgender issues. The Trump administration also wants to cut the allowance for indirect costs of NIH's and other agencies' research grants to 15% of research contracts, although a district court judge has put that move on hold pending further legal arguments. On 8 March, the Trump administration also threatened to cancel $400m in funding to Columbia purportedly due to its failure to tackle anti-semitism on the campus.

A Trump policy of removing “undocumented aliens” continues to alarm universities that have overseas students. Some institutions have already advised overseas students against travelling abroad during holidays, in case immigration officers do not let them back in when they return. Others warn that their international students should carry their immigration documents with them at all times. Universities have also started to rein in spending with Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, implementing a hiring freeze.

Amid the turmoil, the US scientific community is beginning to fight back. Individual scientists have supported court cases that have overturned sackings at government agencies, while a letter to Congress signed by the Union of Concerned Scientists and 48 scientific societies asserts that the administration has “already caused significant harm to American science”. On 7 March, more than 30 US cities also hosted “Stand Up for Science” rallies attended by thousands of demonstrators.

Demonstrators march for science in New York City

Elsewhere, a group of government, academic and industry leaders – known collectively as Vision for American Science and Technology – has released a report warning that the US could fall behind China and other competitors in science and technology. Entitled Unleashing American Potential, it calls for increased public and private investment in science to maintain US leadership. “The more dollars we put in from the feds, the more investment comes in from industry, and we get job growth, we get economic success, and we get national security out of it,” notes Sudip Parikh, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, who was involved in the report.

Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, meanwhile, has called on the community to continue to highlight the benefit of science. “We need to underscore the fact that stable federal funding of research is the main mode by which radical new discoveries have come to light – discoveries that have enabled the age of quantum computing and AI and new materials science,” she said. “These are areas that I am sure are very important to this administration as well.”

Donald Trump has said Vladimir Putin's comments on the US ceasefire plan are ""promising"" but incomplete - after the Russian president suggested there were ""questions"" about the proposals.

false,Thursday 13 March 2025 19:44, UK

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

After hearing Vladimir Putin's layered response to the ceasefire this afternoon, we have now had reaction from Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In his evening statement, the Ukrainian president describes Putin's words as ""very predictable"" and ""very manipulative"" and says Russia's president is preparing a rejection of the ceasefire proposal.

""Putin, of course, is afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, he wants to kill Ukrainians,"" Zelenskyy says.

""That's why they in Moscow are framing the idea of silence with such preconditions that nothing will happen at all or that it will not happen for as long as possible.""

He labels Putin's words as ""just another Russian manipulation"".

Zelenskyy continues by saying Ukraine does not ""set conditions that complicate anything"" while stating that Russia does.

""As we have always said, the only one who will drag things out, the only one who will be unconstructive, is Russia,"" he says. 

""They want a war. Putin has stolen years of peace and continues this war - day after day.""

Zelenskyy ends by calling for allies to ramp up the pressure on Putin and impose further sanctions.

We can bring you more from Vladimir Putin's news conference earlier, and while much of the attention was on his comments around the ceasefire, he did also address the situation in Kursk.

It follows his visit to the region yesterday while dressed in camouflage after Russia's military continued its advances on the front.

In his news conference, Putin said Russia had trapped the remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the western Kursk region, where they had clung on for more than seven months in one of the war's key battles.

He said the troops were cut off inside the invasion zone, and issued a warning to the Ukrainian forces still in the area. 

""If a physical blockade occurs in the coming days, then no one will be able to leave at all, there will only be two ways - to surrender or die,"" he said.

Ukraine's incursion into the region last August came as a major surprise, and aimed to divert Russian forces from elsewhere on the frontlines while also taking land to trade for its own captured territory.

But with the support of troops from its ally North Korea, Russian forces have gradually been clawing back the lost ground, heightening the pressure on Ukraine.

You can watch the footage of Putin visiting Kursk in the video below...

Donald Trump has been hosting NATO's secretary general at the White House - but with the world's media assembled in the Oval Office, he took the opportunity to also discuss the ceasefire.

Trump has been increasing the pressure on Vladimir Putin to agree to the proposals, with his envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow for talks right now.

Watch what the US president had to say in the video below....

Vladimir Putin does not expect to give up regions of Ukraine as part of a peace deal, nor does he expect Volodymyr Zelenskyy to remain as Ukraine's president, an expert has told Sky News.

Baroness Catherine Ashton, the former EU high representative for foreign affairs, said this afternoon's news conference with Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, was ""really interesting"".

She told our presenter Kamali Melbourne that Putin ""says he supports the idea of a ceasefire"".

What follows, though, is a ""whole series of details"".

These include: ""Who monitors the ceasefire, how will we know when it's being violated, what happens if it is, does it lead on to talks for peace, what does that look like, and who's in the room?""

There is also the issue of Russia ""making sure it's in the best possible position"".

Such matters will lead to ""very difficult conversations, I think, for the American envoy to have this evening"", Ashton commented.

The negotiation is being set up as ""Russia and America decides"", she said.

Putin ""expects that Zelenskyy won't be there"" afterwards.

""He expects that he will not be returning parts of Ukraine to Ukraine."" 

Our security and defence analyst Michael Clarke says Vladimir Putin's response to the ceasefire comes as no surprise.

""This is the way the Russians always do things and they think they are doing very well in the war and are actually now in control of the diplomacy of this,"" he said.

Clarke explained that the main question is over how far Russia can push Donald Trump.

""The danger for Europe is that Trump will be so anxious for a deal that he will press the Ukrainians on all sorts of really important things,"" he said.

""The Americans have now demonstrated through the use of intelligence, turning it off and back on again, they know they have got a tap, they could turn up the pressure or turn down the pressure,"" Clarke said.

He added that this left Ukraine in a ""very difficult"" situation.

As we've been reporting, Vladimir Putin has given his first response to the ceasefire, but his answer wasn't exactly definitive.

While he said Russia agrees with the proposal, he indicated its position is based on the assumption that it would lead to ""long-term peace"" and ""something that would remove the initial reasons for the crisis"".

Watch what he had to say when asked about the ceasefire in the video below...

While it is perhaps more tangentially related to the war in Ukraine, Trump has given some new remarks on another recurring topic of his presidency - expressing confidence that the United States will annex Greenland.

""I think that will happen,"" he told reporters during the meeting in the Oval Office.

""I didn't give it much thought before, but I'm sitting with a man that could be very instrumental [NATO chief Mark Rutte].

""You know, Mark, you need that for international security, not just security.

""It's really a very appropriate question, thank you.""

Greenland's pro-business opposition Demokraatit party, which wants a slow approach to independence from Denmark, won Tuesday's parliamentary election. Trump said that election was good for the US - although his latest comments are unlikely to go down well in Denmark, which has repeatedly said Greenland is not for sale. 

By Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent

Vladimir Putin was never going to flat out reject the US proposal for a ceasefire, but he also wasn't going to fully endorse it either. Russia's agreement, as expected, comes with several strings attached.

The Kremlin leader didn't specify Moscow's demands but he did allude to them by saying that any peace deal had to eliminate the ""root causes"" of the conflict. 

It's become a frequent refrain of his, and shows that Moscow's maximalist position hasn't changed. By ""root causes"", the Russian president is referring to NATO's eastward expansion, which he blames as the catalyst for the war in Ukraine.

It's a very clear indication that his agreement to a ceasefire relies on getting some kind of security guarantees of his own, eg a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO, or that there'll never be any European peacekeeping forces from NATO members based in the country in the future.

He also articulated why Moscow is reluctant to agree to an immediate truce, talking at length about his forces' advances in the Kursk region. 

Ukraine's incursion there has been humiliating for the Kremlin, but their expulsion is finally within reach. Vladimir Putin doesn't want that opportunity to slip away. By pausing Russia's offensive, he fears they'll lose the advantage and give the enemy time to regroup.

Vladimir Putin was, however, careful to thank Donald Trump for his efforts in trying to reach a peace agreement, perhaps wary of any backlash from the White House. But despite that, he still doesn't appear to be showing any sign of compromise.

So in many ways, it feels like nothing has changed.

We are now seeing some comments from Donald Trump in his news conference with Mark Rutte that indicate a potentially significant change of tone on NATO.

As mentioned in our previous post, the US president has praised NATO's secretary general for doing ""some really good work"", and has also told reporters NATO ""is stepping up"".

Both before and since his election, Trump has repeatedly criticised NATO countries for not meeting the current member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defence - and said they should pay even more.

He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts a burden on the US.

While his recent public pronouncements on the alliance have been heavily critical, leaders of fellow member countries will be hopeful his remarks today represent a shift in the White House's stance.

Trump also told reporters that he noticed ""very few people were paying"" when he first went to NATO, adding that if they were, they were not paying their ""fair share"".

He says he was able to raise ""hundreds of billions of dollars... the money started pouring in"" and claims the alliance became much stronger because of his actions.

Meanwhile, Rutte has urged NATO to produce more weapons, stating the alliance is not doing enough and is lagging behind Russia and China.

Donald Trump has taken his seat in the Oval Office alongside NATO's secretary general Mark Rutte - with the US president using the opportunity to update the media on the ceasefire proposal.

He tells reporters that his envoy Steve Witkoff is in serious discussions in Russia - Witkoff is expected to meet Vladimir Putin shortly.

""Hopefully Russia will do the right thing,"" he says, repeating that he would like to see a ceasefire from Russia.

He tells reporters that a peace deal ""shouldn't be very complicated"" and urges all parties to get the process over with quickly.

Trump: Putin's statement 'wasn't complete'

Trump also addressed Putin's news conference with ally and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

He says the Russian president put out a promising statement, but insists it was not complete, and reiterated he is willing to talk to Putin about the ceasefire proposal.

The US president has also broken away from his high-profile criticism of NATO and praised Rutte for his role, saying he has been doing ""some really good work"".

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he supports a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine, but stressed it should lead to lasting peace in the region. 

“So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,"" Putin told a news conference in Moscow, according to The Associated Press. “But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.”

The proposal was developed during discussions between U.S. and Ukrainian representatives in Saudi Arabia this week. 

Ukrainian officials said that they would accept the ceasefire if Russia agreed to the same terms.

A delegation of American officials, including President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow on Thursday in an effort to persuade Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine, Scripps News learned. 

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who participated in the talks, emphasized that the ceasefire would provide an opportunity for all sides to negotiate an end to the war, though he acknowledged the process would be challenging.

""I think we're going to have to be flexible and nimble and creative and patient and work hard at it and hopefully turn it into something that's concrete,"" Rubio said.

The war in Ukraine began in February 2022 when Russia launched a full-scale invasion.

Despite the potential ceasefire, fighting has escalated this week.

Russia claims to have recaptured Sudzha, a key Ukrainian operational hub in Kursk, just hours after President Vladimir Putin visited the region.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials reported Wednesday that Russian missile strikes killed at least five civilians. The attacks came one day after Ukrainian strikes inside Russia.

The impending tariffs on India, set to take effect next month, may have far-reaching consequences for the US healthcare system. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's recent unscheduled visit to the US was an attempt to negotiate a trade deal and mitigate the impact of these tariffs on India's pharmaceutical exports.The US relies heavily on Indian generic medicines, with nearly half of all generic drugs consumed in the US originating from India. This has resulted in significant savings for the US healthcare system, with estimates suggesting that Indian generics saved the US $219 billion in 2022 alone, according to a study by consulting firm IQVIA. Generic drugs, which are cheaper versions of brand-name medications, account for nine out of 10 prescriptions in the US, making India's pharmaceutical industry a critical component of the US healthcare system.

However, the proposed tariffs could disrupt this delicate balance. Experts warn that the tariffs could make some Indian generics unviable, leading to drug shortages and exacerbating existing healthcare issues. Dr. Melissa Barber, a drug costing expert from Yale University, notes that the tariffs could ""worsen the demand-supply imbalances"" and disproportionately affect the uninsured and poor, per a report in the BBC.

The Indian pharmaceutical industry is deeply concerned about the potential impact of these tariffs. Companies like Sun Pharma and Cipla have expressed concerns about the viability of their businesses in the face of increased tariffs. Dilip Shanghvi, chairman of Sun Pharma, has stated that the tariffs ""do not justify relocating our manufacturing to the US,"" citing the significant cost differences between manufacturing in India and the US.

The US has already seen the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports, with the cost of raw materials for drugs increasing by 20% since Trump took office. The pharmaceutical sector is India's largest industrial export, with the US being a critical market for Indian generics. Any reciprocal tariffs by the US would increase costs for both generic medicines and specialty drugs, affecting the livelihoods of millions of Americans.

To mitigate these risks, some experts suggest that India should drop its tariffs on pharma goods, which would have a negligible impact on the Indian economy. Ajay Bagga, a veteran market expert, told the BBC that ""US drug exports into India are barely half a billion dollars, so the impact will be negligible"".

The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) has also recommended zero duty on US drug exports to avoid reciprocal levies. However, this may not be a straightforward solution, as it would require significant changes to India's trade policies.

As the situation unfolds, all eyes are on the potential trade deal between the US and India. Mark Linscott, former assistant US trade representative, believes that ""in the short term, there may be some pain through new tariffs, but I think they'll make significant progress by the fall of this year for a first tranche [trade] agreement"". The outcome of these negotiations will have far-reaching consequences for the US healthcare system, the Indian pharmaceutical industry, and the livelihoods of millions of people around the world.

The US healthcare system is already facing significant challenges, including rising healthcare costs and increasing drug prices. The proposed tariffs on Indian pharmaceuticals could exacerbate these issues, making it even more difficult for Americans to access affordable healthcare.

In contrast, the Indian pharmaceutical industry is a significant contributor to the country's economy, accounting for a substantial portion of India's exports. The industry is also a major employer, providing livelihoods for millions of Indians. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

As Canada prepares to host the G7 foreign ministers, Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly is gearing up to address pressing concerns, including the escalating trade war with the United States. Joly plans to sound the alarm about the implications of the U.S. actions, warning her European and British counterparts that, ""If the U.S. can do this to us, their closest friend, then nobody is safe.""Although the official agenda focuses on Ukraine, the Middle East, Haiti, and Venezuela, Joly intends to raise the issue of U.S. tariffs and sovereignty threats with her counterparts. This move is seen as an effort to rally support and emphasise the need for collective action in the face of U.S. trade policies, while advising them, ""Canada is the canary in the coal mine.""

Canada has been reeling from the impact of U.S. tariffs, with Trump imposing 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. In response, Joly delivered a scathing speech, arguing that Trump's tariffs are an excuse for economic coercion. Canada has also retaliated with counter-tariffs on about $20 billion worth of American goods.

At the heart of the issue is Canada's sovereignty, with Trump repeatedly making comments that have been perceived as annexation threats. Joly has been vocal about her concerns, stating that Canada will not back down in the face of U.S. coercion. She has also emphasised the need for Canada to cooperate with Europe on military exercises and defense equipment to protect its sovereignty.

U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, however, has downplayed Trump's annexation comments, suggesting that the president believes Canada should become the 51st state from an economic standpoint. ""He says if they became the 51st state, we wouldn't have to worry about the border and fentanyl coming across because now we would be able to manage that,"" he added.

Relations between the United States and Canada are at an all-time low, thanks to Trump's threats to impose tariffs on all imports from Canada and his constant musing about annexing the country to make it the 51st U.S. state.

This perspective has been met with skepticism by many Canadians, who feel that their country's sovereignty is under threat.

""We're going to be focused in the G7 on all of those things. That's what the meeting is about. It is not a meeting about how we're going to take over Canada,"" Rubio told reporters, highlighting how offbeat their ties have become.

As Canada prepares to swear in a new prime minister, the trade dispute with the U.S. remains a pressing concern. Prime Minister-designate Mark Carney has identified Trump's trade assault as an ""economic and sovereign crisis"" and has vowed to stop the president from dominating the hemisphere by taking Canada and Greenland.

""The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country,"" he warned on Sunday. ""Think about it. If they succeed, they will destroy our way of life.""

Outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in his farewell speech, emphasised, ""Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given"". ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that he hopes that Russia will do the right thing regarding the war in Ukraine, reported Reuters.

The US president also said that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is in serious discussions with Russia about ending the war.

“Hopefully, they'll do the right thing,” Trump told reporters during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

Trump also responded to Putin's remarks on the idea of a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.

Trump said that while Putin made ""a very promising statement"" on a possible Ukraine ceasefire, but added that ""it wasn't complete.""

""He (Putin) put out a very promising statement but it wasn't complete,"" Trump said, according to AFP. ""I'd love to meet with him or talk to him. But we have to get it (a ceasefire deal) over with fast.""

 

Earlier today, Putin said that his country agrees with the proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine, but added that any ceasefire would have to deal with the root causes of the conflict.

The Russian president said that many details need to be sorted out before advancing further in talks.

""We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities,"" Putin told reporters at a news conference in the Kremlin. ""But we proceed from the fact that this cessation should be such that it would lead to long-term peace and would eliminate the original causes of this crisis.""

He also thanked Trump for his efforts to end the war.

 A new graft scandal rocked the European Parliament after police carried out raids Thursday in Belgium and Portugal, detaining multiple suspects in a probe into suspicions of corruption under the guise of lobbying, for the benefit of Chinese tech giant Huawei. 

 The new investigation comes more than two years after the ""Qatargate"" scandal, in which a number of EU lawmakers were accused of being paid to promote the interests of Qatar and Morocco something both countries have firmly denied. 

 None of those held for questioning on Thursday were EU lawmakers, a police source told AFP. But Belgian media reported more than a dozen parliamentarians were on the detectives' radar. 

 Transparency campaigners, who have accused EU lawmakers of resisting reform, called on the parliament to immediately investigate the latest claims. 

 ""The alleged bribery is said to have benefitted Huawei,"" the Belgian federal prosecutor's office said after local media reported the probe focused on the company. 

 Huawei has not responded to AFP's request for comment. 

 The prosecutor's office had earlier said several people were taken in for questioning over their ""alleged involvement in active corruption within the European Parliament, as well as for forgery and use of forgeries"". 

 The investigating judge ordered seals on the European Parliament offices of two parliamentary assistants and a suspect had been arrested in France, it added in a second statement in the afternoon. 

 The EU parliament said it had received a request for cooperation from the Belgian authorities and would ""swiftly and fully honour"" it. 

 Prosecutors said the alleged corruption by a ""criminal organisation"" was ""practised regularly and very discreetly from 2021 to the present day"" and took ""various forms"". 

 These included ""remuneration for taking political positions or excessive gifts such as food and travel expenses or regular invitations to football matches"" as part of a bid to promote ""purely private commercial interests"" in political decisions. 

 The alleged kickbacks were concealed as conference expenses and paid to various intermediaries, the office said, adding it was looking at whether money laundering had also been involved. 

 About 100 police officers took part in the operation that saw a total of 21 searches conducted across Belgium and in Portugal, it added. 

 Belgium's Le Soir daily said the Portuguese search focused on a company through which transfers had allegedly been made to one or more EU lawmakers. 

 Portugal's prosecutor general confirmed the raids were conducted ""at the request of the Belgian authorities"" but did not provide more details.

 At the heart of the alleged corruption is a former parliamentary assistant who was employed as Huawei's EU public affairs director, Belgian media said. 

 Huawei has been in the EU's crosshairs in recent years. 

 Brussels in 2023 described the telecoms giant as a higher risk to the bloc than other 5G suppliers and called on EU states to exclude its equipment from their mobile networks. 

 Le Soir said police had taken ""several lobbyists"" into custody and they were due to appear in front of a judge for questioning. 

 Transparency defenders were scathing in their criticism of the parliament's lack of wide-ranging reforms after the 2022 scandal. 

 ""These new allegations are as sweeping and serious as Qatargate and make a mockery of democracy at the European Parliament. For too long, MEPs have taken a carefree approach to ethics and continue to exist in a culture of impunity,"" said Nicholas Aiossa, director at Transparency International EU. 

 He urged swift and deep reform in the parliament, a call echoed by former transparency campaigner and current Green EU lawmaker, Daniel Freund. 

 ""This painfully shows that following Qatargate the EU remains vulnerable to corruption. Some reforms are still being blocked,"" Freund told AFP, adding: ""We finally need independent oversight for ethics violations.""

Representatives of President Donald Trump's family have held discussions to acquire a financial stake in the US arm of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, while the company's founder seeks a presidential pardon, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Thursday.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money-laundering requirements, has been pushing for clemency from the Trump administration.

Zhao, known as CZ, remains Binance's largest shareholder despite stepping down as CEO following the company's $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities in 2023.

According to the Journal, the talks reportedly began when Binance approached Trump allies last year, offering a business deal with the family as part of a strategy to re-enter the US market. 

The potential investment could be made directly by the Trump family or through World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture backed by the Trumps that launched in September.

Steve Witkoff, a longtime Trump friend who serves as his top negotiator in the Middle East and Ukraine, has reportedly been involved in the negotiations, though an administration official denied this to the Journal.

For Binance, a pardon for Zhao would clear regulatory hurdles for the company's return to the US market and ease international business operations. 

The company's US arm saw its market share plummet from 27 percent to just over one percent following regulatory actions.

For the Trump family, a stake in Binance in the US would provide an opportunity to participate in the potential revival of a major crypto trading platform at a time when the administration is rolling back regulatory restrictions on the industry.

The discussions, if confirmed, also raise unprecedented conflict of interest questions as Trump continues to mix his presidential powers and business interests. 

Unlike previous presidents who placed assets in blind trusts, Trump has kept his holdings under family control while they continue pursuing business deals.

The news came as United Arab Emirates-based fund MGX, headed by the brother of the UAE's president, on Thursday announced it has invested $2 billion to take a minority stake in Binance.

State-backed MGX is also involved in Stargate, the United States' major artificial intelligence infrastructure project, that has been championed by Trump.

 Gaza's civil defence agency reported that its crews had exhumed 48 bodies on Thursday from the courtyard of Al-Shifa Hospital, once Gaza's biggest medical facility but now largely in ruins following multiple Israeli assaults during the war. 

 The agency has carried out similar work in the past to return remains to their families if they can be identified, or failing that, to remove them and give them a proper burial elsewhere. 

 Rescuers handed over 38 bodies after they were identified by their relatives, who took them to be reinterred in other cemeteries, agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP Thursday. 

 ""The other 10 exhumed bodies were handed over to the forensic department at the ministry of health for identification,"" he said. 

 Bassal added that around 160 bodies remained buried within the hospital complex and that the process of exhumation would continue for several days. 

 AFP footage showed rescuers digging in parts of the courtyard and removing white bags reportedly containing human remains, which were then wrapped in blankets and carried away. 

 Gaza resident Mohammed Abu Asi, who identified the body of his brother, had come to the hospital to receive the remains. 

 ""It's like experiencing the war all over again. Recovering my brother's body feels as though we are burying him today the pain and the wound have reopened,"" he told AFP. 

 Another Gaza resident, Suha al-Sharif, came to the site hoping to find her son's body. 

 ""I know what my son was wearing. That's why I came. God willing, I will find him,"" she said. 

 ""I want to find him. I'm a mother I am exhausted and do not know where my son is."" 

 Hospitals in Gaza, particularly Al-Shifa, have been repeatedly targeted by Israeli forces since the start of the war, following Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. 

 Israel has accused Hamas of using medical facilities as command centres and to hold hostages seized during the group's initial attack. 

 Gaza health workers have previously discovered bodies at Al-Shifa Hospital. 

 Last year, the United Nations Security Council expressed ""deep concern"" after reports of mass graves containing hundreds of bodies in or near hospitals in Gaza. 

 Hamas' October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, according to official Israeli figures. 

 During the attack, Palestinian militants took 251 people hostage, 58 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. 

 Israel's retaliatory military campaign has since killed at least 48,524 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN considers these figures reliable.

Officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection have deported a family with a child recovering from brain cancer.Getty Images

A 10-year-old girl who was being treated in the U.S. for brain cancer was deported along with the family to Mexico. 

Immigration authorities removed the girl, her parents and her four siblings on Feb. 4, according to NBC News. 

The family was taking their daughter to an emergency medical checkup in Houston, Texas, when they were stopped at an immigration checkpoint. 

The family had been able to pass through the checkpoint previously by showing letters from their doctors and lawyers to immigration officials, but attorney Danny Woodward of the Texas Civil Rights Project said this time that wasn't enough and they were arrested when they couldn't present legal immigration documentation.

The child's mother told NBC News that she tried to explain her child's health condition, but “they weren't interested in hearing that.”

The parents have no criminal history apart from being undocumented, Woodward told the news outlet. 

The 10-year-old was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and had surgery to remove the tumor. However, the swelling on her brain has not gone away yet, which is causing difficulties with speech and mobility. 

“It's a very difficult thing,” the mother said to NBC News. “I don't wish anyone to go through this situation.”

US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from European Union countries, in retaliation against the bloc's planned levies on US-produced whiskey.

Trump has launched trade wars against competitors and partners alike since taking office, wielding tariffs as a tool to pressure countries on commerce and other policy issues.

His latest salvo was a response to the European Union's unveiling of tariffs on $28 billion in US goods, starting in stages from April.

The EU measures -- including a sharp tariff hike on American whiskey -- were in turn retaliation against Trump's levies on steel and aluminum imports that took effect Wednesday.

""If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

Trump also renewed his harsh criticism of the bloc, singling out its 50 percent levy on US whiskey as ""nasty.""

He termed the EU ""one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World"" and said the union -- which for decades has been at the heart of a US-led Western alliance -- was formed to take advantage of the United States.

Trump later told reporters he would not bend on tariffs, be they on aluminum or steel or cars, even as European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc is ready to negotiate over the escalating duties.

France pledged to fight back against any tariffs on wine and other alcoholic beverages.

""We will not give in to threats,"" Foreign Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said Thursday on X. He added France was ""determined to retaliate.""

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television Thursday that he had plans to speak with his European counterparts, without providing details.

An EU spokesperson told AFP its trade chief has reached out to Washington.

The EU earlier said it deeply regrets the US introduction of steel and aluminum tariffs, with spokesman Olof Gill adding that it would feel the same about any future measures while urging Washington to revoke the duties.

'Devastating'

French wine and spirit exporters were angered at being put in Trump's line of fire, their federation said.

""We are fed up with being systematically sacrificed for issues unrelated to our own,"" Nicolas Ozanam, the director general of the federation, known by the acronym FEVS, said.

French wine and champagne company Taittinger added that a 200 percent tariff could bring the cost of some bottles from about $60 to over $180.

The European spirits trade group called on the EU and United States to stop using the sector as a ""bargaining chip"" in their tariffs fight.

US wine merchants and restaurant owners meanwhile also eyed Trump's threats with trepidation.

A 200 percent tariff would send business costs ""through the roof,"" said Francis Schott, a restaurant owner based in New Jersey who serves European and American wines.

Noting it is hard to substitute specific European wines, he told AFP: ""It's just business that will go away. It's devastating.""

""If I lose half of the profit I make on alcoholic beverages, my business is no longer viable,"" he said.

Europe exported nearly $5.2 billion worth of wine and champagne to the United States in 2023, according to the World Trade Organization.

EU levy 'disappointing'

US distillers, meanwhile, have called the EU's levy on American whiskey ""deeply disappointing.""

""Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in US marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,"" said Distilled Spirits Council head Chris Swonger in a Wednesday statement.

A 2018 imposition of similar tariffs led to a 20 percent drop in American whiskey exports to the European Union.

Trump's tariff wars have taken aim at Canada, Mexico and China over allegations they are not doing enough to curtail fentanyl smuggling or illegal immigration into the United States --- even if in the case of Canada the border sees negligible levels of smuggling.

He has also taken aim at commodities including steel, aluminum and copper.

Some countries like China and Canada have already imposed retaliatory tariffs.

Uncertainty over Trump's trade plans and worries that they could trigger a recession have roiled financial markets.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday reiterated his desire to annex the autonomous territory of Greenland from Denmark in the interest of ""international security.""

""I think it will happen,"" Trump told reporters at the White House alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, when asked about his vision for the annexation.

He pointed at Rutte and added the NATO chief could be ""very instrumental"" in the move.

""You know Mark, we need that for international security... we have a lot of our favorite players cruising around the coast and we have to be careful,"" he said, apparently referring to rising Chinese and Russian interest in the Arctic region.

Trump's threats to take over the resource-rich Arctic island have shined an unprecedented global spotlight on the territory, as he has previously refused to rule out the use of force to ""get Greenland.""

The US president's comments come days after Greenland's elections, with all the political parties, and the majority of the island's 57,000 inhabitants, backing independence -- though they disagree on how quickly the process should go.

Rutte said that he would not be involved in any question of Greenland becoming part of the United States, saying: ""I don't want to drag NATO in that.""

However, ""when it comes to the high north and the Arctic, you are totally right,"" Rutte said.

""The Chinese are now using these routes. We know that the Russians are rearming. We know we have lack of icebreakers.

""So the fact that the seven -- outside Russia -- seven Arctic countries working together on this under US leadership is very important to ensure that that region, that part of the world stays safe,"" Rutte said.

 By Wendell Roelf 

 CE TOWN -European Union leaders announced a 4.7 billion euro investment package during a visit to South Africa on Thursday, at a time when both are on worse terms with the United States than they have been for decades. 

 The European leaders said the visit was an opportunity to strengthen close ties with Africa's most advanced economy, coinciding with the latter's presidency of the Group of 20 nations, which U.S. officials have so far largely snubbed. 

 U.S. President Donald Trump has stunned European leaders with his pivot towards Russia in the Ukraine war, upending U.S. policy since Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022. His staunchly pro-Israel stance has brought him into conflict with South Africa over its genocide case against Israel at the World Court. 

 The U.S. administration has also interposed itself in Europe and South Africa's domestic politics, criticising Europe for attempting to isolate the far right and ignoring voters' concerns about immigrants, while cutting aid to South Africa over its efforts to address historic racial land injustice. 

 The EU trip was an opportunity to ameliorate ties, which soured when South Africa refused to outright condemn Russia's Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine. 

 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said South Africa had a vital role on the world stage as a leading voice of the Global South. 

 ""In a moment of increased confrontation and competition, we must strengthen our partnership further,"" she said. 

 She said at talks with President Cyril Ramaphosa in Cape Town that Europe wanted to help the South African economy grow. 

 ""Europe understands your potential,"" she said, sitting alongside European Council President Antonio Costa. She cited clean hydrogen, where South Africa could make use of abundant raw materials and vast renewable energy potential. 

 Ramaphosa said South Africa wanted Europe's support to transition to a low carbon economy and grow industry, and that it valued European support for multilateralism at a time of rising nationalism. 

 ""African relations with the European Union should be built on a mutually beneficial partnership,"" he said.

Donald Trump has said Vladimir Putin's comments on the US ceasefire plan are ""promising"" but incomplete - after the Russian president suggested there were ""questions"" about the proposals.

false,Thursday 13 March 2025 19:44, UK

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

After hearing Vladimir Putin's layered response to the ceasefire this afternoon, we have now had reaction from Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In his evening statement, the Ukrainian president describes Putin's words as ""very predictable"" and ""very manipulative"" and says Russia's president is preparing a rejection of the ceasefire proposal.

""Putin, of course, is afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, he wants to kill Ukrainians,"" Zelenskyy says.

""That's why they in Moscow are framing the idea of silence with such preconditions that nothing will happen at all or that it will not happen for as long as possible.""

He labels Putin's words as ""just another Russian manipulation"".

Zelenskyy continues by saying Ukraine does not ""set conditions that complicate anything"" while stating that Russia does.

""As we have always said, the only one who will drag things out, the only one who will be unconstructive, is Russia,"" he says. 

""They want a war. Putin has stolen years of peace and continues this war - day after day.""

Zelenskyy ends by calling for allies to ramp up the pressure on Putin and impose further sanctions.

We can bring you more from Vladimir Putin's news conference earlier, and while much of the attention was on his comments around the ceasefire, he did also address the situation in Kursk.

It follows his visit to the region yesterday while dressed in camouflage after Russia's military continued its advances on the front.

In his news conference, Putin said Russia had trapped the remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the western Kursk region, where they had clung on for more than seven months in one of the war's key battles.

He said the troops were cut off inside the invasion zone, and issued a warning to the Ukrainian forces still in the area. 

""If a physical blockade occurs in the coming days, then no one will be able to leave at all, there will only be two ways - to surrender or die,"" he said.

Ukraine's incursion into the region last August came as a major surprise, and aimed to divert Russian forces from elsewhere on the frontlines while also taking land to trade for its own captured territory.

But with the support of troops from its ally North Korea, Russian forces have gradually been clawing back the lost ground, heightening the pressure on Ukraine.

You can watch the footage of Putin visiting Kursk in the video below...

Donald Trump has been hosting NATO's secretary general at the White House - but with the world's media assembled in the Oval Office, he took the opportunity to also discuss the ceasefire.

Trump has been increasing the pressure on Vladimir Putin to agree to the proposals, with his envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow for talks right now.

Watch what the US president had to say in the video below....

Vladimir Putin does not expect to give up regions of Ukraine as part of a peace deal, nor does he expect Volodymyr Zelenskyy to remain as Ukraine's president, an expert has told Sky News.

Baroness Catherine Ashton, the former EU high representative for foreign affairs, said this afternoon's news conference with Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, was ""really interesting"".

She told our presenter Kamali Melbourne that Putin ""says he supports the idea of a ceasefire"".

What follows, though, is a ""whole series of details"".

These include: ""Who monitors the ceasefire, how will we know when it's being violated, what happens if it is, does it lead on to talks for peace, what does that look like, and who's in the room?""

There is also the issue of Russia ""making sure it's in the best possible position"".

Such matters will lead to ""very difficult conversations, I think, for the American envoy to have this evening"", Ashton commented.

The negotiation is being set up as ""Russia and America decides"", she said.

Putin ""expects that Zelenskyy won't be there"" afterwards.

""He expects that he will not be returning parts of Ukraine to Ukraine."" 

Our security and defence analyst Michael Clarke says Vladimir Putin's response to the ceasefire comes as no surprise.

""This is the way the Russians always do things and they think they are doing very well in the war and are actually now in control of the diplomacy of this,"" he said.

Clarke explained that the main question is over how far Russia can push Donald Trump.

""The danger for Europe is that Trump will be so anxious for a deal that he will press the Ukrainians on all sorts of really important things,"" he said.

""The Americans have now demonstrated through the use of intelligence, turning it off and back on again, they know they have got a tap, they could turn up the pressure or turn down the pressure,"" Clarke said.

He added that this left Ukraine in a ""very difficult"" situation.

As we've been reporting, Vladimir Putin has given his first response to the ceasefire, but his answer wasn't exactly definitive.

While he said Russia agrees with the proposal, he indicated its position is based on the assumption that it would lead to ""long-term peace"" and ""something that would remove the initial reasons for the crisis"".

Watch what he had to say when asked about the ceasefire in the video below...

While it is perhaps more tangentially related to the war in Ukraine, Trump has given some new remarks on another recurring topic of his presidency - expressing confidence that the United States will annex Greenland.

""I think that will happen,"" he told reporters during the meeting in the Oval Office.

""I didn't give it much thought before, but I'm sitting with a man that could be very instrumental [NATO chief Mark Rutte].

""You know, Mark, you need that for international security, not just security.

""It's really a very appropriate question, thank you.""

Greenland's pro-business opposition Demokraatit party, which wants a slow approach to independence from Denmark, won Tuesday's parliamentary election. Trump said that election was good for the US - although his latest comments are unlikely to go down well in Denmark, which has repeatedly said Greenland is not for sale. 

By Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent

Vladimir Putin was never going to flat out reject the US proposal for a ceasefire, but he also wasn't going to fully endorse it either. Russia's agreement, as expected, comes with several strings attached.

The Kremlin leader didn't specify Moscow's demands but he did allude to them by saying that any peace deal had to eliminate the ""root causes"" of the conflict. 

It's become a frequent refrain of his, and shows that Moscow's maximalist position hasn't changed. By ""root causes"", the Russian president is referring to NATO's eastward expansion, which he blames as the catalyst for the war in Ukraine.

It's a very clear indication that his agreement to a ceasefire relies on getting some kind of security guarantees of his own, eg a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO, or that there'll never be any European peacekeeping forces from NATO members based in the country in the future.

He also articulated why Moscow is reluctant to agree to an immediate truce, talking at length about his forces' advances in the Kursk region. 

Ukraine's incursion there has been humiliating for the Kremlin, but their expulsion is finally within reach. Vladimir Putin doesn't want that opportunity to slip away. By pausing Russia's offensive, he fears they'll lose the advantage and give the enemy time to regroup.

Vladimir Putin was, however, careful to thank Donald Trump for his efforts in trying to reach a peace agreement, perhaps wary of any backlash from the White House. But despite that, he still doesn't appear to be showing any sign of compromise.

So in many ways, it feels like nothing has changed.

We are now seeing some comments from Donald Trump in his news conference with Mark Rutte that indicate a potentially significant change of tone on NATO.

As mentioned in our previous post, the US president has praised NATO's secretary general for doing ""some really good work"", and has also told reporters NATO ""is stepping up"".

Both before and since his election, Trump has repeatedly criticised NATO countries for not meeting the current member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defence - and said they should pay even more.

He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts a burden on the US.

While his recent public pronouncements on the alliance have been heavily critical, leaders of fellow member countries will be hopeful his remarks today represent a shift in the White House's stance.

Trump also told reporters that he noticed ""very few people were paying"" when he first went to NATO, adding that if they were, they were not paying their ""fair share"".

He says he was able to raise ""hundreds of billions of dollars... the money started pouring in"" and claims the alliance became much stronger because of his actions.

Meanwhile, Rutte has urged NATO to produce more weapons, stating the alliance is not doing enough and is lagging behind Russia and China.

Donald Trump has taken his seat in the Oval Office alongside NATO's secretary general Mark Rutte - with the US president using the opportunity to update the media on the ceasefire proposal.

He tells reporters that his envoy Steve Witkoff is in serious discussions in Russia - Witkoff is expected to meet Vladimir Putin shortly.

""Hopefully Russia will do the right thing,"" he says, repeating that he would like to see a ceasefire from Russia.

He tells reporters that a peace deal ""shouldn't be very complicated"" and urges all parties to get the process over with quickly.

Trump: Putin's statement 'wasn't complete'

Trump also addressed Putin's news conference with ally and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

He says the Russian president put out a promising statement, but insists it was not complete, and reiterated he is willing to talk to Putin about the ceasefire proposal.

The US president has also broken away from his high-profile criticism of NATO and praised Rutte for his role, saying he has been doing ""some really good work"".

 ANKARA - Turkey's foreign minister, defence minister and the head of the MIT intelligence agency are in Damascus on a working visit, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, without providing details. 

 The visit follows the outbreak of sectarian violence in Syria this week, pitting the security forces from Syria's new Islamist-led government - backed by Turkey - against fighters from toppled President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite minority. 

 It also follows an agreement between the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces and Syrian government to integrate the group into Syria's institutions. In exchange, the agreement provides for the transfer of state SDF-controlled civilian and military institutions in northeast Syria, as well as border crossings, an airport and oil and gas fields there. 

 Turkey regards the SDF, which controls much of northeastern Syria, as a terrorist group linked with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party militant group, which has waged a decades-old insurgency against the Turkish state for over 40 years. 

 The PKK is deemed a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. 

 Since the ousting of Assad last year by rebels, some of whom have been backed by Turkey for years, Ankara has repeatedly said the YPG militia, which spearheads the SDF, must disarm, disband, and send its foreign fighters out of Syria. 

 Turkey has mounted several cross-border operations against the YPG in recent years, and a Defence Ministry official said on Wednesday that attacks on Kurdish militants in Syria were still continuing. 

 Turkey has welcomed the SDF-Damascus deal, but said it would need to see its implementation to ensure the YPG does not end up joining Syrian state institutions or security forces as a bloc, while maintaining its demands from the group. 

 Last month, the jailed leader of the PKK called on the group to disarm, after which the militants announced they would cease all hostilities, while calling for more freedoms for its leader. 

 Ankara has become one of the main foreign allies of the new Syrian government since rebels ended Assad's rule, vowing to help rebuild the country and help train its armed forces.

Canada is hunting for ways to respond to President Trump's tariff threats, and some of the most forceful pushback has come not from national leaders but from Doug Ford, the head of the country's most populous province.

 When Trump said earlier this month that he would levy 25% tariffs on many Canadian goods, it was Ford who announced that Ontario would in turn levy a 25% export tax on electricity that the province sends to 1.5 million homes in Minnesota, New York and Michigan.  The next day, Ford backed off after Trump threatened to double the tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum, and Ford spoke directly with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The two men agreed to meet Thursday in Washington. With Canada awaiting a snap election expected to be called soon, Ford has become the unlikely face of Canadian resistance in Trump's trade war. It is a surprising place to find a provincial leader who lived in the U.S. for years and once described Trump as a “marketing genius” who would unleash economic prosperity with lower taxes. Ford, who is 60 years old and won re-election in Ontario last month, is known in Canada as a right-leaning pragmatist. After militants attacked Israel in 2023, he called local pro-Palestinian demonstrations “hate rallies,” and he has come out against medically supervised facilities for drug users promoted by activists and politicians in some Canadian cities. “He is somebody who I think can speak the language of Trump voters perhaps better than other politicians here in Canada,” said Kory Teneycke, Ford's campaign manager. Though he is chairman of the Council of the Federation, a group of the leaders of Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories, Ford has no official voice in the state-to-state negotiations between Canada and the U.S. But Ford has been increasingly vocal in his opposition to Trump's tariff plans, which was key to Ford's re-election campaign. He has warned Americans on CNN that a trade war would lead to “absolute chaos” and cause factories to close and prices to increase. On CNBC, he said the economic downturn would be referred to as the “Trump recession.” On Fox News, he urged the Trump administration to work with Canada, which he called the U.S.'s “treasured ally,” to create a more prosperous and secure North America. In January, he appeared on TV wearing a “Canada Is Not for Sale” hat. “He's seen the vacuum that has existed at the federal level and has stepped in and tried to take a harder line,” said Eric Miller, a Canadian who is the Washington-based president of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group, a consulting firm that works on cross-border issues. Ford's moves have caught Trump's attention. On Tuesday, Trump referred to Ford as a “gentleman,” and said, “As you know there's a very strong man in Canada who said he was going to charge a surcharge or a tariff on electricity coming into our country.” “He's not going to do that,” Trump said. “It would have been a very bad thing if he did, and he's not going to do that, so I respect that.” In an interview, Ford said he backed off on his threat to tax electricity exports after speaking with Lutnick. “It's not weakness,” he said. “When someone reaches out to you and offers you an olive branch, you take it. The worst thing you can do in a negotiation is hang up and walk away from the table.” Ford's high profile reflects Canada's current political transition. Justin Trudeau's tenure as prime minister effectively ended Sunday, when his Liberal Party chose Mark Carney as its new leader. Carney won't officially become Canada's leader until Friday, according to a person familiar with the plans.  He is then expected to call a general election, leaving Canada's leadership in caretaker mode until a new government is chosen. Doug Ford, who became Ontario premier in 2018, lived for many years in Chicago. Canadian reciprocal tariffs take effect Thursday, and Carney has said he plans to continue Canada's strategy of responding to Trump's tariffs with targeted duties of its own. Carney's Liberal Party, which is likely to face voters in a matter of weeks, has risen in the polls as Canadians react to the tariff threats. Ford met Wednesday with Carney and said the two leaders agreed that Canada needs to push back against Trump. “We're going to have to respond, dollar-for-dollar, tariff-for-tariff,” said Ford. Ford and Lutnick will be joined at Thursday's meeting in Washington by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S. “Do we think we're walking away with a whole deal? No. That's going to take a while to run through,” Ford said in the interview. “It's all about building a relationship, and the quicker we can build a relationship, the quicker we can discuss what their needs are and what our needs are.” Other Canadian provincial premiers are also stepping in. On Tuesday, Danielle Smith, the leader of the oil-rich province of Alberta, met with the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. She previously had traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to lobby for the province's energy industry, which sends more than four million barrels of oil a day to the U.S. A senior government official said Trudeau's center-left government had a good relationship with Ford, despite ideological differences. The nature of Trump's threats has made it difficult to know what the most effective retaliation strategy is, said the official. Trump's forceful reaction to Ford's gambit reinforces the impression that access to energy and other resources remains a sensitive issue for the Trump administration, the official said. Ford entered politics 25 years ago as the campaign manager and top aide for his younger brother, Rob Ford, the former mayor of Toronto whose political career ended in 2014 after a video surfaced of him smoking crack. The brothers led a populist movement that they termed “Ford Nation” and that called for cutting waste at city hall, challenging organized labor and privatizing garbage collection. While trimming the city budget, the brothers took part in public weight-loss challenges. Ford, who became Ontario premier in 2018, lived for many years in Chicago, where he ran the U.S. operations of a printing company founded by his father. Before every interview, Ford says how much he loves the U.S. and the American people. But he has said that Canada and his Ontario government have been forced to respond to an “unprovoked attack” by Trump. He has warned that Trump's tariffs will cause the U.S. stock markets to “go downhill quicker than the American bobsled team.” “This chaos has to stop,” said Ford.

“He's not going to do that,” Trump said. “It would have been a very bad thing if he did, and he's not going to do that, so I respect that.”

In an interview, Ford said he backed off on his threat to tax electricity exports after speaking with Lutnick. “It's not weakness,” he said. “When someone reaches out to you and offers you an olive branch, you take it. The worst thing you can do in a negotiation is hang up and walk away from the table.”

Ford's high profile reflects Canada's current political transition. Justin Trudeau's tenure as prime minister effectively ended Sunday, when his Liberal Party chose Mark Carney as its new leader. Carney won't officially become Canada's leader until Friday, according to a person familiar with the plans.  He is then expected to call a general election, leaving Canada's leadership in caretaker mode until a new government is chosen.

Canadian reciprocal tariffs take effect Thursday, and Carney has said he plans to continue Canada's strategy of responding to Trump's tariffs with targeted duties of its own. Carney's Liberal Party, which is likely to face voters in a matter of weeks, has risen in the polls as Canadians react to the tariff threats.

Ford met Wednesday with Carney and said the two leaders agreed that Canada needs to push back against Trump. “We're going to have to respond, dollar-for-dollar, tariff-for-tariff,” said Ford.

Ford and Lutnick will be joined at Thursday's meeting in Washington by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S.

“Do we think we're walking away with a whole deal? No. That's going to take a while to run through,” Ford said in the interview. “It's all about building a relationship, and the quicker we can build a relationship, the quicker we can discuss what their needs are and what our needs are.”

Other Canadian provincial premiers are also stepping in. On Tuesday, Danielle Smith, the leader of the oil-rich province of Alberta, met with the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. She previously had traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to lobby for the province's energy industry, which sends more than four million barrels of oil a day to the U.S.

A senior government official said Trudeau's center-left government had a good relationship with Ford, despite ideological differences. The nature of Trump's threats has made it difficult to know what the most effective retaliation strategy is, said the official. Trump's forceful reaction to Ford's gambit reinforces the impression that access to energy and other resources remains a sensitive issue for the Trump administration, the official said.

Ford entered politics 25 years ago as the campaign manager and top aide for his younger brother, Rob Ford, the former mayor of Toronto whose political career ended in 2014 after a video surfaced of him smoking crack. The brothers led a populist movement that they termed “Ford Nation” and that called for cutting waste at city hall, challenging organized labor and privatizing garbage collection. While trimming the city budget, the brothers took part in public weight-loss challenges.

Ford, who became Ontario premier in 2018, lived for many years in Chicago, where he ran the U.S. operations of a printing company founded by his father. Before every interview, Ford says how much he loves the U.S. and the American people.

But he has said that Canada and his Ontario government have been forced to respond to an “unprovoked attack” by Trump. He has warned that Trump's tariffs will cause the U.S. stock markets to “go downhill quicker than the American bobsled team.”

“This chaos has to stop,” said Ford.

Russia claimed Thursday that its troops have driven the Ukrainian army out of the biggest town in Russia's Kursk border region, as a senior Kremlin official said that a US-proposed 30-day ceasefire in the war three years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine would help Kyiv by giving its weary and short-handed military a break.

The Russian Defence Ministry's claim that it recaptured the town of Sudzha, hours after President Vladimir Putin visited his commanders in Kursk and wore military fatigues, could not be independently verified. Ukrainian officials made no immediate comment on the claim.

The renewed Russian military push and Putin's high-profile visit to his troops came as US President Donald Trump presses for a diplomatic end to the war. The US Tuesday lifted its March 3 suspension of military aid for Kyiv after senior US and Ukrainian officials made progress on how to stop the fighting during talks held in Saudi Arabia.

Trump said Wednesday that “it's up to Russia now” as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire. The US president has made veiled threats to hit Russia with new sanctions if it won't engage with peace efforts.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that US negotiators were on their way to Russia, but he wouldn't comment on Moscow's view of the ceasefire proposal.

“Before the talks start, and they haven't started yet, it would be wrong to talk about it in public,” he told reporters.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that national security adviser Mike Waltz spoke Wednesday with his Russian counterpart. She also confirmed that Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff will head to Moscow for talks with Russian officials, possibly including Putin.

Russian news agencies reported Thursday that Witkoff's plane had landed in Moscow. It wasn't immediately possible to verify the reports.

Senior US officials say they hope to see Russia stop attacks on Ukraine within the next few days.

But Yuri Ushakov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy adviser, complained in televised remarks Thursday that a ceasefire would grant a “temporary break for the Ukrainian military.”

Ushakov said that Moscow wants a “long-term peaceful settlement that takes into account Moscow's interests and concerns.” His comments came a day after his phone call with Waltz.

Ushakov's comments echoed statements from Putin, who has repeatedly said a temporary ceasefire would benefit Ukraine and its Western allies.

The US still has about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding for future arms shipments to Ukraine, but the Trump administration has shown no interest so far in using that authority to send additional weapons as it awaits the outcome of peace overtures.

By signalling its openness to a ceasefire, Ukraine has presented the Kremlin with a dilemma at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war — whether to accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington.

The Ukrainian army's foothold inside Russia has been under intense pressure for months from a renewed effort by Russian forces, backed by North Korean troops. Ukraine's daring incursion last August led to the first occupation of Russian soil by foreign troops since World War II and embarrassed the Kremlin.

Speaking to commanders Wednesday, Putin said he expected the military “to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future.”

Putin added that in the future “it's necessary to think about creating a security zone alongside the state border,” in a signal that Moscow could try to expand its territorial gains by capturing parts of Ukraine's neighbouring Sumy region. That idea could complicate a ceasefire deal.

Ukraine launched the raid in a bid to counter the unceasingly glum news from the front line, as well as draw Russian troops away from the battlefield inside Ukraine and gain a bargaining chip in any peace talks. But the incursion didn't significantly change the dynamic of the war.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, assessed late Wednesday that Russian forces were in control of Sudzha, a town close to the border that previously was home to about 5,000 people.

Ukraine's top military head, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said late Wednesday that Russian aviation had carried out an unprecedented number of strikes on Kursk and that as a result Sudzha had been almost completely destroyed. He did not comment on whether Ukraine still controlled the settlement but said it was “maneuvering (troops) to more advantageous lines.”

Meanwhile, Major General Dmytro Krasylnykov, commander of Ukraine's Northern Operational Command, which includes the Kursk region, was dismissed from his post, he told Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne on Wednesday. He told the outlet he was not given a reason for his dismissal, saying “I'm guessing, but I don't want to talk about it yet.” (AP) ZH ZH

Donald Trump has said Vladimir Putin's comments on the US ceasefire plan are ""promising"" but incomplete - after the Russian president suggested there were ""questions"" about the proposals.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

After hearing Vladimir Putin's layered response to the ceasefire this afternoon, we have now had reaction from Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In his evening statement, the Ukrainian president describes Putin's words as ""very predictable"" and ""very manipulative"" and says Russia's president is preparing a rejection of the ceasefire proposal.

""Putin, of course, is afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, he wants to kill Ukrainians,"" Zelenskyy says.

""That's why they in Moscow are framing the idea of silence with such preconditions that nothing will happen at all or that it will not happen for as long as possible.""

He labels Putin's words as ""just another Russian manipulation"".

Zelenskyy continues by saying Ukraine does not ""set conditions that complicate anything"" while stating that Russia does.

""As we have always said, the only one who will drag things out, the only one who will be unconstructive, is Russia,"" he says. 

""They want a war. Putin has stolen years of peace and continues this war - day after day.""

Zelenskyy ends by calling for allies to ramp up the pressure on Putin and impose further sanctions.

We can bring you more from Vladimir Putin's news conference earlier, and while much of the attention was on his comments around the ceasefire, he did also address the situation in Kursk.

It follows his visit to the region yesterday while dressed in camouflage after Russia's military continued its advances on the front.

In his news conference, Putin said Russia had trapped the remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the western Kursk region, where they had clung on for more than seven months in one of the war's key battles.

He said the troops were cut off inside the invasion zone, and issued a warning to the Ukrainian forces still in the area. 

""If a physical blockade occurs in the coming days, then no one will be able to leave at all, there will only be two ways - to surrender or die,"" he said.

Ukraine's incursion into the region last August came as a major surprise, and aimed to divert Russian forces from elsewhere on the frontlines while also taking land to trade for its own captured territory.

But with the support of troops from its ally North Korea, Russian forces have gradually been clawing back the lost ground, heightening the pressure on Ukraine.

You can watch the footage of Putin visiting Kursk in the video below...

Donald Trump has been hosting NATO's secretary general at the White House - but with the world's media assembled in the Oval Office, he took the opportunity to also discuss the ceasefire.

Trump has been increasing the pressure on Vladimir Putin to agree to the proposals, with his envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow for talks right now.

Watch what the US president had to say in the video below....

Vladimir Putin does not expect to give up regions of Ukraine as part of a peace deal, nor does he expect Volodymyr Zelenskyy to remain as Ukraine's president, an expert has told Sky News.

Baroness Catherine Ashton, the former EU high representative for foreign affairs, said this afternoon's news conference with Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, was ""really interesting"".

She told our presenter Kamali Melbourne that Putin ""says he supports the idea of a ceasefire"".

What follows, though, is a ""whole series of details"".

These include: ""Who monitors the ceasefire, how will we know when it's being violated, what happens if it is, does it lead on to talks for peace, what does that look like, and who's in the room?""

There is also the issue of Russia ""making sure it's in the best possible position"".

Such matters will lead to ""very difficult conversations, I think, for the American envoy to have this evening"", Ashton commented.

The negotiation is being set up as ""Russia and America decides"", she said.

Putin ""expects that Zelenskyy won't be there"" afterwards.

""He expects that he will not be returning parts of Ukraine to Ukraine."" 

Our security and defence analyst Michael Clarke says Vladimir Putin's response to the ceasefire comes as no surprise.

""This is the way the Russians always do things and they think they are doing very well in the war and are actually now in control of the diplomacy of this,"" he said.

Clarke explained that the main question is over how far Russia can push Donald Trump.

""The danger for Europe is that Trump will be so anxious for a deal that he will press the Ukrainians on all sorts of really important things,"" he said.

""The Americans have now demonstrated through the use of intelligence, turning it off and back on again, they know they have got a tap, they could turn up the pressure or turn down the pressure,"" Clarke said.

He added that this left Ukraine in a ""very difficult"" situation.

As we've been reporting, Vladimir Putin has given his first response to the ceasefire, but his answer wasn't exactly definitive.

While he said Russia agrees with the proposal, he indicated its position is based on the assumption that it would lead to ""long-term peace"" and ""something that would remove the initial reasons for the crisis"".

Watch what he had to say when asked about the ceasefire in the video below...

While it is perhaps more tangentially related to the war in Ukraine, Trump has given some new remarks on another recurring topic of his presidency - expressing confidence that the United States will annex Greenland.

""I think that will happen,"" he told reporters during the meeting in the Oval Office.

""I didn't give it much thought before, but I'm sitting with a man that could be very instrumental [NATO chief Mark Rutte].

""You know, Mark, you need that for international security, not just security.

""It's really a very appropriate question, thank you.""

Greenland's pro-business opposition Demokraatit party, which wants a slow approach to independence from Denmark, won Tuesday's parliamentary election. Trump said that election was good for the US - although his latest comments are unlikely to go down well in Denmark, which has repeatedly said Greenland is not for sale. 

By Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent

Vladimir Putin was never going to flat out reject the US proposal for a ceasefire, but he also wasn't going to fully endorse it either. Russia's agreement, as expected, comes with several strings attached.

The Kremlin leader didn't specify Moscow's demands but he did allude to them by saying that any peace deal had to eliminate the ""root causes"" of the conflict. 

It's become a frequent refrain of his, and shows that Moscow's maximalist position hasn't changed. By ""root causes"", the Russian president is referring to NATO's eastward expansion, which he blames as the catalyst for the war in Ukraine.

It's a very clear indication that his agreement to a ceasefire relies on getting some kind of security guarantees of his own, eg a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO, or that there'll never be any European peacekeeping forces from NATO members based in the country in the future.

He also articulated why Moscow is reluctant to agree to an immediate truce, talking at length about his forces' advances in the Kursk region. 

Ukraine's incursion there has been humiliating for the Kremlin, but their expulsion is finally within reach. Vladimir Putin doesn't want that opportunity to slip away. By pausing Russia's offensive, he fears they'll lose the advantage and give the enemy time to regroup.

Vladimir Putin was, however, careful to thank Donald Trump for his efforts in trying to reach a peace agreement, perhaps wary of any backlash from the White House. But despite that, he still doesn't appear to be showing any sign of compromise.

So in many ways, it feels like nothing has changed.

We are now seeing some comments from Donald Trump in his news conference with Mark Rutte that indicate a potentially significant change of tone on NATO.

As mentioned in our previous post, the US president has praised NATO's secretary general for doing ""some really good work"", and has also told reporters NATO ""is stepping up"".

Both before and since his election, Trump has repeatedly criticised NATO countries for not meeting the current member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defence - and said they should pay even more.

He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts a burden on the US.

While his recent public pronouncements on the alliance have been heavily critical, leaders of fellow member countries will be hopeful his remarks today represent a shift in the White House's stance.

Trump also told reporters that he noticed ""very few people were paying"" when he first went to NATO, adding that if they were, they were not paying their ""fair share"".

He says he was able to raise ""hundreds of billions of dollars... the money started pouring in"" and claims the alliance became much stronger because of his actions.

Meanwhile, Rutte has urged NATO to produce more weapons, stating the alliance is not doing enough and is lagging behind Russia and China.

Donald Trump has taken his seat in the Oval Office alongside NATO's secretary general Mark Rutte - with the US president using the opportunity to update the media on the ceasefire proposal.

He tells reporters that his envoy Steve Witkoff is in serious discussions in Russia - Witkoff is expected to meet Vladimir Putin shortly.

""Hopefully Russia will do the right thing,"" he says, repeating that he would like to see a ceasefire from Russia.

He tells reporters that a peace deal ""shouldn't be very complicated"" and urges all parties to get the process over with quickly.

Trump: Putin's statement 'wasn't complete'

Trump also addressed Putin's news conference with ally and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

He says the Russian president put out a promising statement, but insists it was not complete, and reiterated he is willing to talk to Putin about the ceasefire proposal.

The US president has also broken away from his high-profile criticism of NATO and praised Rutte for his role, saying he has been doing ""some really good work"".

Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk A/S is planning to make more of its medicines for the US market in the country; Boeing Co. risks a gummed up supply chain and higher aircraft costs it may not be able to pass on; Chinese online retailer Shein Group Ltd. is offering incentives to its top apparel providers to set up new production capacity in Vietnam.

Companies across the world are looking for cover from President Donald Trump's frenzied tariff barrage, planning for the worst even as reversals and exemptions leave them desperately seeking clarity.

In corporate suites, executives are counting the potential cost of the tariffs, its impact on sales, profits and market shares. Many companies are putting “tariff task forces” in place as they look to mitigate the pain from the measures.

In his early weeks in office, Trump imposed tariffs on about $1.4 trillion of goods imports from Canada, Mexico and China — more than triple the $380 billion worth of Chinese merchandise hit with such levies during his first term, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation. He later delayed and scaled back those threats on Canada and Mexico. But his efforts to rewire the US economy have rattled financial markets.

They have also left companies from carmakers Stellantis NV and Volkswagen AG to pharmaceutical firms Sandoz Group AG and Eli Lilly & Co. and retailers Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and Temu struggling to work out the impact and come up with a response. The confusion stems in part from how inextricably intertwined global commerce has become over the last few decades, making the outcome of such measures difficult to predict, according to Florent Menegaux, tiremaker Michelin's chief executive officer.

“In a globalized world, the mechanisms are very complex. If you start to put tariffs, it becomes very, very delicate to understand what are going to be the consequences,” he said in an interview, noting for instance that for a vehicle assembled in the US, parts can cross borders 53 times — making tariffs a logistical nightmare.

While companies are still sifting through the ever-changing policy statements, there are some broad strands emerging. Many, like European automotive parts companies Continental AG, Schaeffler AG and Valeo SE say they have no choice but to pass on the higher costs to consumers.

“For us it's clear: We cannot bear additional duties, and we are informing our customers about that,” Continental Chief Financial Officer Olaf Schick said in an interview. The German company has 20 plants in Mexico and generated a fifth of its group sales in the US last year.

The Trump administration is betting that tariffs can remake the US economy by forcing businesses that sell to customers in the country to make their products locally. While companies from tiremaker Pirelli & C SpA and pharma giant Eli Lilly are among several that have pledged to increase their US output, industrial groups warn that such projects could take a long time.

“A tire plant is not a simple assembly plant,” said Michelin's Menegaux. “The minimum investment for a tire plant is $600 million. If you go as fast as possible, it takes three years before you can produce the first tire.” In the near term, the company will have no choice but to raise prices, he said.

Not all companies will be able to pass on the higher costs. Stellantis and Volkswagen could see the tariffs on vehicles they import from Mexico and Canada wiping out €5.21 billion of their earnings this year, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. S&P this month downgraded Stellantis' debt, citing the potential impact.

The owner of the Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and Dodge brands may import around 417,000 vehicles into the US this year from the two countries, according to BI senior industry analyst Michael Dean, who says intense competition and overcapacity mean it has “limited scope to pass this additional cost onto buyers.”

The automakers may eventually also face more levies on their imports from Europe. Trump has threatened 25% tariffs on the European Union, and pharmaceuticals, cars and agriculture have been identified as industries of particular concern.

If that happens, it makes it “more difficult for us because we import a lot of cars into the US from Europe,” said Volvo Car AB CEO Jim Rowan. “So then we need to start thinking about manufacturing more cars in the US. We have capacity in Charleston. So we could do that.”

For Boeing, while the tariffs will drive up costs for parts like the landing gear it purchases from Canada, the bigger worry is that procuring components will become difficult. CEO Kelly Ortberg told workers during a company-wide address that tariffs could turn into “a continuity of supply issue.”

Keeping supplies moving smoothly are also a concern for US retailers like Target and Walmart that source their wares from countries like China. They are expecting potential price increases even though they are not yet sure what the tariffs will entail.

“Depending on the level of tariffs, we're going to have to take some level of action,” Target CEO Brian Cornell told reporters last week.

Walmart has asked some Chinese suppliers to lower their prices by as much as 10% per round of tariffs, essentially getting them to help shoulder the cost of Trump's duties. That's creating angst among some vendors, already working with razor-thin margins, and has drawn the ire of the Chinese government.

Online shopping giant Temu has gone so far as to make tweaks to its business model, giving up substantial control of its Chinese supply in the face of new tariffs. At the risk of driving up prices on the budget shopping app, the company is asking factories to ship their own products in bulk to American warehouses, adopting what it calls a “half-custody” framework where it only manages the online marketplace.

Some companies like Switzerland's Galderma Group AG — maker of the popular skin cream Cetaphil — are looking for other markets to offset some of the effects of tariffs.

“We always have the opportunity to shift sales to the international markets where we have very, very strong progress,” CEO Flemming Ornskov said in an interview.

But that might be easier said than done. The US makes up around 40% of Galderma's sales.

For drugmakers, the impact will depend on whether the actual product or the active pharmaceutical ingredient is targeted, industry executives said. If it's the latter, many of the biggest drug companies would be hit since that base ingredient is largely produced in China and India, they said.

Sandoz, which manufactures generic drugs largely outside of the US, said it's unlikely to increase manufacturing in the country unless there are fundamental changes in how drugs are purchased, suggesting prices of its medicines will rise.

“In the short term, I think it will drive even more patient-access instability,” the Swiss company's CEO, Richard Saynor, said in an interview. In the medium term, pricing increases will be passed on to payers and ultimately to patients, he said.

Eli Lilly, meanwhile, said it will spend at least $27 billion to build four US manufacturing plants that will come online within the next five years, three of which will make active ingredients.

For its part, Pfizer Inc. is more vulnerable to tariffs on the EU, where the drugmaker has manufacturing plants, CEO Albert Bourla said. The company has at least 10 plants across Europe, according to its website.

“We are waiting to see how that could play out,” the executive said.

Taiwan plans to reinstate military judges to hear Chinese espionage cases involving Taiwanese service members, President Lai Ching-te said Thursday.

The number of people prosecuted for spying for Beijing has soared, with retired and serving members of Taiwan's military the main targets of Chinese infiltration efforts, official figures show.

China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring it under its control.

Taiwan says China also uses ""grey zone"" tactics, including espionage, cyberattacks and disinformation, to weaken its defences.

Lai said that there would a review and an amendment to the law ""to reinstate the military trial system"", he told reporters after a national security meeting.

""Military judges will return to the front line,"" Lai said.

He said military judges would work ""alongside prosecutorial and judicial agencies to handle criminal cases involving active-duty military personnel accused of treason, aiding the enemy, leaking classified information, dereliction of duty, insubordination, and other military offences"".

Taiwan's intelligence agency has said previously that 64 people were prosecuted for Chinese espionage in 2024, compared with 48 in 2023, and 10 in 2022.

Retired and serving members of the military were the main targets of China's infiltration efforts, Taiwan's National Security Bureau said.

Taiwan disbanded the military court system after the death of a young corporal in 2013.

Hung Chung-chiu died of heatstroke apparently after being forced to exercise excessively as punishment for taking a smartphone onto his base -- just days before the end of his compulsory year-long military service.

Both sides of the Taiwan Strait have been spying on each other for decades.

But analysts have warned that espionage is a bigger problem for Taiwan, which faces the existential threat of a Chinese invasion.

In recent years, China has ramped the deployment of fighter jets and warships around the island, and sought to erase Taiwan from the international stage by poaching its diplomatic allies and blocking it from global forums.

 A UK court on Thursday upheld lengthy prison terms handed to the father and stepmother of a 10-year-old British-Pakistani girl who was killed after suffering years of torture and abuse. 

 The trial of Urfan Sharif and his wife Beinash Batool caused waves of revulsion in the UK at the horrific way they had treated Sara Sharif. 

 There was anger too at how the bright, bubbly youngster had been failed by the authorities supposed to be in charge of her care. 

 Sharif, 43, Batool, 30, and her uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, all lost bids on Thursday to appeal against their sentences. 

 The court also refused a plea by the solicitor general's office to impose a stiffer whole-life sentence on Sharif. 

 Sara's father was sentenced in December to 40 years in prison for her murder, while her stepmother was ordered to remain in jail for at least 33 years. 

 Her uncle was sentenced to 16 years after being found guilty of causing or allowing her death. 

 Sara's body was found in bed at the family home in August 2023 covered in bites and bruises with broken bones and burns inflicted by an electric iron and boiling water. 

 Seeking to reduce Sharif's term, lawyer Naeem Majid Mian argued that although Sara's treatment had been ""horrendous"" it did not merit his 40-year sentence. 

 ""There was no intention to kill... and was not premeditated,"" he added. 

 But documents submitted to the court on behalf of the solicitor general, one of the government's top legal officers, called for Sharif to have an indefinite sentence imposed. 

 ""It is submitted that the judge was wrong not to impose a whole life order on the offender,"" said lawyer Tom Little in a text submission. 

 A lawyer for Sara's stepmother also told the court that her sentence of 33 years was too long and did not ""justly reflect her role"". 

 Dismissing Sharif's appeal, Lady Chief Justice Sue Carr, the highest-ranking judge in England and Wales, said: ""We can see no arguable basis to challenge the conclusion of the trial judge."" 

 Passing sentence in December after the trial, judge John Cavanagh said Sara had been subjected to ""acts of extreme cruelty"" but that Sharif and Batool had not shown ""a shred of remorse"". 

 They had treated Sara as ""worthless"" and as ""a skivvy"", because she was a girl. And because she was not Batool's child by birth, the stepmother had failed to protect her, he said. 

 ""This poor child was battered with great force again and again.""

 A post-mortem examination of Sara's body revealed she had 71 fresh injuries and at least 25 broken bones. 

 She had been beaten with a metal pole and cricket bat and ""trussed up"" with a ""grotesque combination of parcel tape, a rope and a plastic bag"" over her head. 

 A hole was cut in the bag so she could breathe and she was left to soil herself in nappies as she was prevented from using the bathroom. 

 Police called the case ""one of the most difficult and distressing"" they had ever dealt with. 

 The day after Sara died, the three adults fled their home in Woking, southwest of London, and flew to Pakistan with five other children. 

 Her father, a taxi driver, left behind a handwritten note saying he had not meant to kill his daughter. 

 After a month on the run, the three returned to the UK and were arrested after they landed. The five other children remain in Pakistan. 

 There has been anger in the UK that Sara's brutal treatment was missed by social services after her father withdrew her from school four months before she died. 

 Sharif and his first wife, Olga, were well known to social services. 

 In 2019, a judge decided to award the care of Sara and an older brother to Sharif, despite his history of abuse. 

 The school had three times raised the alarm about Sara's case, notably after she arrived in class wearing a hijab which she used to try to cover marks on her body which she refused to explain.

 March 13 - A top United Arab Emirates official plans to visit Washington to press for easier access to American technology and discuss investment in the United States, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, is expected to meet U.S. President Trump's cabinet officials as soon as next week, the report said. 

 These officials would likely include Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, though it remains unclear if the president will participate. 

 At the start of the year, the U.S. government tightened restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips, such as those made by Nvidia, while finding ways to block China's access to the advanced technology. 

 Under the regulations, countries such as Japan, Britain, South Korea and the Netherlands would essentially be exempt from the rules while others, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Singapore, will face some caps. 

 The U.S. Commerce Department, Nvidia and the Abu Dhabi Media Office did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 

 The UAE, a wealthy oil producer, is keen on gaining increased access to American technology to build its own advanced tech industry, but the U.S. has expressed concerns about its warm relationship with China. 

 Sheikh Tahnoon's visit comes at the request of the Trump administration, the Bloomberg report said.

Haidilao, one of China's biggest restaurant chains, has promised compensation to thousands of customers after a video of a customer urinating into a hotpot at the restaurant went viral. The video, which was shot last month, shows a man standing on a table at a Haidilao outlet in Shanghai and urinating into a hotpot with boiling broth. Another man was allegedly involved in the disgusting act.

Haidiliao has apologised for the incident and said it was taking legal action against those responsible. ""In the early hours of February 24, two men urinated into a hotpot after dining in a private room at a Haidilao branch on the Bund in Shanghai,"" the company said.

""As management had never made contingency plans or given training for dealing with this type of incident, staff at our branch were unable to detect any abnormalities at the scene or uphold the safety of the dining environment,"" it said.

Two boys have been detained by Shanghai police for allegedly urinating into a hotpot at an outlet of famous restaurant #Haidilao, police officers announced on Saturday.In the video, the man also laughed and said that the restaurant, Haidilao, China's hotpot chain, had launched a… pic.twitter.com/WeT0QSliDH

The restaurant said it would compensate any customer involved in the 4,100 orders received between February 24 and March 8, equivalent to a full refund plus a lump sum of 10 times that amount. Shanghai police said two 17-year-olds had been detained in connection with the incident.

Haidilao is popular for its service and menu, including its broth. It has expanded its presence outside China and opened outlets in the US, Japan and the UK.

Amid the outrage over the urination video, users of China's microblogging site Weibo accused Haidilao of delayed response. ""Where was this (apology) at the beginning? Wouldn't it have been better to say this right from the start,"" one comment said, according to an AFP report.

China made headlines for poor food hygiene standards earlier this week too when state media reported unhygienic practices at some stores of a key chain of braised chicken restaurants, including use of rotting ingredients and recycling of leftover meals, AFP reported.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Oops, something went wrong

Some of the biggest bosses on Wall Street aren't hitting the panic button on President Trump's policies this week despite the recent gyration in markets, even as they acknowledge some new concerns from the business world.

Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman said earlier this week that US tariffs will produce more manufacturing in the United States “at the end of the day,"" and ""given the size of the US, that tends to be a good thing for the world.”

Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said Wednesday, ""I think the business community understands what the president is trying to do with tariffs,"" even if executives do want ""lower tariffs everywhere.""

BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said Wednesday that while he does hear from CEOs that ""the economy is weakening as we speak,"" he predicts that ""if we are able to unlock private capital ... that will restart and rekindle the next wave of a bull market.""

Wall Street certainly has a lot riding on Trump 2.0. At the beginning of the year, bankers were wildly optimistic that the Trump administration's pro-growth agenda and deregulatory stance would unleash the market's animal spirits and spur a flurry of US deals.

But the uncertainty surrounding the administration's trade policies is roiling markets and raising new concerns about the direction of the US economy and inflation.

That is making it more challenging for bankers and executives to know how trade changes could affect their supply chains or if they should pull the trigger on a public listing or a merger.

At the beginning of this week, Goldman Sachs (GS) became the first major Wall Street firm to lower its year-end price target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), after the major index tumbled into near-correction territory and the firm reduced its outlook for GDP.

Though less bullish than the major bank initially expected, the new forecast is still optimistic — it's 11% higher than the index's all-time high set in February.

Solomon said Wednesday on Fox Business Network's ""Mornings with Maria"" that he still expects a pickup in certain deals this year.

""The level of uncertainty is a little bit higher, and that has kept some possible transactions on the sidelines, but the overall level of dialogue, as people are thinking strategically about where they want to drive their businesses, is certainly increasing.""

""There is potential, especially if we got more specific actions on the regulatory front, to unleash more animal spirits,"" he added.

Trump did make an effort this week to speak directly to Solomon and some of the other top CEOs at a meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, D.C.

""There's a renewed spirit,"" the president told the executives, adding that ""the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.""

During a portion of the meeting closed to the press, Trump laid out other parts of his agenda — including extending the corporate tax cuts, speeding up approvals on environmental projects, and bringing more jobs and plants back to the US, according to a person familiar with the remarks.

The next day, one attendee, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, downplayed the effect tariffs thus far may be having on consumer sentiment.

""I don't think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work, which there are like 175 million of them, changes what they're going to do because they read about tariffs,"" Dimon said in an interview with a Semafor reporter at a Washington, D.C., event hosted by BlackRock and the Bipartisan Policy Center.

""But,"" he added, in a nod to some unease in the business world, ""I do think companies might. Uncertainty is not a good thing.""

Since Trump took office, Dimon has, in some measure, applauded the Trump administration's efforts to cut down on Washington, D.C.'s bureaucracy and publicly rebuked tariff worries without delivering an outright judgment on whether the cost-cutting efforts or trade policies have gone too far.

Days into Trump's second term, Dimon said of tariffs, ""If it's a little inflationary, but it's good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it,"" while speaking with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

He made similar points on March 7 during a talk at Stanford University, calling the current impact of tariffs ""very modestly inflationary"" and said the effect on that part of the economic picture was being ""blown out of proportion.""

However, he acknowledged scenarios where the impact could be bigger. ""Now, if you put 25% tariffs on all imports, okay, that's a lot more. That could be, in my viewpoint, recessionary and inflationary,"" Dimon added.

Fink, who runs the world's largest money manager, has already shown that his company's moves can align with the priorities of the Trump administration.

It came last week when a BlackRock-led coalition struck a $22.8 billion deal with Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison that included taking control of two ports located on either end of the Panama Canal.

The move gave Trump what he asked for on his first day in office — a larger American presence in a crucial shipping lane where he had alleged Chinese interference.

Fink himself cleared the deal with Trump and other White House officials, according to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.

This week, Fink offered optimism even amid some uncertainty. ""The world economies, over a long cycle, are going to be fine,"" Fink said Monday at an event in Houston.

On Tuesday he told CNN: ""Could we have one quarter or two quarters of a flattening of our economy as we try to reset the economy? Absolutely.""

But, he added, Trump's policies, including tariffs, ""can be very productive for the United States"" in the long run. As for market losses this week, he said ""there's nothing wrong with a market pullback.""

""I look at that as a buying opportunity because I'm very bullish on America.""

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets closed lower Thursday as further threats from U.S. President Donald Trump pressured global trading relationships.

Wine and spirits firms Pernod Ricard, Rémy Cointreau and Davide Campari were all more than 3% lower after Trump threatened on social media to place a 200% tariff on wines, champagnes and alcoholic products coming out of France and other countries in the European Union. Trump said he was responding to the EU's own new 50% tariff on whiskey out on the U.S.

Drinks giant Diageo, owner of brands including Johnnie Walker and Guinness, was just 0.2% lower, while luxury conglomerate LVMH — parent firm of Moët & Chandon and Hennessy — closed 1.1% lower.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 ended the session 0.15% lower with sectors diverging. Autos were the biggest laggards down 1.7%, as traders continued to assess the impact of the latest U.S. tariffs as well as counter-tariffs from the European Union, Canada and beyond on the industry.

Pharma giant Novo Nordisk was among the top performers, rebounding from Tuesday losses tied to disappointing weight loss drug trial results, to trade 4% higher. Analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux on Thursday upgraded the stock to buy from hold, citing priced-in risks and expected higher sales of its Wegovy treatment.

The Stoxx 600 snapped a four-session losing streak on Wednesday amid optimism about a ceasefire in the Ukraine-Russia war and lower-than-expected U.S. inflation.

The inflation figures bolstered optimism about the direction of the economy — amid growing concerns about a U.S. recession — although economists warn that tariffs are likely to quickly lead to higher prices for consumers.

However, U.S. stocks opened lower Thursday amid the latest trade volatility.

Thursday marks the second and final day of CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore, where business leaders, investors and policymakers are discussing the brewing global trade war. Follow CNBC's live coverage from event here.

Shares of LVMH, which trade in France, shed 1% on Thursday.

The luxury stock, which owns brands such as Hennessy and Moet & Chandon, slipped on more trade war fears after President Donald Trump threatened to levy a 200% tariff on wine and champagne exported from the European Union. LVMH is now on pace for its ninth straight negative day, which would mark its longest losing streak since August 2021.

Gold's April-dated futures were last trading near 2,963.3, near their highs of the session. They were closing in on their record high of 2,974 from Feb. 24.

Gold has gained 1.6% week to date, pacing for their second weekly gain. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX), which encompasses both gold and silver miners, rose 2% and was on pace for its third straight day of gains.

The S&P 500 opened lower on Thursday, giving up some of its Wednesday gains

The market benchmark shed 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 85 points, or 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4%.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he plans to put a 200% tariff on alcohol from France and other European nations in the latest escalation of global trade tensions.

The U.S. tariff comes after the European Union moved to reinstate an import tax on American whiskey.

""The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky. If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.,"" Trump said on Truth Social.

The producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation, was flat in February — another potential sign that inflation pressures may be ebbing. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a month-over-month increase of 0.3%.

Shares of British food delivery firm Deliveroo were down 6.9% on Thursday morning after the company said it expected slower growth this year.

The company reported net profit of £2.9 million ($3.7 million) in 2024, compared with a £31.8 million loss incurred during the previous year, marking the food company's first time making a profit since it was founded in 2013.

Its gross transaction value per order was £25.1 million in 2024, up 3% from 2023, and its orders increased 2% year-on-year to 296 million in 2024. Revenue also rose 2% to £2.07 billion.

The company cited reduced cost of living pressures during the year in some of its major markets and increased demand for its grocery business, for its growth.

Will Shu, Deliveroo's founder and CEO, said the company's first full-year profit and positive free cash flows indicate that its strategy is working.

For 2025, the company expects GTV to be in the high-single digits percentage growth while adjusted is forecast to come in lower than in 2024 as the company makes ""focused investments to drive further growth opportunities.""

Deliveroo now also sees its margin growth to hit 4% from 2026, compared with a previous forecast of reaching that objective by the timeline.

Deutsche Bank flagged autos as a ""growing risk"" for its portfolio that is being ""monitored closely given the challenging economic environment in Europe, Electric Vehicles (EV) transition and competition in China,"" Germany's largest lender said in its annual report out Thursday. 

Europe's auto sector now faces further pressures from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and separate duties on goods from countries in which several carmakers have production lines. 

Deutsche Bank noted the industry outlook ""remains subdued,"" while also warning of the impact of ""U.S. import tariffs affecting sales in the key market U.S., competition from China and persistent excess capacities around the globe.""

Hugo Boss on Thursday posted fourth-quarter sales in line with expectations, but provided a tepid growth forecast for the year, citing ""macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility"" and continued weakness in China.

The German fashion house recorded revenues of 1.25 billion euros [$1.35 billion] in the three-month period, just marginally ahead of the 1.2 billion euros forecast by LSEG analysts. Net income came in at 126 million euros, just shy of the 128 million euros anticipated.

Full year sales increased 3% to total 4.3 billion euros, also in line with forecast. Operating income fell 12% over the period to 361 million euros, after the company lowered its full-year outlook in July on challenging macroeconomic factors.

The company said it expected those challenges to persist into 2025, forecasting group sales to increase or decline by up to 2% over the year. Asia-Pacific sales were cited as a particular laggard amid ""ongoing uncertainties regarding the further recovery of industry development in China.""

""Subdued consumer sentiment and muted store traffic have been weighing on business performance since the beginning of the year, with the overall market environment remaining uncertain also going forward,"" the company said in a statement.

— Karen Gilchrist

The chief executive of Ferrari on Thursday said the company was prepared for potential U.S. tariffs on European automakers.

""We are ready with some countermeasures,"" Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna told CNBC's Robert Frank at CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore on Thursday.

""We are watching what's going to happen in the next month, next weeks ... we are on the same boat in terms of tariffs,"" he added.

European automakers have been grappling with trade policy uncertainty in recent months, with the threat of U.S. import tariffs raising alarm bells among many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

Prospects for a broad deal between the U.S. and China have improved following Donald Trump's election as president, two former diplomats said during a panel discussion at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE.

David Adelman, former U.S. ambassador to Singapore, said Trump's tough stance on trade put him in a stronger position to overcome domestic opposition when negotiating with Beijing, much like when former U.S. President Richard Nixon reestablished ties with China in the 1970s.

""No one can accuse Trump of being soft on China,"" he said.

Kishore Mahbubani, a prominent former Singapore diplomat, said both the U.S. and China know there will be no winners in a conflict between the two giants.

The private equity market is likely to experience a shake-up, with some fund managers unable to raise cash amid difficulty in monetizing current investments.

Serena Tan, CEO of Gaia Investment Partners, a Malaysian fund of funds manager, said exits from existing private equity funds are still challenging because of lackluster activity in the initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions markets. This meant there was less cash to recycle into new private equity investments, she said.

Many private equity funds may have raised their last funds, Tan added.

European markets are expected to open in mixed territory Thursday.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index is expected to open 8 points higher at 8,537, Germany's DAX down 47 points at 22,611, France's CAC 2 points lower at 7,983 and Italy's FTSE MIB 32 points lower at 38,230, according to data from IG. 

Investors in Europe will be keeping an eye on earnings from Hugo Boss, Hannover Re and Deliveroo. There are no major data releases taking place today.

Oops, something went wrong

Intel (INTC) stock jumped Thursday after the chipmaker announced it's appointing Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO Wednesday evening.

Chip industry veteran Tan, who previously helmed Cadence Design Systems, takes over from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus. The duo succeeded former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted by Intel's board in late 2024.

Shares of Intel surged over 15% in early trading on Thursday as many on Wall Street welcomed the announcement.

The news came the same day as a Reuters report that a consortium of chip companies — led by TSMC (TSM) and including Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) — is in talks to take over Intel's manufacturing business.

But Tan told employees that he'll carry on with an existing plan to work on making Intel a top contract chipmaker, signaling he won't split out the company's design and foundry businesses.

Many on Wall Street welcomed the news, seeing it as adding credibility to Intel's turnaround efforts. ""Having followed Mr. Tan's transformative impact on Cadence Design Systems during his 11-year tenure as CEO at that company, as well as many successful outcomes related to investments across the semiconductor universe, we believe that Mr. Tan is uniquely qualified to attempt a reboot of Intel,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a note.

Tan is no stranger to Intel. The new CEO initially served on the company's board in 2022 but left the chip giant in 2024. He reportedly disagreed with Gelsinger on the company's turnaround plan, including its third-party contract semiconductor fabrication business, according to Reuters.

""I am honored to join Intel as CEO,"" Tan said in a statement. ""I have tremendous respect and admiration for this iconic company, and I see significant opportunities to remake our business in ways that serve our customers better and create value for our shareholders.""

Tan is taking over Intel in the midst of one of the darkest eras in the company's history. The chipmaker has lost its lead in process manufacturing to rival chip builder TSMC and ceded its opportunity to dominate in the AI space to Nvidia.

Shares of Intel have plummeted 54% over the last year as the company's revenue has shrunk from its pandemic highs. It now faces increased competition from longtime nemesis AMD (AMD) and a renewed effort by Qualcomm (QCOM) to break into the PC chip space, threatening Intel's biggest moneymaker.

The semiconductor giant has also received billions of dollars via the CHIPS Act to help pay for new manufacturing facilities in the US, including a massive campus in Ohio. But Intel says a part of the project is delayed and won't be completed until 2030. It was initially slated to open in 2025.

Number of employees you oversee: 

15 paid staff 

Number of active volunteers at Grace Clinic: 

300+ annually 

Brief background of Grace Clinic: 

Founded in 2002, Grace Clinic is the only free clinic in the Tri-Cities, providing medical, dental and mental health services for uninsured adults who meet income guidelines. We also distribute nutritious food to patients to encourage healthy eating habits and address food insecurity. Although most patients come from working households, nearly 60% of our patients live at or below the federal poverty line. Estimates from the Washington State Insurance Commissioner tell us that there are 27,000 uninsured individuals in our community. We are focused on expanding access for the under-resourced and bridging gaps in our health care system by removing financial barriers.

How did you land your current role? How long have you been in it? 

About 10 years ago, I received a call from Grace Clinic CEO Mark Brault. He invited me to coffee and shared that there was a position open at the clinic. After interviewing with staff and volunteers, I was hired as clinic director in May 2015. In 2023, I was named executive director.  

How many patients did Grace Clinic serve in 2024? Is this number increasing each year? We provided 8,700 patient visits in 2024. This figure is in line with our annual projections. The number of people we serve is primarily driven by the number of volunteers that we have in any given year, as well as the mix of the volunteers' skills and expertise. Since launching in 2002, we have provided about 120,000 patient visits cumulatively. The Tri-Cities should view this as a collective achievement. Grace Clinic is strong because our community is generous with their time, talents and financial support. 

Tell us about the residency program partnership with Trios and Kadlec and why it's important. 

Residents from both Trios and Kadlec Family Medicine Residency programs complete four-week community health rotations with Grace Clinic during the third and final year of the programs. This partnership was the key element in our expansion to a five-day per week clinic schedule. We find that the residents build their sensitivity to the needs of the underserved, giving careful consideration to cost while developing treatment plans. Insurance can mask these costs for providers, so it can be very eye-opening to look at the actual expense. Since this collaboration launched in 2017, we have hosted about 95 residents. There are a number of physicians who have returned to volunteer after completing residency. We also had one wonderful romance – a former Trios resident married one of our former staff members. They now live in Spokane with their adorable daughter. For this reason and many more, it has been a very fruitful partnership and we are grateful.  

What do you wish people in our community knew about Grace Clinic?

Grace Clinic plays an important role in health care education. In addition to residents, we also host many other students and trainees from other disciplines including dental assisting, dental hygiene, medical interpreting, medical assisting, nursing, nurse practitioners and mental health counselors. It's rewarding to watch these young people achieve their professional goals. We are honored to play a part in their journeys. 

What do you see as the community's greatest health care needs? What is your plan to meet these needs?

We always see the health care system through the lens of the medically underserved. Both Benton and Franklin counties have been designated as Healthcare Provider Shortage Areas, meaning we do not have enough health care providers to support our population. Franklin County is also a Medically Underserved Area. This designation is based on too few primary care providers, high poverty rates and other factors. Grace Clinic addresses these issues on two fronts – by supporting health care education and by removing barriers to health care access for those without insurance and limited income. We believe it is important to continue to function as a free clinic to remove the financial barriers that prevent the medically underserved from accessing care. For more than 20 years, that has been our aim. We ask that people continue to support us to address the health concerns of those in need. This ultimately results in a healthier community overall. 

What is one characteristic that you believe every leader should possess?

It's hard to name just one thing because leadership is so all-encompassing. Vision, wisdom, courage, tenacity and more are all very important. One characteristic that isn't often named is humility. C.S. Lewis stated that humility is not thinking less of yourself but thinking of yourself less. When we lead with humility, we place the needs of the organization, our team and our clients above our personal agendas. That is a key ingredient for successful leadership. Humility is a very undervalued trait. 

What is the biggest challenge facing business managers today?

I don't know if it's the biggest one, but the multigenerational workforce is definitely a challenge. At Grace Clinic, our volunteers range in age from 18 to 92. There can be clashes between different generations. Yet when we can extend grace to one another (pun fully intended), the various styles and approaches blend well making the clinic culture much more nurturing. However, as managers and leaders, we must be intentional in fostering cross-generational relationships. It's a challenge but worth the effort. 

If you had a magic wand, what would you change about your industry?

With my magic wand, I would wipe away the common belief that nonprofits don't need operational funds to thrive. There is a great article called, “The Nonprofit Starvation Cycle,” that explains it well. Without proper operational funding, community-based organizations are at risk of imploding, leaving substantial gaps in our community's safety net. This issue is an unrelenting concern for me and many others in the nonprofit world.

Thinking now of the health care industry, I would use my magic wand to make health care more affordable. The more affordable health care is, the more accessible it becomes for all in our community. Grace Clinic patients receive free care from us but must pay or seek financial assistance for any services outside of the clinic (except lab fees, which we cover). They often won't follow through with treatment plans due to cost. This is a huge issue that we do not have an answer for … yet.

What advice would you give someone going into a leadership position for the first time?

Learn everything you can about your organization, your team and your role in the first three to six months. When we are new, we often see areas of improvement and can be tempted to start making changes right away. Keep the changes to a minimum in the beginning. 

Who are your role models or mentors and why? 

I greatly admire my mother who lives in my hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. She has always been greatly involved in the community and has remained active even as she juggles the great demands of being a caregiver for my father who is legally blind and has many health issues. She also is the definition of a lifelong learner. Most recently, she has been learning to use AI in her community work. I hope and pray that my mind will be as sharp as hers when I am in my mid-80s. 

How do you keep your employees (or team members) motivated? 

Whether paid staff, students or volunteers, we aim to give them a great experience. “Atomic Habits” author James Clear asks, “What would it look like if this was fun?” In 2024, Grace Clinic volunteers contributed nearly 26,000 hours. We owe it to them to make their time as enjoyable as possible. Along with this, a heartfelt thank you goes a long way. 

How did you decide to pursue the career that you are working in today?

After finishing my MBA at Florida A&M University, I started my career in Corporate America working for Hewlett-Packard. When our kids were babies, I left the workplace to be a stay-at-home mom which is still my favorite season of life. I transitioned into the nonprofit space when we moved to the Tri-Cities in 2009. It really felt like a calling to work in the business of charity. 

How do you measure success in your workplace?

On a day-to-day basis, success looks like a patient who receives the care they need and leaves with a smile. Grace Clinic is the only place I have seen a patient hug the dentist after a tooth extraction. 

Long term, I devote myself to building a sustainable organization that thrives far into the future. The need isn't going away and we want to make an impact. To achieve this long-term goal, we have to begin with the end in mind. It starts now and builds every day. 

What do you consider your leadership style to be? 

I embrace servant leadership because this approach aligns best with my core values. There's a great graphic that compares a boss to a leader. The boss sits behind the desk and points while the team is straining in front. In contrast, the leader is not behind a desk but instead leading the charge. The leader and the team are pulling together. An African proverb says, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”  

How do you balance work and family life? 

As recent empty nesters, Kedrich and I are still discovering what “balance” looks like in this season. We work a lot but sweeten our days with family time. We have brunch with my recently widowed mother-in-law almost every Sunday right after church. That is a lovely part of our week and very tasty also.  

What do you like to do when you are not at work? 

Our days are very full, so downtime at home is a nice break. We enjoy watching good movies and lots of football. We also enjoy traveling and are currently planning a cruise for our 30th wedding anniversary.  

What's your best time management strategy? 

Tough one. There always seems to be too much to do and not enough time to get it all done. I embrace deadlines as a way to prioritize. On a personal note, I like to cook on the weekends and enjoy leftovers throughout the week. The crockpot is one of my best time-saving tools. We get a lot of great recipes from Instagram. 

Best tip to relieve stress? 

I started taking yoga classes a few years ago. That has been great for the body and the mind. Along with that, I enjoy puzzles like Wordle and try to take a brain break every day.  

What's your favorite podcast? Most used app? Favorite website? Favorite book? (Feel free to choose one or all) 

YouTube is my most used app by far. There is so much variety from music to podcasts and so much more. I once used YouTube to fix the urinal when it was overflowing. Another app that I use a lot is Libby, the library app for ebooks and audiobooks. Audiobooks are my favorite. I love anything written by John Grisham and Maya Angelou. There is nothing better than Dr. Angelou's voice on an audiobook. 

Do you have a personal mantra, phrase or quote you like to use? 

The tagline on my LinkedIn profile is “Faith. Family. Service.” Those are my priorities. To sum it all up, Martin Luther King Jr. stated that anyone can be great because greatness comes through service. There is no greater expression of love and compassion than joyfully and wholeheartedly serving others.

				Sponsorship & Events 

World Long Drive has announced a new partnership with Pinnacle, designating the brand as the official golf ball partner of World Long Drive tour events for the 2025 season. 

In addition to providing Pinnacle Distance as the official golf ball for WLD events, the collaboration will see the birth of the Pinnacle Series and the introduction of long drive professionals serving as Pinnacle ambassadors. 

Pinnacle Distance will be available in golf shops beginning March 15. 

Pinnacle will serve as the presenting sponsor for three WLD tour events and the official sponsor of a fourth event in 2025. It owns the presenting naming rights to the first event of the 2025 season, Clash in the Canyon, to be contested in Mesquite, Nevada from March 21-23, as well as the Bluff City Shootout in Memphis, Tennessee, and the Rocky Mountain Rumble in LaSalle, Colorado. 

In addition, Pinnacle will be the official sponsor for The Fight at the Fort at Fort Jackson in Columbia, South Carolina. The Mesquite event in March will be the first time the Pinnacle Distance ball is used in competition. 

The 2024 World Long Drive World Champion Sean Johnson and World No.4 Jack Smith will serve as official Pinnacle Ambassadors for the 2025 season. Johnson and Smith will play a vital part in promoting and showcasing the incredible distance, durability, and ball-to-ball consistency of the Pinnacle Distance. 

“I'll be straightforward, I am very excited to be using the Pinnacle golf ball again,” said Johnson. “The first ball I ever played with was the Pinnacle Gold when I was 12 years old, and I appreciate the opportunity to represent the brand as I continue my long drive journey. The brand is synonymous with distance and I look forward to hitting the Pinnacle Distance in competition.”

“I'm dedicated to becoming the best long driver I can be and I know Pinnacle can help get me there,” said Smith. “I've watched old footage of many of the past world long drive champions – including (five-time World Long Drive champion) Jason Zuback – who were associated with the brand and now I get the opportunity to do the same. I've had the chance to test this product and ‘Don't Think, Just Rip' is the perfect tagline for this ball and this brand. I know how it is going to react when I hit it properly so that takes one element out of my process.”

“We are excited to partner with Pinnacle and its parent company, Acushnet Company, as the official golf ball for World Long Drive tour events in 2025,” said World Long Drive Chief Commercial Officer David Livingston. “Pinnacle's commitment to engineering a golf ball that delivers maximum distance and consistency will elevate our sport by allowing our athletes to showcase the most impressive drives in golf.”

“Pinnacle's origin story is distance, and it will be fun to see that on the World Long Drive stage. Competitors will certainly notice the distance, but it is the quality, consistency and durability that will stand out – long drive after long drive,” added Jeremy Stone, Senior VP, Golf Ball Marketing and US Sales at Acushnet.

The 2025 World Long Drive season features nine events beginning next week in Mesquite, Nevada, and culminates with the World Championship from September 24-28 at Bigfoot Turf Farm in La Salle, Colorado.

Bowood Hotel, Spa & Golf Resort in Wiltshire has appointed a new Director of Golf and promoted from within for its new Head Greenkeeper as it seeks to further enhance its member and visitor experience.

Agrovista Amenity has strengthened its team with the appointment of Rob White as an Amenity Specialist. 

Srixon's all-new line of SOFT FEEL golf balls, which will be at retail from April 12, feature an updated FastLayer Core to generate increased ball speeds for enhanced distance and feel.

Turmoil on Wall Street is keeping financial planners' phones ringing as 401(k) holders watch their retirement account balances fall with the stock markets they're tied to. For the most part, they're being told to sit tight and breathe through it.

“I've seen more concern and fear with clients that I've talked to over the last month or so than I have since the financial crisis,” said Jude Boudreaux, a senior financial planner at the Planning Center, a New Orleans-based firm. He added that this week has been especially hectic. “People are really concerned.”

Vanese Pitts said she watched her husband's 401(k) shed $8,000 on Monday, when a wide-ranging market selloff pushed the S&P 500 to its lowest close since September. The sharp downturn in recent days followed several weeks of losses on Wall Street that have left the stock index about 4.8% lower than where it started the year. Many 401(k)s follow the broad-based S&P closely.

“It was just insane,” said the 41-year-old, who's raising two kids alongside her husband, a software engineer, in Birmingham, Alabama.

Pitts was among those who took to social media platforms to crowdsource advice and commiserate this week, as President Donald Trump's trade war with America's closest allies sends tremors through millions of savers' retirement investments. His chaotic rollout of new tariffs, the retaliatory levies they've triggered, and an ongoing purge of federal workers have stoked fears of rebounding inflation and a potential economic downturn.

Lee Baker, founder and president of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta, said he'd been fielding anxious calls from clients — most of them in or near retirement — for the past week or so. He was surprised to hear so much concern “from people who, mathematically, really don't have a problem in terms of making it through whatever this might be,” he said.

I've seen more concern and fear with clients that I've talked to over the last month or so than I have since the financial crisis.

Jude Boudreaux, The Planning Center, New Orleans

“Clients, particularly in times like these, don't want to hear, ‘Essentially, do nothing. It's going to be all right,'” Baker said.

That was the gist of Katie Szykman's mother's advice when the 23-year-old Philadelphian called in a panic. She had been contributing 6% of her paycheck to her employer's 403(b) — a type of retirement account offered by public schools and charities — for barely two years and watched more than $1,000 vanished in a matter of days, she said.

“My mom was like, ‘Don't even touch it,'” said Szykman, who works in marketing at a local nonprofit. “Everyone was always saying make sure you invest in your retirement, so [that was] the first thing I did once I got my first job outside of college. I can't say that I'm surprised. It just feels disheartening a little bit.”

Szykman said she found some comfort knowing that downturns have occurred in recent decades and that “people have gotten out of it.” Still, she feels frustrated having another economy-related issue to worry about — especially when “it didn't have to be this way,” she said.

“Having that money just kind of diminish a little bit when groceries are so expensive, it just takes a little bit of an extra toll,” she added.

Plenty of retirement savers have forgone the advice of Szykman's mother. Empower, a financial firm that administers retirement plans for some 19 million investors, told CNBC Wednesday that some account holders are increasingly shifting money toward safer investments. though the company emphasized that it's “not seeing widespread capitulation despite the downturn.”

While the activity accounts for only a sliver of overall balances, trading in 401(k)s has doubled over the past three weeks as savers yank money out of funds calibrated toward a target retirement date and those linked to big companies' stocks, according to the Alight Solutions 401(k) index. Lower-risk investments including government bonds, money market accounts and so-called stable value funds have swelled over the same period.

Financial planners generally urge clients to think carefully before adjusting their 401(k)s, though changing the makeup of an account's portfolio is far different than withdrawing funds early, which entails paying a penalty.

In terms of investments, Baker said those looking to build some cushion into their portfolios could look to TIPS, or Treasury inflation-protected securities, which are indexed to inflation to guard investors from a decline in purchasing power. TIPS funds have returned an average 3.4% so far this year, according to Morningstar, making it a top-performing bond fund category.

He also pointed to a recent uptake in “buffered products” like S&P 500-tracked exchange-traded funds, where high-performing assets are locked and evenly proportioned for a period of time. But investors who move in that direction should be comfortable missing out on potential gains, Baker warned. If markets reverse and bound higher, “remember we had this conversation, because in this moment you were afraid,” he said.

Some planners also advised having a good mix of international funds in their portfolios.

Previously, “international [stocks were] something that you kind of had to apologize for” as an adviser, said Samuel Deane, founder and president of Rora Wealth in Atlanta. But some ETFs that exclude U.S. stocks have been performing remarkably well, he said.

Boudreaux agreed but pointed out that many international companies' revenues are heavily linked to the U.S. market, limiting the potential appeal of foreign stocks.

“It's a very globally connected world, and that applies to our investments also,” he said.

Clients, particularly in times like these, don't want to hear, ‘Essentially, do nothing. It's going to be all right.'

Lee Baker, Claris Financial Advisors, Atlanta

Planners also said it's OK to take a more conservative approach with future retirement contributions rather than touching what's already there.

“People are tightening up,” said Kevin Mahoney, founder of Illumint, a Washington, D.C.-based firm. “So there's some uncertainty about spending or investing savings now. It's less about existing investments and more focus on potential investments that they might have planned.”

And for investors nearer to retirement than others, now is also a good time to focus on cash flow, said Boudreaux.

“I like clients to have a good cash reserve heading into retirement,” he said. “It allows them to be more selective when they sell from their portfolio, and to not have to sell every month if we are heading into a downturn.”

“The goal with any of these things is to respond — and not react,” he added.

As difficult as it's been for Pitts to “just let it stay and hope for the best,” she said she and her husband aren't touching their retirement funds. Instead, they're thinking about getting a financial adviser to help them protect their savings.

“Every day it's something different,” Pitts said. “Something that's not good.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news","Pasco's oldest restaurant is back online with south of border favorites","https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/articles/javis-chicken-and-churros","Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:49:24 GMT","

Laura and Francisco Gonzalez and two of their children stand in front of their third Javi's Chicken and Churros restaurant at 1520 N. Fourth Ave. in Pasco. It is their first restaurant in Tri-Cities. They have two other locations in Grandview and Sunnyside and a food truck coming soon in Yakima.

The building once home to Pasco's longest continuously operating restaurant is now serving up cuisine from another continent.

The Chinese food once dished up at 1520 N. Fourth Ave. has given way to south of the border and Southern California favorites, such as loaded carne asada (lime-marinated steak) fries, birria (goat or beef cooked in broth), pollo loco (fire-grilled chicken) and, of course, deep-fried cinnamon encrusted churros with a variety of sauces and sweet toppings.

Javi's Chicken and Churros opened in November 2024. The owners, Francisco and Laura Gonzalez of Sunnyside, operate two other restaurants under the same name in Grandview and Sunnyside.

They named the business after their first son, Javi, who was about 4 years old when it opened.

The couple say they are excited that the Pasco Javi's provides an opportunity to offer a bigger food and drink menu.

At its heart, Francisco Gonzalez said Javi's menu is a coming-together of many unique regional Mexican cuisines, but with a focus on the border town food his family enjoyed living in Southern California.

“In a border town, you get people who migrate there from all corners of Mexico, so you find everything there,” he said.

Francisco Gonzalez recalled that when his family moved to Washington eight years ago, he noticed that a lot of foods they were used to seeing – like birria and flame-broiled chicken – weren't often on local menus.

He said there is a heavy focus among area Mexican restaurants on carnitas, chicharrones and other styles from other regions.

His parents are from Jalisco where birria is said to derive from, so with his mom's help finetuning the recipes, he made that the center of several headlining dishes.

“Our signature dish would be our birria tacos: doraditas,” he said. Doraditas, per Javi's menu, are crunchy tacos with birria meat topped with melted cheese, onion, cilantro and guacamole.

“We also sell a lot of our fajitas, molcajetes, as well as (seafood) and prime cuts of meat like steaks, rib eye and New York cuts,” he said.

Everything is cooked fresh daily. “Rice, beans, all our meats … a lot is cooked to order. We notice from a lot of restaurants that they'll cook off certain items for the whole week and have them frozen to reheat as they go, but we don't do that here.”

Like many businesses that started in the last several years, a defining moment for Javi's was the Covid-19 pandemic, which occurred a little over a year after it opened.

“After Covid hit, we started doing even better (business). People were staying local and we were just doing to-go orders,” Francisco Gonzalez said, adding that the uptick enabled him and his wife to pursue their second location in Sunnyside, which is similar in size to the Pasco restaurant and caters more toward nightlife as it features a bar, lounge, pool tables, darts and more, as well as regular live music offerings.

“It kind of came at a perfect time because when we were a month away from opening, they had massive layoffs at my job. Then, a week after we opened the (second) restaurant it ended up getting busy enough that my wife had to quit her job, too, as a schoolteacher,” he said.

His wife is now a stay-at-home mom and ongoing partner in the business along with several of their family members, including both of his parents, his brother, who manages the Pasco location, his sister and several cousins.

Riding on the success and revenue from their first two businesses, Tri-Cities was the next place to go given the large Latino community.

The previous restaurant building owners prided themselves on maintaining the retro restaurant appearance, but beneath the decor there was a lot in need of updating.

In April 2022, the Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business announced the retirement of Chinese Gardens' longtime owners, Ted and Amy Wong.

The Wongs put the building up for sale shortly thereafter and sold it to the Gonzalezes for $700,000 in 2023, according to the property records.

Francisco Gonzalez said they have invested more than $200,000 in renovations, including replacing the HVAC system, fumigation, new hard floors throughout the 8,052-square-foot facility, new bar and kitchen equipment, reupholstering seating, new lighting, repainting inside and out and all new decor, among others.

“We're still not done,” he noted.

One novelty diners may recognize from the restaurant's former life is the collection of 325 vintage Jim Beam whiskey decanters. However, Francisco Gonzalez said they probably won't stay in favor of decor that celebrates the culture of the restaurant and its cuisine.

Francisco Gonzalez said he looks forward to being able to host more events such as DJ nights, live music, karaoke, a “speakeasy” themed night and more at the new Pasco location like the Sunnyside Javi's is able to.

However, he's run up against code roadblocks with the city of Pasco as other downtown businesses occupying older buildings have likewise encountered.

He said the biggest is “they want older buildings to retrofit sprinkler systems ... which would cost us $60,000,” Francisco Gonzalez said.

He described Pasco's building code as very stringent to the point “of thinking about just selling the place” and relocating elsewhere in Tri-Cities.

For now, he's sticking it out.

“We're here to serve the community,” he said. “We're grateful for all our customers and the community that's been supporting us and keeping us busy.”

In just a few weeks, they will be opening a Javi's Chicken and Churros food truck, which will be permanently parked at Single Hill Brewery in Yakima.

“We're going to do birria, tacos, a more basic menu but also some really good vegetarian options over there,” Francisco Gonzalez said.

Javi's also offers catering and online ordering.

Reflecting on the busy past seven years, he and Laura are proud to have a Javi's location to pass down to each of their children, which was one of their business aspirations from the onset.

With three restaurants and a food truck under their belt, one might wonder where they plan to go next, but Francisco Gonzalez said, “This is kind of where I want to stop. I want to be able to dedicate more time to my kids right now while they're little.”

Hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday to Thursday, 10 a.m. to 1 a.m. Friday to Sunday, closed Mondays.

Swedish apparel brand J.Lindeberg has announced the addition of Taiwanese player Kevin Yu to its roster of tour ambassadors. 

Yu, 26, has rapidly ascended the professional golf ranks, capturing his first PGA Tour victory at the Sanderson Farms Championship in 2024. He is currently 76th in the OWGR. 

Yu's journey began in Taoyuan, Taiwan, where he revealed his talent early on by winning a gold medal at the 2013 Asian Youth Games. He further refined his skills at Arizona State University, achieving three individual collegiate titles before turning professional in 2021.

“Joining J.Lindeberg feels like a natural fit for me and I'm excited for what we can achieve together,” said Yu, who will play in the brand's latest golf collection at The Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass this week. “To succeed in this sport, you have to be willing to push limits, challenge expectations and continuously evolve both on and off the course – and J.Lindeberg shares that same drive.”

J.Lindeberg has expanded its golf ambassador roster in 2025 to include PGA TOUR players Matthieu Pavon and Niklas Nørgaard, LPGA Tour player Yealimi Noh, golf influencer Mia Baker and American actress Kathryn Newton.

“Kevin's dedication and performance really align with our ethos of bridging sport and fashion,” says Hans-Christian Meyer, CEO of J.Lindeberg. “We're thrilled to welcome him to our ambassador family during this exciting time of expansion.”

World Long Drive has announced a new partnership with Pinnacle, designating the brand as the official golf ball partner of World Long Drive tour events for the 2025 season. 

Bowood Hotel, Spa & Golf Resort in Wiltshire has appointed a new Director of Golf and promoted from within for its new Head Greenkeeper as it seeks to further enhance its member and visitor experience.

Daniel Watt, right, and Patrick McKennon display products while standing on a solar array behind the company's production facility in Richland. The small distillery is expanding and opening a tasting room in The Parkway.

Solar Spirits began operations in the Tri-Cities 10 years ago as a company that used solar energy to distill alcohol and liqueurs.

And while the business has had many successes along the way (winning major awards from the American Distilling Institute in 2019) and some tough times too (surviving the pandemic by making hand sanitizer), its main focus has been reaching as many customers as possible.

That's why Solar Spirits is moving its main tasting room from the production facility at 2409 Robertson Drive in north Richland to 702 The Parkway — a location surrounded by restaurants and shops.

Solar Spirits' Daniel Watt is the company's production manager, distiller and a co-owner. He also designed and implemented the old tasting room at the production facility.

He is expecting the new tasting room to open around April 1 in the spot Moniker Bar had until it closed last year.

Their new neighbors will be Ethos Bakery and The Social.

The small company will still keep the north Richland facility for its distilling operations, and the current tasting room will stay open for distillery tours.

While the company has loved the location off Highway 240, moving to a more visible storefront adjacent to George Washington Way will offer more foot and car traffic.

“This place is very seasonal, with sometimes a very limited number of people coming here,” said Patrick McKennon, a friend of Watt's who helps with social media. “There is just not enough of them to support us here.”

The current tasting room is 900 square feet and has about eight small tables. The new tasting room is 1,500 square feet with capacity for 77 people.

The moving process began in January.

“We just finished putting the floor in,” Watt said. “We're working with the city as we finish things.”

Meanwhile, there are plans to freshen the menu. A few years ago, Solar Spirits began offering small plate dishes, such as caprese sandwiches and baguettes with various toppings.

“We were making everything in house,” McKennon said.

That will change at The Parkway, Watt said.

They want to outsource their bread from their new neighbors, Ethos Bakery.

In fact, everything food-wise will come from other local businesses.

“We're looking for local partners,” Watt said. “I'm aiming to hire help with designing the menu at the new (tasting room). The minimum (on the menu) needs to be over five entrees. And we're looking for some gluten-free options.”

In addition, Solar Spirits is hoping to partner with local hotels to encourage tourists to visit and experience local food and drinks.

“We can see people taking the day off, having a chance to walk to the park and then to The Parkway,” said Watt. “We want this place to be a hangout-friendly lounge. There won't be a bunch of televisions in there. It's not a sports bar. We want it to be a really chill place.”

They plan to put up a “process wall” to illustrate how the company's spirits are made.

But like the idea of using local suppliers for the food, the company mantra of “keep it local” involves almost all ingredients for the spirits as well.

Behind the Richland distillery sits a large solar array that shifts as the day passes to follow the sun.

That collected solar energy allows the Solar Spirits to distill its spirits, as well as heat and cool the facility.

It was a concept that a few Hanford scientists came up with in 2013 that came to fruition with the company launching in 2015.

Ownership makeup has shifted over the years.

“All of our owners are currently in Washington state,” McKennon said.

The current major local owners, in addition to Watt, are Brett Spooner, Khurshed Sharifov, Todd Coleman and Matt Janssen, who is responsible for the solar thermal technology.

In 2019, Solar Spirits cleaned up at the American Distilling Institute competition in Denver.

The company's London Dry Gin and its Grapp Brandy-McQuerry won silver medals.

But it was the Eclipse Vodka that was the star of the show, earning a gold medal, a Best of Category award and Best of Class honors.

When the pandemic hit in 2020 and sales slowed to a crawl, Solar Spirits pivoted and began making hand sanitizer to see them through the lull.

After, Solar Spirits went back to making spirits. Watt says the company's revenues have gone up each year.

“Our biggest seller is a vodka made from cranberry wine,” he said. “But I also want to make a liqueur from Washington state apples.”

Currently there are three employees. With the new tasting room, Watt says there are plans to add one more full-time employee, as well as two more part-timers.

“We're still considered a small distillery,” Watt said.

				People & Jobs 

Former PGA TOUR Commissioner Tim Finchem has received the PGA TOUR Lifetime Achievement Award, the 14th time the accolade has been awarded and the first since 2015. 

Finchem, 77, established the Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996 to periodically honor those who have made outstanding contributions to the PGA TOUR.

Current PGA TOUR Commissioner Jay Monahan presented the Lifetime Achievement Award to Finchem at a ceremony at the TPC Sawgrass Clubhouse in conjunction with the 51st edition of THE PLAYERS Championship.

“Tim Finchem built on what Joe Dey and Deane Beman — his two predecessors — created and then took the TOUR to incredible heights during his 22 years leading our organization,” said Monahan. “It's impossible to fully articulate the impact he had on the PGA TOUR, but we believe the Lifetime Achievement Award best encapsulates everything Tim did for the TOUR and the game of golf.”

Finchem, the third commissioner of the PGA TOUR, succeeded Deane Beman in 1994 and held the position until his retirement in 2016. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2022.

“Having been involved with the creation of the Lifetime Achievement Award, I fully understand the significance of what we wanted the Lifetime Achievement Award to represent to those receiving it,” said Finchem. “Now, as the Award comes to me, I can only say how extremely humbling this is and what great meaning it carries to my family and me.”

In Finchem's first year as commissioner in 1994, the TOUR staged the inaugural Presidents Cup, a global event conceived by Beman that included the world's best non-European players in team match-play competition against their American counterparts. After 15 playings across five countries, the Presidents Cup has grown to be one of the most highly anticipated events on golf's calendar.

One of the crowning achievements of Finchem's tenure was the development and introduction of the FedExCup in 2007. Now in its 19th year, the TOUR's season-long points competition that culminates with the FedExCup Playoffs continues to grow in size and stature.

On the international front, Finchem oversaw the formation of the International Federation of PGA Tours in 1998 that brought golf's five world-governing bodies — the PGA TOUR, the DP World Tour, the Japan Golf Tour, the PGA Tour of Australasia and the Sunshine Tour in South Africa — together to address global, professional golf issues. One year later, the Federation announced the formation of the World Golf Championships, a series of international events featuring players from around the globe.

With Finchem spearheading the effort on behalf of the International Golf Federation, the International Olympic Committee reinstated golf as an official sport on its program in 2009, with the first competition held at the 2016 Summer Games in Brazil.

Finchem was instrumental in the founding of First Tee in 1997 and was a tireless advocate and fundraiser for the program, recruiting former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush to serve as First Tee Honorary Chairs. Finchem received the First Tee Lifetime Achievement Award in 2024.

Finchem was also commissioner when the TOUR surpassed both the $1 billion (2005) and $2 billion (2014) milestones in charitable giving.  

“I enjoyed my TOUR career primarily because I worked with so many talented people who had clear vision and wanted the TOUR to succeed and our game to grow as much as I did,” Finchem said. “To represent world-class athletes and witness the rise in popularity of PGA TOUR golf around the world was incredibly gratifying.”

After retiring from the PGA TOUR, Finchem has remained active in the sport, maintaining his First Tee ties and promoting the initiative that has made golf more affordable and accessible for youth.

World Long Drive has announced a new partnership with Pinnacle, designating the brand as the official golf ball partner of World Long Drive tour events for the 2025 season.

				Exhibitions & Conferences 

European Tour Group Chief Executive Guy Kinnings and Director of Tournament Business Mark Casey were among the keynote presenters at the 2025 European Tour Destinations Annual Conference.

Representatives from the network's world-class venues gathered at The Dutch, an exclusive private members' club in the heart of The Netherlands, to learn from and network with industry leaders and their peers.

Tying in with the event's theme of how clubs and destinations can use data and technology to enhance the customer experience, Kinnings shared insights into the European Tour Group's strategy to maximise fan engagement.

“We continually strive to lead the way in sport by using new technology and data to guide our strategies and offer fans the best possible experience both at our tournaments and from afar,” said Kinnings.

 “We are proud that this has been recognised by the Sports Technology Group's Power List, where we featured in the top 10 in 2024, and we have welcomed the chance to share our insights and knowledge this week with the European Tour Destinations network, many of whom have hosted tournaments across our three tours.”

Casey followed by sharing the DP World Tour's new tournament business model, which aims to maximise the commercial opportunities and optimise the delivery of every tournament on the schedule. 

Delegates heard from Hans van der Eijk, Senior Vice President Sales and Account Management at DP World, about innovations in golf, including using AI for dynamic green fee pricing, and from Dutch entrepreneur Robbert Odijk, who demonstrated how smart CRM implementation can drive revenue and efficiency.

There were also thought-provoking presentations from Amelia Lewis, Director at Players 1st, and Floris Wouters, Marketing and Communications Manager at The Dutch, while Phil Helsby, The Dutch's Managing Director, gave delegates a tour of the unique facility and explained its Scottish roots.

A panel featuring Jeremy Slessor, Managing Director of European Golf Design, Eugene Hennessey, DP World Tour Agronomist, and Paul O'Donoghue, Golf Course Superintendent at The Dutch, discussed technological advancements in agronomy, water management and the impact of design and technology on the sustainability of golf courses.

David Ashington, General Manager of Golf at Costa Navarino, the No.1 golf resort in Continental Europe, said: “It's been a super venue and the guest speakers have been brilliant. To hear from DP World Tour CEO Guy Kinnings about the plans for the tour and the Ryder Cup has been great, and we've covered a range of other topics centring on data and technology. It's always an excellent networking opportunity too.”  

Head of European Tour Destinations Ian Knox added: “It was extremely valuable to hear from Guy Kinnings and Mark Casey in particular, and for our venues to have that contact with the leadership of the European Tour Group. All the speakers shared valuable insights and learnings on pertinent topics over the two days, which attendees can take back to their venues and positively impact their strategies and operations.

“One of the best things about European Tour Destinations is the strength of our network, and to have this kind of opportunity to be among these industry experts – as well as share best practice with fellow professionals – is hugely important.”

Bowood Hotel, Spa & Golf Resort in Wiltshire has appointed a new Director of Golf and promoted from within for its new Head Greenkeeper as it seeks to further enhance its member and visitor experience.

Commencing in January, Josh Hirst has brought 20 years' experience to the Director of Golf role at the resort, having already established a successful career in golf operations and management.  

A qualified PGA Professional since 2011, after completing his training at Alwoodley Golf Club in Leeds, Hirst has honed his skills through coaching with the acclaimed Leadbetter Academy. His career has also afforded him the opportunity to gain invaluable insights into various aspects of the industry through roles in sales, operations, and management.

Hirst's most recent position was Golf Operations Manager at The Manor House Hotel, also in Wiltshire, where he amassed a wealth of industry experience to build on in his new role at Bowood.

“I'm delighted to be part of the Bowood team and excited to work alongside them and our members to elevate the golf experience at this prestigious club,” said Hirst. “My vision is to build on the club's already well-established reputation, which offers an inclusive and enjoyable environment for all players. 

“The course, facilities and services reflect the highest standards, and I strongly believe that open communication and member feedback are essential to continuous improvement. Together, we can continue to enhance a thriving golf community that we can all take pride in.”

To further elevate Bowood's golf offering, White plans to conduct a comprehensive survey of all members and visitors to get a deeper understanding of their needs and expectations. He believes their feedback will be invaluable in shaping his strategies to build on the overall experience at Bowood, from course conditions and clubhouse amenities to customer service and event offerings.

Bowood has also promoted David Wyborn to Head Greenkeeper to help keep the estate's 18-hole championship course in pristine condition. Having been at the club for almost two years, Wyborn has impressed his peers, transferring his skills he acquired over 36 years as course manager at Foxhills Golf Club in Surrey. He also claimed third in the 2024 Greenkeeper of the Year Awards – a reflection of his expertise and dedication to creating world-class golf courses. 

Talking about Wyborn's promotion, Hirst said: “We're thrilled to have David lead our on-course team. He's already hit the ground running, bringing with him not just his extensive experience but also a genuine passion for upholding the highest standards in course maintenance. 

“Having been part of the greenkeeping team at Bowood for nearly two years, David has a solid grasp of the course. His hands-on approach and collaborative leadership style will be key in keeping our course in top shape for both members and visitors. We're excited to see the impact he'll make as he continues to refine and enhance the playing experience at Bowood.”

World Long Drive has announced a new partnership with Pinnacle, designating the brand as the official golf ball partner of World Long Drive tour events for the 2025 season. 

Agrovista Amenity has strengthened its team with the appointment of Rob White as an Amenity Specialist.

Visitors sit and walk through the new main entry space of an expanded Three Rivers Convention Center in this rendering of the $71 million expansion project. The Kennewick City Council recently signed off on the project's budget, which will be paid for through a combination of bonds, county and city funds.

March 22 marks the final game of the season for the Tri-City Americans but also the beginning of a transformation for the area around the Toyota Center and Three Rivers Convention Center.

The Kennewick Public Facilities District plans to break ground on its long-planned expansion of Three Rivers Convention Center as soon as the hockey season ends, PFD officials announced at a recent Kennewick City Council meeting.

It's a step made possible by council members unanimously approving the $71.3 million budget for the project, which will be paid through a combination of bonds, local government funds and existing city tax revenue.

The expansion is scaled back from early proposals, which would have cost upward of $80 million. But council members said they are eager to see the project get underway, especially without having to raise taxes.

For PFD officials, though, this will make Kennewick and the Tri-Cities overall a destination for everything from sports tournaments to conventions.

“All of it coming together will be an absolute game changer for our region,” said Cory Pearson, the PFD's executive director, at the council meeting.

The expansion will add a 60,000-square-foot exhibit hall; 5,000 square feet of additional meeting rooms; an extended lobby/pre-function space; and a new kitchen to the existing facility. It's expected to open in the fall of 2026.

Hotelier A-1 Pearl will simultaneously build a 162-room AC by Marriott hotel to the east of the Toyota Center that will connect to the expansion as part of a public-private partnership with the PFD.

Calvin Dudney, president of the PFD's board, told the council that construction documents are 90% complete and more than two-thirds of the project bids are in, many coming in below projection.

“This has been a long trail to get here but it's a happy time in my life for sure,” Dudney said.

The PFD has worked to expand the convention center since 2012. Voters have shot down ballot measures to raise the funds for construction. That led PFD officials to go back to the drawing board and also seek other ways to pay for the project.

“We had to sit back down and start doing some figuring out what we had to have and wanted to have,” Dudney said.

The council's approval of the project would allow the city to seek $50.3 million in bonds to finance the bulk of the expense. The city also will provide a combined $14 million through its capital fund and lodging tax revenues. Benton County's Rural County Capital Fund, which comes from state sales tax rebates, will contribute $7 million.

“Seventy-one million is a big number but coming down from $80 million in the past year is also impressive,” said Mayor Gretl Crawford. “I do appreciate there was definitely teamwork there and some value engineering to make it a little bit more affordable.”

Pearson stressed that investment in the project will pay dividends for years to come. The new exhibit hall will be able to accommodate a variety of sporting tournaments, from basketball to pickleball to wrestling, as well as allow events and conventions that have outgrown the current facility to return. PFD officials anticipate doubling visitors to the convention center once everything is online.

“Staff and I have already been meeting with local tournament and equipment folks,” Pearson told the council. “The interest is already there, which we're really excited about.”

Crawford and other council members said the expansion is just one more way the city is coming into its own at just the right time. The Port of Kennewick's adjacent Vista Field mixed-use development is beginning to ramp up development as businesses buy parcels and start construction.

“This has been interesting to watch, to see Kennewick become a player in the competitive environment of convention centers in Eastern Washington,” said councilman John Trumbo. “Kennewick is now standing pretty tall and will now stand taller.”

			10.03am 13th March 2025	 -
				Greenkeeping & Agronomy 

From the moment James Bledge took over as Links Manager at Royal Liverpool Golf Club, it was all eyes on preparation for the 151st Open Championship. 

From the moment Brian Harman lifted the Claret Jug in July 2023, the focus changed to how to retain the top-level presentation and play for members to enjoy. 

Part of solving that equation has been a Salsco HP11-III roller which is delivering unparalleled productivity and unprecedented progression in greens speed at the Wirral-based links.  

James first came across Salsco rollers in his previous role at Royal Cinque Ports and, while rolling didn't play a major part in preparations for the Open, he knew it was the solution to retaining standards. 

“Hand cutting again and again is the way to go when resources are high, however, when you only have five staff in on a Saturday morning and you're trying to recreate similar conditions for people travelling hundreds of miles to play the course, it's simply not feasible. The HP11-III with three wide rollers allows us to deliver the greens to an incredibly high standard and has been pivotal to retaining the post-Open ‘buzz'.”  

The Salsco HP11-III roller features three oscillating rollers which articulate to guarantee 100% roll-to-ground contact. With a combined rolling width of 73 inches and an almost 11mph ground speed, it delivers efficiency and quality with every roll, on every terrain. 

“We'll use the Salsco two or three times during the week and after mowing ahead of weekend competitions for that extra bit of greens speed. We also roll throughout the winter instead of cutting to retain presentation and minimise plant stress,” James explains.

“In terms of operation, it's the comfiest roller on the market in my opinion. Because of the mounted brush system, it's also the cleanest, dispersing any debris pick-up meaning we can use it after sand-dressing, verti-cutting and grooming operations. It's gone from being a two-person job, to a one-person job.”

He adds, “There's also evidence to suggest rolling can reduce the impact of Dollar Spot so, in conjunction with careful nutritional management, we've been rolling prone areas to remove moisture and create conditions less conducive to the disease.” 

James also had good things to say about the service received from the importers Lister Wilder, having used them at his previous club. “They have always been a good company to work alongside – at the end of the phone if we ever need anything and with the right support and answers to any questions we may have.” 

World Long Drive has announced a new partnership with Pinnacle, designating the brand as the official golf ball partner of World Long Drive tour events for the 2025 season. 

Bowood Hotel, Spa & Golf Resort in Wiltshire has appointed a new Director of Golf and promoted from within for its new Head Greenkeeper as it seeks to further enhance its member and visitor experience.

Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard has reiterated its determination to acquire Seven & i Holdings, although the operator of Japan's top convenience store chain has rejected its offer

Canada's Couche-Tard's Chief Stresses 'Friendly' Interest in Japan's 7-Eleven Chain

TOKYO (AP) — Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard reaffirmed Thursday that it is determined to acquire Seven & i Holdings, although the operator of Japan's top convenience store chain has rejected its offer.

“We are continuing to pursue a friendly, mutually agreeable transaction,” the chairman and founder of Alimentation Couche-Tard, Alain Bouchard, told reporters in Tokyo. 

Bouchard stressed that his company was pursuing a “friendly” transaction, not a hostile takeover. He reiterated his promise to retain local management, saying the merger would be good for 7-Eleven's business.

The chain has more than 20,000 stores nationwide and more than 80,000 outlets around the world, serving an estimated 63 million customers a day, according to Tokyo-based Seven & i Holdings Co. 

In rejecting the Canadian company's offer, Seven & i Holdings said it intends to boost its own corporate value. It also has raised antitrust concerns that it says will come up in the U.S. 

Seven & i appointed a new chief executive this month and announced a share buyback and said it will sell its supermarket subsidiary to U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, to help boost its value and fend off the acquisition.

Last year, Couche-Tard, which operates Circle K stores, proposed acquiring all of Seven & i Holdings shares for $14.86 per share in cash. Media reports now say the offer is for $18.19 per share, or about 7 trillion yen ($47 billion).

Seven & i has made public a letter that Stephen Dacus, its new chief executive, sent to Bouchard in September, explaining why it was rejecting the Canadian company's offer. 

“The proposal is not in the best interest of 7&i shareholders and other stakeholders. We are open to engaging in sincere discussions should you put forth a proposal that fully recognizes our standalone intrinsic value,” Dacus wrote.

Convenience stores, known as “conbini” in Japan, are popular, offering various services such as paying utility bills and selling concert tickets, while selling various everyday goods. 

Seven & i announced a restructuring plan last year to strengthen its U.S. business and streamline operations, closing some Ito-Yokado supermarkets in Japan. In 2023, Seven & i sold its Sogo & Seibu department stores in Japan to Fortress Investment Group, a U.S. fund, for $1.5 billion.

Couche-Tard, founded in 1980 in Quebec, offers coffee, beer, snacks, fuel and lottery tickets. It runs more than 16,800 stores worldwide, including in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

Crews work to take down Mequon's original Hahn Ace Hardware location. A Chase Bank has been approved to be built in its place.

MEQUON — The city of Mequon's original Ace Hardware location at 11001 N. Port Washington Road began the demolition process Tuesday.

The store, which first opened up shop in 1981, still remains present in the community after it relocated up the road last year and filled over half of the former Pick 'n Save at 11300 N. Port Washington Road that had been vacant for more than a decade. The other half will now be occupied by Planet Fitness.

""It was a destination more than a store,"" Han Ace-Mequon Manager Jim Harts recalled about the previous building. ""It was one of the great spots. You could always come in with your kids and grab some popcorn and shop away and just chit chat and let us help you with your projects. So yeah, people are going to miss the intimacy of that store.""

Independently owned by Perry, Barb, and Adam Hahn, the second-generation, family-owned and operated local Hahn Ace Hardware also currently serves the Hartford, Delafield, Mukwonago and Menomonee Falls areas.

Belgian Prosecutors Arrest Suspects in Huawei Bribery Probe Targeting EU Parliament

BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgian federal prosecutors on Thursday announced the arrests of several people in a corruption probe linked to the European Parliament and the Chinese company Huawei, which is suspected of bribing EU lawmakers.

The arrests came as an investigation by Le Soir newspaper and other media said lobbyists working for the Chinese telecoms giant were suspected of bribing current or former European Parliament members to promote the company's commercial policies in Europe.

The prosecutor's office confirmed in a statement that the alleged bribery “is said to have benefited Huawei.” 

About 100 federal police officers carried out 21 searches in Brussels, the Flanders and Wallonia regions, and Portugal. The investigating magistrate in charge of the case also asked for seals to be placed on offices inside the EU Parliament allocated to two parliamentary assistants allegedly involved.

Prosecutors said one person was arrested in France.

The suspects would be questioned over “alleged involvement in active corruption within the European Parliament, as well as for forgery and use of forgeries,” prosecutors said. “The offences were allegedly committed by a criminal organization.”

The company said in a statement that “Huawei takes these allegations seriously and will urgently communicate with the investigation to further understand the situation.”

“Huawei has a zero tolerance policy towards corruption or other wrongdoing, and we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations at all times,” it added.

The European Parliament said only that the assembly “takes note of the information"" and ""always cooperates fully with the judicial authorities.”

Huawei, which makes cellphones and is the biggest maker of networking gear for phone and internet carriers, has been caught in tensions between the United States and China over technology and trade. 

READ:  

Some European nations have followed Washington's lead and banned Huawei's equipment from next-generation mobile networks over allegations that it poses a security risk that could help facilitate Chinese spying. The company has repeatedly denied this.

European Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said the EU's executive branch had no comment regarding the investigation but underlined the commission's security concerns about Huawei and Europe's fifth-generation mobile phone networks.

“The security of our 5G networks is obviously crucial for our economy,” Regnier told reporters. “Huawei represents materially higher risks than other 5G suppliers.”

EU member states should swiftly ""adopt decisions to restrict or to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks,” Regnier said. “A lack of swift action would expose the EU as a whole to a clear risk.”

The prosecutor's office said it believes there was corruption “from 2021 to the present day"" in various forms, ""such as remuneration for taking political positions or excessive gifts such as food and travel expenses or regular invitations to football matches.""

Prosecutors also believe payments might have been disguised as business expenses and in some cases may have been directed to third parties. They said they would also look to ""detect any evidence of money laundering.”

Police seized several documents and objects during the searches. Staff at Huawei's offices in Brussels declined to comment and turned the lights off inside to avoid photographs taken through the window.

This is the second corruption case targeting the EU Parliament in less than three years. 

In December 2022, the legislature was shaken by a corruption scandal in which Qatari officials were accused of bribing EU officials to play down labor rights concerns ahead of the soccer World Cup.

The scandal scarred the reputation of the EU's only institution comprised of officials elected directly in the 27 member countries. It undermined the assembly's claim to the moral high ground in its own investigations, such as into allegations of corruption in member country Hungary.

EU Greens lawmaker Daniel Freund — who supervised the work of the assembly's ethics body during the scandal, dubbed Qatargate — said Thursday the parliament's reputation is again under threat.

“The risk of corruption in Brussels is high because the EU is so influential,"" he said. ""We need a complete investigation quickly, and finally reforms that will make the Parliament more resistant to corruption.”

According to Follow The Money, an investigative journalism platform, one of the main suspects in the probe is 41-year-old Valerio Ottati, a Belgian-Italian lobbyist who joined Huawei in 2019. 

Before becoming Huawei's EU public affairs director, Ottati was an assistant to two Italian MEPs who were both members of a European Parliament group dealing with China policy, Follow the Money reported.

There are now eight businesses near George Floyd Square who've filed lawsuits against the city of Minneapolis, claiming their businesses have suffered because the city failed to open the intersection and 38th and Chicago in a timely and safe manner.

Attorney Michael Healey represents all of the business owners in the suit. He told 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS why his clients are seeking financial compensation.

“The complaint represents both Cup Foods and seven other business owners at the intersection essentially that their businesses were destroyed by the conduct of the city,” said Healey.

The plaintiffs are seeking $49 million, according to court records.

In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs claim they've lost income, employees and their property values have dropped significantly.

A city spokesperson issued a statement which said, in part, “As with all areas of the city, MPD provides 24/7 emergency response to the 38th and Chicago area. Chief O'Hara has assigned two officers to a dedicated beat in this area, focusing on community engagement, relationship-building, and collaborating with local businesses and residents.”

The next court hearing is later this month.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his new administration.

McALLEN, Texas (AP) — The Trump administration moved to drop a civil lawsuit Wednesday against the largest provider of housing for migrant children over allegations of sexual abuse and harassment of unaccompanied minors, saying it also would no longer use the provider.

The motion to dismiss the suit against Southwest Key Programs was filed after the federal government announced it had moved all unaccompanied children to other shelters.

The complaint, filed last year during the Biden administration, alleged a litany of offenses between 2015 and 2023 as Southwest Key Programs, which operates migrant shelters in Texas, Arizona and California, amassed nearly $3 billion in contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services. 

The agency said it stopped sending unaccompanied children to the provider's facilities “out of continuing concerns relating to these placements,” and said it would review grants going to the contractor. In view of the agency's action, the Department of Justice has dismissed its lawsuit against Southwest Key, HHS said in a statement. 

The shelter provider said they were pleased with the decision to dismiss the case. “Southwest Key strongly denied the claims relating to child sexual abuse in our shelters, and there is no settlement or payment required,” the statement Wednesday evening said. 

“We always believed the facts would prove the allegations to be without merit. We thank the Government for its commitment to reviewing the whole record and dropping the case with prejudice,” they added.




This week, Southwest Key Programs furloughed employees across the country. “Due to the unforeseen federal funding freeze and the stop placement order on our unaccompanied minor shelters and Home Study Post Release programs by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, we have made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 5,000 Southwest Key Programs' employees,” the company said in a statement shared Tuesday.

According to allegations in the 2024 lawsuit, Southwest Key employees, including supervisors, raped, inappropriately touched or solicited sex and nude images of children beginning at least in 2015.

Among the accusations: One employee “repeatedly sexually abused” three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas, with the 8-year-old telling investigators the worker “entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their ‘private area.'”

The lawsuit also alleged that another employee, at a shelter in Mesa, Arizona, took a 15-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.

Children were warned not to report the alleged abuse and threatened with violence against themselves or their families if they did, according to the lawsuit. Victims testified that in some instances, other workers knew about the abuse but failed to report or concealed it, the complaint said.

“DOJ's lawsuit revealed horrific sexual abuse and inhumane treatment of children detained in Southwest Key shelters,” said Leecia Welch, an attorney who represents unaccompanied children in a separate case. “It's shocking to me that the government now turns a blind eye to their own contractor's actions. I hope the impacted children will have other legal recourse and support in healing from their abuse.”

The lawsuit may not be over. On Wednesday, the National Center for Youth Law asked the court not to dismiss the case and grant them an opportunity to formally intervene on behalf of those affected by the alleged abuse. If granted, they would have 30 days to file a motion in the lawsuit.

At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020. 

The civil lawsuit had sought a jury trial and monetary damages for the victims.

The letter did not specify why exactly the program fell short on funds. While experts note there are many factors that go into Medicaid costs, some are pointing to the money the state spends providing health insurance to undocumented people.

The letter comes weeks after Newsom's administration officials told lawmakers they had underestimated the cost. 

During a line of questioning in an Assembly budget hearing last month, Assemblyman Carl DeMaio, R-Riverside, asked about the expense. Newsom's Department of Finance said the state is estimated to spend $9.5 billion to provide Medi-Cal to undocumented people, with $8.4 billion coming from the state's general fund. The number had grown from the $6 billion that was initially projected. 

DeMaio criticized the expense, and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas eventually removed him from the committee weeks later. 

""Unbelievable!  The mismanagement continues.  Now they want a loan? We said it then and we'll say it again: we can't afford the failed leadership of @GavinNewsom and the Democratic supermajority,"" Assembly Republican Minority Leader James Gallagher posted on X Wednesday night.  

The loan would come from the state's general fund, specifically an account meant for economic uncertainties which California taxpayers provide.  

""This isn't new — as the administration outlined in the Governor's January budget proposal, additional funding is needed to support Medi-Cal,"" said Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom. ""Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike. This is not unique to California.""  

Other states grappling with the rising Medicaid costs include Pennsylvania, Colorado and Indiana.  

Newsom's Department of Finance submitted a similar letter last year to the legislature for a $1.75 billion loan. The department at the time said that the loan was specifically necessary primarily because of an issue with timing related to a tax on health insurance plans.

Las Vegas (KSNV) — Nevada State Senator Melanie Scheible has introduced Senate Bill 352, a significant legislative effort aimed at ensuring equal access to quality health care for all Nevadans, including LGBTQ+ individuals. 

The bill seeks to prohibit discrimination by both public and private health insurance carriers and providers based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability.

The proposed legislation would apply to health insurance policies, including Medicaid and the Nevada ACA Exchange, and would also prevent healthcare providers from engaging in discriminatory practices. 

Additionally, it empowers state regulatory boards and agencies to adopt regulations and discipline providers who violate these prohibitions.

André C. Wade, State Director for Silver State Equality, expressed strong support for the bill. ""This bill makes a resolute stance against discriminatory practices that can hinder the delivery of healthcare service to a large portion of Nevada's population,"" Wade said. 

He emphasized the importance of enshrining these protections into state law, particularly for the LGBTQ+ community, and praised Senator Scheible's commitment to the health and well-being of every Nevadan.

""In Nevada, we believe in equality, and that includes equality in healthcare,"" said Scheible. ""Senate Bill 352 will maintain our commitment to non-discrimination in health insurance and give Nevadans equal opportunities to access health plans.""

Silver State Equality has endorsed the passage of SB 352, highlighting it as a critical step toward a fair healthcare system in Nevada.","{'href': 'https://news3lv.com', 'title': 'News3LV'}"

UN experts say Israel ‘intentionally attacked and destroyed' the Palestinian territory's main fertility centre.

Israel has carried out “genocidal acts” against Palestinians by systematically destroying women's healthcare facilities during its war on Gaza and using sexual violence as a war strategy, United Nations experts have said.

On Thursday, the Geneva-based Independent International Commission of Inquiry said in a new report that Israel “intentionally attacked and destroyed” Gaza's main fertility centre while simultaneously blocking medicine for pregnancies, deliveries and neonatal care from entering the enclave.

In its report, the commission found that Israeli authorities “have destroyed … the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group through the systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive healthcare”, it said in a statement.

It added that this amounted to “two categories of genocidal acts” during Israel's offensive in Gaza, launched after the attacks by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023.

For its part, “Israel categorically rejects the unfounded allegations”, its mission in Geneva said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the UN investigation for “false accusations, including absurd claims”.

“The anti-Israeli circus known as the UN Human Rights Council has long been exposed as an anti-Semitic, corrupt, terror-supporting, and irrelevant body,” Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office on Thursday.

 



 

The report said maternity hospitals and wards had been systematically destroyed in Gaza, along with the Al-Basma IVF Centre, the territory's main in-vitro fertility clinic.

It said Al-Basma was intentionally shelled in December 2023, destroying about 4,000 embryos at a clinic that served 2,000-3,000 patients a month.

The commission found no credible evidence that the building was used for military purposes.

It said the destruction “was a measure intended to prevent births among Palestinians in Gaza, which is a genocidal act”.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, the former UN Humanitarian Affairs Coordinator Martin Griffiths said “it's good that the UN is now talking about genocide, because up to now it's been very careful about that word”.

And while he said that the evidence for genocide was “incontrovertible” and that the findings were “long overdue”, he steered clear of saying that either the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or the International Criminal Court (ICC) would bring those accountable to justice.

“Will it be a legally enforced claim? I don't think so,” he said of the report's findings.

The report came after the commission conducted public hearings in Geneva on Tuesday and Wednesday, hearing from victims and witnesses of sexual violence.

It concluded that Israel had targeted civilian women and girls directly, “acts that constitute the crime against humanity of murder and the war crime of wilful killing”.

The commission added that forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, as well as sexual assault, comprise part of the Israeli forces' “standard operating procedures” towards Palestinians.

On a calm day in one of Minnesota's busiest emergency rooms, Dr. John Hick stands next to a ventilator.

“During COVID, these things were getting an absolute workout because we had a lot of people in the emergency department on them,” Hick said. “We never ran out of such critical devices. I cringe thinking of potential future epidemics where that becomes an issue.”

In March 2020, while working at HCMC in Minneapolis, Hick, an emergency physician and medical director for emergency preparedness, began hearing reports of increasing COVID-19 cases in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in skilled nursing facilities. He realized it was only a matter of time before the virus reached his own hospital.

The emerging risk from exposure to COVID-19 led governors across the country to declare states of emergency. Gov. Tim Walz issued an order on March 13. Days later, he ordered schools, restaurants and bars to close.

At the same time, hospitals began to fill up with severely ill patients, many of whom were struggling to breathe.

When patients began arriving at HCMC, health care providers were ready. Hick said they also felt nervous due to the unpredictability surrounding a potential surge in cases.

“This was a disease that we did not have a lot of experience with. We did not have a vaccine for it or any antivirals at the time,” he said.

Hick led the state's health care response alongside the health department and the Minnesota Hospital Association during the first several months of the pandemic.

There are inherent risks associated with practicing medicine in an emergency department, such as exposure to infectious diseases and injury caused by patients. But Hick said the pandemic intensified everything.

He added that it was difficult at times to transfer critically ill patients to available medical facilities quickly, distressing health care providers, especially in greater Minnesota.

Small hospitals across the state were overwhelmed with patients. To address this issue, health officials formed the statewide Medical Operations Coordination Center, a bridge between private and public health care and state emergency management agencies.

“I see that as a big win, but it was a full-on effort, and I think we can do better in the future with that too,” Hick said.

Even with increased cooperation, the entire statewide health care system in the pandemic's early years came under unprecedented strain. Many patients were intubated, which is a serious and invasive medical procedure involving the insertion of a tube into the trachea through the mouth or nose to maintain an open airway. The staff at HCMC were unsure about when, or if, these patients would be able to breathe independently again.

“We were taking care of patients who were needing to be on ventilators and were challenged with some pretty significant volumes of COVID patients,” Hick said. “I felt like I was just walking from one cube into the next with identical patients.”

The COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on the mental and physical well-being of health care workers. Many reported increased levels of stress, anxiety, fatigue, and grief from constant exposure to patient deaths and the demands of the job.

A 2021 survey conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health explored how health care providers were affected by COVID-19. Many considered leaving their careers due to stressors associated with providing care during the pandemic. The data shows that “respiratory therapists were four times more likely to say they were leaving due to burnout or dissatisfaction in 2021 compared to 2019.” Physician assistants and registered nurses said they were three times as likely to leave their careers within five years for the same reasons.

Although Hick was accustomed to witnessing and treating trauma, this experience was exceptionally difficult. Family members and friends outside of the medical field did not grasp what he was dealing with at work.

Hennepin Healthcare provided peer support and encouraged people to take care of themselves, Hick said.

“I would get home from the Emergency Operations Center, usually after dark,” he said, his voice breaking. “But I would make it a point to go down to the lake and look across Bde Maka Ska, see the lights reflecting and just take a few minutes to know it's going to be okay.”

Hick is not the same person he was before the pandemic and is more aware of his vulnerability and mortality. However, he is not abandoning emergency medicine. Instead, he feels motivated to continue making health care safer for both the providers and the patients he serves.

“There is a lot of things that we became aware of post-pandemic about the fragility of ourselves and of our health care system,” Hick said. “But I think we also learned a lot about our resilience.”","{'href': 'https://www.mprnews.org', 'title': 'MPR News'}"

Danielle Drainer recalled the hospital bill she received after her son, Charlie, spent a month in the intensive care unit due to unexplained blood clots. Even with private insurance through her job, the Dover mom said she faced a $200,000 bill.

""Medicaid picked that up,"" she said. Without it, she added, ""we would still be in debt.""

Now, Drainer and thousands of Delaware residents may lose that safety net. As Congress scrambles to prevent a partial government shutdown before Friday's deadline, a fight over a proposed $880 billion budget cut to Medicaid could strip coverage from 41,000 Delaware residents, putting critical health care out of reach for some of the state's most vulnerable people.

While this week's short-term funding bill does not impose these reductions, Democrats and advocates warn that it paves the way for them to happen later this year.

A separate Republican-led budget plan, expected to be debated this spring or summer, could bring sweeping changes to Delaware's health care system. While supporters argue the cuts are aimed at reducing unnecessary spending, critics warn they target Medicaid and would come at the cost of essential coverage and services, particularly for the state's most vulnerable residents.

For Drainer, the debate isn't just about budgets or politics; it's about keeping her son healthy. Medical specialists diagnosed Charlie with antiphospholipid syndrome. To treat his recurring blood clots, Charlie, now 11, ""will be on blood thinners for the rest of his life,"" she said. ""If it wasn't for Medicaid, we would not be able to afford them at all.""

In February, House Republicans passed a budget resolution that includes $880 billion in cuts to programs overseen by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. These programs include Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP, and Medicare. If enacted, these cuts could have devastating consequences for thousands of Delaware families who rely on Medicaid for lifesaving care.

Although House Republicans deny targeting Medicaid, they also said reductions will address ""fraud, waste and abuse"" in the program. Health care advocates and Democratic lawmakers argue that such steep cuts would be impossible to implement without significantly slashing coverage and services, potentially leaving some of Delaware's most vulnerable residents without access to essential health care.

For Nancy Lemus, another Dover mother, Medicaid is a particularly critical lifeline. Her 19-year-old son, Christopher Garcia, has complex medical needs requiring a tracheostomy tube, ventilator, feeding pump, oxygen and 35 different medications administered every two hours. His formula alone costs $300 a day. All of it is covered through a Medicaid waiver program called the Children's Community Alternative Disability Program.

The program provides Medicaid coverage to severely disabled children who do not qualify for Supplemental Security Income or other Medicaid programs because of their parents' income. The program is designed for children whose disabilities would likely result in death without care, requiring a level of support equivalent to nursing facility care, but at a lower cost in a home setting.

Lemus works multiple jobs to structure her schedule around Christopher's care, filling in when skilled nurses aren't available. She said even if she could physically care for her son at home, the looming cuts would make it impossible to afford the medical equipment that keeps her son alive.

If the cuts to Medicaid were to happen, Lemus said they could keep her son home until they come and remove the rented medical equipment from her house. She would have to put him in a hospital.

""That's our backup plan, right now."" Lemus said. She said other families she's talked to are planning to do the same.

While this week's continuing resolution to fund the government doesn't include Medicaid cuts, U.S. Rep. Sarah McBride warns of a separate reconciliation package expected this spring that could slash $880 billion from Medicaid nationwide.

Under House Republicans' proposed budget, the cuts will be made from programs overseen by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which includes Medicaid, CHIP and Medicare.

Medicaid operates through state and federal funding. In Delaware, the federal government provides $1.50 for every dollar Delaware spends on Medicaid, totaling over $2 billion annually, McBride said in an interview Tuesday. This includes those enrolled under Medicaid expansion, which covers low-income adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level, with the federal government covering 90% of the costs.

McBride warned the proposed cuts could result in Delaware's losing an estimated $200 million in federal Medicaid funding, forcing the state to either reallocate funds or reduce coverage. A study by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimates that, if enacted, these cuts could lead to 41,000 Delawareans losing coverage.

The ripple effects would extend far beyond individual families.

Hospitals that serve a high number of low-income patients, known as Disproportionate Share Hospitals, rely on Medicaid funding to cover uncompensated care costs. Reducing Medicaid reimbursement rates could push some hospitals to scale back services or even close.

With roughly 25% of Delaware residents on Medicaid, hospitals and clinics that serve lower-income communities would face severe financial strain.

Additionally, health care job losses could follow. Lemus pointed out that Garcia's Medicaid-funded care supports multiple full-time employees, including nurses and therapists. If coverage were cut, those jobs would also disappear.

While Medicaid cuts could leave thousands without coverage, McBride argued that reducing health care costs requires a comprehensive approach rather than funding cuts.

McBride emphasized the need to increase the number of health care providers in Delaware and nationwide to expand access to care. She also called for stronger protections for the uninsured and underinsured, ensuring that no one is forced to pay out of pocket for life-saving or medically necessary care due to a lack of coverage.

Additionally, she highlighted the need to curb high deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses and copayments, which can leave insured patients struggling with overwhelming medical bills.

On prescription drugs, McBride pointed to recent federal legislation under the Biden administration, which gave Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices for the first time. She said that expanding these cost-cutting measures could further reduce prescription drug prices for Medicaid recipients and the broader public.

According to McBride, Delaware's congressional delegation — Sen. Chris Coons, Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, along with McBride — have vowed to fight against the proposed Medicaid cuts. The congresswoman emphasized that Delaware lawmakers are working to “sound the alarm nationally” about the devastating effects these reductions could have on families, hospitals, and the state's economy.

""This isn't just about numbers,"" McBride said. ""We're focused on protecting Medicaid from cuts by lifting the voices of Delawareans who've seen their lives improved or even saved because of this coverage.""

As Congress moves closer to a final decision in the coming months, Delaware families and health care providers remain on edge.

To those who support these cuts, this decision is life or death, said Drainer, the mother whose son suffered unexplained blood clots. Cutting Medicaid won't solve the national debt, but it ""could take my child's life,” she said.

The Holy See Press Office updated reporters on the Pope's condition on Thursday evening, as he marked the 12th anniversary of his election to the papacy.

In the afternoon, the medical staff brought a cake with candles to the Pope's room.

The Pope also followed the Spiritual Exercises for the Roman Curia via video link with the Paul VI Hall, and resumed respiratory therapy.

He continues to alternate between non-invasive mechanical ventilation at night and high-flow oxygenation with nasal cannulas during the day.

His clinical situation remains stable within a complex condition. A new medical bulletin is expected on Friday evening.

Pope Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital on February 14 to receive treatment for bilateral pneumonia.

Students flock to Fox Hall to meet with professionals in the healthcare industry. Photos by Tom Zucco

For Eckerd College students interested in volunteering, interning or having a career in public health, this was an event not to miss. And they didn't.

More than 100 students gathered around tables inside Fox Hall on a recent Wednesday afternoon to learn about opportunities in the healthcare industry. Titled Careers in Public Health: An Informational Fair, the event was part of larger efforts by Eckerd's public health faculty to prepare students for future educational and career paths in the field of public health. The fair was co-sponsored by Eckerd's public health minor and the College's Pre-Health Club.

Among the presenters were representatives from the St. Petersburg Free Clinic, Feeding Tampa Bay, CAN Community Health, Metro Wellness, the Suncoast Center, the Peace Corps, the Florida Department of Health, Empath and the Master's of Public Health programs at Rollins College and at the University of South Florida.

“I was really pleased with the event,” says Lisa Miller, Ph.D., associate professor of sociology at Eckerd, who organized the fair along with Sarah Lyle, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychology. Miller adds that along with visiting with the various organizations, “a number of students stopped by to learn about Eckerd's public health minor, so they could be able to focus on coursework in that area.

Peace Corps recruiter Claudale Daniels drew a large crowd of students.

“We have a huge need for public and community health workers across the globe, especially in the area of illness prevention,” Miller says. “Public health professionals help stop disease and other poor health outcomes in their tracks before they even begin. The students also got to meet with people who work in the field and learn about internship opportunities, careers and master's programs. The fair went over so well that we're planning for a bigger one next spring.”

Eckerd's public health minor, coordinated by Miller, is designed to provide a pre-professional background for students interested in careers in public health, medicine, healthcare administration, health education, epidemiology and related fields. The minor requires five courses: Foundations of Public Health, a Statistics course and three approved electives.

Also represented at the fair was the student-run Pre-Health Club, which includes fields such as pre-vet, biomedical research, pre-nursing, pre–physician assistant and pre-med. There are approximately 200 student names in the club mailing list, and the aim is to network, guide and support pre-health students at Eckerd. Lisa Bonner, assistant professor of chemistry, and Denise Flaherty, associate professor of biology, are the faculty advisers.

Pre-Health Club Secretary Emma Rodriguez is a senior from Hillsborough, New Jersey, majoring in international relations and global affairs and minoring in Spanish and public health. She also volunteers at Metro Inclusive Health, a nonprofit organization that provides health and wellness services throughout the Tampa Bay area and had a table at the event.

“I think we got a ton of freshmen and sophomores at the fair,” Emma says. “And that's great because Metro and many other organizations are offering positions of employment as well as internships and volunteering. After COVID, I think people were exhausted hearing about public health issues. Now people have room to breathe and time to process the idea of not letting that happen again.”

Emma took a break to visit a crowded Peace Corps table and chat with Claudale Daniels, the Peace Corps' Central Florida recruiter. A member of the Eckerd College Peace Corps Prep program, Emma will travel to the Dominican Republic in August to spend two years teaching healthy living practices to middle school– and high school–aged students.

“I get goosebumps when I meet with the students and hear how interested they are,” Daniels says. “Not a lot of people think about it, but the Peace Corps is one of the most challenging things you'll ever do in your life. But living and teaching in an underserved community, there's nothing more rewarding.”

Deenah McFadden, a senior from Willoughby, Ohio, who is co-president of the Pre-Health Club, plans to take a gap year before she starts medical school. She intends to use that year to work in public health or medical research. “I want to see how much I like the public health field to see if I should pursue a dual-degree program,” she explains, “and talk with people already in the public health field about what they enjoy and what they don't.”

An anthropology and biology student who is minoring in public health, Deenah got a good start at the fair, visiting with representatives of all 10 organizations while also helping out at the Pre-Health table.

“I was surprised at first to see so many people at the fair,” she admits. “I know how much interest there is in the public health minor, but to see them follow through on it was exciting.”

Just as Google and Amazon expanded far beyond their initial offerings, successful healthcare AI companies must evolve into comprehensive platforms that address both clinical and operational challenges.

Healthcare is on the cusp of an AI revolution, but only the surface of its transformative potential has been explored.  As the first wave of AI adoption in healthcare unfolds, a fascinating pattern is emerging that mirrors the evolution of tech giants like Amazon and Google — a journey from singular solutions to comprehensive platforms that reshape entire industries. It's a roadmap worth studying for innovators looking to break through in this crowded market, and healthcare organizations looking to stay ahead of the curve in AI adoption.

The commoditization challenge

The initial breakthrough in healthcare AI came through ambient scribing — AI-powered systems that automatically document patient-provider interactions. This technology addressed a critical pain-point in healthcare: the administrative burden that takes physicians away from patient care. The market responded enthusiastically, with numerous startups entering the space and achieving rapid adoption. In fact, KLAS Research reported that 93% of health systems expect to adopt ambient AI tools at a moderate to deep level within the next six months.


					Transitioning to PDPM models significantly shifted the healthcare industry. By replacing the RUG system, healthcare providers cut waste and more accurately reflect the care each patient received.				

However, as AI technology becomes increasingly commoditized, there has already been an inevitable race to the bottom in pricing for these single-use solutions. Enterprise contract values for scribing services are now feeling the pressure of intense competition. This trend signals an important reality: Standalone scribing solutions, while valuable, won't be enough to build sustainable, large-scale businesses in the long term.

Platform evolution: The key to sustainable value

While the first wave of healthcare AI innovation focused on niche use cases, many of these solutions will struggle to scale into large, standalone businesses. To create long-term value, the second wave of innovation must be integrated, data-driven platforms that address multiple healthcare functions and produce visible return on investment. 

The healthcare AI market is further complicated by the dominance of large incumbents, such as Epic and Microsoft, which control much of the healthcare infrastructure and exert significant influence over data, operations, and workflow. This creates challenges for niche AI startups, which may either struggle to carve out a sizeable market or face the risk of being outcompeted when the incumbents inevitably enter the space and introduce competing products. 


					A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.				

Learning from big tech's playbook

However, opportunities for innovation remain in areas where the incumbents may not establish dominance. AI companies that focus on building platforms that work alongside physicians and integrate seamlessly with existing tools and platforms have the potential to complement, rather than compete with, current infrastructures.

The broader potential of AI in healthcare will mirror the evolution seen in other technology sectors. Companies like Google and Amazon began with narrow, specialized products — Google as a search engine and Amazon as an online bookstore — but quickly expanded into integrated, expansive platforms. A similar shift is happening in healthcare. Initially focused on specific use cases, AI companies are now evolving into comprehensive platforms that address both clinical and operational challenges. While still in its early stages, healthcare AI is transitioning toward data-driven, holistic platforms that span a wide range of functions and services. To remain competitive, today's niche AI use cases will need to expand their capabilities and evolve into the next generation of platforms.

The evolution from scribing to broader platforms is already underway, with the emergence of what Elion Health calls the “clinician copilot” — an integrated clinical and non-clinical AI layer that sits atop the EHR. This platform evolution follows a natural progression, starting with ambient scribing, extending to clinical summarization, and now expanding into clinical decision support.

A prime example of this transition is the partnership between Abridge and UpToDate (Wolters Kluwer Health). This collaboration represents more than just an incremental improvement — it's a fundamental shift in how healthcare providers engage with clinical data. By combining AI-powered transcription of patient-provider conversations with immediate access to UpToDate's extensive medical database, the platform enables real-time, evidence-based decision-making at the point of care. This integration moves beyond simple documentation to create a comprehensive system that enhances both the quality and speed of care delivery.

The smart hospital room opportunity

Companies that gain momentum in the market can turn it into long term success if they build their solutions with a platform approach in mind. For example, as ambient scribing companies look to expand their platform capabilities beyond clinical decision support, there is a unique opportunity in the smart hospital room space. This represents a natural yet transformative extension of their existing technology stack, one that could redefine the future of inpatient care while building a defensible platform moat.

By integrating their ambient documentation capabilities with AI-powered video monitoring systems, these companies could create a comprehensive platform that owns the entire hospital room experience. This platform would combine:

This convergence of capabilities is particularly powerful because it leverages the unique strengths of ambient scribing companies — their expertise in capturing and processing real-time healthcare interactions — while expanding into new, high-value territories. By combining written and visual AI technologies, these companies can build a platform that not only improves care delivery but also creates significant barriers to entry for competitors.

Transforming healthcare's AI future

The path forward is clear: While ambient scribing marked the beginning of healthcare's AI journey, the future belongs to integrated platforms that can transform multiple aspects of healthcare delivery. Just as Google and Amazon expanded far beyond their initial offerings, successful healthcare AI companies must evolve into comprehensive platforms that address both clinical and operational challenges. The “clinician copilot” represents a compelling example of this platform evolution. Companies that recognize this opportunity and successfully execute this platform strategy will be the ones that ultimately reshape healthcare for the better.

The future of AI in healthcare is incredibly promising. AI will become a central partner in healthcare delivery as these tools evolve from passive assistants to proactive partners. The transformation it brings — driving efficiency, improving patient outcomes, and reshaping the way care is delivered — can redefine the industry across clinical and operational functions.

Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: AVAH) is still working on executing its transformation strategy — which focuses on preferred payers and obtaining adequate rates from its government partners — while also navigating a tricky labor environment. 

For 2024, the company's goal was to increase the number of private-duty services preferred payer agreements from 14 to 22. The company achieved this goal with the addition of eight additional preferred pay agreements. 

“Our Q4, and full year 2024, results highlight that we continue to align our objectives with those of our preferred payers and government partners,” Aveanna Healthcare CEO Jeff Shaner, said Thursday during the company's fourth quarter earnings call. “By focusing our clinical capacity on our preferred payers, we achieved solid year over year growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA.” 

Atlanta-based Aveanna Healthcare offers a range of pediatric and adult health care services, including nursing, rehabilitation, occupational nursing in schools, therapy services, day treatment centers for medically fragile and chronically ill children and adults, and home health and hospice services. The company has 327 locations across 34 states. 

Though Shaner called out the current labor environment as a primary challenge, he also credited Aveanna Healthcare's preferred payer strategy for the company's improved retention and hiring rates. 

“We also experienced improvement in our caregiver hiring and retention trends by aligning our efforts with those payers willing to engage with us on enhanced reimbursement rates, and value-based agreements,” he said. “While we continue to operate in a challenging environment, our preferred payer strategy allows us to return to a more normalized growth rate in our business segments.” 

Aveanna Healthcare's preferred payer strategy has allowed the company to invest in caregiver wages and recruitment efforts.

Since Aveanna Healthcare's third quarter earnings call, the company has also made strides on a number of its rate improvement initiatives with both government and preferred payers. The company is also seeing signs of improvement in the caregiver labor market, according to Shaner.

The company's 2024 goal was to improve reimbursement rates in our various states, with a particular emphasis on Georgia, Massachusetts and California. Aveanna Healthcare secured double-digit rate improvements in both Georgia and Massachusetts.

“These states demonstrate our government affairs strategy, to partner with state legislatures and governors to identify shortfalls in private-duty nursing wages and to align reimbursement rates to improve access to care for patients with complex medical conditions,” Shaner said.

Overall, Aveanna Healthcare secured 12 private-duty services state rate increases for 2024.

Despite seeing success, Stephens identified this as a potential area of exposure.  

“[Aveanna Healthcare] generates a significant percentage of revenue (~90%) from government payers,” Stephens analysts wrote in the research brief. “[The company] could experience pressure on revenues/adjusted EBITDA from unanticipated changes in government reimbursement rates.”  

On the home health side, the company's 2024 goal was to maintain its episodic payer mix above 70%.

“In Q4 our episodic mix was 76%,” Shaner said. “However, our total episodic volume growth was slightly lower as compared to the prior year period. We ended 2024 with a total of 38 episodic agreements, and are well-positioned for growth in 2025. We are committed to growing our home health volumes, and I expect us to return to positive year-over-year growth trends in the first half of 2025. We will remain focused on aligning our home health caregiver capacity with those payers willing to reimburse us on an episodic basis, and focus on improved clinical and financial outcomes.” 

Shaner also outlines the five primary strategic initiatives that Aveanna Healthcare plans to focus on this year.

“First, enhancing partnerships with government partners and preferred payers to create additional capacity and growth,” he said. “Second, identifying cost efficiencies and synergies that allow us to leverage our growth. Third, modernizing our medical solutions business to achieve our top target operating model. Fourth, managing our capital structure and collecting our cash while producing positive free cash flow, and finally, engaging our leaders and employees and delivering our Aveanna mission.” 

For Q4, Aveanna Healthcare reported revenues of $519.9 million, a 8.6% increase compared to $478.8 million during the same period last year.

The company's private-duty services segment brought in $422 million, a 10.1% increase compared to $383 million in Q4 2023. Its home health and hospice segment checked in at $54.4million, a 0.6% increase compared to $54.1 million during the same period last year.

The company anticipates a 2025 revenue range of $2.10 to $2.12 billion.

“We believe this initial [2025] outlook provides a prudent view, considering the challenges we still face with the evolving environment,” Shaner said.

The CMS estimates terminating the models will save nearly $750 million. The agency will also no longer implement two demonstrations that aimed to improve prescription drug affordability and access.

The CMMI was created under the Affordable Care Act in 2010 to test new payment and delivery models to lower costs and improve quality in government healthcare programs. The agency currently operates 23 active models.

The canceled models tested several different healthcare delivery and payment options, and affected millions of patients across the country. Two models — Primary Care First and Making Care Primary — focused on improving primary care, like helping clinicians shift to value-based payment arrangements and increasing access to advanced services.

The Maryland Total Cost of Care demonstration set a per capita limit on Medicare costs in the state. The demonstration saved Medicare $689 million over its first three years in operation, according to an analysis prepared for the CMS.

However, not all models saved money. The ESRD Treatment Choices experiment, which aimed to promote home dialysis and kidney transplants among Medicare beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease, didn't decrease spending or boost the use of home dialysis over its first two years, according to a model analysis. However, the report released early last year found it was early to form conclusions about the impact of the demonstration.

The CMS will propose terminating the ESRD Treatment Choices model through rulemaking, the CMS said Wednesday.

In addition to the model cancelations, the CMS is considering ways to change or reduce the size of the Integrated Care for Kids model, which aims to prevent or detect behavioral and physical health conditions early among children covered by Medicaid.

The Trump administration said cutting the demonstrations will streamline the focus of CMMI's models and reduce spending, according to the press release.

Participants in the experiments will have through the end of the year to transition to other models, the CMS said. 

The changes at the CMMI come after the agency has received some criticism from lawmakers. Last summer, lawmakers on a House subcommittee, particularly Republicans, noted the CMMI had failed to save money during its first 10 years in operation. 

A report by the Congressional Budget Office published in 2023 found the CMMI increased direct spending by $5.4 billion, or about 0.1% of the net spending on Medicare, between 2011 and 2020. Additionally, the analysis noted few models have been certified for expansion. 

The CMMI has been productive when it comes to doing plenty of experiments and demonstrations, Paul Ginsburg, senior scholar at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, told Healthcare Dive last month.

But “the challenge is ...  how do we actually put value-based payments, or whichever terms you'd want to use, in place as a core part of Medicare provider payments, as opposed to just continuing to do more demonstrations?” he said.

  Philips' business strategy and long-standing commitment to developing and delivering innovative, energy-efficient and increasingly lightweight solutions, resulted in improving the lives of 1.96 billion people in 2024, putting the company well on track to achieve its aim to positively impact 2.5 billion lives per year by 2030.  

  In 2024, Philips increased its circular revenue to 24% of sales and achieved 100% EcoDesigned new product introductions (NPIs) for the first time, enabling better care for more people through sustainable innovation.   

  Philips was recognized by Forbes as one of the World's Best Employers for the sixth consecutive year, positively reflecting on the company's fair hiring, retention and promotion practices and creating equal opportunities for all employees.   

  With a long legacy of reporting responsible business efforts since 1999, including an ESG report since 2008, Philips has now increased its scope and depth to align to the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.  

 “We are proud of the progress we made in 2024, executing our focused strategy to improve people's health and well-being, creating sustainable long-term business value for all our stakeholders,” says Marnix van Ginneken, member of Royal Philips' Board of Management. “Our sustainability-led partnerships with customers and suppliers highlight the potential for significant cost savings, improvements in energy efficiency and expanding access to care in and outside the hospital, while the company continues to explore ways to provide consumers with greater choices to live sustainably.” 

   For the first time, 2024 saw Philips achieve 100% EcoDesigned new product introductions (NPIs). Meeting growing customer demand to support their environmental ambitions, Philips EcoDesigned products are designed to increase energy efficiency, avoid the use of hazardous substances, optimize the use of materials and improve packaging across the product life cycle. These measures are driving significant and systemic changes in healthcare, providing safe, efficient and effective methods of care, while often bringing down costs.  Philips is focused on delivering meaningful innovations and teaming up with partners to improve and expand healthcare delivery with lower carbon emissions. In 2024, Philips grew its portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient and, increasingly, compact and lightweight solutions, while scaling the adoption of circular practices to reduce material use and waste in the healthcare value chain.   Philips introduced helium-free operations in MRI, combining compact and lightweight design, for increased flexibility and ease of installation in difficult and remote locations, contributing to wider access to advanced MRI. Its PowerSave+ feature ensures additional energy savings by switching automatically to stand-by mode within 30 minutes of idle time. MRI scanners equipped with Philips' BlueSeal magnet technology have so far saved more than 2.75 million liters of helium since 2018, eliminating the need for helium refills – a scarce resource – even in the event of a shutdown. This ensures long-term reliability and reduced environmental impact.  In the Personal Health segment, the expansion of the Philips Refurb Edition and local takeback systems across select European markets gave toothbrushes and shavers a second life while supporting consumers in making sustainable choices.   CO₂ emissions across Philips' operations, its logistics and its full value chain were significantly reduced, thanks to low-carbon energy alternatives and optimized planning. Driven by the company's supplier sustainability program, 48% of all purchases (by spend) in 2024 came from suppliers with science-based climate targets – up from 46% in 2023. Collaboration with suppliers also resulted in better continuous improvement skills, with a positive knock-on effect on overall quality and cost management.  Philips continues to team up with customers across the world, to enable better health outcomes and address pressing challenges, including cost of care, staff shortages and growing health disparities and reduce their environmental impact at the same time.    A 2024 analysis confirmed that the collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation (Portugal) achieved a 24% emissions reduction per exam in its radiology and nuclear medicine department in the first year of the partnership.  County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust (UK) with support from Philips, identified key areas where sustainability could be enhanced in ICU care, everything from discharging patients sooner to reducing waste in the supply chain, training staff and refurbishing buildings. Critical care was strategically chosen as a focus area as, per patient, it is a high consumer of electricity and single use items and is one of the most expensive types of care. The recommendations will now serve as a blueprint for further change and targeted improvements to further enhance critical care. A cradle-to-grave analysis of hospital-based radiology services, together with the Department of Radiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (US), found the energy consumption from imaging equipment accounted for more than 50% of the greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis also shed light on areas of focus for future evidence-based decarbonization strategies.

‘Gutfeld!' panelists discuss reports claiming California Gov. Gavin Newsom secretly funded thousands of dollars for a monument of himself.

The California Department of Finance cleared a $3.44 billion loan to make up for a gap in Medi-Cal spending, which critics say is due to illegal immigrant healthcare costs, whereas the governor's office argues it's not out of the ordinary.

It was revealed a few weeks ago that the state had $6 billion in expected costs for Medi-Cal, but it is now roughly $9.5 billion. This comes after it became state law to allow people to qualify for the program regardless of their immigration status. Medi-Cal is the state's Medicaid system for certain Golden State residents, which takes both federal and state taxpayer dollars, according to a state government website. 

Critics of allowing the program's availability to those who are in the country illegally strongly believe it is cause for concern.

""Gov. Gavin Newsom lied and cooked the books to gift all illegal immigrants free healthcare and now has stuck California taxpayers with a multi-billion dollar bill,"" Rep. Carl DeMaio, R-San Diego, told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""This is so egregious that he needs to resign,"" he continued.

DeMaio was the lawmaker who, in a hearing last month, questioned a state budget official who ended up revealing the higher spending figure for MediCal. DeMaio was later removed from the California State Assembly budget committee.

However, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said that California is not the only state facing spending issues with their state-based healthcare programs, such as Pennsylvania, Colorado and Indiana.

""This isn't new — as the administration already outlined in the Governor's January budget proposal, additional funding is needed to support Medi-Cal,"" Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for the governor told Fox News Digital in a statement.

This week, several health IT vendors announced new tools to apply advanced analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to help providers and payers spot potential gaps across care settings by embedding real-time insights into existing workflows.

Innovaccer is offering health plans a new platform integration that targets gap closure and streamlines risk adjustment with a proactive approach, the company announced Wednesday.

Health plans have historically relied on disconnected tools and resource-intensive manual processes that pose compliance risks and increased costs. 

Combining prospective, concurrent and retrospective reviews, payers can use the new platform, called 360-Degree Gap Closure, to leapfrog traditional data silos and close gaps across care provider offices, pharmacies and patients' at-home interventions.

The key to risk adjustment and quality improvement is seamless data exchange with provider EHRs, Innovaccer said. 

With the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services accelerating value-based care adoption, gap closure can improve coding accuracy with automation and enhance member outcomes with advanced analytics.

""We are bringing a much-needed shift in how payers approach risk and quality,"" Abhinav Shashank, Innovaccer's cofounder and CEO, said in a statement. 

""Instead of piecing together multiple vendors and solutions, health plans can now close gaps efficiently across the entire care journey, whether at a provider's office, in pharmacies or through at-home test kits.""

Veradigm announced a gap closure workflow integration for its payer insights platform on Tuesday. 

The company said that more than 3,500 healthcare practices across the United States are now receiving gaps-in-care alerts from several national and regional health plans directly in their EHRs. 

With the alerts, providers can address risk and quality care gaps in their point-of-care workflows, which could enhance clinical decision-making for better patient outcomes. 

""By embedding risk and quality-driven insights into provider workflows, we are fostering a more interconnected healthcare ecosystem that enhances efficiency and improves patient outcomes,"" Jay Bhattacharyya, Veradigm senior vice president and general manager, said in a statement. 

The alerts could also improve claims acceptance rates. With streamlined access to payer incentive programs, providers can earn on average $100 in incentive payments per patient gap addressed in the platform, creating an additional revenue stream, Veradigm said.

For Medicare Advantage plans, improving risk adjustment accuracy and reducing avoidable hospitalizations by closing gaps could result in substantial savings each year. 

The insights have ""made it incredibly easy for us to identify and close care gaps while unlocking significant financial incentives,"" Sneha Patel, chief operating officer of Metroplex Medical Centers in Texas, said in a statement. 

""The ability to take action directly within our EHR makes the entire process seamless.""

MedeAnalytics, a healthcare enterprise data platform and analytics service, has formed a strategic partnership with Holon Solutions, a vendor of workflow integration technology, to develop an integrated patient insights platform that enhances care and reduces overall administrative burdens.

The partners said in their announcement earlier this month that providers will see significant improvements in their operations and patient care quality, including an 80% increase in gap closure rates and a 5% improvement in revenue capture.

Their proprietary artificial intelligence sensor technology powers an overlay located on top of EHRs that provides additional patient data without deviating from clinicians' existing workflows. The integration provides claims and social determinants of health data, which can lead to timely interventions for patients and improved efficiency for care teams, the companies said. 

The overlay also reduces the need for multiple log-ins, and data searches and alerts can be customized for organizational priorities.

""Our partnership with Holon represents a pivotal moment in healthcare data management and analytics,"" said Steve Grieco, MedeAnalytics' CEO, in a statement.

""This synergy not only leads to better patient outcomes and care quality but also optimizes value and increases revenue for both payers and providers.""

""We break down data silos and bring critical information to the forefront of patient care,"" Jon Zimmerman, Holon Solutions' CEO, added.

Brian Pieninck started his career in a storage room, as an IT contractor without a college degree, learning his job as he went. It's been years since then, but the CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield president and CEO says the lessons from that time have remained.

Presenting to a packed room of more than 75 students, faculty and staff on March 12 as part of a UMD School of Public Health Dean's Lecture, Pieninck shared his journey from a first-generation college student to leading one of the nation's largest not-for-profit healthcare insurers. The event began with an introduction from UMD President Darryll J. Pines. 

“Brian has been pursuing a vision of advancing opportunities through both health and economic well-being,” Pines said, before handing the floor to Pieninck.

In a wide-ranging discussion, Pieninck shared several tips for audience members:

Pieninck's origin story, in many ways, began with his mother's “insatiable love of learning,” he said. “She knows a lot, she learns a lot, she's on a learning journey but she never went to college.” 

As his parents tracked every dollar, saving to help their sons have the opportunities they didn't, Pieninck learned that “environment and circumstances matter,” he said. At that IT job and other early positions, people believed in and invested in him – and those made the difference. 

“As much as I was willing to work, I could find success on the other side of the equation [but] circumstances have to be right for that to be true.” He now works to help create those circumstances for people who bring the talent but haven't had opportunities, understanding that “there's a myth of meritocracy that those opportunities exist equally … and it's not demonstrably true.”

 

Pieninck said his approach was to look at the big picture of what makes up a person's life – from public transportation to job opportunities to clean water to food security – and to understand how those factors contribute to the individual. Population health often involves public/private partnerships and groups working collaboratively to find solutions, he said.

CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield has been working deeply in West Baltimore, for example, to bring career opportunities in the organization to their neighborhood, so aspects like transportation become lesser factors, Pieninck said. 

“We benefit when our communities thrive,” says Pieninck as he discussed the importance for CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield to connect with communities and to better understand health needs. Last year CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield employees completed nearly 90,000 volunteer hours in the Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia area. “It's not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do.”

 

AI is the tool of the future. Learn to use it wisely.

Pieninck sees potential and pitfalls in AI to solve healthcare problems. For example, AI could give a patient their likely cost for care before the care happens, rather than waiting for a bill of an unknown amount. He recommended people learn about AI for themselves and be part of the conversation about how AI is used. 

“Have an opinion. Have a firsthand perspective,” he said. “How would you want other people to use it on your behalf? … We have to think about the confluence of what people can uniquely do and do well and what technology could potentially enable and determine the right balance between the two.” The technology, he said, will be a key factor on a global scale in the near future.

Longtime Memphis television broadcaster Richard Ransom is leaving ABC24 to join Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare on March 24, the hospital system announced Thursday.

Ransom spent almost a decade at ABC24 but has been in the Memphis media landscape for 20 years.

At the end of February, Richard posted to his Facebook account that he would be leaving the news industry to embark on a ""new chapter.""

“I am excited to join the team at Methodist and continue to share the stories that matter to Mid-Southerners and support the expert healthcare professionals right here in the Bluff City,” Ransom said in a statement Thursday.

Ransom will join the healthcare system as the Director of Strategic Communication, where he will ""provide guidance"" on employee communications and media relations and support ""community initiatives.""

Methodist President and CEO Dr. Michael Ugwueke said in a statement that Ransom was ""drawn"" to the healthcare system's mission.

“I'm confident that his communications expertise and his familiarity with the health concerns impacting Mid-Southerners will be a benefit to our organization and the community at large,” Ugwueke said.

A graduate of the University of Missouri, Ransom started covering Memphis in 2001 with WMC where he stayed for seven years, according to his LinkedIn. He briefly moved away from Memphis before moving back to work with WREG.

Ransom joined ABC24 in 2017, where he served as an anchor for the station's evening broadcasts, anchor for ""ABC24 This Week"" and has been the managing editor for the station.

Named among the nation's top hospitals for exceptional, patient-centered care


NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation's leading healthcare providers, today announced that 100 of its hospitals have been recognized as 2025 Patient Safety Excellence Award recipients by Healthgrades for providing exceptional, patient-centered care. This annual recognition is given to the top 10% of hospitals for their commitment to delivering safe, high-quality care.





“Patient safety will always be at the forefront of our priorities,” said Dr. Michael Cuffe, executive vice president and chief clinical officer of HCA Healthcare. “I am proud of all of our hospitals and their staff, who continue to strive for clinical excellence, going above and beyond to provide high-quality, compassionate care to the patients who come through our doors.”



Recognition on this list is based solely on patient outcomes. To determine the top-performing hospitals for patient safety, Healthgrades evaluated risk-adjusted complication and mortality rates for approximately 4,500 hospitals nationwide. The annual study found that patients treated in hospitals that received the 2025 Patient Safety Excellence Award have a significantly lower chance of experiencing certain complications than patients treated at non-recipient hospitals.



Earlier this year, 49 HCA Healthcare hospitals were named on the 2025 Healthgrades America's 250 Best Hospitals list for being within the top 5% of hospitals in the country for clinical excellence. Also based exclusively on patient outcomes, the annual designation is reserved for hospitals who demonstrate superior performance in providing care for conditions and procedures across multiple specialty lines and areas.



Across HCA Healthcare, dedicated quality teams strive to engineer patient safety into day-to-day operations across the health system. These teams are responsible for overseeing event reporting, serious event analysis, safe tables, and technologies such as barcode medication administration, among other programs. Safety initiatives are measured partly through a Culture of Safety survey, which is designed to help drive safety agendas and ensure the voices of colleagues are valued and leveraged to deliver safe, quality care.



HCA Healthcare's Patient Safety Organization (PSO), established more than a decade ago, is dedicated to improving patient safety and the quality of healthcare delivery by partnering with HCA Healthcare facilities to build systems, refine processes and foster a culture of safety. Intentionally focusing on protecting conversations around patient safety, the PSO holds an annual, enterprise-wide “Safe Table” campaign to encourage all colleagues to share concerns and ideas related to the delivery of safe, quality care.



The organization has a long history of prioritizing and working to continually improve patient safety and has worked with prominent public and private institutions on industry research, including:



HCA Healthcare has also helped develop evidence-based perinatal protocols through a longstanding partnership with March of Dimes, including prohibiting elective delivery prior to 39 weeks to help babies have a healthy start to life. Additionally, HCA Healthcare developed the Sepsis Prediction and Optimization of Therapy (SPOT) tool, a system to help clinicians more quickly identify patients with sepsis.



About HCA Healthcare



Nashville-based HCA Healthcare is one of the nation's leading providers of healthcare services comprising 190 hospitals and approximately 2,400 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom. With its founding in 1968, HCA Healthcare created a new model for hospital care in the United States, using combined resources to strengthen hospitals, deliver patient-focused care and improve the practice of medicine. HCA Healthcare has conducted a number of clinical studies, including one that demonstrated that full-term delivery is healthier than early elective delivery of babies and another that identified a clinical protocol that can reduce bloodstream infections in ICU patients by 44%. HCA Healthcare is a learning health system that uses its approximately 44 million annual patient encounters to advance science, improve patient care and save lives.

The senator said removing financial conflicts of interest would build confidence in Oz's impartiality. His confirmation hearing is Friday.

Oz will appear before the Senate Finance Committee on Friday for his confirmation hearing.

“If confirmed, you will be expected to steward CMS's $1.5 trillion budget in the best interest of the over 140 million Americans on Medicare and Medicaid,” Warren wrote. “Entering this role with financial conflicts of interest would undermine your effectiveness and the effectiveness of the programs you are slated to administer.”

Oz works with or previously worked with numerous companies that the CMS could oversee, including Eko Health and SandboxAQ, which sell medical diagnostic technologies, and could require the CMS' approval for reimbursement requests.

The nominee also founded and still holds up to $5 million of stock in ShareCare, a digital health company that provides in-home supplement benefit programs used by approximately 1.5 million Medicare Advantage enrollees. 

“Your relationships with these and other entities will raise serious doubts about your impartiality if you participate in coverage decisions and other matters that impact them,” said Warren, urging the nominee to both divest his stake and recuse himself from matters concerning previous business interests.

The senator is also concerned about Oz's activity upon leaving Washington, if confirmed.

Warren said previous agency heads, including Biden appointees and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who was just confirmed to lead the HHS, had agreed to a “cooling-off period” for working in industry after leaving office. 

“By agreeing to a cooling off period, you can mitigate concerns about your potential conflicts of interest in this role,” Warren said.

Democratic strategist Kevin Walling discusses his party's attempt to rebrand and find new messaging on 'Fox & Friends.' 

Leading House Democrats, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and ""Squad"" member Rashida Tlaib, railed against the Department of Government Efficiency's ""cruel"" cuts at a healthcare rally outside the Capitol, demanding the Trump administration not make ""even a minor cut to Medicaid.""

For weeks now, Democrats have been pushing a narrative that the Trump administration is planning massive cuts to government health programs, including ObamaCare, Medicare and Medicaid.

Several hundred protesters joined the rally organized by left-leaning groups, including the Women's March, Planned Parenthood Federation of America and National Nurses United.

Speaking during the rally, Pelosi said: ""They said they were going to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In fact, that guy who's in the White House said, ‘ObamaCare sucks,' crude as he is. But nonetheless, we said it doesn't suck, it cures.""

""They say they want to cut waste, fraud and abuse. We've always done that. We have oversight. We know what we're doing,"" she said. ""Firing half the people at the Department of Education, that's not waste, fraud and abuse, that's brutal.""

She also slammed the continuing resolution budget bill passed by House Republicans this week.  

""What they did in that bill that passed the House last night was disgraceful, it was harmful, it was deadly for some people,"" she said.

Pelosi said Democratic leadership is planning a national messaging push to ""save our Medicaid.""

""Our leadership under Hakeem Jeffries and Catherine Clarke, our leadership next week we will be having a day all over the country, one word, ‘Medicaid,' ‘Save our Medicaid,"" she said.  

Tlaib, who represents Detroit, accused the Trump administration and Republicans of wanting to make cuts to healthcare to provide tax cuts to billionaires.

""Here they are choosing the billionaires and the corporations over the people they're supposed to represent,"" she said. ""Republicans want to ram through not millions but $4.5 trillion in tax cuts for billionaires and profit corporations. You know, corporate greed kills and it's a disease in our country.""

""You know I have colleagues who will go up and say, ‘This budget proposal doesn't have the word Medicaid in it.' Yeah, OK, we ain't stupid. We understand what nearly a trillion dollars out of energy and commerce committee really means. Stop lying to the American people,"" she shouted. ""It's obvious to me that they prefer to put profits before people and, in order to pay for these tax breaks, giving away our money, they want to rip healthcare away from millions of our families. It is shameful.""

Case study highlights 80% reduction in wait times for behavioral health services


OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--WellSky, a global health and community care technology and services company, and UF Health St. Johns Care Connect, a community outreach program of the UF Health network in Florida, today jointly released a case study detailing how Care Connect used the WellSky Community Services solution to significantly reduce wait times for students seeking behavioral health services. In the last five years, the average time required for a student to schedule a behavioral health appointment dropped from 90 days in 2018 to just 18 days in the 2023-24 school year.





“Through our partnership with WellSky, we created a data-driven approach that empowers us to prevent crises — whether related to homelessness, mental health, or medical emergencies — before they arise,” said Paige Stanton, executive director at UF Health St. Johns Care Connect. “This results in long-term positive outcomes for the communities we serve.”



Care Connect, launched in 2017, was designed to connect social care providers across St. Johns County, Florida, through a unified information system. The program coordinates social care for individuals discharged from the hospital and those experiencing homelessness who frequently sought non-emergent care in a hospital emergency department.



The Care Connect team quickly identified a critical need: the suicide rate in St. Johns County among 15- to 19-year-olds was 3.2 times higher than the national average. Compounding the issue, only 35% of referred students accessed behavioral health services due to limited local resources.



In response, Care Connect expanded its use of the WellSky Community Services platform to establish the BRAVE program (Be Resilient And Voice Emotions) — a statewide behavioral health referral network. This initiative played a key role in reducing the average wait time for behavioral health services, contributing to a 75% decrease in the teen suicide rate in St. Johns County. Since its launch in 2019, BRAVE has expanded to seven counties, serving more than 300,000 students.



“The transformative impact UF Health St. Johns Care Connect has achieved for students in Florida exemplifies why WellSky is dedicated to leading the movement for smarter, more connected care,” said Bill Miller, chairman and CEO of WellSky. “Breaking down silos and fostering collaboration among providers is critical to building healthier communities.”



Powered by WellSky technology, Care Connect is fostering seamless collaboration among providers and enabling Care Connect leadership to monitor and evaluate referral outcomes. To download the full case study, visit wellsky.com.

War-torn Sudan's healthcare system is approaching breaking point as three or four patients are sharing single beds, Islamic Relief revealed on Thursday. 

Overwhelmed healthcare workers in eastern Sudan described dire conditions, with patients either turned away or dying on the floor, the aid group said. 

The conflict-stricken country has seen countless displaced families seeking care, and the collapsing medical infrastructure has been unable to accommodate demand, with ongoing violence outstripping limited resources and two thirds of all main hospitals out of service. 

Dr Abdalbasit Alameen Mohamed Adallah, director of al-Gedaref Teaching Hospital, told Islamic Relief that the number of displaced people seeking treatment is increasingly at double or triple the rate that the hospital can find new beds.  

He said: “The health situation is very serious. The existing hospitals take all of the burden [from displacement as a result of the conflict]. 

“After recent displacements, the number of patients has increased many times,” he added. “Two or three patients can be treated in one bed, some treated on the couch, and some we just give them the treatment and let them go if they have a place to stay. People are begging for prescriptions.” 

Adallah went on to say there was a severe lack of medication available, including for vital emergency treatments such as infusions and laboratory testing. 

He continued: “There has been a systematic destruction of all health facilities across Sudan. Most of the medical staff have themselves been displaced and many hospitals destroyed completely, resulting in no medical services. 

“In Gedaref we took the biggest burden since the very start of the war from the displacement of Khartoum and Al Jazirah state, where half of the population was displaced to Gedaref including the elders, children, and people with chronic diseases. It's a huge number.”

Many doctors and medical staff have fled the country, after facing violence, attacks, decimated infrastructure and corruption, Islamic Relief said.

Since the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began fighting, there have been 542 attacks on healthcare facilities between April 2023 and December 2024, according to a report by Insecurity Insight. 

During these attacks, 122 health workers have been killed and 90 arrested, with medical facilities including clinics and hospitals damaged 136 times, and taken over 51 occasions for non-medical purposes, the report said.

Insecurity Insight has attributed almost two thirds of these attacks to the RSF. 

Since April 2023, Sudan has been embroiled in a brutal civil war between the SAF and the RSF militia.

The country has fallen into a humanitarian crisis, with 12.5 million Sudanese displaced from their homes, according to UNHCR.

Miles between laboratories and testing sites, a shortage of medical professionals and deteriorating infrastructure is underscoring the health care problems that plague some rural counties as a measles outbreak spreads from the West Texas counties where it began.

The most recent count as of last week shows that 223 cases have been reported nationwide, with the bulk of them in Texas. 

So far, 198 people in West Texas counties and 30 in neighboring Lea County, N.M. have become infected with measles since late January. Of those, 23 children have been hospitalized in Texas; one 6-year-old died there, and one adult died in New Mexico.

Measles showed up the first week of February in Andrews County, Texas. 

“We had our first exposure when a person showed up in the ER with measles,” said Andrews County Health Director Gordon Mattimoe. 

“We had 50-plus exposures we had to follow up on. That was typical of the next couple of weeks.”

State records in Texas show that Gaines County, where the outbreak began, and where there were 138 measle cases so far, has a high rate (18%) of those who are unvaccinated. 

“We are seeing folks from Gaines County, they're coming here for care, to our local hospital or clinic, so we get exposures from that,” Mattimoe said. 

Andrews County has been using the old City Hall building as a testing site to keep others from being exposed.

The county is getting the word out about getting vaccinated on social media, local newspapers and lots of correspondence with schools and daycare centers, “trying to get those children with exemptions vaccinated,” Mattimoe said. In Texas, children can refuse vaccinations for religious or conscientious grounds.

His advice to other counties out there: “If you're seeing vaccination rates drop below 94 percent, you're going to see cases, you've got to keep working on keeping those immunization rates up,” Mattimoe said. (State health departments typically record vaccination rates per county.) 

Anyone who has been exposed can benefit by getting vaccinated within 72 hours of an exposure, he noted.

In Ector County, Texas, after two cases popped up there, the county took action, said county health Director Brandy Garcia, who suspects even more people actually have measles there.

“Based off my experience, it's always more than what you find,” she said. 

“People get sick and don't think about what it could be. If you have a mild reaction, some go undetected.”

Located smack-dab in the Texas oil patch, Ector County is sending any measles test samples to a lab in Travis County and usually sees results within 48 hours. 

But without any drivers to take samples on weekends, the County Board recently voted to purchase a specialized freezer to store samples locally when needed.

With spring and summer travel season approaching, the CDC emphasizes the important role that clinicians and public health officials play in preventing the spread of measles. 

“Spring break is happening for a lot of these school districts,” Mattimoe said. “We'll have to see how things are going when they come back after spring break.”

Public health officials should be vigilant for cases of febrile rash illness that meet the measles case definition and share effective prevention strategies, including vaccination guidance. 

“We're scared of things we don't know,” Garcia said. 

“The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is very effective, and it's been around for a long, long time,” she said.

“Measles is something we don't normally see. Education is key.”

New program from National Association of Counties (NACo) and Public Promise Insurance (PPI) will reduce prescription coverage expenditures by 28 percent in 2025.

Medicaid is a joint federal, state and local program that provides health coverage to low-income individuals, including children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities. The program accounts for over half of all federal funding to states and is the largest source of federal funding in state budgets.

Roughly 40% of home care workers live in low-income households and the majority rely on some form of public assistance, with about one-third relying on Medicaid.

NIU's pre-health professions program is making a significant impact on students pursuing careers in healthcare. The program ensures students are well-prepared for their future in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and other health professions by providing comprehensive support through academic guidance, professional development and application assistance.

“Over the past 18 months, NIU's pre-health professions program has been instrumental in preparing students for the challenges of applying to professional schools,” Tracy Ash, pre-health professions director said. “By integrating academic preparation, hands-on experiences and structured application support, the program empowers students to achieve their career aspirations in healthcare.”

Starting in fall 2025, NIU will introduce the pre-health professions transcript notation, a formal recognition of students' dedication to professional school preparation, highlighting a commitment to fostering a well-rounded education. To earn this, students must complete eight required courses, participate in 10 NIU engagement activities across campus, complete 25 hours of healthcare simulation or shadowing, participate in one research or leadership experience, and attend a professional development training academy.

Julia Bogunia

“The transcript notation motivates me and enhances my application as it reflects a commitment I made during my journey at NIU. It allows me to have formal recognition of my ability to complete relevant coursework and excel academically,” Julia Bogunia, a senior biology major who is applying to medical school said.

A new, centralized letter packet service being piloted this semester streamlines the process of gathering faculty and professional recommendation letters for students applying to medical, dental and other healthcare professional schools. This service removes barriers and ensures that students present strong application materials, by providing a structured and efficient approach and will be fully available in spring 2026.

“The letter packet service has been incredibly helpful in my medical school application process. Instead of managing multiple letter submissions myself, NIU's pre-health advising office compiles all my recommendation letters into a single, organized packet and submits them directly to the application services,” Aleena Kallan, a senior biology major said. “This saves me time, allows me to focus on other important aspects of my application and ensures my letters are submitted professionally and efficiently.”

Aleena Kallan

To provide students with easy access to crucial resources, the pre-health professions program has developed a dedicated Blackboard Community. This space includes career exploration tools, application guidance, experiential learning opportunities and advising updates to help students navigate their pre-health journey. Also, a newly revised pre-health professions website is in development to provide comprehensive guidance on course prerequisites, application timelines and career pathways while serving as a go-to information hub for pre-health students.

In addition to academic and application support, pre-health students have access to tailored graduate school preparation advising services, personal statement workshops, interview preparation sessions and assistance in securing meaningful clinical, research and volunteer experiences. This helps ensure students meet admission requirements, while developing the skills and experiences necessary to stand out in the competitive healthcare field.

“I have received valuable guidance on course selection, application timelines and extracurricular involvement ensuring I stay on track for medical school. Professional development opportunities such as workshops, mentorship programs and networking events have helped me build essential skills beyond academics,” Kallan said. “These experiences have not only strengthened my application but have also reinforced my passion for medicine by exposing me to different aspects of healthcare.”

Alpha Epsilon Delta

NIU's vibrant pre-health community is strengthened by three active student organizations that provide networking, mentorship and peer support. These organizations play a critical role in fostering collaboration and professional growth among students:

“Being president of two student organizations has allowed me to gain a sense of community and understand the importance of collaboration, while allowing me to enhance my communication with varying professionals to bring diverse events to life,” Bogunia said. “This has empowered me to build upon my personal characteristics such as adaptability, time management and teamwork which are all crucial traits for future healthcare professionals.”

Attorney Lexie Rigden joins ‘Fox News Live' to give her take on the Menendez brothers and Luigi Mangione criminal cases.

Luigi Mangione's defense attorney in Pennsylvania continues to argue that Altoona police unlawfully detained the murder suspect and searched his belongings when they identified him at a McDonald's following a tip.

Mangione, 26, is charged with first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, stalking and a slew of other state and federal charges in both New York and Pennsylvania, for allegedly gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a married father of two, on a sidewalk in Manhattan in December 2024.

Now his attorney says authorities' use of the word ""manifesto"" to describe Mangione's writings allegedly found in his backpack during his arrest on Dec. 9 is ""incorrect.""

""The use of this characterization of the defendant's alleged personal experiences and writings is incorrect, improper and without justification and has no probative value,"" Altoona-based defense attorney Thomas Dickey said in a Tuesday court filing. ""Defendant believes that this characterization was done so solely for the purpose to prejudice the defendant and put him in a negative light before the public, all in an effort to prejudice any potential jury pool.""

LUIGI MANGIONE SUPPORTERS WHINE ABOUT SUSPECTED CEO ASSASSIN'S PORTRAYAL IN ‘CORPORATE BACKED NARRATIVE'

Mangione allegedly shot Thompson outside the Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare's annual shareholder conference was being held, in an act prosecutors believe was meant to send a message to the healthcare insurance industry based on a manifesto found on the suspect when he was arrested days after Thompson's murder.

In his writings, Mangione apparently expressed his grievances with the healthcare industry — specifically naming UnitedHealthcare and the shareholder conference where Thompson was headed in New York at the time of the assassination.

Dickey is asking the court not to describe Mangione's alleged writings as a ""manifesto."" He is also asking the court to suppress various other evidence, including what Dickey describes as a warrantless search of the suspect's backpack, statements made to police during his arrest and DNA evidence.

Mangione's attorney argued that Mangione had been improperly detained and arrested at the McDonald's, so certain evidence collected during that arrest should not be submitted as evidence against his client.

The 26-year-old suspect has a degree from the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania and attended an elite private high school in Baltimore.

Despite some supporters' characterization of him as an anti-capitalist crusader, he allegedly stopped at a New York City Starbucks for coffee minutes before the murder and was ultimately arrested while eating hashbrowns at McDonald's.

Mangione is accused of ""meticulously"" planning the murder with the motive of igniting a ""public discussion about the healthcare industry,"" according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

New York prosecutors said Mangione plotted to travel to New York; find Thompson, a Minnesota resident in town for UnitedHealthcare's annual shareholder conference; and kill him. Mangione allegedly shot Thompson from behind with a 3D-printed ghost gun and suppressor.

The NYPD released a still image from surveillance video, showing him pulling his face mask down and smiling while flirting with a clerk at the check-in of the Manhattan hostel where police say he stayed for the murder. It went viral and immediately attracted a wave of support online for the accused killer.

Mangione is originally from Maryland and recently lived in California and Hawaii. He graduated as valedictorian from the Gilman School, a private, all-boys high school in Baltimore, in 2016.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (TNND)  — California is in need of a $3.44 billion loan to cover a shortfall in ""Medi-Cal,"" which is the state's Medicaid program, according to reports. 



POLITICO said Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration informed lawmakers about the shortfall in a letter sent on Wednesday.

Citing Department of Finance Spokesman H.D. Palmer, the media outlet said the money is the maximum amount the state is allowed to borrow, adding that it ""will only be enough to cover bills for Medi-Cal"" through the end of March.

Paul Winfree, who is the president and CEO of the Economic Policy Innovation Center, or EPIC, told Fox News Digital the state is ""exploiting an existing loophole"" in an existing law.  

The news comes a year after the state expanded Medi-Cal to offer free healthcare to residents in need -- as well as undocumented migrants. 

The state previously described the initiative as a public health insurance program that provides ""needed health care services for low-income individuals including families with children, seniors, persons with disabilities, foster care, pregnant women, and low income people with specific diseases such as tuberculosis, breast cancer, or HIV/AIDS.  Medi-Cal is financed equally by the state and federal government,"" according to a statement Newsom's team shared online.","{'href': 'https://kmph.com', 'title': 'KMPH Fox 26'}"

Eric Palmer, the CEO of Evernorth, appears to be a victim of Cigna's latest restructuring as the massive healthcare company consolidates oversight of its insurance and health services divisions.

Cigna is in a period of transition after underperforming on Wall Street expectations in the fourth quarter. The company, which operates one of the largest insurance businesses in the country, was struck by unexpected cost growth in plans that protect self-funded employers from disastrously high medical spending.

Despite growth in Evernorth, higher medical costs drove Cigna's income down in 2024. Overall, Cigna reported $247.1 billion in revenue last year, up 27% year over year — but $3.4 billion in net income, down 34% year over year.

To recover margins, the insurer is growing its lucrative specialty pharmacy business, shrinking its Affordable Care Act plans and selling its Medicare business entirely, exiting a program that's been wracked by higher than expected costs for seniors. The $3.7 billion sale is expected to close in the first quarter.

“With the divestiture of the Medicare business it makes sense to have a single leader overseeing both sides of the business,” JP Morgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a Thursday note on Cigna's executive transition.

Evanko was “essentially wearing two hats” as Cigna's CFO and CEO of Cigna Healthcare, Gill said. “With Evanko now sitting atop the leadership structure with broad oversight as COO, we think he will have greater latitude to drive efficient operations across the company moving forward.”

The executive changes, which simplify Cigna's reporting structure, will help the Connecticut-based company grow and focus on its customers, CEO David Cordani said in a statement.

Evanko, who originally joined Cigna in 1998, has served as the company's CFO since 2021 and has run Cigna Healthcare since January 2024.

In his new role as COO, Evanko will report to Cordani — as will Dennison, who's taking the reins as Cigna's CFO.

Dennison joined Cigna early last year as deputy CFO, prior to which she was CFO of Nasdaq.

Meanwhile, departing executive Eric Palmer worked for Cigna for more than 25 years across a variety of finance and strategy roles before being appointed to the head of Evernorth in 2022. Last year, Cigna expanded his role to include oversight of the company's enterprise strategy and corporate development.

Palmer was Cigna's highest-paid executive after Cordani, according to the company's most recent proxy filing, making more than $8.9 million in 2023.

Also on Thursday, Cigna reaffirmed its outlook for 2025. The company expects to bring in adjusted income from operations of at least $29.50 per share.

And though it's early days, the year so far is tracking to Cigna's expectations, Evanko told investors Wednesday during a healthcare conference managed by Barclay's.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — One of the first and longest lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic was felt within our medical systems. 

Five years later, healthcare is still dealing with the effects of the uncertainty and change of 2020. 

In the beginning of the pandemic, the one constant was change. 

""Something changed every day,"" said Charles Gibson,  interim chief medical officer and senior vice president for hospital care for Corewell Health in West Michigan.

At first, little was known about the impact of the coronavirus strain. 

""We didn't have testing. We couldn't tell people what they had,"" said Dr. Andrew Jameson, section chief of infectious disease at Trinity Health Grand Rapids. ""We couldn't get people the help they needed. Doctors' offices are closing, and patients had nowhere to turn. So, that was the first thing that hit.""

Supplies of personal protection equipment (PPE) were low. N95 masks, not used for most everyday operations, became high in demand. 

""There was a lot of fear in us coming to work,"" said Gibson. ""How are we going to take care of ourselves? Am I going to bring something home to my family?""

Once testing became available, there wasn't enough supply at times. Jameson remembered testing 3D printed test swabs on himself, because he said they couldn't find enough to purchase. 

""We turned an entire hospital building into a negative pressure building, where every single room in that building vented outside,"" said Jameson. ""It probably saved countless numbers of our employees from getting sick.""

Healthcare providers began opening drive-through testing centers. Staff cross-trained in new jobs to combat an influx of patients. 

""A lot of our nurses and our respiratory therapists, in particular, did a Herculean job of trying to learn on the fly new workflows,"" said Gibson. 

Hospitals reached and exceeded capacity levels again and again. Many nonemergency surgeries and procedures were paused. 

""It really hit our frontline workers hard,"" said Gibson.

Five years later, healthcare has learned lessons from the pandemic and changed. Health systems learned about stressing emergency preparedness, communication and adaptability. 

""I think being nimble, that's probably the best thing that we've learned,"" said Gibson. ""Healthcare is very much like a gigantic cruise ship. It takes a long time to turn and reposition. We are not as nimble as we need to be. We need to be more like a speedboat.""

Hospital systems, public health and more worked together. This was seen, for example, in the large vaccine clinic at DeVos Place.

Another big change in healthcare in the past five years has been in the workforce. There was severe burnout and staff turnover at hospitals across the country. 

""Some of the more experienced nurses, it burned them out. It was hard,"" said Jameson.

He explained the nursing staff tends to be younger now. 

An emphasis on employee mental health awareness was also prioritized. 

""A lot of the efforts that we focus on now are, 'What are we doing for wellbeing? What are we doing for burnout?'"" said Gibson. 

Virtual care options for patients grew. 

""One of the things that we found is that meeting patients where they are sometimes doesn't mean sitting in the same room with them,"" said Gibson. ""One of the most efficient ways to get to somebody is have them log into their phone.""

Trinity Health Muskegon also implemented virtual nurses in the building to help with patient load and nurse workforce. 

Unfortunately, another major change in healthcare was the opinion of the public on the institution as a whole. 

""Public trust took a hit,"" said Gibson. ""There was a lot of uncertainty. I think people were not used to healthcare, not necessarily having the answer, and not having the most clear cut pathway.""

Another major change in healthcare in the last five years was with the change in attitude toward vaccines. 13 ON YOUR SIDE dives into that topic in this article. ","{'href': 'https://www.wzzm13.com', 'title': 'WZZM13.com'}"

ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer and Shionogi as shareholders, today announced positive findings from the company's EMBRACE phase IIb study. The study found that N6LS (VH3810109 or VH109), given every four months in combination with monthly cabotegravir long-acting (CAB LA), successfully kept viral levels suppressed in adults living with HIV who were already stable on treatment. It was also well tolerated by participants.

These results were presented today at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2025) in San Francisco, U.S.

As leaders in long-acting injectable innovation, we are building on the positive patient and physician experience we have with Cabenuva and pioneering the next generation of long-acting treatment options. The EMBRACE study demonstrated that VH109, a CD4-binding broadly neutralizing antibody, administered every four months with cabotegravir, achieved high efficacy and was well tolerated through six months. We're looking forward to continuing the development of VH109 as a component of our future ultra long-acting regimens.”

Results from the EMBRACE study at the six-month primary endpoint showed that 96% of participants receiving VH109 60 mg/kg intravenously (IV) and 88% receiving VH109 3000 mg subcutaneously (SC) with rHuPH20 maintained HIV-1 RNA levels below 50 copies/mL, compared to 96% in the standard-of-care group. VH109 was administered in both arms every four months, combined with monthly CAB LA. Confirmed virologic failure was observed in two participants from each VH109 group.

Overall, 4% of the IV group and 6% of the SC group had HIV-1 RNA levels of 50 copies/mL or higher, compared to none in the standard-of-care group when measured at month six.

VH109 was generally well tolerated, though infusion site reactions were more frequent with SC administration, occurring in 14% compared to none with IV administration. Adverse events specific to the use of study medication were reported in 64% of the IV group and 65% of the SC group, with 16% of participants in the SC group experiencing grade 3-4 adverse events (erythema). No participants in the IV group experienced a grade 3-4 adverse event.

Based on the favourable results seen in the trial, ViiV Healthcare will be progressing a six-month IV formulation of VH109 in combination with CAB LA for further evaluation in an EMBRACE part two trial.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April Health, a leader in integrating behavioral health into primary care, today announces a transformative merger with Wysa, the global leader in AI for mental health. Together, they address one of the most pressing issues in healthcare, ensuring patients receive timely, effective mental health support, by combining human-led care with Wysa's clinically proven therapeutic AI.





The collaboration will provide patients with continuous, personalized care, through a combination of behavioral health specialists, psychiatrists, and Wysa's AI-driven guidance, ensuring that no referral goes unanswered. This groundbreaking combination of AI and human resources in one model of care guarantees that patients receive support between clinician visits and eliminates the wait times that often plague mental health care.



Redefining Behavioral Health in Primary Care



Behavioral health care is often difficult to access, particularly in rural and underserved areas where mental health providers are scarce. Half of the US population lives in a mental health desert, leading to an average wait time of 3-4 months for psychiatric support. 80% of patients turn to their primary care providers (PCPs) for help, but without dedicated behavioral health support, providers face limited options for effective treatment.



Founded to change this reality, April Health embeds virtual behavioral health services into primary care practices to ensure patients receive the care they need. Now, with Wysa's Therapeutic AI Coach integrated into its model, April Health patients can access a hybrid of human and AI-guided care—expanding access without increasing the burden on providers and overcoming insurance barriers.



“Mental healthcare doesn't fit neatly into appointment slots. Patients need support between visits, and providers need solutions that don't add to their workload,” said Jesse Weinberg, CEO at April Health. “By integrating Wysa's AI, every patient referred to us receives ongoing care—whether through a behavioral health specialist, a psychiatrist, or AI-powered guidance tailored to their needs. This combined approach drives better outcomes in less time, helping to bridge America's mental health gap.”



No Referral Unfulfilled



More than 50% of behavioral health referrals in primary care settings are unsuccessful, leaving patients without critical support. April Health is addressing this by taking full responsibility for patient follow-through. Once a provider refers a patient, April Health ensures they receive the right level of care—whether that means direct engagement with a behavioral health care manager, psychiatric medication recommendations, or digital support from Wysa's Therapeutic AI Coach. Every patient, regardless of insurance coverage, will have access to Wysa's AI-powered support, making this a scalable solution for expanding mental health care without financial barriers.



“No one should have to wait for behavioral health care, yet the reality is most patients face long delays, assuming they ever get the support they need,” said Ramakant Vempati, Co-founder and President of Wysa. “By bringing Wysa's AI into April Health's care model, we're creating a seamless system where patients can engage with mental health support immediately, while still receiving expert-led care.”



A Model That Works for Patients and Providers



April Health's integration of AI reinforces Collaborative Care Management (CoCM), a proven model allowing primary care and specialty clinics to be reimbursed for behavioral health services. This approach not only improves patient outcomes but also makes behavioral health financially sustainable for healthcare practices.



By partnering with April Health, Primary care, pediatrics, women's health and more can now integrate behavioral health into their practice without hiring additional staff or disrupting existing workflows. Providers simply refer patients to an introductory call with April Health, where care managers assess needs and initiate a psychiatrist-led collaborative care plan. This ensures patients receive comprehensive behavioral health support within the time constraints of primary care.



The Future of Integrated Behavioral Health



With this integration, April Health and Wysa demonstrate that behavioral health care can be both accessible and scalable—offering human support where it's needed while ensuring every patient has continuous access to clinically validated mental health tools. The first providers to adopt this integrated model are April Health's existing primary care partners within LifePoint Healthcare and The Newton Clinic (affiliated with MercyOne).

– The investment will help Phoenix grow its team, drive brand awareness, and build infrastructure –


TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Phoenix, Canada's leading digital health clinic for men, today announced it has signed a CAD 50 million Series A financing round. The round is led by Valspring Capital, with renewed investment from Y Combinator, and support from CIBC Innovation Banking.





Over the last few years, Phoenix has become a dominant force in digital healthcare, addressing long-standing gaps in access to treatment. The $50 million investment comes at a critical time in Canada's healthcare system, with more than 6.5 million Canadians without a regular care provider. As a telehealth platform, Phoenix helps address this gap by connecting patients with healthcare practitioners for healthcare concerns that are often stigmatized: erectile dysfunction, weight loss, and hair loss. Through Phoenix, men can consult with a licensed physician, receive expert assessment, and, if prescribed, can have their medications discreetly delivered for free through their end-to-end fulfillment service.



“The digital health landscape in Canada has been underdeveloped despite our widely dispersed population that stands to greatly benefit from increased access to care. This investment into Phoenix will help us meet the rising demand for telehealth solutions and expand the resources available to patients,” says Kevin Bache, co-founder and co-CEO of Phoenix. “This funding round will not only fuel our growth, but also bring us closer to achieving our mission to help even more Canadians access treatment.”



Stigma around erectile dysfunction and men's hair and weight loss can discourage men from seeking care to address these issues. By lowering the barrier to access care for these conditions, Phoenix is helping men connect with a doctor, openly discuss their symptoms, and, in some cases, get early treatment for conditions that can lead to other healthcare concerns. Phoenix provides access to care for men of all ages and across both rural and urban Canada.



“Since day one, Phoenix has resonated with patients. Only a few hours after launching, we had our first patient and we've heard from our patients ever since, sharing how Phoenix has changed their lives,” says Gavin Thompson, co-founder and co-CEO of Phoenix. “Healthcare shouldn't feel impersonal—we built Phoenix to meet patients where they are. Our focus on specialized treatments has been critical to our growth, it's our differentiator. Given the state of healthcare in Canada, we know there are even more patients who would benefit from Phoenix.”



With this raise, Phoenix will expand its team, increase brand visibility and scale operations, ensuring that more Canadians can benefit from convenient and accessible care.



“Phoenix has built an accessible, patient-first telehealth platform that has empowered men across Canada to take charge of their health,” says Yumin Choi, Managing Partner, Valspring Capital. “Their commitment to high-quality treatment delivery—through seamless pharmacy fulfillment, regulatory adherence, and efficient doctor touchpoints—has fueled their impressive growth. We're proud to support Phoenix as they scale to meet the evolving healthcare needs of Canadians.”



Phoenix is currently available in Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, PEI, & Newfoundland. To learn more about Phoenix, visit https://www.phoenix.ca/.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A new report analyzing 180 healthcare email breaches from January 1, 2024, to January 31, 2025 reveals widespread cybersecurity issues and escalating regulatory penalties. Paubox's 2025 Healthcare Email Security Report highlights how email remains the leading attack vector, resulting in financial penalties, compromised patient data, and increased enforcement actions from regulators.





Key Findings:



Email security remains healthcare's biggest weakness



Despite a 50% increase in healthcare cybersecurity spending since 2018, many healthcare organizations still fail to implement fundamental email security protocols. The report found that 98.9% of breached organizations lacked MTA-STS protections, exposing email communications to interception. Additionally, 37.2% of Microsoft 365 users had DMARC in ‘monitor-only' mode, leaving phishing attempts undetected.



According to OCR Director Melanie Fontes Rainer, “HIPAA-regulated entities need to be proactive in ensuring their compliance with the HIPAA Rules, and not wait for OCR to reveal long-standing HIPAA deficiencies.” The prevalence of email-related breaches in 2024 underscores this warning, as many healthcare organizations only realize their security gaps after a serious incident occurs.



Regulators are increasing enforcement



The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has intensified HIPAA enforcement, issuing record fines for email security failures and insufficient risk assessments. Recent high-profile cases include:

Oops, something went wrong

This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Healthcare Dive newsletter. 

Tech companies are trying to get healthcare companies to adopt artificial intelligence tools, hoping they can pull in revenue by appealing to the industry's need to reduce costs and tackle clinician burden.

Google is one such company. The search and cloud computing giant has unveiled a number of health AI products in the past few years, including a large language model called Med-PaLM trained specifically on medical data, generative AI products for healthcare organizations and a platform to help companies create their own AI agents.

Google also offers a tool that allows clinicians to search for and answer questions about information in patient notes and other medical documentation. That product, called Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, has quickly ramped up after launching last March. Google announced that Vertex AI Search was multimodal earlier this month, meaning it can now understand images as well as text, allowing the tool to scrub charts and scans for relevant information.

Google has inked deals with major EHR vendors and leading health systems to integrate its AI into their workflows. But not everyone is gung ho about AI, especially as the models become more evolved and the potential for mistakes grows.

Concerns include hallucinations, when AI makes up a response; omissions, when AI leaves important information out; and model drift, when AI becomes less reliable over time. Meanwhile, fledgling oversight and a lack of regulation are also hampering adoption as the industry confronts weighty questions of accuracy, privacy and bias.

Healthcare Dive sat down with Aashima Gupta, the head of healthcare for Google Cloud, to chat about Google's work in health AI and the future of the technology — including how AI is evolving from a task-based helper to a collaborator for clinicians, uncertainty from the Trump administration and why she's excited about agentic AI.

Editor's Note: This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

AASHIMA GUPTA: Healthcare information is scattered in different forms and types. During an annual diabetes foot exam, for example, when a physician is looking for ulcers, they mark on a diagram of a foot where it's callous, pre-ulcer and ulcer, using different symbols. Healthcare is full of examinations like this. Now, with multimodal, you're able to see and contextualize that diagram of a foot and extract that information, including any potential ulcers, and put it into the medical record automatically. That saves clinicians time, because they don't need to interpret this themselves.

Healthcare, as an industry, has a lot of paperwork. We talk about burnout. These are the type of innovations we want to add to Search to reduce it. Last year, we said Search was ‘semantic', meaning it knows what people mean when they say ‘diabetes' or ‘A1C' — it knows clinical concepts and how they're related. Now we're taking that and applying that to forms in an exam room that have different pictures. So our results are much more accurate and helpful.

You're right. We will continue to add different modalities here. Sound and videos, as an example.

We are very excited about agentic AI. The last few years have been a lot about generative AI, which is task-based — ‘Give me a discharge summary. Give me a nurse handoff. Write me a referral.'

AI agents are a leap forward, because they can think multiple steps ahead. They can plan unique steps for the goal in mind.

Imagine this in healthcare workflows. Let's say I want to figure out, in my revenue cycle, where there's variability by payer type, market, for a certain CPT code — that's a multistep process. And that's what agentic AI offers. Imagine hundreds of agents helping nurses and physicians do their jobs.

We believe there's a need for centralized coordination and management, and that's the platform we provide, and we will give agents the tools.

So if a company is building their first-party agent, they have three things: An ability to use [Google's family of large language models] Gemini, our search functionality based on clinical knowledge and an orchestration layer.

We believe that people have choice. Some people they really want to build themselves. Some want a partner. How do you organize all of that? That's where we want to be.

We have relationships with Basset Health, Highmark Health, Mayo Clinic, HCA — customers using generative AI to streamline prior authorization submissions, close screening gaps, enhance radiology workflows and more.

Healthcare used to be a laggard in technology adoption. But this AI is different — this is actually going into the back office, the revenue cycle, claims, to tackle burnout. You are seeing this move much, much faster. You are seeing generative AI pilots move from experimentation to scaling.

As for agentic AI, I'd say healthcare companies are definitely adapting to it. But it's a newer space.

Not only us — customers are building guardrails. At HCA, for example, we worked with them on a very robust evaluation framework, not just to catch errors but also — Is this model reliable? Is it hallucinating? Did it omit something? So we provide those tools for an evaluation framework, and for all of this there's a human in the loop capturing the feedback, and that feedback loop then makes the model more effective. That's what gives me comfort. That's best practices being deployed.

Our health systems have put humans in the loop, and there's change management around that. Technology by itself is not enough. You need robust change management, and to have a human in the loop and make sure they're evaluating this. These processes are in place before the AI is brought in.

There are checks like grounding, or citing where the AI pulled information from. That helps combat hallucination. For omission, when the AI leaves something out, this is where we're seeing evaluation frameworks. We'll say, ‘Okay, did this result omit something pertinent?' And eventually, after that feedback loop goes a few times with human oversight and the model learns, the next situation is better.

Also, use cases matter. This is why AI is being used more in administrative tasks.

At Google, we have our own AI principles and processes. But while self-regulation is good, we don't believe that it's sufficient. We believe AI is too important to not be regulated. And I will stop at that.

It's hard to say at this point. I think we are trying to figure out how we best work with them, share our best practices with them. Too early to say. I think the entire healthcare community is waiting for that.

House Republicans proposed Medicaid cuts last month that would have disastrous financial consequences for hospitals, especially for those in rural areas. While the plan aims to reduce government spending, healthcare executives are pointing out that these cuts would actually exacerbate the financial instability of the overall U.S. healthcare system — as well worsen health outcomes for millions of people, many of whom are children.

As Congress deliberates what the future of Medicaid funding will look like, healthcare executives are worried.

House Republicans proposed Medicaid cuts last month that would have sweeping and disproportionate consequences — particularly for rural hospitals and underserved populations. The plan, which seeks to reduce Medicaid spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, lacks specifics but could be implemented through reduced federal funding, block grants or stricter eligibility requirements. Healthcare leaders warn that these cuts would cause uncompensated care costs to balloon, leading to hospital closures and diminished care access.

The experts interviewed for this article agreed that while the proposed Medicaid cuts aim to reduce government spending, the plan will actually end up exacerbating the financial instability of the overall U.S. healthcare system — as well worsen health outcomes for millions of Americans.


					Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.				

House Republicans introduced a budget plan last month ordering various congressional committees to find at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years. It directs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, to reduce its spending by $880 billion over that time period.

The GOP's budget blueprint doesn't outline how the committee would achieve this target, but it's clear that doing so would involve significant cuts to Medicaid. The nation's Medicaid program, which provides health coverage for about 72 million Americans, accounts for one-sixth of all healthcare expenditures and is one of the largest programs under the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction.

The day the plan was released, one federal budget expert — Bobby Kogan, senior director of Federal Budget Policy at Center for American Progress and former adviser to the director of the Office of Management and Budget under the previous presidential administration — wrote on X that this plan would undoubtedly require major cuts to Medicaid.


					Transitioning to PDPM models significantly shifted the healthcare industry. By replacing the RUG system, healthcare providers cut waste and more accurately reflect the care each patient received.				

“For Energy and Commerce, it's mathematically impossible to achieve $880 billion in savings if you don't cut Medicaid or Medicare. There's not enough money they have jurisdiction over. Republicans say they're not cutting Medicare, so that means they're cutting Medicaid,” he wrote.

A March 5 report from the Congressional Budget Office also found it is impossible to achieve $880 billion in savings without broad cuts to Medicaid.

The House passed the budget resolution on February 25, and the Senate is expected to vote on the plan this month. 

Healthcare leaders certainly don't have a sunny outlook about the budget resolution making its way through Congress, but it's presently difficult to quantify exactly how disastrous its effects would be because the plan lacks specifics, said Harold Miller, CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.

There are several ways Congress might go about reducing Medicaid funding, he noted. 

For example, lawmakers could lower the federal government's share of Medicaid funding, which would force states to either cover the difference or slash services. Alternatively, Congress could withdraw federal support for specific services, such as expensive GLP-1 drugs, which would shift financial responsibility to state governments, Miller explained.

Another tactic Congress may choose is cutting eligibility. With Medicaid eligibility reduced, fewer Americans would be insured, which would cause a surge in hospitals' uncompensated care, Miller remarked.

He also mentioned block grants as a possibility. Instead of covering a percentage of costs, the federal government could provide states with a fixed sum for Medicaid — which would limit funding growth and force states to make tough decisions about whether or not to make their own cuts.

“Many people have argued that [block grants] could give the state greater flexibility in terms of exactly what it covers and how it structures the program. The concern is, if Congress decides it's going to cut the overall amount, then the state might not have enough money to be able to provide the same level of benefits,” Miller remarked.

He pointed out that Medicaid cuts would likely lead to many difficult decisions for state-level leaders. Since Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, states would have to figure out how to respond to federal cuts — whether to reduce provider payments, get rid of services or maintain coverage by increasing state spending.

Medicaid cuts would affect many more Americans than just those covered by Medicaid, noted Megan Cundari, senior director of federal relations at American Hospital Association. This is because the financial ramifications would force hospitals to make cost-cutting adjustments like eliminating departments or laying off staff members — thereby affecting all patients.

Slashing Medicaid funding means hospitals would deliver more uncompensated care. Fewer people would have Medicaid coverage, leading to more uninsured patients unable to pay for their services. A report released this week predicted that Medicaid cuts would result in an $80 billion revenue loss for providers next year, due in large part to a spike in uncompensated care costs.

This would strain providers' finances, and many hospitals would be forced to eliminate certain service lines or reduce their staffing levels, Cundari pointed out.

“There may be, for example, longer wait times at the emergency department because there's just not as many staff to help serve all the people that need to be served in the community. I think it's important to understand that the Medicaid cuts are not just Medicaid cuts — and they will not just impact the people who are involved in the program. They're also going to impact entire communities,” she declared.

There are hundreds of rural and safety-net facilities across the nation that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursements to cover the cost of care — and for some of these organizations, a significant decline in Medicaid payments will be the straw that breaks the camel's back, forcing them to close their doors, added Ben Finder, the AHA's vice president of policy, research, analytics and strategy.

When a rural or safety-net hospital closes, its patients don't just disappear, he noted. These patients must seek care at the next nearest facility, which is often a regional hospital that is already operating at capacity. 

This surge in patient volume can overwhelm staff and decrease provider availability, further diminishing care quality and access for all patients in the area, Finder explained.

Medicaid cuts would hit rural hospitals, those who can least afford it, the hardest. For one, most of these hospitals operate on razor-thin margins — research from last month shows nearly half of the country's rural hospitals are operating at a loss.

Secondly, many rural Americans receive coverage through the Medicaid program. In rural communities, 18% of adults are covered by Medicaid. 

In six states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico and South Carolina — more than half of children in rural areas are covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP provides low-cost health coverage to children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance. While CHIP is technically a separate program from Medicaid, CHIP is typically managed and administered in conjunction with it.

Nick Olson, CFO of Sanford Health, called Medicaid “the bedrock” of rural healthcare. Sanford is a South Dakota-based system operating 56 hospitals and more than 270 clinics across several states. 

Most of the health system's patients live in rural communities, Olson said. He also pointed out that more than half of Sanford's skilled nursing facility residents are covered by Medicaid.

“Hospitals across the country are already struggling to break even, and this really puts pressure on their ability to reinvest back into the communities that they're serving — to reinvest back into increasing and expanding access,” Olson declared. “For us, in 2022 alone, and I believe more recent years are similar, we provided over $159 million in uncompensated care.”

Reducing Medicaid funding would cause that figure to rise to an even more unsustainable level, Olson said.

Another healthcare executive — Alan Morgan, CEO of National Rural Health Association — said there is no question that rural hospitals would close should the government cut Medicaid spending.

“Somewhere between 400 to 700 rural hospitals are at financial risk for closure right now, so any type of reduction in revenue is going to have a dramatic impact on these facilities,” he remarked.

Rural hospital closures would force many Americans to travel long distances for even basic treatments and emergency care. This would cause many rural residents to forgo routine care, leading to greater utilization of emergency departments — the most expensive place to get care — Morgan explained.

This problem would destroy the purported intent of the budget resolution, which is to save money, argued Effie Carlson, CEO of care coordination company Watershed Health.

In other words, the House Republicans' plan to cut Medicaid funding aims to save money, but it will likely increase overall healthcare spending. Higher utilization rates in expensive settings like ERs and long-term care facilities will lead to higher costs for taxpayers, Carlson said.

“In healthcare, you don't avoid paying for things — it just gets paid for somewhere else in a less controllable way,” she declared.

To paint an even bleaker economic picture, rural hospitals are often the largest employers in their area, which means that if they reduced staffing or closed, unemployment in those regions would increase, Carlson added.

This would also lead to greater unemployment and reduced tax revenue, thereby pushing rural communities deeper into economic distress, she remarked.

At first, slashing Medicaid funding may appear to save dollars on paper, but experts agree that the real costs are hidden beneath the surface. When hospitals close and care disappears, expenses don't just go away — they get passed to struggling communities and overwhelmed providers.

Drug-resistant infections are linked to over a million deaths a year in India. A health crisis compounded by the country's healthcare inequalities. Dr Gautham and her team are working with rural healthcare providers to better understand the challenges of tackling AMR in these settings – and co-develop innovative solutions.

India is home to the world's largest rural population — an estimated 900 million people.

Across this patchwork of towns, villages and farmlands, access to formal healthcare is extremely limited. Despite the country's extensive private medical system, most doctors and hospitals are found in cities.

“The moment you leave cities behind, there are no qualified doctors around. People have to travel to the nearest urban centre or government health centre if they want to access a qualified doctor,"" says Dr Meenakshi Gautham, Assistant Professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Project Leader of One Health Antimicrobial Stewardship for Informal Health Systems (OASIS).

In India, Gautham grew up away from rural life, in the capital city of New Delhi. She trained as a social scientist and then pursued a career in public health. As she began working more closely with rural communities, she was struck by the exceptional contrast in healthcare availability.

“In cities, within a radius of five kilometres, you can find about 50 different private doctors. You have so many options. But the private formal sector is unaffordable [and inaccessible] for the people who live in villages.”

This inequality can have significant impacts on the health of rural populations. For example, infant mortality rate is 46 per thousand live births for rural areas compared to 32 per thousand live births for urban areas.

With limited formal healthcare services, a vast and resourceful network of informal, rural healthcare providers exists to fill the gap.

“When you go into rural India, there are a lot of village doctors,” explains Gautham. “These are health care providers who have not received formal training in health, but they have been trained by doctors as their assistants or technicians.” After a few years working in the city, informally trained healthcare workers often return home to set up clinics in their villages. Once established, an intricate ecosystem of professional networks, teleconsultation services and training conferences exist to support the informal practices.

“The informal provider is just as trusted and knows just about enough to manage your problem,” says Gautham. “If they have a doubt, they will consult doctors they are connected to. They learn about new drugs and new therapies through pharmaceutical representatives. This mosaic is an amazing entrepreneurial way of managing a lot of people's health needs. We can't shut them down because the health system will collapse otherwise.”

Rather than fight against this informal system, Gautham's research hopes to work with it to tackle one of India's greatest health threats: drug-resistant infections. 

Drug-resistant infections are linked to over a million deaths a year in India. A health crisis compounded by the country's healthcare inequalities.

Since 2016, Gautham and her team at the OASIS project have been working closely with rural communities to better understand the drivers of antibiotic use and the challenges of tackling AMR in rural settings.

Their findings paint a complex picture. Antimicrobial resistance is poorly understood, antibiotic use is difficult to control and disease surveillance data in community settings is almost non-existent.

“It's a result of the ecosystem in which [the rural healthcare providers] function,” explains Gautham.

Due to a lack of formal medical training, many rural healthcare providers see antibiotics as a cure-all drug. And this misconception extends to the communities they serve. As a result, antibiotics are often dispensed when they are not the appropriate treatment.

“These are communities who need to get better quickly because many of them are daily wage labourers. They cannot take more than a day off work. And they think that giving an antibiotic is the best way of curing a person quickly,” says Gautham.

Another important aspect of Gautham's research has been to investigate how rural communities and healthcare providers understand the concept of antimicrobial resistance.

“We find that knowledge of what causes [ill] health is very mixed – biomedical concepts blend with traditional medicine,” says Gautham. “And so, their understanding of AMR is limited to some medicines not working because you have taken too many of them.”

Without an understanding of the dangers of AMR, rural healthcare providers aren't motivated to collect data or monitor antibiotic use. And without the data, it's difficult to demonstrate the dangers of AMR.

But Gautham and her team have been investigating this for a long time. As well as identifying the problems, they've also been working with communities and other important stakeholders in this ecosystem to find solutions.

We're ensuring research considers the needs and priorities of the most affected communities, so evidence and interventions are acceptable, affordable and accessible in the locations they are most needed.

The OASIS project identified two priority issues to address: there were no suitable antibiotic guidelines for rural healthcare providers and no one was collecting any data.

Gautham and her team knew that the only way to create effective solutions was to co-develop them with people across the informal and formal healthcare ecosystems.

The OASIS team collected years of data from in-depth interviews, surveys and stakeholder consultation groups. They wanted to understand the most common symptoms clinics were facing, how patients were being diagnosed and managed, and which antibiotics were being dispensed and why.

Their findings revealed a clear path forward.

“The [rural healthcare providers] wanted more information about antibiotics, but they wanted it in a flexible format, not where they would have to travel and attend some training program, but something which they could easily manage, like on a mobile phone.”

With support from the Wellcome-funded Trinity Challenge on Antimicrobial Resistance, Gautham and her team are developing the Antibiotic Bandhu App – which means, ‘friend of antibiotics'. This easy-to-use tool will guide users from identifying symptoms to providing first level management for six of the most common illnesses clinics face. Most of which do not require any treatment with antibiotics.

As well as helping reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, the clinics can use the app to record data about which infections they're treating and whether or not they are dispensing antibiotics in a responsible way.

The OASIS team were winners of the Trinity Challenge on Antimicrobial Resistance. A second funding opportunity focussed on antimicrobial resistance has now launched, supported by Wellcome.

The new challenge is a call for low-cost technology and data-driven solutions to improve access to effective antibiotics in community settings in low- and middle-income countries. A prize fund of up to £1 million is available.

Early feasibility assessments of the guidelines show promising results. “It's like a doctor present near us,” noted one participant.

The OASIS team will be training more rural clinics to use the app and guidelines.

But for the guidelines to be successful, the whole community needs to be on board. Gautham is optimistic that rural healthcare providers are the key:

“A really strong enabling factor is that the future of the community and its health is very important to the rural healthcare providers. If they were to counsel patients to not misuse antibiotics, people would listen to them.”

The OASIS team will also be able to collect and analyse larger sets of data through the app. It will help to inform the practices of the rural providers, and Gautham is hopeful it will be invaluable for local, district and national policymakers too.

“I think it can transform healthcare, the healthcare system, healthcare practices – it can transform our understanding of AMR because there isn't any data coming from the community level. So whatever data we collect it's going to be really, really valuable.”

Assistant Professor, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine

Meenakshi Gautham leads the One Health Antibiotic Stewardship (OASIS) project. She is an interdisciplinary researcher interested in the dynamics of informal health systems, where both formal and informal health actors collaborate to shape healthcare practices. Focusing on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in community settings, her work uncovers the interactions within these systems, shedding light on health system and policy barriers that impact healthcare delivery and access in resource-constrained contexts.

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) is planning on ending four payment models by the end of the year in a bid to achieve a projected $750 million in savings, though the agency did not say where the savings would take place.

CMMI said it conducted a ""comprehensive and data-driven review"" based on the ""clear statutory mandate given to the Center by Congress."" Four models will end early, by Dec. 31, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services tasked with minimizing the disruption to patients in these models.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

The models slated for termination are Maryland Total Cost of Care, Primary Care First, ESRD Treatment Choices and Making Care Primary.

CMS is also considering options to reduce the size of the Integrated Care for Kids awards or make other changes to the model, the agency said.

Further, the CMS Innovation Center will no longer pursue two previously announced models, the Medicare $2 Drug List and Accelerating Clinical Evidence.

The CMS Innovation Center said it determined its other active models can meet the statutory mandate – either as-is or with future modification – and will continue.

CMMI said it planned to announce a new strategy centered around preventing disease through evidence-based practices, saying it wants to drive choice and competition by empowering people with information to ""make better choices.""

The goal is to streamline CMMI's models, the administration said.

THE LARGER TREND

The announcement from CMMI is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to find savings by slashing government funding and programs. 

House Republicans' previously proposed budget looked at $880 billion in spending cuts from programs overseen by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. If Republicans want to move forward with the cuts, it can't be done without slashing Medicaid, according to CBO projections.

The administration has also attempted to halt federal support for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, although a federal judge in Maryland temporarily barred the order, saying it likely violates the First Amendment.

At the same time, President Donald Trump has been calling for the termination of several government positions, including at least 5,200 probationary employees at the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Trump administration cut about 1,300 employees, or 10% of the workforce, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in February, according to NPR. As many as 1,500 employees at the National Institutes of Health were laid off.

Last month CMS announced that funds for the Affordable Care Act Navigator Program would be slashed from $98 million in 2024 to $10 million. This means that the pay for people performing the function of helping consumers choose an ACA plan is being cut, as is likely their navigator jobs. Funding for the navigator program was also slashed under the first Trump administration.

FALLS CHURCH, Va. (7News) — On a cold day, there's something so comforting about a large bowl of pho. But at Pho Golden Cow in Falls Church, that comfort is fleeting.

""Very sad. Very sad,"" described Tim Le, the owner.

He took over the business last year to fulfill a family friend's dying wish.

""He get sick and he ask me buy the place,"" remembered Le. ""I say I will. So you know, I'm here.""

Little did he know then, he wouldn't be here for long. Le said he had no idea VHC Health had bought the property.

Northern Virginia will soon be home to a new health care facility, but that move will also displace a group of small businesses that have called the Graham Center in Falls Church home for decades.



From a shoe repair store, dentist office, salon, to a handful of restaurants, all of these businesses are in the process of leaving this plaza along Route 50.

In mid August, Le, along with other tenants, received a letter from VHC Health letting them know their lease would be over by the end of March 2025, to allow for new construction for the new medical facility.

""It's very short notice,"" said Le.

Grass roots organization, A Viet Place Collective, has been helping them navigate the change.

""A lot of them don't understand that they're entitled to help,"" said Hoinam Nguyen.



He said these businesses, many minority owned, are being taken advantage of.

""During public board meetings for Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, they mentioned how this is a win win for everybody,"" said Nguyen. ""But I noticed they left out the small businesses. They left out the businesses that got displaced.

He's pushing for a lease extension, rent relief, something to help these businesses stay afloat during this tough transition.

""I think it'll be really devastating for these businesses to close down,"" said Nguyen.

VHC sent 7News details about their efforts saying: 

""They put up some signs that were very small, like near the road,"" described Nguyen. ""But there needs to be more outreach.""

Viet Place Collective told 7News the small businesses ""have provided integral community services, products, and food to the multicultural communities of Falls Church and the greater area for decades.""

A core organizer for Viet Place Collective, Binh Ly, said in a statement:

“Fairfax County approved this development without consulting the impacted small businesses and without considering how this displacement of the businesses and their workers would affect the community. It's clear that the outreach that's legally required is neither sufficient nor considerate.""

Supervisor Dalia Palchik told 7News in a statement:

“We facilitated a meeting between VHC, Viet Place Collective, and several business owners onsite last week. We brought several county agencies, including the Department of Economic Initiatives, One Fairfax, and Neighborhood and Community Services, to provide additional resources and help us learn from the entrepreneurs. I was encouraged by the dialogue and the additional concessions made by VHC to support the business owners, and their conversations are still ongoing. It was a productive meeting, and we thank all of those who attended. We also had helpful takeaways for similar circumstances in the future.”

""It's just important that these businesses get help,"" said Nguyen.

Many of these businesses can't make profits while also moving.

""I just want to be a business owner, and I love to be a business owner of the Pho Golden Cow,"" said Le. ""It's part of my goal and part of my dream to own the restaurant.""

A dream he'll have to fulfill elsewhere in just a few weeks.

A Viet Place Collective tells 7 News after the meeting facilitated by Fairfax County, VHC Health has offered tenants who have paid rent through February:

""We are pleased that VHC has agreed to the requests of the business owners. It will help ease the burden of having to close down their business and/or relocate,"" the organization said.

As for the new facility, VHC said it ""will provide highly in-demand emergency, urgent care and imaging services to the community less than 15 minutes and 4.6 miles from the hospital campus.""","{'href': 'https://wjla.com', 'title': 'WJLA'}"

The CMS Innovation Center has announced it will end several alternative payment model programs at the end of 2025, including the Primary Care First and Making Care Primary models as well as the End Stage Renal Disease Treatment Choices model. 

The Innovation Center statement said the early termination of Primary Care First and Making Care Primary does not signal a retreat from its support of primary care providers, but rather “a need to focus on different approaches that are consistent with the CMS Innovation Center's statutory mandate and produce savings.”Most models selected for early termination are within two years of their end date. Also ending early is the Maryland Total Cost of Care model, which was planned to run through 2026. 

Primary Care First was scheduled to run through 2026, and Making Care Primary was scheduled through 2034. ESRD Treatment Choices was supposed to end in 2027. The Innovation Center said it would propose terminating it through rulemaking.CMS is considering options to reduce the size of the Integrated Care for Kids (2020 – 2026) awards or make other changes to the model. Further, the CMS Innovation Center will no longer pursue two previously announced but not yet implemented models:• Medicare $2 Drug List• Accelerating Clinical Evidence

The CMS Innovation Center said it has determined its other active models can meet the Center's statutory mandate—either as is or with future modification—and therefore will continue moving forward. At a congressional hearing last June, Elizabeth Fowler, Ph.D., J.D., director of the Innovation Center, was pressed to explain why so few of its alternative payment models have produced cost savings. In a meeting of the Health Subcommittee of the the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, began by outlining her concerns. The Innovation Center, also known as the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) was created to help improve how Medicare and Medicaid pay for healthcare and to be an engine in our drive towards value-based care, Rogers said. “CMMI was given a 10-year, $10 billion budget and extremely wide-ranging authorities with limited built-in congressional oversight. The only directives Congress gave CMMI were to achieve two goals: lowering the cost of delivering care and improved patient outcomes.”Over the last decade and a half, CMMI has tested over 50 models to accomplish both those goals. When CMMI was created, the savings it was projected to generate were to be used to offset spending by the Affordable Care Act, Rogers continued. Originally, CBO estimated that CMMI would save $1.3 billion over its first decade of operation. That same model also projected CMMI would save as much as $77.5 billion in its second decade from 2020 to 2023. “However, when CBO looked at the actual results in a September 2023 report, the disparity between those expectations and the reality proved to be staggering. Instead of reducing spending by $1.3 billion in the first decade, CMMI increased spending by $5.4 billion. For the second decade, instead of saving $77.5 billion, CBO is now projecting CMMI to increase spending by $1.3 billion. I have a hard time believing any objective observer could look at the results thus far and describe CMMI as a success. So how do we move forward?”

The CMS statement said that by ending these models early, it will save taxpayers $750 million. The Innovation Center now says it plans to announce a new strategy based on guiding principles to make Americans healthier by preventing disease through evidence-based practices, empowering people with information to make better decisions, and driving choice and competition.  This announcement streamlines the focus of CMMI's models and will help build a health system that improves quality and lowers costs while helping Americans live healthier lives, the statement said.

In the wake of the recent Change Healthcare/UHC data breach, critical vulnerabilities in healthcare have been exposed, including outdated systems and weak security measures. In response, global IT research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group has published new insights, providing cybersecurity strategies to help healthcare organizations defend against evolving threats. In the resource, Info-Tech stresses the urgent need for improved cybersecurity practices and offers key strategies to security leaders to mitigate ransomware risks, strengthen data protection, and enhance incident response capabilities.

TORONTO, March 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - The 2024 Change Healthcare/UHC data breach underscored the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity within the healthcare sector. Exposing sensitive patient records and disrupting hospital operations, the breach highlighted significant vulnerabilities, particularly around the growing reliance on third-party vendors and outdated IT disaster recovery plans. To help security leaders take proactive measures to strengthen their defenses and protect patient care in the aftermath of cyber incidents, Info-Tech Research Group has published its blueprint Lessons Learned and Life After a Breach in Your Healthcare Organization.


""In today's healthcare landscape, organizations face increasing cybersecurity challenges due to their reliance on third-party vendors and complex IT environments,"" says Sharon Auma-Ebanyat, research director at Info-Tech Research Group. ""The largest healthcare breach involving Change Healthcare/UHC highlighted significant vulnerabilities, disrupting hospital operations and billing and exposing patient records. This underscores the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address these risks.""


""In today's healthcare landscape, organizations face increasing cybersecurity challenges due to their reliance on third-party vendors and complex IT environments,"" says Sharon Auma-Ebanyat, research director at Info-Tech Research Group. ""The largest healthcare breach involving Change Healthcare/UHC highlighted significant vulnerabilities, disrupting hospital operations and billing and exposing patient records. This underscores the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address these risks.""

The firm reports that despite the escalating cyber threat landscape, many healthcare organizations have yet to fully implement multifactor authentication, especially for remote access services, leaving critical systems exposed to attackers who exploit stolen credentials.

Info-Tech's insights also highlight the challenges posed by interconnected IT environments, making it difficult for organizations to detect and address security gaps.

""Many healthcare organizations encounter obstacles such as outdated IT disaster recovery plans that fail to address virtual and digital connections, limited budgets and resources, and complex, interconnected systems that make it difficult to identify and fix vulnerabilities,"" adds Auma-Ebanyat.  ""Traditional disaster recovery approaches often overlook the evolving nature of third-party risks and virtual environments, increasing susceptibility to cyberattacks.""

Info-Tech advises the need for a more comprehensive and proactive cybersecurity approach to mitigate these risks.

Five-Step Approach to Mitigate Third-Party Ransomware Risks

In its recently published resource Lessons Learned and Life After a Breach in Your Healthcare Organization, Info-Tech provides a structured five-step approach to help healthcare organizations mitigate third-party ransomware risks.

The five-step approach includes:

""This research offers a roadmap to mitigate third-party ransomware and data breach risks, featuring insights on current healthcare cybersecurity threats, lessons from the Change Healthcare/UHC data breach, and strategies to prevent future incidents,"" explains Auma-Ebanyat

By leveraging insights from Info-Tech's blueprint, healthcare organizations can take decisive steps to enhance their cybersecurity strategies and disaster recovery plans. The expert-driven recommendations outlined in the data-backed resource will help security leaders protect sensitive patient data, maintain operational resilience, and prepare for evolving cyber threats.

Jack Draper made a statement to the rest of the players remaining in the Indian Wells Masters draw.

The British number one reached the quarterfinals at the Masters 1000 event for the first time after dispatching former champion Taylor Fritz 7-5, 6-4.

That was Draper's third top-five win of his career and he has lost just one completed match so far this season.

The 23-year-old needs is on a mission to not claim the title in Indian Wells, but establish himself as one of the world's best.

Draper is gradually climbing the ATP Tour rankings and taking on the world's best on a more consistent basis.

The World number 14 He has claimed victories over the likes of Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's and now Fritz at Indian Wells.

However, he does have a losing record against the Spaniard and he lost his 2024 US Open semi-final to Jannik Sinner in straight sets.

Draper admitted that those two players put him under a different type of pressure than from other players, and he hopes that he is now developing that aspect of his game when he steps on court.

“When I play against someone like Carlos or Jannik. When these players are playing well they put a lot of pressure on you and you feel like you have to do more,” Draper told Tennis Channel.

“You feel that pressure when you are on the court and I think that is tennis. When you play these top players or I hope when people play me now they feel pressure to do more than they think they need to.”

Draper has recorded one victory against both Alcaraz and SInner during his young career.

He defeated the Italian at the Queen's 7-6(6), 7-6(2) back in 2021, but Draper lost to Sinner at the US Open in 2024.

Draper has played Alcaraz four times and his victory also came at Queen's in a 7-6(3) 6-3 victory last summer.

But the Spaniard won their Basel Open contest in 2022, and their 2023 matchup at Indian Wells, when Alcaraz won the first of his two titles on the Californian desert.

The pair last played at the Australian Open in January, and Alcaraz was leading 7-5, 6-1 before Draper retired from the match due to injury.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

Jack Draper clinched the biggest win of his season on Wednesday at the BNP Paribas Open, where he eliminated former champion and World No. 4 Taylor Fritz 7-5, 6-4 to advance to the quarter-finals in Indian Wells for the first time.

The British lefty won seven straight games from 4-5 in the first set to 4-0 in the second set to gain firm control of the clash, before he served out at the second time of asking for his third Top 5 win.

Draper's success against the home favourite was underpinned by a dominant serving performance, with the 23-year-old winning 91 per cent (32/35) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to improve to 3-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Fritz.

""I felt great. It is the best match I have played here so far in the three years I have been here,"" Draper said. ""I was happy with the way I was sharp. I moved great and competed well. There were a few moments here and there which I was brave, which I spoke to my coach about before the match. When you have chances against these types of players. Taylor is such an amazing player, so to come through in the way I did I am very proud of that.""

With his 79-minute win, Draper advanced to his third ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final. The World No. 14, who would crack the Top 10 for the first time if he reaches his second tour-level final of the season (Doha), lost in the last eight in Montreal in 2022 and in Cincinnati in 2024.

Draper will aim to go at least one step further in California, where he next meets Ben Shelton.

""I am very excited for that matchup,"" Draper said on Shelton. ""He is an amazing young talent like myself and brings such an amazing energy to the court, to the changing room. He is one of the nicest guys around so I will really enjoy that matchup and I am looking forward to competing.""

 

Fritz holds fond memories in Indian Wells, having won the biggest title of his career at the hard-court event in 2022. The third seed has struggled to find his best level at the start of the 2025 season, failing to win consecutive matches in Dallas and Delray Beach.

Chasing a confidence-boosting win against Draper, the 27-year-old was unable to outmanoeuvre the Brit on Stadium 1. Draper soaked up Fritz's hitting and was able to take the first strike in the baseline exchanges and held firm when the pressure mounted at the end to close out on his first match point.

The 23-year-old ended with a 24-17 winners-unforced errors count, with Fritz 19-19. Watching Draper courtside was coach James Trotman, who was the subject of March's ATP Coach spotlight.

""I was building some amazing stuff at the end of last year. I was moving great, playing great and seeing the ball very well,"" said Draper, who has struggled with injuries in recent years. ""I just had a bit of a break at the start of this year when I was injured. But with all of those problems, I have adjusted my schedule and that has helped me. I am happy with the way me and my team have worked and come through some tough times and the hard work is paying off.""

Boris Becker and Novak Djokovic are two people associated with tennis who have made waves during their career. 

Becker managed to win eight Grand Slam titles and although he never conquered the French Open, he was the youngest male's singles champion at Wimbledon back in 1985. 

Djokovic has arguably already etched his name at the top of the greatest ever discussion. He's on 24 Grand Slam titles and at 37-years-old, he's still on the hunt for more big titles. 

These days, Becker gives his honest opinions on tennis via social media but isn't involved in any coaching capacities after spending some time working alongside Djokovic. 

There will come a time when Djokovic calls time on his career. However, right now, he's still striving to the best and claim that 25th Grand Slam crown. 

Being number one in the world is the pinnacle for any player in sport – especially a single player sport like tennis. 

Winning major titles is ultimately what you'll be judged on but being the number one player in your field is the ultimate testament to consistency. 

However, Becker has told the ATP on YouTube that he never cared too deeply about being the world number one during his days as a player. 

However, he believed that he noticed how much it impacted the players when he was actually coaching Djokovic and claimed things had changed a little bit. 

He said: “I've been player number one but I was coaching Novak Djokovic for a couple of years so I realized similar mental patterns that we all have. I'm good friends with John McEnroe, Ivan [Lendl], and Mats [Wilander], and Stefan [Edberg], we all actually get along now. Back in the day, no chance to be on the same dining table. You've got to be a little bit crazy, a little bit egoistic in a way that your life is tennis and that's it. 

“So to keep that intensity for a long time is difficult, but I think we all have a bit of this crazy mentality of just doing what it takes to win the match. Being part of this number one club, and you know, when you're in your daily errands and you're busy, you don't think about it anymore, but all these other 28 players were heroes of mine, you know, the reason I played, it was because of all these players. 

“To be amongst this very small group of players, think of the thousands of tennis players you have and only 29 made it to you know, the Mount Everest of our sport. It's very special, it's very unique and I checked the list, I think everyone on it is alive so it would be great to get all these number ones one day on the tennis court and just speak tennis, because I mean, we know how it's done.”

Well, in fairness, his chances of getting back there any time soon look pretty slim. 

His recent defeat to Botic van de Zandschulp have set him back and things might get worse from a rankings point of view before they get better. 

Djokovic is currently seventh on the list with 3900 ranking points, with Jannik Sinner way out in front on 11330 at the top of the pile. 

Having been the world number one for a staggering 122 weeks during his career, Djokovic might not be too fussed about being the best in the business these days. 

With the Serbian picking up an injury that saw him withdraw from the Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev in January, the first thing for him to do it get fit again. 

Then, he will hope to take his best form into the summer and in particular Wimbledon which is where he will surely view his best chance of winning the 25th Grand Slam title given his record in England. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

The Marin Cilic Foundation awarded scholarships to its seventh generation of young talents this week, supporting a record 48 musicians and athletes. Since launching in 2019, the foundation has now provided 177 scholarships to help promising individuals pursue their passions.

Grants are awarded to grade school and high school-level classical musicians and athletes from individual Olympic-classified sports, with one collegiate-level recipient in each category. The funds help cover costs like equipment, training, competition fees, and travel.

This year's winners include athletes in taekwondo, wrestling, skiing, track & field, sailing, cycling and fencing, as well as musicians playing instruments including saxophone, clarinet and violin. Past recipients have gone on to medal at European and World Championships, represent Croatia at the Olympics and study at top music academies.
The scholarship programme is a key initiative of the Marin Cilic Foundation, which works to provide financial aid and opportunities for young people. Alongside scholarships, the foundation has renovated six school laboratories, sponsored four tennis summer camps and built four multifunctional school sports courts, with a fifth under construction.

At the ceremony, former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings Marin Cilic emphasised the importance of perseverance, self-belief and hard work.
“Watching these young talents bravely follow their dreams and not give up, despite challenges, is immensely inspiring to me,” Cilic said at the award ceremony. “Each year I feel a deeper sense of how important it is to provide them with support and show them that we believe in their dreams. Perseverance, belief in oneself, and tireless work are the keys to success, and I hope that our foundation will continue to accompany them on that journey.""
A standout moment this year came when former recipient Zrinka Ljutic, an alpine ski racer, chose to sponsor a new scholarship recipient. A two-time past winner herself, Ljutic's support highlights the growing cycle of past scholars giving back to the next generation.

Morgan Riddle has had it with those who look down on her career and those who accuse her of using boyfriend Taylor Fritz for content, as the tennis WAG has clapped back at some of her detractors. 

Riddle specifically targeted social-media trolls and tennis' 'older wives' who look down at what she does for a living.

The 27-year-old Riddle, who has been dating Fritz since 2020, has fully embraced her life on the road and near the court, turning into a fashion and tennis-forward influencer. 

'Historically, a lot of the older wives and partners on the [tennis] tour have been very private, heads down, in the box,' Riddle said on 'The Squeeze' Podcast.  'They're there to cheer on their partner and they didn't have super public personas.'

Riddle making content around Fritz's career led to 'a clique of older wives' posting her videos and photos in a group chat and making fun of her. 

'I think [the backlash happened] because it's different,' Riddle added. 'People expected me to sit in the box, be relatively private and not capitalize on my partner's career. And I kind of came in guns blazing. I was like, ""Well, f*** that"" and posted whatever I wanted to.' 

Despite appearing to be ostracized by other tennis WAGs, Riddle maintains her relationship with Fritz is as strong as ever.  

Fritz has been in the public eye longer than Riddle, as he turned pro in 2017. He coached his girlfriend on how to deal with outside attention to their romance. 

'Taylor has always been really good about [blocking out the noise],' Riddle said. 'When it first started happening, I would be like, ""Oh my gosh, look at what this person said"" and he'd be like, ""Why are you reading that?""'

'He went pro when he was 17 so he has dealt with that for so much, much longer than I had,' Riddle added. 'So he was very helpful in coaching me through that.'

Fritz is coming off a career best 2024, where he made his first Grand Slam final at last year's US Open, falling to Jannik Sinner in straight sets. 

Also in attendance was Taylor Swift, with Riddle wanting to know where 'mother' was inside Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City. 

That tournament has put even more eyeballs on Fritz and Riddle. 

'People write crazy things about us and our relationship,' Riddle said. '[But] we really love each other. We have a very healthy relationship [and] nothing that anyone says online is gonna have any sort of effect on that.'

Rarely heard voice recordings of trailblazing tennis entrepreneur Gladys Heldman and firsthand accounts from Billie Jean King, Rosie Casals and Nancy Richey are features of a TennisWorthy podcast released this week by the International Tennis Hall of Fame, as part of Women's History Month.

Introduced by ITHF President Patrick McEnroe and compiled by esteemed tennis historian Chris Bowers, the 25-minute oral history brings to life the tumultuous summer of 1970, when nine of the world's best women players joined forces with Heldman to rewrite the future of professional tennis.

Before delving into the archival interviews, Bowers sets the scene.

Original 9: A legacy of independence and empowerment

“For a revolution, or a war of independence to happen it requires two things: the right context and the right people,” he said. “In the great battle for independence in 1970 that gave birth to modern day women's tennis, there were two crucial people.

“One of them was Billie Jean King.”





 Getty Images
                        

The other was Heldman, the visionary owner and publisher of World Tennis Magazine. And the context was the ever-widening gap in playing opportunities and pay for women players, who had not benefitted from the instigation of Open tennis in 1968.

Against the broader rumblings of societal change, matters came to a head in August, 1970 when Jack Kramer's prestigious Pacific Southwest Championships announced the women's field would be paid little more than one tenth the men.

An exasperated King, Casals and Richey invited Heldman -- who was a mentor and confidante as well as a savvy businesswoman -- to lunch and told her they wanted to boycott Kramer's tournament.

“Men were still running the tournaments, promoting them, and very few women were involved in all of that,” Casals said. “It was something that was difficult to maneuver because every time we needed to talk to somebody about women, it was a man.”





 Getty Images
                        

Heldman counselled restraint but when her efforts at diplomacy with Kramer failed, she set about organizing her own eight-woman tournament at the Houston Racquet Club. Inevitably, this attracted the ire of administrators at the USLTA and their counterparts in Australia, who threatened to blacklist any player who took part in the unsanctioned event.

Throwing caution to the wind, Heldman was ready to invest her own money in the venture, but she asked her friend Joe Cullman, the tennis-crazy chief of tobacco giant Philip Morris, if she could use his company's Virginia Slims branding for added cachet. He agreed and, even better, provided one third of the prize money purse of $7,500.

The podcast goes behind the fraught scenes of the iconic dollar bill photo taken in Houston on Sept. 23, 1970 and explains the legal purpose behind the $1 dollar pro contracts Heldman signed with her players.

While these contracts did protect the athletes and indeed anyone associated with the tournament from being sued, they did not stop tennis authorities from imposing penalties -- which they did in the form of suspension from official competition, including the Grand Slams.

Nonetheless, the players were ready to take a stand.

“I mean, there was no money, so it was worth taking the chance,” Richey said. “I would rather throw myself in with Gladys Heldman who was a success at everything she ever did, versus the USLTA which was doing nothing.”

And what was King thinking as she held that hugely symbolic dollar bill aloft?

“Oh, my God, we're actually going to try to do this. And that whole week I kept calling [then-husband] Larry and saying, ‘This is nice to have this tournament. But then what?'”

The Virginia Slims Invitational was won by Casals, who defeated Dalton in the final. The event was such a success -- notably in the eyes of Cullman -- that a 21-tournament Virginia Slims Circuit was mounted early in 1971.

It was an incredible feat of organization and logistics, spearheaded by Heldman, but the sport's politics remained fraught and the USLTA even mounted a rival tour.

So on the eve of Wimbledon in 1973, Billie Jean, understanding that dividing the top talent was just bad business, brought 60 players together for another ride-or-die moment at London's Gloucester Hotel.

At that meeting, the players chose unity when they voted to form the WTA. Later that summer, the US Open introduced equal prize money, and King defeated Bobby Riggs in the Battle of the Sexes. Women's tennis was on its way -- with a little help from its ‘friends.'

“If the USLTA had not suspended them, if Jack Kramer had not screamed about women's tennis, if he had not put them down, women's tennis might have died,” Heldman said in 1979, the year she was inducted into the Hall of Fame.

“It lived because it came to a fighting climax and because Billie Jean and the other women, but mainly Billie Jean, was such a marvelous spokeswoman.”

The TennisWorthy podcast is further enlivened by anecdotes from Judy Tegart Dalton and Julie Heldman, Gladys' daughter. The powerful posse that has gone down in the history books as the Original 9 also comprises Peaches Bartkowicz, Kristy Pigeon, Kerry Melville Reid and Valerie Ziegenfuss.

In 2021, they became the first group of players to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

“The enormity of what the Original 9 achieved went well beyond tennis,” Bowers said.

“How much one views it as part of the women's lib movement of the ‘60s and ‘70s is open to question. Not all pioneering women players of the time see it quite so broadly. But there's no question they inspired people in other sports and walks of life.”

This year's induction celebration will be held at the Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island from Aug. 21-23, with Maria Sharapova and Bob and Mike Bryan set to be enshrined.

Highlights of the Fanfest surrounding the main ceremony will include a pro-celebrity tournament comprised of two teams made up of Hall of Famers Andy Roddick, Kim Clijsters, Tracy Austin, Jim Courier and Gigi Fernandez.

Listen to the full Original 9 podcast. And here's information on how to enjoy this summer's festivities.

MOSCOW, Idaho - After a 2-0 weekend where Idaho men's tennis moved to a perfect 3-0 in conference play, the Vandals hit the road again to return to a familiar state for a two-match slate over four days. 

UI has spent a good deal of time in California this season, and it's hard to blame them for wanting to be in the warm weather. The Vandals first traveled to La Jolla to take on UC San Diego, a match that was ultimately not played due to the elements and looks to be postponed to a later date. 

However, with another match on tap, there's little time to dwell. Idaho is headed to San Diego to take on San Diego State, looking to turn their three-match win streak into four.

The Aztecs are sitting at an even 6-6 heading into Friday's matchup, most recently coming off of a 3-4 loss vs. Gonzaga, a foe that the Vandals knocked off earlier in the month. The red and black has a season win over another familiar foe, taking down Cal Poly, 4-1, in late February. 

The match will commence at 10:00 AM PST, and will be live streamed HERE.

GREENSBORO – The North Carolina A&T women's team lost its second match as the Norfolk State Spartans escaped with a 5-2 win over the Aggies Tuesday afternoon at the Piedmont Indoor Tennis Center. The Aggies dropped to 5-2 on the season. 

After losing to 24th-ranked Clemson on Sunday, the Aggies finally got a chance to play at home in front of the fans, even though they found themselves in an early deficit after the Spartans secured the doubles point.

The Spartans clinched the doubles point early at the No. 1 position. Sofiya Tsitavets and Irina Lurea defeated A&T's No. 1 freshmen duo, Dorsa Cheraghi and Juana Weiss Gomez, 6-0. That gave the Spartans the point because the Aggies had to forfeit at No. 3 doubles.

For good measure, the Norfolk State duo of Yuliya Yurkova and Caroline Nicholls defeated junior Hana El Sherif and sophomore Randy Rakotoarilala 6-2. The doubles point and the Spartans receiving a point for the Aggies having to default at No. 6 singles gave Norfolk State a sizeable advantage over the next five singles competitions.

But the Aggies did not concede anything. They opened singles play with a win at No. 4 singles with Gomez Weiss defeating Sabrina Lurea 6-3, 6-2. The Spartans took a 3-1 lead when Tsitavets beat Cheraghi 6-1, 6-2.

Norfolk State clinched the win at No. 2 singles. Yurkova earned a 6-4, 6-3 win over Rakotoarilala. The Spartans' lead grew to 5-1 when Caroline Nicholls defeated El Sherif 7-6 (4), 6-1 at the No. 3 spot.

There was some good news for A&T at No. 5 singles. After her upset win over Clemson on Sunday, freshman Flavia Villegas remains undefeated after a 6-7, 6-3, 10-8 win over Irina Lurea.

""I was excited to compete at home today,"" said El Sherif. ""I think I played all right, but there's always room to improve. I'm looking forward to the next matches and continuing to get better.""

 The Aggies' next match is Thursday at 2 p.m. against LIU at the Piedmont Indoor Tennis Center.

LEXINGTON, Ky. – The Kentucky women's tennis team hits the road this weekend, traveling to No. 12 Oklahoma on Friday and No. 70 Arkansas on Sunday.

The No. 68 Wildcats are looking to gain their first SEC win this season, hoping to build momentum with these key matchups. Kentucky will rely on the strong play of junior Zoe Hammond, who has been a consistent presence on court one, and Julia Zhu, the Wildcats' No. 66 ranked singles player, who has been a reliable asset as well. Kentucky's doubles lineup, including the talented pair of Ellie Eades and Lizzy Stevens, will also play a key role.

On Friday, Kentucky will face an Oklahoma team that includes ranked singles players like No. 17 Julia Garcia Ruiz, No. 34 Alina Shcherbinina, and No. 74 Emma Staker. The Sooners also feature top doubles teams, including No. 63 Cara Mester & Shcherbinina and No. 66 Chloe Noel & Garcia Ruiz.

On Sunday, the Wildcats head to Arkansas, where they will take on a Razorbacks squad featuring No. 55 Carolina Gomez Alonso in singles and the doubles pair of No. 82 Anet Koskel & Grace O'Donnell. While Arkansas is ranked just behind Kentucky, this matchup will be another tough test on the road.

Friday's match in Oklahoma will begin at 6 p.m. ET and Sunday in Arkansas at 1 p.m. ET. Fans are encouraged to follow the Wildcats on the road as they look to continue their strong play and work to rise in the rankings.

“Being inducted into the Orange Bowl Tennis Hall of Fame is a huge honor,” said Fernandez. “This tournament has been a springboard for so many great players, and I'm proud to be part of its rich history. I'm deeply grateful to the Orange Bowl Committee for this recognition and for their unwavering dedication to growing the game of tennis.”

The Orange Bowl International Tennis Championships annually attracts top young players from around the globe and has a rich history of nurturing future tennis stars, including Arthur Ashe, Bjorn Borg, Jim Courier, Chris Evert, Roger Federer, Coco Gauff, John McEnroe, Gabriela Sabatini, Harold Solomon and Caroline Wozniacki.

Fernandez will be officially inducted at a ceremony on Wednesday, March 26 during the night session of the Miami Open at Hard Rock Stadium.

The Scarlet Knights had their best season under head coach Hilary Ritchie, finishing with a 12-12 record and earning their second win in program history at the Big Ten Tournament. RU also picked up nine victories in non-conference play, including three shutouts.  

Rutgers started the spring 9-3, their best start since the COVID-19 shortened 2020 season. The team also added two Big Ten regular season wins, defeating Michigan State and Minnesota.  

Rutgers made history in the ITA rankings, claiming its first-ever team and doubles ranking. The Scarlet Knights reached as high as No. 68 in the polls while the pair of Amira Badawi and Mai Nguyen came in at a season-best No. 54.  

Graduate Student Yana Gurevich became the first Scarlet Knight in program history to earn All-Big Ten honors, after going 12-5 in conference play.

Chilton, who came to Rutgers in the fall of 2023 at the start of her junior season, has made a long-lasting impact on the Scarlet Knights. During her time On The Banks Chilton has excelled in all areas including in tennis, academics and volunteering in her community. 

""The Arthur Ashe Award is a prestigious ITA Award and Tara is a perfect recipient,"" head coach Hilary Ritchie said. ""Tara always strives for excellence. In her two years at Rutgers, she made a big impact on our team, the business school and the student-athlete community overall."" 

The ITA Assistant Coach of the Year honors an assistant coach who has exhibited outstanding leadership in ways that contribute to on and off-court team performance. These are qualities that assistant coach Barrett has exemplified since arriving On The Banks.  

""Hailey is so deserving of this award,"" Ritchie said. ""She wears an incredible number of hats to help this team and the individual student-athletes as well. During a time when there is a lot of uncertainty in college athletics, Hailey always remains positive and puts her passion for tennis first.""

In the offseason, head coach Hilary Ritchie welcomed four newcomers to the team including two freshman in Zeynep Ilker and Karina Jumazhanova in addition to two transfers in Zuzanna Frankowska and Zhou ""Cindy"" Xintong.  

Zuzanna Frankowska played her freshman year at Baylor and hails from Kobylka, Poland. In the fall of 2023, she made her debut at the TCU Fall Invitational and went onto pick up four singles wins and a doubles victory throughout the slate. In the 2024 spring, she played two matches at the No. 5 lineup spot and picked up a doubles win against the Iowa State on the third court.  

Zhou ""Cindy"" Xintong spent her rookie season at Fordham, where she excelled. In the 2023 fall, she went 4-3 in singles play and 6-1 in doubles. She saw action in 18 of the team's 22 spring matches, going 8-5 in singles play, earning victories on courts No. 3, 4 and 5. The Mississauga, Ontario, Canada native went 11 matches without a loss, picking up big two-set wins over George Washington, Brown, Richmond and George Mason.  

Originally from Bursa, Turkey Zeynep Ilker comes to Rutgers with a wealth of international playing experience. A member of Turkey's National Team, she has taken part in European Championships. She spent several years competing on the ITF Junior Tour and in 2023 reached a career-best ranking of 408.  

Karina Jumazhanova also brings lots of worldly experience to the team, coming from Almaty, Kazakhstan. She mainly competed in Women's 15k events on the ITF World Tennis Tour, reaching a career-high ITF ranking of 178. The freshman also saw action in the U16 Juniors Billie Jean King Cup, representing Kazakhstan. She is an ITF J4 Doubles Winner and Finalist, in addition to being a Kazakhstan Doubles Finalist Champion.  

The Returners  

In addition to the four newcomers, Ritchie also welcomed back four returners in Jackie Lopez, Minchae Kim, Mai Nguyen and Naomi Karki.  

Lopez compiled eight singles wins across the 2023 season, finishing the campaign on a three-match winning streak. She clinched RU's first-ever victory over Minnesota in addition to the win over NJIT. 

Kim finished the spring campaign with a strong 11 singles and nine doubles victories, including eight in Big Ten competition. She helped RU earn a win in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament with a singles win over Michigan State.

She was featured twice in the ITA National Doubles rankings with partner Amira Badawi and defeated Penn State's 69th-ranked doubles pair with partner Yana Gurevich. In addition, Nguyen earned a singles victory to help RU top Michigan State in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--World-renowned player Björn Borg, one of the greatest icons in tennis, has signed with the Legends Team Cup as a patron and Grand Master of Tennis – adding his name to the prestigious tennis competition.





The Legends Team Cup, a new era of tennis competition, is an eight-event global tour, spanning two stops each in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas. The competition unites legendary elite players in world-class destinations, creating an unparalleled stage for high-stakes games, with the first event in the summer series taking place in Saint Barths in the Caribbean from June 12-14, 2025.

Following this thrilling series, the Fall Session begins in October, building momentum toward the highly anticipated Grand Superfinal where ultimate champions will be crowned.



The Legends Team Cup is a defining moment for the sport – it will give the best players in the business a life after the ATP Tour that is more than just exhibition matches – a real competition. Along with a $12 million prize pool, the winning players will also receive a trophy named in honor of Björn Borg, a symbol of excellence, perseverance, and tennis at its highest level.



""Tennis has given me everything – now it's time to give back. Legends Team Cup is unlike anything the tennis world has seen before, and I am honoured to attach my name to this electrifying competition where champions continue to inspire, compete, and make history,” Björn Borg said. “It represents everything I love about tennis – the passion, the rivalries, and the commitment to excellence. It's a new chapter in the sport's history, and I am proud to be a part of it. This platform gives legendary players another opportunity to compete at a high level and continue our journey in tennis beyond the ATP Tour. The hunger for competition never fades, and with this tour, we can keep that spirit alive while engaging with our loyal fan base in exciting new ways.""



The competition is made up of three teams, and selected iconic captains will choose from the pool of 18 legendary players during the first Annual Player Draft. Current players in the mix for the Legends Team Cup 2025 include Dominic Thiem, Diego Schwartzman, Fernando Verdasco, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Juan Mónaco, Marcos Baghdatis, Mike Bryan, Bob Bryan, Tommy Haas, David Ferrer, Radek Štěpánek, Philipp Kohlschreiber, Tommy Robredo, and Feliciano López.

ORLANDO - The No. 17 UCF women's tennis team is looking to maintain its five-match win streak as it faces off against No. 52 Iowa State and No. 40 Kansas this weekend. 

The squad will have the home-court advantage, looking to continue their flawless performance at the USTA National Campus. The Knights (12-1, 4-0)  have gone 8-0 in home matches thus far and are looking to continue this record when they face Iowa State (8-4, 2-2) Friday at 6 p.m. and Kansas (8-6, 2-2) Sunday at noon.

LAST TIME OUT

Last weekend solidified the Black and Gold as a force to be reckoned with in conference play. On Friday, the team faced No. 15 Baylor and started by clinching the doubles point. Olivia Lincer and Hannah Rylatt showcased their prowess against the 15th-ranked tandem in the nation, with Sophia Biolay and Aya El Aouni following shortly after with a win against Baylor's 89th-ranked duo. In singles, Lincer quickly disposed of her opponent, while Jantje Tilbuerger and Olivia Bergler rounded out the final points for the team in dramatic fashion. The Knights were victorious 5-2.

The squad then played No. 40 TCU on Sunday afternoon, where they remained dominant on the court. The team once again found success within doubles and carried that momentum into their singles performance, with wins from Lincer, Biolay and El Aouni on the front three. The Black and Gold would ultimately win the match 4-1 after showcasing their dominance in singles and doubles play.

THE OPPONENTS 

IOWA STATE

Iowa State currently sits at No. 52 in the national rankings, after going 8-4 overall and 2-2 in conference play so far this season. The Cyclones are currently coming off a loss against Arizona State, where they fell 0-4. 

The last time the two teams faced each other was last season in UCF's inaugural Big 12 season. The Knights emerged victorious, sweeping Iowa State 4-0. 

KANSAS

The Jayhawks boast an 8-6 record so far this season, going 2-2 against Big 12 opponents. No. 40 Kansas is no stranger to UCF, as they recently faced them in the opening round of the Big 12 championships last season.

UCF was able to clinch the win 4-2 at the championships, and the Knights hope to find the same success against Kansas on Sunday afternoon at the USTA NAtional Campus.

WASHINGTON — The White House has directed the U.S. military to draw up options for increasing the American troop presence in Panama to achieve President Trump's goal of “reclaiming” the Panama Canal, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.

During a joint address to Congress last week, Trump said, ""to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal.” Since then, administration officials have not said what ""reclaiming"" means.

U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans that vary from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the U.S. 

The Trump administration's goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China's influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. 

Both Panama and China deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama's Constitution. Chinese officials have accused the U.S. of using ""coercion"" to pressure Panamanian officials to block Chinese aid projects.

The U.S. officials told NBC News that the commander of U.S. Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey, presented draft strategies to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week. Hegseth is expected to visit Panama next month.

The officials cautioned that a U.S. invasion of Panama is unlikely and would only come under serious consideration if a larger American military presence in Panama does not achieve President Donald Trump's goal of reclaiming the waterway, the officials said.

Neither the Pentagon nor the Panamanian Embassy in Washington  immediately responded to a request for comment. 

Trump has said he intends to return ownership of the canal to the U.S. after Panama gained control of the area more than a quarter century ago under a treaty signed by the Carter administration. 

Privately, Trump has told his advisers that he sees a U.S. military presence in Panama and on the canal itself as critical to that effort, the U.S. officials said. Trump has also made it clear that he wants U.S. service members to be visible in the canal zone as a show of force.

Trump administration officials have argued that China has too large a presence near the canal. In the event of a conflict, they say, Beijing could shut down the canal to American shipping, including military ships. 

During a visit to Panama last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio  told Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino that “the status quo is unacceptable” regarding China's presence in Panama. Mulino said the Panamanian government alone administers the canal and denied ceding operation of the canal to China in any way. 

After Panama declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with China, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said the projects were part of Beijing's Belt and Road development initiative and that China “firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.”

Last year, now retired Gen. Laura Richardson, then the commander of United States Southern Command, said in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee that China is ""playing the long game."" Richardson warned that Chinese government-backed economic development projects are ""dual-use sites and facilities"" that can be quickly flipped and used for military purposes. 

""The PRC messages its investments as peaceful, but in fact, many serve as points of future multi-domain access for the PLA and strategic naval chokepoints,"" she said, referring to the People's Republic of China and the People's Liberation Army. ""In Panama, PRC-controlled State-Owned Enterprises, SOEs, continue to bid on projects related to the Panama Canal — a global strategic chokepoint.”

The U.S. military currently has more than 200 troops in Panama but the number fluctuates as troops rotate in and out, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Some of those troops include Special Forces units working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats, insurgencies or unrest. 

Potential administration strategies include simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal, to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of the passageway, officials said. Other options under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, to build new ports in Panama or using the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal's locks, officials said. 

There are also discussions about opening Army Jungle Schools, or training camps, in Panama, like the ones U.S. troops trained in jungle warfare until the canal was formally handed over to Panama in 1999.

One other focus of the ongoing planning is potentially positioning U.S. military forces near Panama in the event of a regional war or a threat to the U.S. In that scenario, the U.S. military would aim to secure the Panama Canal and eliminate China's access to the critical waterway. American officials cautioned that the U.S. would only block Chinese transit through the canal in the event of war.

The Panama Canal is one of the world's busiest waterways, with the majority of the cargo that passes through it originating in the U.S. or heading to the U.S. If the Panama Canal were blocked, ships would have to transit around South America, sharply increasing the cost and time of each voyage. 

The U.S. constructed the canal from 1904 to 1914 after a failed French effort. In 1977, after long-running protests by Panamanians, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty that turned control of the canal over to Panama. In 1989, during the George H.W. Bush administration, U.S. forces invaded Panama and ousted the country's leader, Manuel Noriega, who was later convicted of drug trafficking. 

In his joint address to Congress last week, Trump said that the U.S. was already moving to limit Chinese presence in the canal. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.”

The U.S. investment company BlackRock is part of a group buying a 90% stake in the Panama Ports Company, which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal. The stake is being purchased from a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchinson, for $22.8 billion.

BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) — Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guard member who caused an international uproar when he leaked highly classified documents about the war in Ukraine, pleaded guilty to military charges of obstructing justice at his court-martial Thursday and called himself a “proud patriot.” 

In a 10-minute address, Teixeira said he was “exposing and correcting the lies that were perpetrated by President Biden and force-fed to the American people” about the war in Ukraine. 

“I believe the Department of Justice was politicized against President Trump and myself,” added Teixeira, who said he acted alone when he shared the documents in a geopolitical chatroom on Discord, a social media platform popular with online gamers. He called on Trump and members of his administration to reverse his convictions.

“If I saved one American, Russian or Ukrainian life in this money-grabbing war, my punishment was worth it,” he said.

The judge agreed to the plea deal, which calls for dishonorable discharge and no jail time.

Teixeira was already sentenced last year to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty in federal court to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act, following his arrest in the most consequential national security breach in years.

Military prosecutors said before the court-martial at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts that charges of disobeying orders and obstructing justice were appropriate given that obeying orders is the “absolute core” of the military. 




Teixeira's lawyer, Lt. Col. Bradley Poronsky, argued Monday that the obstructing justice charge should either be dismissed or go unpunished, saying it amounts to double jeopardy because it already factored into Teixeira's November sentencing. 

A plea agreement was accepted by both sides that drops the disobeying orders charge. Teixeira pleaded guilty to the obstruction charge, admitting that he used a hammer to destroy a cellphone, a computer hard drive and an iPad after seeing some news reports of the leaked documents. He also admitted to telling his friend to destroy messages exchanged on a communication app. 

“I was scared about a potential law enforcement investigation into me and my friends,” he said in court Thursday. 

As the sentencing phase began, Teixeira's parents said he took an early interest in the military as a child. His father, also named Jack Teixeira, described him as “a good kid, energetic, intelligent, and quirky.” 

When his son decided to join the military, “I was excited about it,” the elder Teixeira said. ”It was a good option for Jack.” He said it gave him direction and the chance to see the world. 

“He made a mistake,” his mother, Dawn Dufault, said. “Everyone makes mistakes. He's my son, I love him. He deserves a second chance.” 

The leaks exposed to the world unvarnished secret assessments of Russia's war in Ukraine, including information about troop movements in Ukraine, and the provision of supplies and equipment to Ukrainian troops. The leaked documents also revealed assessments of the defense capabilities of Taiwan and internal arguments in Britain, Egypt, Israel, South Korea and Japan. Teixeira also admitted to posting information about a U.S. adversary's plans to harm U.S. forces serving overseas.

Teixeira worked as an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks. His lawyers described Teixeira as an autistic, isolated individual who spent most of his time online, especially with his Discord community, and never meant to harm the U.S.

President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia was excluded from high-level talks on ending the war after the Kremlin said it didn't want him there, a U.S. administration official and a Russian official tell NBC News.  

Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg was conspicuously absent from two recent summits in Saudi Arabia — one with Russian officials and the other with Ukrainians — even though the talks come under his remit. 

“Together,” Trump said when announcing Kellogg's nomination in November, “we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.” 

But Kellogg did not attend U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, on Feb. 18. Russian President Vladimir Putin thought he was too pro-Ukraine, a senior Russian official with direct knowledge of the Kremlin's thinking told NBC News.   

“Kellogg is a former American general, too close to Ukraine. Not our kind of person, not of the caliber we are looking for,” according to the official, who is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.  

A U.S. official  in the Trump administration, who is also not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed to NBC News that Russia didn't want Kellogg involved. The official did not know when this was communicated to the White House. 

Where this leaves Kellogg is unclear. 

Kellogg's office did not respond to requests for comment on why he has not been involved in the negotiations and whether Russia had requested that he not attend. 

National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt said that Trump had “utilized the talents of multiple senior administration officials to assist in the bringing the war in Ukraine to a peaceful resolution.” He added that Kellogg remained “a valued part of the team, especially as it relates to talks with our European allies.”

Kellogg, 80, is a staunch Trump loyalist who served in various roles in the president's first term, including a stint as then-Vice President Mike Pence's national security adviser.  

Before being confirmed Trump's envoy for Russia-Ukraine peace in January, he wrote about what he called the Biden administration's “incompetent” foreign policies. 

In a paper for the America First Policy Institute, which was founded to promote Trump's policies, he suggested that to end the war the U.S. should arm Ukraine and strengthen its defenses, thus ensuring that “Russia will make no further advances and will not attack again after a cease-fire or peace agreement.” 

“Future American military aid, however, will require Ukraine to participate in peace talks with Russia,” Kellogg and his co-author, Fred Fleit, wrote. 

During his presidential campaign, Trump said it was a top priority to end the war, which started in February 2022 when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbor, and that he would halt hostilities “24 hours” after taking office.  

The war has raged on after Trump became president for a second time, with Russia making slow progress on the battlefield in Ukraine and pressing Ukrainian forces that had taken a sliver of Russian territory across the border in Kursk. 

On Feb. 11, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, went to Moscow and spent three-and-a-half hours with Putin.  

There is no official account of their meeting. Witkoff had traveled to Russia to help secure the release of Marc Fogel, an American teacher held for three and a half years for a minor medical cannabis infraction.  

In a CBS News interview, Witkoff, a New York real estate developer and a friend of Trump's, called his hours-long meeting with Putin a “trust building” assignment from the American president. He said he was the only U.S. official present at the meeting and carried a message for Putin from Trump. Witkoff also said the Russian leader “had something for me to transmit back to the president,” but did not say what that was.  

The following day, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had spoken with Putin and they had “agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.”  

“We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other's Nations,” he added.  

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later said that during the 90-minute call Putin had “expressed readiness to receive American officials in Russia regarding areas of mutual interest, including, of course, the topic of Ukrainian settlement.” 

On Feb. 13, Trump announced a list of diplomats who would attend the talks with Russia. Witkoff, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and national security adviser Michael Waltz were on the team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio 

Kellogg was not on the list. A second U.S. official told NBC News  at the time that the decision stung him.  

A representative for Witkoff would not comment when NBC News asked whether his boss discussed Kellogg's exclusion with Putin.

When asked last week whether Russian officials had requested Kellogg not be included in the high-level talks, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it was up to American leaders to “fix their delegation” and her country's diplomats had “great experience of dealing with different envoys.” 

Andrei Fedorov, Russia's former deputy foreign minister who maintains close ties with the Kremlin, went further, telling NBC News that Kellogg was “not the person with whom Russia will negotiate with” because his position on the talks was to freeze the front line in Ukraine.  

Russia wants Kyiv's forces to withdraw from Ukrainian regions where there is still fighting, including the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia administrative regions known as oblasts, Fedorov, said.  

Russia illegally annexed the regions, along with Donetsk and Luhansk, in September 2022. 

Little was said about the war in Ukraine after Rubio and his team met with Russian officials in Riyadh, on Feb. 18, although the secretary of state did announce that the countries had agreed to restore embassy staffing.  

Trump has since played hardball with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with relations reaching a low point after their extraordinary Oval Office spat on Feb. 28. The U.S. subsequently put a pause on intelligence sharing and providing security assistance to Ukraine. 

This was lifted on Tuesday after a Ukrainian delegation agreed to a proposal for a 30-day interim ceasefire at a meeting in Saudi Arabia with Rubio and his team 

Kellogg was not present.    

On Thursday, Trump dispatched Witkoff to Russia again. 

Shortly after his arrival, Putin told a news conference that he agreed “with the proposals to stop the hostilities,” but there were issues that needed to be discussed. He added that he may need to “have a phone call with Trump.”

U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee for ambassador to Canada on Thursday reaffirmed the importance of the U.S.-Canada relationship and Canadian sovereignty, despite escalating attacks from the White House.

Pete Hoekstra said during his confirmation hearing in front of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Canada remains an important ally on intelligence and national security issues, which can be maintained and strengthened while addressing matters around trade.

Yet senators voiced concern about Trump's repeated calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state, which the president has said he will use “economic force” to achieve.

“Canada is a sovereign state,” Hoekstra said.

He appeared to attribute Trump's rhetoric to the frosty relationship he has with outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who marked his final day in office on Thursday. Liberal Leader Mark Carney will be sworn in as prime minister on Friday.

Hoekstra agreed with Democrat Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who suggested the arrival of a new prime minister offered an opportunity for a “reset” of the relationship.

Trump has antagonized Canadians by repeatedly suggesting the country would be “better off” as a U.S state, pointing to grievances in trade and military spending.

He repeated his annexation threat Thursday in the Oval Office alongside NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, calling the Canada-U.S. border an “artificial line” and mused about the “visual” appeal of combining the two nations.

Escalating rounds of tariffs on Canadian goods that began early this month sparked a trade war that has further damaged relations. Carney has said Trump's actions have broken Canada's “trust” in its top trading partner, and the government has sought to diversify its trade away from the U.S. in response.

The relationship was due to be addressed during a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers in Quebec on Thursday. Ontario Premier Doug Ford and federal officials were also in Washington to meet with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about the path forward on tariffs and trade.

Hoekstra, a former Michigan congressman and state Republican official who previously served as U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands during Trump's first term, said he expects to be the “tip of the spear” for the new Trump administration in Canada.

He equated the situation to his experience pushing the Dutch government to meet its NATO obligations and help the U.S. confront Russia on energy.

“There was a lot of hostility or concern about some of the objectives of the first Trump administration, which were really about fairness,” he said. “What we really spent a tremendous amount of time on was focusing on the strength of the relationship between our two countries.

“We have a great history of working together (with Canada). We know how to make this work. We now have to take that and say, ‘We know how to make this work, now let's do it and apply our experience to the priorities the president has outlined: freer, fairer trade so we can actually grow the business relationship between Canada and the U.S.”

Trump and Lutnick have said their tariff policies are intended to drive investment and manufacturing back to the U.S., with little regard for their impact on Canadian industries like the auto sector.

Nearly all of the questions to Hoekstra, who appeared alongside Trump's nominees for ambassadors to Mexico and Japan, were posed by Democrats on the committee who highlighted the fraying relations with Canada.

Some of those senators vowed to work with Hoekstra to push Canada to increase its defence spending and fulfill its NATO commitments, a longstanding irritant for U.S. lawmakers in both parties.

“We have a great alliance with Canada on national security issues,” Hoekstra said. “It would help if Canada met its NATO commitment. They're one of eight or nine countries that fall short, significantly short, with no real plan to get there anytime soon.”

The federal government has said it has a “clear and credible” path to reach the NATO target of spending at least two per cent of GDP on defence by 2032 or earlier, but has not released details on how that will be achieved.

Republicans focused on the other two nominees, pressing them on border security with Mexico and the importance of countering China in the Indo-Pacific.

Republicans in Congress have largely either ignored Trump's comments about annexing Canada or have sometimes openly supported them. The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee in January posted a New York Post cover that called Trump's “vision for the hemisphere” — including making Canada the 51st state — “The Trump Doctrine,” and celebrated Trump's “big dreams” for America.

Hoesktra said the U.S. wants to see the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship expanded to include law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, in order to not just crack down on fentanyl smuggling but other cross-border threats.

“It's not a huge amount (of fentanyl) that goes across our border from Canada, but … tomorrow it could be something else,” he said.

“If confirmed I will do everything I can to strengthen that relationship on Five Eyes, law enforcement cooperation, trade — those are all opportunities to make Canada and America safer, secure, and more prosperous. Closer cooperation.”

Trump has justified the 25 per cent tariffs he imposed on Canada and Mexico on March 4 as a way to pressure both countries to increase efforts to stop fentanyl flowing into the U.S.

Less than one per cent of fentanyl that enters the U.S. comes from Canada, with less than 20 kilograms seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection last year. January saw agents encounter just 13 grams of the deadly opioid, the lowest level in two years and down from a record high in monthly seizures last summer.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the committee, pointed out more drugs are encountered flowing north from the U.S. to Canada than what American border agents seize coming from Canada.

“Let's be honest about what's happening here,” she said.

Hoekstra also acknowledged concerns raised by Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland that tariffs on Canadian goods like lumber will make homebuilding in the U.S., which is facing a housing shortage in several cities, more expensive.

“It's not brain surgery,” he said with a chuckle.

Shutdown threat: The federal government edged closer to a shutdown after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said the stopgap bill to fund the government for six months did not have enough support for a vote in the Senate. He said Democrats in the chamber instead wanted a 30-day bill to negotiate a bipartisan solution. The government's funding is set to run out on Friday, and there is little time to find another path: House Republicans left town after passing the six-month funding bill. Read more ›

Senate Democrats said on Wednesday that they would refuse to back a Republican-written stopgap bill to fund the government through Sept. 30, significantly raising the chances of a government shutdown at the end of the week.

After two days of intense closed-door party meetings, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, emerged to say that members of his party could not support the bill approved by the House on Tuesday to keep most federal funding flowing at current levels for the next six months. He instead urged Republicans to pass a monthlong extension to allow time for Congress to consider individual spending bills and reach a compromise that both parties could accept.

“Our caucus is unified” on such a measure to “keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,” Mr. Schumer said in a brief statement from the floor.

The announcement left congressional leaders without a clear path to avert a shutdown that would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday should Congress fail to act by then to extend federal funding. Senate Republicans would need the support of at least eight Democrats to overcome procedural hurdles and bring a spending measure to a final vote. Just one, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has so far declared he would vote to break any filibuster.

The standoff puts Senate Democrats at risk of being blamed for any shutdown even as they complain about Trump administration disruptions to federal agencies. But they are under pressure from House Democrats and activists to stand against Mr. Trump and Elon Musk as they lead an effort to dismantle broad swaths of the federal bureaucracy, in some cases in direct defiance of Congress, which holds the power of the purse.

With two days left before the shutdown deadline, there is still time for a reversal by Democrats. But most of them have heaped criticism on Republicans' stopgap spending measure, arguing that it would give Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk too much leeway to continue their unilateral efforts to slash government employees and programs.

Republicans, who control both chambers, have shown no willingness to compromise with Democrats on the spending measure. And even if they agreed to, changing the House bill or approving a different one would require the House to return and vote again, which is highly unlikely. Republican leaders deliberately adjourned the chamber on Tuesday night and left town after passing the spending legislation, known as a continuing resolution, to effectively force the Senate to accept it.

The private meetings this week have laid bare a major dilemma for Democrats as they wrestle with how to respond to the Republican legislation. Senators said they had two unappealing alternatives. They could oppose the G.O.P. plan and potentially take the blame for a damaging federal shutdown or surrender to Mr. Trump and incite the wrath of Democrats demanding that their representatives thwart the White House at every turn.

“There are really only two options,” said Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. “One is to vote for a pretty bad C.R., or the other is to vote for a potentially even worse shutdown. It is a very tough choice.”

Even as Mr. Schumer declared his party's opposition, Democrats privately continued to deliberate over a way to avoid a shutdown without appearing to capitulate to Mr. Trump. Some suggested allowing the stopgap spending bill to move forward as long as Republicans agreed to give them a chance to revise it on the Senate floor. That would afford Democrats the chance to make their political case against the measure and show that they were fighting it, even if their proposals for changes ultimately failed.

But as House Democratic leaders gathered for a retreat in Virginia on Wednesday, they pleaded with their Senate counterparts to follow their lead and oppose the government funding bill outright.

Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called the measure “a power grab that further unleashes and entrenches Elon Musk's efforts.” He applauded his caucus for sticking together on Tuesday in voting against it and sending a clear message of repudiation for its policies on the House floor. All but one Democrat opposed the measure in the House.

In the Senate, virtually all Democrats are opposed to the stopgap bill, which cleared the House largely along party lines on Tuesday. They view it as an abdication of congressional power and a woefully inefficient way of funding the government while providing Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk more opportunity to slice into federal agencies. They also noted that it broke from an earlier bipartisan deal on both domestic and military spending.

“Instead of writing a bill that gives our communities what they need, they wrote a bill that turns many of our accounts into slush funds,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. The bill, she added, “gives the final say over what gets funding to two billionaires who don't know the first thing about the needs of our working families.”

She and her fellow Senate Democrats would much prefer to pass the individual spending bills that have been negotiated between the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Appropriations Committees. But House Republicans pulled back from those talks in favor of the decision to freeze most funding through Sept. 30, leaving only two remaining possibilities: blocking the spending bill or approving it.

Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said Democrats should not give in “just because the House decided to leave town on a Tuesday night.”

“That doesn't mean the Senate shouldn't be a deliberative body,” he added.

Despite their opposition to the spending plan, top Democrats are leery of forcing the government into a shutdown, fearing the political blowback after years of castigating Republicans for shutdowns.

In addition, Democrats worried that a shutdown would play into the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk, empowering them to keep hollowing out federal agencies. Democrats also argued that it remained unclear how any shutdown would end once it began. And they conceded that it could undercut their criticism of the Department of Government Efficiency as an out-of-control buzz saw shredding the government, if they were the ones refusing to extend funding for federal agencies.

Republicans were already trying to take advantage of their predicament.

“If I listen to our colleagues across the aisle, they claim to have a lot of concern for the federal workers that depend on government funding,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. “So I find interesting that so many of them in the House cast a vote that would put thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of federal workers out of work.”

Relenting to Republicans was certain to inflame House Democrats and advocacy groups who were demanding that Senate Democrats remain united against the legislation.

More than 150 progressive and environmental groups on Wednesday sent Senate Democratic leaders a letter urging them to “stand strong until Musk and Trump stop their illegal actions to dismantle key federal programs.”

At least one Democrat said causing a shutdown would clear the way for additional harm.

“If any of those groups want to shut the government down, I would disagree with them,” Mr. Fetterman said. “It wasn't that long ago that we were lecturing Republicans who were threatening to shut the government down. Now I think we are in the same situation.”

Democrats have excoriated Republicans, saying they acted irresponsibly in shuttering federal agencies in past funding fights.

Mr. Schumer and his fellow Democrats did prompt a shutdown in 2018 as they sought to win protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. But they capitulated after a brief weekend closure, when lawmakers concluded that the strategy was backfiring and angering the public.

They have sought to make certain they were not blamed in any government funding lapses since then.

A federal judge in Washington reinstated Susan Tsui Grundmann, a Biden appointee, to the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the agency that adjudicates labor disputes between federal employees and management, after President Trump moved to fire her last month. The ruling is the latest setback to President Trump's efforts to purge the federal bureaucracy, and his administration's legal stance that the president may fire almost any official in the executive branch at will.

Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan excoriated the government's legal arguments in her 35-page ruling that they “paint with a broad brush and threaten to upend fundamental protections in our Constitution.” She continued, “But ours is not an autocracy; it is a system of checks and balances.”

The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it had stopped using the largest U.S. operator of shelters for migrant children over allegations of sexual abuse and harassment of minors at the facilities, and moved to dismiss a Biden-era lawsuit that sought to hold the nonprofit accountable for enabling that abuse.

A joint statement issued by the Health and Human Services and Justice Departments on Wednesday cited concerns over allegations detailed in the lawsuit filed last year, namely that employees for the provider, Southwest Key Programs, subjected children to abuse and harassment.

The suit accused employees of Southwest Key, which has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, of exploiting “children's vulnerabilities, language barriers and distance from family and loved ones” from 2015 through at least 2023, including President Trump's first term.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, in the statement, blamed the Biden administration's immigration policies for enabling the abuses.

“Under the border policies of the previous administration, bad actors were incentivized to exploit children and break our laws: this ends now,” Ms. Bondi said, adding, “securing our border and protecting children from abuse are among the most critical missions of the Department of Justice and the Trump administration.”

Anais Biera Miracle, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key, maintained the nonprofit denied the claims of abuse. She said it was “pleased” that the Justice Department had dropped the case in its entirety, and that charges cannot be refiled.

“There is no settlement or payment required,” Ms. Miracle said in an email. “We are glad this matter is now concluded.”

Abuse and harassment were also alleged to have taken place during President Trump's first term, including during his policy of family separation, which forced thousands of additional minors into federal custody. In a complaint filed in July, federal prosecutors reported that Southwest Key employees subjected minors to threats of violence to prevent them from reporting rape, solicitations of sex and entreaties for nude photographs, among other inappropriate conduct and abuse for at least eight years, across three presidential administrations.

At the time the complaint was filed, the H.H.S., which assumes responsibility for housing children who arrive at the southern border unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians, continued to place minors at shelters run by Southwest Key even as prosecutors asked that the nonprofit face penalties and that it pay damages to the victims.

The decision appears to conclude a gradual reversal of fortune for Southwest Key, which has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, operating more than 25 shelters across Texas, Arizona and California. It has been awarded more than $6 billion in federal funds since 2007. After the H.H.S. announced that it would review its grants to Southwest Key, Ms. Miracle, the spokeswoman, said that the government had frozen funding and put in place a stop placement order on Southwest Key shelters, forcing the nonprofit to furlough about 5,000 employees.

Housing underage migrants for the federal government has been a financial boon for contractors like Southwest Key, whose award money more than doubled during the family separation policy overseen by Mr. Trump in 2017 and 2018. It was one of several providers that cashed in as the administration scrambled to find shelter for more than 5,000 children forced into federal custody, turning the care of migrant children into a billion-dollar business with little transparency.

The New York Times revealed in 2018 that Southwest Key had funneled government money through a web of for-profit companies to convert public funds into private money for the organization and pay top executives millions of dollars. Shortly after, the Justice Department opened an investigation into possible financial improprieties. Southwest Key also began an internal inquiry, and high-level executives, including its founder and chief financial officer, eventually resigned.

The complaint filed by the Justice Department last year disclosed that Southwest Key had documented dozens of cases of abuse reported by children, the majority of whom were 13 to 17 and came from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. But Southwest Key's employees did not report abuse they had observed or knew of, or any violations of policies intended to protect minors.

By one account, a worker who sexually abused three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 threatened to kill their families if they told. In another case documented by Southwest Key, a supervisor deliberately changed shifts to be alone with a teenage girl he repeatedly raped, abused and threatened. At night, he would enter her bedroom and those of others in violation of Southwest Key's policies. The girl was transferred to a different shelter after she reported the abuse.

At the time, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key said that the complaint did not “present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children,” and that the company remained focused on “the safety, health and well-being” of the children at its shelters.

The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into the funding and management of New York City hotels operating as shelters for migrants, according to a copy of a federal subpoena sent to a Manhattan hotel.

Federal prosecutors sent a subpoena to the Hotel Chandler in Midtown on Wednesday, requesting information related to the migrant shelter program and “a list of full names of aliens currently residing at Hotel Chandler,” including nationality, dates of birth and identification numbers.

The subpoena requested testimony and evidence from the hotel related to “an alleged violation” of federal immigration law. It asked the hotel for the names of entities and individuals responsible for the “funding and management of the illegal immigrant/migrant shelter program,” as well as any contracts or agreements related to it.

It was unclear why prosecutors sent a subpoena to the Chandler, a hotel on East 31st Street that was converted into a homeless shelter years ago but does not operate as a shelter for migrants.

The investigation appears focused at least in part on the management and funding of hotels acting as shelters, but its full scope was unclear as of Wednesday, as was whether other hotels had received subpoenas.

The grand jury subpoena was issued by the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. A spokesman for the office, Nicholas Biase, referred questions to the Department of Justice in Washington. A spokesman there declined to comment on what he said was “an ongoing criminal investigation,” adding that he could not discuss the scope or contours of the inquiry.

New York City, which is housing about 43,000 migrants in shelters across the city, including dozens of converted hotels, had not received a subpoena as of Wednesday, according to an official briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.

Liz Garcia, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams, declined to comment, saying, “We cannot comment on any type of federal investigation.”

The Guardian first reported on Wednesday that a Manhattan hotel, which they did not name, had received a subpoena.

The city's migrant shelters have been criticized and scrutinized by the Trump administration, which has made New York City, the country's largest sanctuary jurisdiction, a target of its immigration crackdown.

The city entered into multimillion-dollar contracts with more than 100 hotels as it struggled to house the more than 230,000 migrants who have arrived in the city seeking shelter since early 2022. Republicans have long decried the use of hotels as shelters to house migrants as wasteful spending of taxpayer funding.

Last month, the Trump administration abruptly clawed back $80 million in federal funds from the city's bank accounts that was meant to cover some expenses associated with paying hotels to shelter migrants.

In doing so, the federal government singled out the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown, which the city had converted into its main processing center for migrants. The Trump administration depicted it as a safe haven for migrant gangs. Shortly after, the city announced it would shut down the Roosevelt Hotel by June, citing a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in the city.

President Trump has formally nominated Dan Caine, a retired Air Force lieutenant general, for promotion to four-star rank and to serve as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which would make him Mr. Trump's top uniformed military official. The president fired his previous Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Charles Q. Brown, in a late-night political purge of senior military officers on Feb. 21.

The same day the Office of Personnel Management informed hundreds of employees, including about 20 involved in the communications division, that they were being laid off, the department's top spokeswoman posted an Instagram video she filmed in her office showing off her outfit with the caption: “a moment for mixed patterns.”

On the day O.P.M. sent a memo to all federal department and agency heads asking for lists of underperforming employees to terminate, she flaunted a “work look” that included a purple skirt that her followers could also purchase, retailing at $475. She would get a commission if they used her link.

The spokeswoman, McLaurine Pinover, is not the only member of the Trump administration to have used her federal office to promote outside business interests, but former agency officials and ethics watchdogs say that the timing and content of the videos were both unlawful and especially tone-deaf.

Government watchdogs say the videos, coming from the spokeswoman of the agency driving the layoffs of thousands of federal workers, exemplify a widespread disregard for government ethics across the Trump administration.

“It's illegal for a public employee to promote a private company in their government office,” said Donald Sherman, the executive director and chief counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group.

“On its own, maybe it would qualify as small potatoes, but context matters,” Mr. Sherman added. “In the context of a president and an administration that are routinely engaged in profiteering and using the office of the presidency for financial gain, in the context of someone who owns a private company, Elon Musk, coming into the administration and dismantling the government as he has, and in the context of O.P.M. being central to the administration's attack on civil servants who actually want to be there to work for the American public, an O.P.M. political appointee engaging in this conduct is egregious.”

Though presidents are legally exempt from certain conflict of interest laws, President Trump has not divested from many business interests, some of which involve real estate deals with foreign governments that could influence his diplomatic decisions. Mr. Musk, the tech billionaire whom Mr. Trump deputized to slash the federal government, continues to pursue federal contracts for his private businesses.

And on Tuesday, the day news of Ms. Pinover's Instagram account broke, Mr. Trump made a show of purchasing a red Model S from Tesla, of which Mr. Musk is chief executive, on the White House grounds, just a day after the company's stock crashed.

Ms. Pinover's short videos, each four to nine seconds, featured her in her office, lightheartedly modeling her clothes, applying makeup, working at her desk and occasionally blowing a kiss to the camera. They also included links to the clothes that would give her a commission from fans' purchases.

The existence of Ms. Pinover's accounts was first reported by CNN. The Instagram account has since been deleted, while the account that would supply commissions, ShopMy, has been wiped clean, save for Ms. Pinover's name and picture and an invitation to “Shop my looks!” 

In a statement, Ms. Pinover said she never made any money from the fashion videos.

“While I was battling breast cancer as a new mom, I felt so unlike myself. I turned to social media shortly after as a personal outlet,” she wrote. “I never made any income and with only about 800 followers, I'm surprised the so-called ‘newspaper of record' finds this newsworthy. My focus remains on serving the American people at O.P.M.”

Whether she actually profited off the enterprise is irrelevant, Mr. Sherman said. The purpose of the account was to promote the clothing.

Ms. Pinover took on her role in the Trump administration in January, but her Instagram account — and the start of her fashion influencer videos — predated that job. Before she joined the Trump administration, she worked as a senior director for the Herald Group, a communications and advocacy firm, starting in August 2023. Before that, Ms. Pinover was a spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Former O.P.M. employees said that Ms. Pinover should have been warned against pursuing supplementary income streams, particularly on government property, as part of a standard ethics briefing employees receive when joining the agency.

It was not immediately clear if Ms. Pinover had been explicitly warned against such activity when she started the job. White House representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Use of public property to film one's ‘fashion influencer' videos should raise lots of ethical questions about how seriously the Trump administration is taking their oaths,” said Viet Tran, the deputy communications director of O.P.M. during the Biden administration, a political appointment. “Whether it's Trump hawking Teslas on the South Lawn, SpaceX employees meddling in competitor contracts at F.A.A., or using your government offices for personal enrichment, it looks awful all around.”

President Trump hosted Micheál Martin, Ireland's leader, and hundreds of Irish Americans at the White House on Wednesday evening for a St. Patrick's Day celebration.

“We have come together to this beautiful White House this evening for the annual Shamrock Ceremony, a living symbol of the long and unique friendship between Americans and the Irish,” he said.

Several members of Trump's cabinet attended the celebration, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services. At the same event last year, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. invited many of Kennedy's siblings and their children in a pointed rebuke of Kennedy's independent presidential bid.

In a barrage of pronouncements on Wednesday the Trump administration said it would repeal dozens of the nation's most significant environmental regulations, including limits on pollution from tailpipes and smokestacks, protections for wetlands, and the legal basis that allows it to regulate the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

But beyond that, Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reframed the purpose of the E.P.A. In a two-minute-and-18-second video posted to X, Mr. Zeldin boasted about the changes and said his agency's mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”

“From the campaign trail to Day 1 and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,” Mr. Zeldin said. “We at E.P.A. will do our part to power the great American comeback.”

Nowhere in the video did he refer to protecting the environment or public health, twin tenets that have guided the agency since its founding in 1970.

The E.P.A. has “no obligation to promote agriculture or commerce; only the critical obligation to protect and enhance the environment,” the first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, said as he explained its mission to the country weeks after the E.P.A. was created by President Richard M. Nixon. He said the agency would be focused on research, standards and enforcement in five areas: air pollution, water pollution, waste disposal, radiation and pesticides.

Mr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would unwind more than two dozen protections against air and water pollution. It would overturn limits on soot from smokestacks that have been linked to respiratory problems in humans and premature deaths as well as restrictions on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. It would get rid of the “good neighbor rule” that requires states to address their own pollution when it's carried by winds into neighboring states. And it would eliminate enforcement efforts that prioritize the protection of poor and minority communities.

In addition, when the agency creates environmental policy, it would no longer consider the costs to society from wildfires, droughts, storms and other disasters that might be made worse by pollution connected to that policy, Mr. Zeldin said.

In perhaps its most consequential act, the agency said it would work to erase the E.P.A.'s legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that show global warming is endangering humanity. In his video, Mr. Zeldin derisively referred to that legal underpinning as “the holy grail of the climate change religion.”

Mr. Zeldin called Wednesday's actions “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.” He added, “today the green new scam ends, as the E.P.A. does its part to usher in a golden age of American success.”

The announcements do not carry the force of law. In almost every case, the E.P.A. would have to undergo a lengthy process of public comment and develop environmental and economic justifications for the change.

President Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, campaigned on a promise to “drill, baby, drill” and ease regulations on fossil fuel companies. Since returning to the White House, he has degraded the government's capacity to fight global warming by freezing funds for climate programs authorized by Congress, firing scientists working on weather and climate forecasts, and cutting federal support for the transition away from fossil fuels.

The United States is the world's largest historic emitter of carbon dioxide, a planet-warming greenhouse gas that scientists agree is driving climate change and intensifying hurricanes, floods, wildfires and droughts, as well as species extinction. Last year was the hottest in recorded history, and the United States experienced 27 disasters that each cost at least $1 billion, compared to three in 1980, adjusted for inflation.

Democrats and environmental activists decried Mr. Zeldin's moves and accused him of abandoning the E.P.A.'s responsibility to protect human health and the environment.

“Today is the day Trump's Big Oil megadonors paid for,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. He called the E.P.A. moves a series of attacks on clean air, clean water and affordable energy. “Administrator Zeldin clearly lied when he told us that he would respect the science and listen to the experts,” Mr. Whitehouse said, referring to Mr. Zeldin's confirmation hearing. 

Gina McCarthy, who served as E.P.A. administrator in the Obama administration, said it was “the most disastrous day in EPA history. Rolling these rules back is not just a disgrace, it's a threat to all of us. The agency has fully abdicated its mission to protect Americans' health and well being.”

Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate change and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said repealing or weakening regulations on automobiles, power plants and more would lead to increases in asthma, heart attacks and other health problems. “At a time when millions of Americans are trying to rebuild after horrific wildfires and climate-fueled hurricanes, it's nonsensical to try to deny that climate change harms our health and welfare,” said Ms. Wong, whose organization successfully sued the first Trump administration repeatedly over environmental rollbacks.

The Trump administration had been signaling for months that it would reverse many of the climate regulations enacted during the Biden administration. But the cascade of announcements, timed with an op-ed by Mr. Zeldin in The Wall Street Journal and the online video, was designed to attract attention before he is expected to address oil, gas and other energy providers at an annual gathering in Houston.

 By midafternoon, the agency had counted 31 pronouncements that were designed, Mr. Zeldin said, to “unleash American energy.”

The top lobbying groups for the automobile, oil, gas and chemical industries, among others, applauded Mr. Zeldin's plans.

Anne Bradbury, the chief executive of the American Exploration & Production Council, a lobbying group representing oil and gas companies, called the announcements “common sense.” John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto lobby, said the changes would keep the industry “globally competitive.”

Marty Durbin, a senior vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said, “American businesses were crippled with an unprecedented regulatory onslaught during the previous Administration that contributed to higher costs felt by families around the country.” He said “The Chamber supports a more balanced regulatory approach that will protect the environment and support greater economic growth.”

Groups that deny the established science of climate change also cheered Mr. Zeldin's actions.

“The Biden E.P.A. ignored the will of Congress, infringed on individual freedom, trampled on property rights and tried to force the country to use unreliable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar,” said a statement from Daren Bakst, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank allied with the fossil fuel industry that believes global warming has been minimal and is good for humanity and the biosphere.

Some of the most significant policy changes Mr. Zeldin said he planned include:

Rolling back restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Currently the E.P.A. requires existing coal-burning power plants and new gas plants built in the United States to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by 90 percent by 2039.

Rewriting tailpipe pollution standards that were designed to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the United States are all-electric or hybrids by 2032.

Easing limits on mercury emissions from power plants, as well as restrictions on soot and haze from burning coal. A Biden-era rule had aimed to slash by 70 percent emissions from coal-burning power plants of mercury, which has been linked to developmental damage in children.

Greatly reducing the “social cost” of carbon, an economic estimate of the damage caused by each additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. That figure plays a significant role in weighing the costs and benefits of regulating industries. 

Perhaps the most significant move, though, is an effort to revise a 2009 legal opinion known as the E.P.A. “endangerment finding” which concluded that rising greenhouse gas emissions are a danger to public health. The finding gives the agency the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Eliminating it would make it virtually impossible for the E.P.A. to curb climate pollution from automobiles, factories, power plants or oil and gas wells.

Reversing the rule has long been the white whale for climate deniers. But doing so would require Mr. Trump's E.P.A. to make and substantiate the argument that greenhouse gas emissions pose no foreseeable threats to public health, when decades of science says otherwise.

Jonathan H. Adler, a conservative legal expert and professor of environmental law at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said he did not believe the Trump administration would succeed. “You've got to explain away decades of statements by every administration that there are negative consequences of climate change that can be reasonably anticipated,” Mr. Adler said.

He called the effort to unravel the endangerment finding “a good way to waste years of time and effort and accomplish nothing.”

An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the views of the Climate Enterprise Institute. The group believes global warming has been minimal and good for humanity and the biosphere; it does not promote “climate denial.”

The acting head of the government's human resources arm, Charles Ezell, will no longer testify on Thursday in a case challenging the legality of the recent mass firings of federal workers, lawyers for the Trump administration said.

The move could pave the way for a federal judge to order the government to pause the firings.

Mr. Ezell had been ordered to appear before a San Francisco judge as part of a lawsuit brought against the Office of Personnel Management by unions representing some of the fired workers.

As the office's acting chief, Mr. Ezell began issuing guidance in January that agencies interpreted as orders to fire federal employees, particularly those with probationary status. That guidance is at the heart of multiple legal challenges, with the once-obscure agency assuming a lead role in President Trump's government-gutting initiative.

According to a legal complaint from the employee unions, Mr. Ezell held a meeting on Feb. 13 with the heads of many federal agencies in which he ordered them to fire tens of thousands of employees. The next day, O.P.M. provided a template to agencies to use for the termination letters, stating that employees were being fired for performance reasons, according to the plaintiffs.

The unions argued that O.P.M. does not have the authority to make such personnel decisions and asked the court to rule that the office's orders were illegal and force the government to stop firing people at their direction.

Mr. Ezell filed a declaration on Feb. 26 asserting that he did not order the agencies to fire anyone, and that the memos from his office were intended only as “guidance.” The same day, lawyers for the unions filed examples of correspondence from O.P.M. that they argue show that the memos were indeed orders.

A day later, the judge presiding over the case, William Alsup of the Northern District of California, heard arguments from both sides about O.P.M.'s role in the mass firings at the agencies involved in the lawsuit, including the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Judge Alsup concluded that O.P.M. has no legal authority to order the agencies to fire anyone, ordered that the government retract the memos and said the government should put a stop to unlawful personnel moves. He also scheduled a hearing for Thursday, March 13, making clear he wanted Mr. Ezell to appear.

O.P.M. responded to his order by retracting the original memos, but the government disputed the need for Mr. Ezell's testimony. Judge Alsup disagreed, ordering on Monday that Mr. Ezell come before the court.

“The problem here is that Acting Director Ezell submitted a sworn declaration in support of defendants' position, but now refuses to appear to be cross-examined, or to be deposed,” Judge Alsup wrote Monday.

On Tuesday, the government confirmed that Mr. Ezell would not comply. Government lawyers said his testimony is not necessary “because existing documentary evidence and briefing demonstrates that O.P.M. is not directing agencies to terminate probationary employees.”

Since the lawsuit was filed, the unions have drastically expanded its scope, including fired employees from 28 agencies, up from the five in the initial complaint.

The broader scope reflects the extraordinary personnel actions that have been taken since Mr. Trump's return to office and the opacity surrounding who is responsible for orchestrating the wholesale changes that have been ordered by O.P.M. — Mr. Trump or his government downsizing guru, the tech billionaire Elon Musk.

During his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, Mr. Trump said Mr. Musk is the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which is overseeing the culling of the federal government. Two days later, Mr. Trump told members of his cabinet that they are the ones in charge of reducing the number of employees at their agencies, not Mr. Musk.

Yet members of Mr. Musk's team continue to show up at federal agencies demanding data and documents and operating with outsized importance.

Mr. Ezell's testimony on Thursday would have given lawyers representing the unions the opportunity to press him on O.P.M.'s role in how Mr. Trump's government overhaul is being carried out. According to a court filing after the government's notice informing the judge that Mr. Ezell would not testify, the court clerk said Thursday's hearing would go on as planned.

Mr. Ezell took over as leader of O.P.M. on Inauguration Day. Before that, he was a lower-level official at the agency, overseeing data analytics. He also previously served as a consultant to the agency, according to his LinkedIn page.

news analysis

President Trump's retribution campaign against law firms, legal experts and analysts say, is undermining a central tenet of the American legal system — the right to a lawyer to argue vigorously on one's behalf.

With the stroke of a pen last week, Mr. Trump sought to cripple Perkins Coie, a firm that worked with Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, by stripping its lawyers of security clearances needed to represent some clients and limiting the firm's access to government buildings and officials.

That action came after he revoked security clearances held by any lawyers at the firm Covington & Burling who were helping provide legal advice to Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought two federal indictments against Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump's actions, and open threats of more to come, have shaken law firms across Washington and beyond, leaving them looking at their client lists and wondering whether their representation could put them in the president's cross hairs and endanger their business. Perkins Coie has acknowledged that in just the few days since Mr. Trump signed the executive order it “has already lost significant revenue” because of clients who have severed their relationship with the firm.

“This is certainly the biggest affront to the legal profession in my lifetime,” said Samuel W. Buell, who is a longtime professor of law at Duke University and a former federal prosecutor.

A federal judge on Wednesday sided with Perkins Coie in an initial courtroom skirmish with the White House, temporarily barring a major portion of Mr. Trump's executive order against the firm from taking effect.

“I am sure that many in the profession are watching in horror at what Perkins Coie is going through,” said Judge Beryl A. Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington. She added, “It sends little chills down my spine” to hear arguments that a president can punish individuals and companies like this.

Her reaction mirrored those of other legal experts who said the issues at stake go far beyond whether or not Mr. Trump will make life difficult for elite law firms and well-paid lawyers.

The experts say Mr. Trump's actions could create a trickle-down effect in which those who find themselves under scrutiny from Mr. Trump and his administration struggle to find lawyers who are willing to defend them in the face of the vast powers of the federal government. Those facing scrutiny could be forced to turn to less skilled lawyers or firms that enjoy access or good ties to the White House, the experts say.

“If you're a political enemy, you really need the best representation when the government comes after you for who you are,” said Daniel C. Richman, a professor of law at Columbia University and former federal prosecutor. “Chilling the lawyers who represent those people hurts the rule of law because when the government can't be legally opposed, the law provides no protections to anyone and you start to live in an autocracy.”

Mr. Trump's attack on Big Law comes as his administration has also gone after law schools, the American Bar Association and even lawyers inside the government itself who might question or hinder his agenda.

Last week, the top federal prosecutor in Washington threatened to stop hiring graduates from Georgetown Law School if its dean, William Treanor, failed to abolish the school's diversity programs. Mr. Treanor all but dared the prosecutor, Ed Martin, to make good on his threats, saying that the First Amendment would forbid them.

Mr. Trump has often relied on pliant lawyers to do his bidding, and last month he fired the three top lawyers in the armed forces who are supposed to advise military leaders on the legality of various policies and operations. The lawyers, known as judge advocates general, were fired without reference to their professional performance, raising concerns that the administration wanted replacements who would be more amenable to Mr. Trump's orders.

One of the first big tests of this new era arose late last week, setting off maneuvering that shows how big firms in Washington are rushing to adapt to the new challenges they face, according to interviews with people involved in or briefed on those discussions.

In his executive order targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump was going after a firm that represented Mrs. Clinton's campaign and repeatedly won election law cases in 2020 against Mr. Trump's campaign. Mr. Trump singled out Perkins Coie's involvement in a dossier complied during the 2016 campaign by a former British spy about Mr. Trump's potential ties to Russia.

Amid concerns in the legal community about a chilling effect, few, if any, major firms issued statements condemning Mr. Trump's action. And amid that silence there was a question about whether any firm would take the even bigger step of agreeing to represent Perkins Coie in its effort to challenge Mr. Trump's executive order in court.

Perkins Coie reached out to Derek L. Shaffer, a lawyer at the firm Quinn Emanuel. Mr. Shaffer had a long history of bringing civil actions against federal and state governments, and had argued before the Supreme Court three times. Perkins Coie wanted to see if he could take on the firm as a client and quickly go to court to file a suit against the Trump administration to stop the executive order.

Convincing Mr. Shaffer to take the case would come with a major potential bonus: close links to Mr. Trump and his allies.

Lawyers at Quinn Emanuel represent Elon Musk and provide ethics advice to the Trump Organization. The firm has also represented Mayor Eric Adams of New York as the Trump Justice Department has moved swiftly to drop corruption charges against Mr. Adams, a Democrat.

But Perkins Coie was rebuffed. Quinn Emanuel decided against taking the case. Its top leaders concluded that this was not an issue they wanted to jump into at this stage as they continue to build themselves into a power center in Mr. Trump's Washington.

Other major law firms expressed concerns that if they represented Perkins Coie, they, too, could face Mr. Trump's ire. Leaders of top firms asked: How would their own clients react if Mr. Trump cut off their access to the government?

In response, the elite Washington firm Williams and Connolly decided it would take on Perkins Coie as a client.

It's unclear why Williams and Connolly was willing to take a risk that other firms were not. But lawyers at Williams and Connolly have long taken pride in their role as an adversary and check against the government, including by highlighting the firm's role in protecting high-profile defendants against prosecutorial misconduct. The firm was founded by the well-known defense lawyer Edward Bennett Williams, who built his career on vigorously representing an array of clients before the government, including those out of political favor.

On Tuesday, Williams and Connolly, on behalf of Perkins Coie, filed suit against the Trump administration in Washington. That suit led to Judge Howell's ruling on Wednesday imposing a temporary restraining order to block for now the section of Mr. Trump's executive order that essentially barred Perkins Coie from dealing with federal officials and prevented it from entering government buildings. She said the executive order was most likely unconstitutional.

Other law firms have been discussing whether to file a joint amicus brief on behalf of Perkins Coie. While some major firms have signaled they are willing to sign onto it, others have said they are reluctant. On Wednesday, 21 state attorneys general filed their own amicus brief supporting Perkins Coie.

Covington & Burling, which had the security clearance stripped from a lawyer at the firm who was assisting Mr. Smith, has taken a different approach from that of Perkins Coie.

Covington has declined to fight Mr. Trump in court. Instead, the firm, concerned about a perception among its clients that it was falling out of favor with Mr. Trump, has begun discussions with other prominent law firms with fewer ties to Mr. Trump's perceived enemies about becoming the face of some of their most important cases before the Justice Department.

But beyond what Mr. Trump has done to law firms, the political appointees he has placed at departments, agencies and commissions are taking on the legal profession in other ways.

One of Mr. Trump's political appointees has ordered government officials under him to not renew their memberships to the American Bar Association, hold a position with the association or attend its events.

At the Justice Department, the attorney general has sent a letter to the American Bar Association questioning its diversity practices.

And last week, at an annual conference on white-collar crime for the association, a slew of top officials from the Justice Department — who regularly attend the event — canceled at the last minute. That meant that a conference designed to bring together the industry about an important topic was devoid of senior department officials in charge of enforcing the law.

Abbie VanSickle and Alan Feuer contributed reporting.

An earlier version of this story referred imprecisely to an element of the executive order President Trump issued about the law firm Covington & Burling. The order stripped security clearances from any lawyers at the firm who assisted the former special counsel Jack Smith. It did not strip security clearances from the firm.

Reporting from Washington

Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, opted not to name a critic of Israel's war in Gaza to a top post managing briefings for the president, after the proposed appointment upset some members of President Trump's coalition, according to officials familiar with the deliberations.

Daniel Davis, a senior fellow at a Washington think tank who is skeptical of American intervention overseas, was undergoing a background check to become the deputy director for mission integration, the officials said. The post is a powerful job that oversees the compiling of the President's Daily Brief, a compendium of intelligence assessments that goes to the White House and top policymakers.

But news of the proposed appointment generated blowback on the right. A senior administration official said Ms. Gabbard reconsidered her choice given the criticism, and other officials confirmed the decision.

Mr. Davis is a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, a think tank with funding from Charles Koch that has a number of alumni in key positions in the Trump administration. Defense Priorities has taken a skeptical view of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East and has supported Mr. Trump's efforts to reach an immediate cease-fire in the war in Ukraine.

The abandoned appointment has highlighted an emerging foreign policy fault line in the new administration. The Trump administration has appointed both more hawkish Republicans, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and officials far more skeptical of American intervention, including Ms. Gabbard.

The tug of war over Mr. Davis's appointment also highlighted the strain among supporters of Mr. Trump's over U.S. support of Israel.

Before Mr. Davis's appointment was pulled, the Anti-Defamation League said on Wednesday that the appointment would be “extremely dangerous.” In a social media post, the group accused Mr. Davis of minimizing Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack and undermining American support for Israel.

Consideration of Mr. Davis had also upset some hawkish conservatives in Congress who began quietly trying to get the administration to rethink it. These officials believed Mr. Davis's skepticism of the war in Gaza could weaken the Trump administration's support for Israel.

Former intelligence officials were also critical of the pick. Marc Polymeropoulos, a former C.I.A. operations officer and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said Mr. Davis's positions were outside the ideological mainstream of the Republican Party.

“His overt criticism of Israel and total opposition to any military action against Iran seems to run counter to current administration policy,” Mr. Polymeropoulos said.

Allies of Mr. Davis had defended him and said there was no hint of antisemitism or opposition to Israel in his work. He is skeptical of military action when it does not directly align with American interests, they say, and troubled by the use of proxies when the United States is unwilling to put its own troops in harm's way.

While some of Mr. Davis's criticisms of Israel are well outside the mainstream of the Republican Party, they are similar to certain critiques by liberal Democrats. He has spoken frequently about the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.

While Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for Palestinians to be removed from Gaza to allow it to be redeveloped into a beach resort, Mr. Davis has said the removal of people from the territory would be “ethnic cleansing.”

In January, he wrote on social media that U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza was a “stain on our character as a nation, as a culture, that will not soon go away.”

Consideration of Mr. Davis for the intelligence post was reported earlier by Jewish Insider.

Ms. Gabbard has said little about the war in Gaza recently. But many of Mr. Davis's other positions, including a skepticism of American support for Ukraine's war effort and his worries about the consequences of the fall of the Syrian government, match her views. And Mr. Davis's social media feed has been supportive of Ms. Gabbard's foreign policy positions.

During the Biden administration, the head of mission integration conducted many intelligence briefings at the White House. Beth Sanner, who was deputy director of mission integration through much of the first Trump administration, was the primary presidential briefer. Another intelligence official has had that responsibility in the current Trump administration, according to former officials.

In recent years, senior C.I.A. analysts with decades of experience have had the briefing responsibility. Robert Cardillo, who was the first person ever to hold the job, had been a senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, Shelly C. Lowe, left her position on Wednesday “at the direction of President Trump,” the agency said.

Dr. Lowe, a scholar of higher education and the first Native American to lead the agency, was nominated by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in October 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in February 2022. Michael McDonald, the agency's general counsel, was named its acting chairman on Wednesday.

“I can confirm that, at the direction of President Trump, Shelly Lowe has departed her position as chair of N.E.H.,” a spokesman for the agency, Paula Wasley, said in a statement. She said Mr. McDonald would serve as acting chairman “until such time as the president nominates and the Senate confirms a new N.E.H. chairman.”

Agency chairs are appointed for four-year terms, though some have served across administrations. Maria Rosario Jackson, the chair of the endowment's sister agency, the National Endowment for the Arts, announced her resignation on Jan. 17, shortly before Mr. Trump's inauguration.

The National Endowment for the Humanities was founded in 1965 and has awarded more than $6 billion in grants to museums, historic sites, universities, libraries and other organizations, according to its website.

Dr. Lowe's departure comes as Mr. Trump has moved to put his stamp on federal cultural agencies, most prominently the Kennedy Center, where he purged Biden appointees from the bipartisan board, fired the center's president and had himself elected chairman.

The president has also issued sweeping executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government while calling for the promotion of “patriotic history.” In one order issued in January, Mr. Trump included the heads of both the art and humanities endowments as members of his newly created Task Force 250, which is charged with providing “a grand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion of the 250th anniversary of American independence.”

Last month, the arts endowment, which is led by an interim chair, Mary Anne Carter, announced that it was canceling this year's “Challenge America” grants, a relatively small program aimed at supporting projects serving underrepresented groups or communities.

Potential applicants were instead encouraged to apply for the agency's much larger main grant program, which according to its website encouraged projects that “celebrate and honor the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity” during the lead-up to the 250th commemoration in July 2026.

In his first term, Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate both agencies, which have an annual budget of roughly $200 million each. But they survived.

Information was not immediately available about any staff or budget cuts or shifts in its programs at the humanities endowment.

Michael S. Schmidt

A federal judge on Wednesday sided with the law firm Perkins Coie, temporarily barring Trump's executive order that crippled the firm's ability to do business with the government. Trump signed an executive order last Thursday that essentially barred the firm's lawyers from doing business with the federal government or entering federal buildings.

Michael S. Schmidt

Trump said that he was targeting the firm because of its role in representing Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Judge Beryl Howell said that the executive order had a chilling effect on the entire legal profession. “I am sure that many in the profession are watching in horror at what Perkins Coie is going through,” she said, adding, “It sends little chills down my spine” to hear arguments that a president can punish individuals and companies like this.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, says that Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to pass the bill the House approved on Tuesday to avert a shutdown and fund the government through Sept. 30.

Schumer says that Senate Democrats are united around a 30-day stopgap bill “that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass.”

At least eight Democrats would need to join Republicans in getting the House-passed bill over the finish line. Democrats instead would like to extend current funding through April 11. But any changes would require the House to return, which is highly unlikely. House Republicans purposefully left town after passing the legislation to prevent any Senate changes.

Carl Hulse

Democrats exiting a meeting over a looming government shutdown said they were not ready to provide the necessary votes to pass a Republican stopgap spending bill, increasing the chances for a shutdown at the end of the week. “At least for now, I don't see the votes,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland. The standoff puts Senate Democrats at risk of being blamed for any shutdown, but they are under pressure from House Democrats and activists to stand against President Trump and Elon Musk.

Claire Brown

The Environmental Protection Agency said that it was canceling $20 billion in grants for climate and clean energy programs that have been frozen for weeks, a move that was labeled illegal by nonprofit groups that were supposed to receive the funds.

The money has been caught in an escalating controversy involving the E.P.A., the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Citibank, where the funds are being held and are now frozen, prompting lawsuits from three nonprofit groups.

The grants were issued to a total of eight nonprofit organizations through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which received $27 billion in funding from Congress through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But since taking office, Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A.'s administrator, has tried to claw back the money, saying they were part of a “scheme” and citing as evidence a hidden-camera video from Project Veritas, a conservative group known for using covert recordings to embarrass its political opponents.

The E.P.A. can cancel the grant contracts if it can document examples of waste, fraud, and abuse by the grantees. But that hasn't happened at this point.

Yesterday, Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched an investigation into the E.P.A,'s freezing of the funds and what they said were Mr. Zeldin's “false and misleading statements.”

Two of the nonprofit grant recipients, Climate United and the Coalition for Green Capital, said they will fight the cancellation. A court hearing on a related case is scheduled for Wednesday.

Here is what we know about the $20 billion in funding and how it became a target of the E.P.A.

In February, Mr. Zeldin announced that he had found billions of dollars of “gold bars” of grant funding at Citibank, calling the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (or “green bank”) grant program a “scheme” and a “rush job with no oversight.”

Mr. Zeldin has embraced the Trump administration's emphasis on spending cuts, touting his work with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has canceled scores of other E.P.A. contracts, totaling what the agency said is around $2 billion across more than 400 initiatives.

The “gold bars” comment was a reference to a video released in December by Project Veritas in which Brent Efron, then an E.P.A. employee, likened his agency's efforts to spend federal funds on climate programs before leaving office to throwing “gold bars” off the Titanic.

Mr. Efron's lawyer has denied his client was referring to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

After Mr. Zeldin's statement, Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C., asked Denise Cheung, a top federal prosecutor, to freeze the $20 billion held by Citibank. But she abruptly resigned after determining there was not enough evidence to order the funds frozen. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department continued their investigations.

Last week, Mr. Zeldin also referred the matter to his agency's acting inspector general for a third, concurrent investigation.

The nonprofit grant recipients began executing their legal defense this past weekend, when Climate United sued E.P.A. and Citibank, claiming they were illegally withholding the money. Two other recipients filed suits against Citibank in the following days.

A hearing on Climate United's request for a temporary restraining order to release the funds was scheduled for Wednesday in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

The cancellations surprised Climate United, a nonprofit organization that was awarded nearly $7 billion, said Beth Bafford, the group's chief executive officer. She said she received an official termination letter a half-hour before the agency issued a public statement.

The nonprofits have been unable to access the funds in their Citibank accounts since mid-February. The funds have been held there under an agreement between the E.P.A. and the bank.

Without the promised funds, some groups said they are struggling to pay staff.

In a termination letter viewed by The New York Times, the E.P.A. said it had identified “material deficiencies” in the program, including the absence of adequate oversight and improper or speculative allocation of funds. It did not provide any evidence.

The Coalition for Green Capital, one of the largest recipients, called the E.P.A.'s decision “unauthorized and unlawful,” and said it was considering legal options.

The $20 billion program was designed to offer low-cost loans to businesses and developers for climate initiatives, which include things like installing solar panels and retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient.

The E.P.A. distributed the money to eight nonprofits, which planned to distribute the money as loans as well as grants to local “green banks'” or credit unions, which would in turn make their own loans.

The idea was that the commitment of federal dollars would attract private investments to green projects.

Mr. Zeldin has made much of the fact that $20 billion in grant money was held at Citibank, portraying the E.P.A.'s decision to use an outside financial institution as an intermediary as an attempt to subvert oversight.

Grant recipients and former E.P.A. officials have disputed this characterization, and said that the agency has full visibility into transactions through the Citibank accounts for the nonprofit organizations and their sub-recipients

It's not clear how much of the $20 billion was spent before the freeze was put in place.

A spokeswoman for the E.P.A. said it could not answer how much of the money has been loaned out by the nonprofits because the funds were spent under the Biden administration.

Citibank did not respond to request for comment.

Parents in the District of Columbia, whose budget would be slashed by more than $1 billion under the stopgap spending bill the House passed last night, are planning to stage a “Recess at the Capitol” protest on Thursday. A flier describing the protest says they plan to bring schoolchildren to the Hart Building near the Capitol to show lawmakers “exactly who they're impacting.”

Annie Karni

Persuading Senate Democrats to block the bill, however, will be a heavy lift. The plight of Washington residents is not top of mind for lawmakers who fear being blamed for a government shutdown if the bill is blocked.

Miguel A. Cardona, the education secretary in the Biden administration, said in an open letter that the Trump administration's move to gut the Education Department was “deeply disturbing” and would “undoubtedly hurt students.”

Tim Balk

Cardona wrote that the cuts would sap resources for students with disabilities and that “vulnerable students in our country will feel the impacts the greatest.” He urged educators to stay “focused on your students and the great work you are doing, and know you are not alone.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he hoped a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine could take place within “days” if Russian leaders agreed, and that he planned to get diplomats from the Group of 7 allied nations to focus on ending the war in a meeting this week in Canada.

“Here's what we'd like the world to look like in a few days: Neither side is shooting at each other — not rockets, not missiles, not bullets, nothing, not artillery,” he told reporters during a refueling stop in Ireland as he flew from Saudi Arabia to Canada. “The shooting stops, the fighting stops, and the talking starts.”

Mr. Rubio also downplayed any notion that he would encounter hostility from American allies because of President Trump's recent tariffs. And he said he expected to have cordial talks with Canadian officials, despite Mr. Trump's threat to annex Canada and make it the 51st state. The president has also imposed coercive tariffs on Canada.

“That's not what we're going to discuss at the G7, and that's not what we're going to be discussing in our trip here,” he said. “They're the host nation, and I mean, we have a lot of other things we work on together.”

“It is not a meeting about how we're going to take over Canada,” he added. He landed in Quebec City on Wednesday afternoon, as other foreign ministers were also flying in.

Mr. Rubio and Michael Waltz, the White House national security adviser, met for hours on Tuesday with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to work out how to start a negotiation process with Russia to end the war. Hostilities began in 2014 when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, and then launched a full-scale invasion in 2022.

After the meeting on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said they had agreed to an American proposal for a 30-day interim cease-fire. After berating the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in the White House, Mr. Trump withheld U.S. weapons and intelligence aid to the Ukrainians to try to force them into negotiations. U.S. officials said after the Jeddah meeting that aid had restarted.

Mr. Rubio said U.S. officials planned to “have contact” with Russian officials on Wednesday to discuss the proposed cease-fire.

“If their response is no, it would be highly unfortunate, and it'd make their intentions clear,” he added.

Mr. Rubio said that when he, Mr. Waltz and Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, met with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia last month, the Russians appeared open to the idea of a settlement to the war. “They expressed a willingness under the right circumstances, which they did not define, to bring an end to this conflict,” he said.

Mr. Rubio said one of his main goals at the Group of 7 meeting was corralling the other countries — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, all supporters of Ukraine — to have a united front on encouraging peace talks. The meeting begins with a reception in Quebec City on Wednesday night.

He said a “perfect statement” to be issued from the meeting “would be that the United States has done a good thing for the world in bringing this process forward, and now we all eagerly await the Russian response and urge them strongly to consider ending all hostilities, so people will stop dying, so bullets will stop flying and so a process can begin to find a permanent peace.”

Ukrainian officials want to ensure several issues are addressed in any talks, he said, including exchanges of prisoners of war, the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia and humanitarian assistance.

When asked what was the American position on Ukraine's request for security guarantees to help deter any future Russian assaults, Mr. Rubio simply said deterrence would be part of peace talks.

“There's no way to have an enduring peace without the deterrence piece being a part of it,” he said, adding that any commercial minerals agreement between the United States and Ukraine would help enrich Ukraine, but was not a deterrent against Russian aggression.

Mr. Trump has insisted that the United States and Ukraine sign such an agreement, suggesting that investment by American companies in Ukraine would help stave off a hostile Russia.

Mr. Rubio said European promises to provide security to Ukraine would be part of peace talks as well. He said it was unclear when those nations would become more involved in negotiations, though European countries have insisted they would be central players in a settlement, if one were to happen.

“I would imagine that in any negotiation, if we get there hopefully with the Russians, that they will raise the European sanctions that have been imposed upon them,” Mr. Rubio said. “So I think that the issue of European sanctions are going to be on the table, not to mention what happens with the frozen assets and the like.”

The foreign ministers gathered in Quebec City expect to discuss the war, but Mr. Trump's hostility to U.S. alliances, his alignment with Russia and his unpredictable tariff actions have created a host of issues that the diplomats intend to raise.

Mr. Rubio said Mr. Trump was imposing tariffs not to punish other nations but “to develop a domestic capability” for manufacturing, especially in defense industries.

Canadian officials, including the incoming prime minister, Mark Carney, are taking reciprocal actions on the tariffs and grappling with Mr. Trump's other threats. Mr. Rubio said Mr. Trump's statements on annexation were based on both economic and security concerns.

“What he said is they should become the 51st state from an economic standpoint,” Mr. Rubio said. “He says if they became the 51st state, we wouldn't have to worry about the border and fentanyl coming across because now we would be able to manage that. He's made an argument that it's their interest to do so. Obviously, the Canadians don't agree, apparently.”

Trump Pulls CDC Nominee: What to Know

The Trump administration did an about-face on Thursday, pulling its nomination of Dave Weldon to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shortly before his confirmation hearing.

The White House reportedly concluded that Weldon, a former member of Congress from Florida and a vaccine critic, did not have the votes to gain confirmation.

Weldon marks at least the third speed bump the Trump administration hit during a confirmation process for its nominees that has otherwise gone relatively smoothly. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew himself for the role of attorney general, and Chad Chronister withdrew his nomination to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Despite holding a very narrow 53-47 margin in the upper chamber, Republicans have maintained enough unity to successfully approve President Donald Trump's slate of picks so far.

Trump announced his pick of Weldon in November, saying he would “proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!”

Weldon has been a close ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his mission to “Make America Healthy Again.” Kennedy, who was one of Trump's most controversial nominees, faced some hurdles during the confirmation process but ultimately squeaked through his confirmation vote.

Weldon said in a statement obtained by CBS News that a White House official told him “there were not enough votes to get me confirmed.” Axios first reported the decision to withdraw the nomination.

Weldon said that Kennedy was “very upset” about the decision and said he was the “perfect person” for the job.

""Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers,” Weldon said.

Weldon was sure to face tough questions about his previous support for anti-vaccine theories during his confirmation hearing. Some Republicans, including Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, gave Trump's picks to lead other health-related agencies a shakedown during their hearings, and Weldon was likely to be put in a similar situation.

OPINION: 



Two Republicans, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, reportedly expressed reservations about Weldon's nomination.

The concerns likely stemmed from some of Weldon's past stances on vaccines. While serving in Congress for 14 years, Weldon, who was also an internal medicine doctor, supported a bill to ban mercury from vaccines. He was targeting a mercury-based preservative the CDC says has “no evidence of harm” in low doses and was also removed from childhood vaccines years prior to the introduction of his bill.

He argued in 2007 that “parents should not be forced to choose between the risk of the mercury containing preservative thimerosal – whether real or perceived and the risk of contracting influenza.”

Like Kennedy, Weldon has also promoted the debunked link between vaccines and autism, which the CDC is preparing to study at the request of Trump administration officials.

Weldon's withdrawal comes as the agency faces growing criticism over its response to a measles outbreak in New Mexico and West Texas that has killed two people and resulted in more than 250 cases as of March 11.

Nationwide, measles cases have been reported in 10 other states, including Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington as of March 6, according to the CDC.

Kennedy, a longtime critic of vaccines, has expressed the importance of measles vaccinations in light of the outbreak but has said the decision to get vaccinated is a personal choice.

Kennedy has also taken a number of actions that have raised concern among some public health experts, including announcing plans for the CDC to reopen research into long debunked claims of a link between vaccines and autism, the canceling or postponing of scheduled meetings of vaccine advisory groups, as well as promoting the use of vitamin A as a treatment for measles – something the CDC recently added to its guidance for management of the virus.

Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director for the American Public Health Association, says Kennedy's actions are helping to sow confusion and mistrust of vaccines.

Steven Ross JohnsonFeb. 19, 2025



“He gives the public a confusing message,” says Benjamin. “I think he does not believe in vaccines and he's trying to find ways to articulate his anti-vaccine views.”

Benjamin says he believes the current measles outbreak probably played a part in the White House decision to withdraw Weldon's nomination, adding that his past anti-vaccine views would have likely made it difficult for lawmakers to vote for his confirmation.

“I don't know how members of Congress would have voted, but I believe it would have been very difficult for the Republican members of Congress – who, in my mind, held their breath and voted for Kennedy – to do it again,” Benjamin says.

For the CDC, the withdrawal of Weldon's nomination means the agency will continue to operate for now under the leadership of Principal Deputy Director Susan Monarez, who has served as acting director since late January.

The role of CDC director had been until recently one that did not need Senate confirmation. But the position took on the new requirement in 2025 after the passage of a 2023 omnibus bill that included a GOP-backed provision stating that the CDC director “shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.”

Benjamin says whoever the White House picks next to lead the CDC will not only face a number of public health challenges but also internal ones. The agency is contending with the aftermath of mass layoffs in February that saw more than 700 of its 13,000 employees lose their jobs as part of the Trump administration's initiative to streamline the federal workforce. Recent reports indicate about 180 CDC staffers who were previously laid off were recently offered their jobs back.

Benjamin says the lack of a permanent head of the CDC only adds to the overall disruption the agency is experiencing, which he feels has led to disruptions in how it functions and hindered its ability to rapidly respond to health emergencies, like the measles outbreak.

“We are behind on this outbreak, we are chasing this outbreak, and I believe the federal engagement was later than it should have been,” Benjamin says. “So, we really do need to have someone in that job. But I do think, in light of all that's going on, it is most important to get the right person in that job.”

Administrator Lee Zeldin promised ‘historic' deregulation at the EPA with sweeping changes to rules governing power plants, the oil and gas industry and more.

EPA Rollbacks: What to Know

Andrew Harnik|Getty Images

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin attends a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Feb. 26, 2025 in Washington, DC.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it would take “31 historic actions in the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.” The actions include loosening regulations on power plants and the oil and gas industry, reducing restrictions on emissions reporting and reconsidering wastewater regulations for coal plants.

The deregulation is an effort to fulfill President Donald Trump's promise to roll back environmental regulations, which he believes will lower the cost of living for Americans. In a video posted to social media announcing the actions, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin focused on the auto industry and the economy, but said nothing about protecting the environment or human health – the EPA's main mission.

“EPA will be reconsidering many suffocating rules that restrict nearly every sector of our economy and cost Americans trillions of dollars,” he said. “Our actions will lower the cost of living by making it more affordable to purchase a car, heat your home and operate a small business.”



Associated PressMarch 12, 2025



Here's a look at what to know, so far, about the EPA's plans:

The agency's mission is to protect human health and the environment by regulating pollution, ensuring clean air and water, and managing hazardous waste. Established in 1970, the EPA also researches climate change, oversees chemical safety, and cleans up contaminated sites.

The EPA does not make laws, rather, it enforces environmental laws passed by Congress. The agency creates regulations based on these laws, sets specific rules and standards for businesses, industries and the public to follow.

Some of the most notable laws that the EPA enforces include the Clean Air Act, which regulates air pollution to improve air quality and limit harmful emissions from industries and vehicles, the Clean Water Act, which protects the nation's water by regulating pollution in rivers, lakes and streams, and the Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures clean and safe drinking water by setting water quality standards.

The announcement did not include specific changes, but instead listed regulations that will receive “reconsideration.” The rules getting a closer look include regulations on power plants, the oil and gas industry, mercury and air toxin standards, wastewater regulations for coal power plants, among others. The EPA will also redirect its enforcement resources “to relieve the economy of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens that drive up costs for American consumers.”

“Critics may claim that these changes signal a retreat from environmental protection. Nothing could be further from the truth,” Zeldin wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. “Under the Trump administration, the EPA's core mission remains safeguarding human health and the environment. The difference lies in how we achieve these goals – through partnership rather than prescriptive bureaucracy, through collaboration rather than regulation.”

READ: 



Generally, Republican legislators are in support of deregulation at the EPA, while Democrats are opposed.

Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, or West Virginia, chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, applauded the EPA's moves toward deregulation.

“The action taken by the Trump EPA today is exactly what needs to be done to secure American energy dominance and restore the communities who have been negatively impacted by regulations and overreach from the Biden administration,” she said. “Today's action begins the process of rolling back the most harmful, anti-energy regulations of the past four years that have impaired our electric reliability.”

Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the announcement was a victory for the biggest polluters at the expense of public health and climate science.

“Today is the day Trump's Big Oil megadonors paid for,” he said. “EPA's attacks today on clean air, clean water, and affordable energy are done for the planet's biggest polluters. Americans will pay dearly—with their health and with their wallets.”

On its current trajectory, the U.S. national debt could soon reach its highest level in 80 years.

What Is the U.S. National Debt?

Bringing the national debt under control or slowing its growth involves various factors.




The U.S. national debt is the accumulation of money borrowed to cover the national deficit over time. 
The highest level of national debt in the last century was right after World War II, while the lowest was in 1974.
Increased spending during the financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and changing demographics have driven national debt higher. 
If unchecked, national debt will reach historic highs by 2029, and continue to balloon thereafter.












































Between Congress working on the budget and discussing changes to the tax code and job cuts taking place across the federal government by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Elon Musk, it's hard to go even one news cycle without hearing about the U.S. national debt.

But what exactly is it? And is the debt really higher than ever? If you're not entirely sure, you're not alone. 

“It's completely understandable that people are confused by it, and there's no reason why they should understand it. It's something the government is supposed to be taking care of,” says Karl Maschino, distinguished service professor of public policy and management at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College.

Here's a crash course on what the national debt is, where it stands now, how it has fluctuated in the last century and what it means for our economy – and your wallet – moving forward.

Read: 



Maschino says the national debt is often confused with the annual deficit. 

“On an annual basis, the U.S. government spends a certain amount and collects a number of taxes, and ideally, those two numbers would be the same,” he explains. “But we spend more every year than what we collect. The accumulation of that deficit on an annual basis is our national debt,"" he says.

It becomes debt because when the government spends more than it brings in, it has to borrow money. It does this by issuing bonds and Treasury securities, which other countries buy to give us cash inflow, Maschino says.

The challenge is that the U.S. has to pay interest on its debt, which is increasing yearly. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports that the U.S. paid out $881 billion in interest in 2024 and is projected to pay around $952 billion in interest in 2025. That is more than we spend on our nation's defense.

Sponsored Bank Accounts

Unless changes are made to address the situation, that number is expected to increase significantly, says Maschino, whose previous experience includes roles within the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Justice Department.

Although there is buzz about the national debt being at historic highs, we're not quite there yet. Economists' most common data point for comparison purposes is our debt as a percentage of economic activity or gross domestic product (GDP).

“The federal government's publicly held debt reached its high point – when compared to the size of the economy – right after World War II, and then declined,” says Jeff Arkin, director of strategic issues at the GAO. For context, the debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at 106% in 1945.

Following that high, the debt decreased over time to about one-third the size of the U.S. economy, reaching a low of 23% in 1974. However, major events like the financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the percentage.

“Today, it's about the same size as the economy,” Arkin says, with a projected percentage for 2025 of about 99.9%. according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.

“We're getting close to the historic high in our history,” Maschino says. “People think that's a big deal, but some economists would say it isn't.”

The real issue is what will happen if we stay on our current trajectory, says Arkin. “What is more concerning is that the national debt is projected to increase indefinitely, reaching twice the size of the economy within 25 years,” he says.

Currently, the CBO projects the national debt will reach 118.5% of GDP by 2035.

The question many Americans might have is how all of this affects them at the individual level. ”An increasing national debt could theoretically put pressure on businesses and individuals,” Maschino says. “It could translate to higher interest rates for borrowing. Some say that can result in lower wages.”

READ: 



The federal government has several strategies for reducing the national debt. It can generate more income (by raising taxes, charging tariffs, etc.) to pay down its debt. It can also try to reduce its annual spending.

While no amount of cutting can wipe out the entire national debt, the administration is trying to get the ball rolling by lowering the deficit – that's where DOGE comes in. 

Right now, the annual budget is roughly $6.75 trillion a year but only $1.75 trillion is discretionary, and that's the portion of the budget we think about all the time, says Maschino. This includes things like defense, transportation, education, government operations, etc. 

“What DOGE is trying to do is reduce our operating costs [in those areas] on an annual basis,” Maschino says.

The other two-thirds of the budget covers mandatory programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and interest on the national debt.

While the administration has promised not to touch entitlement programs (other than identifying fraud, waste and abuse), it is the elephant in the room regarding our long-term ability to reduce the national debt.

 “A big part of that annual deficit is the increasing cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security because of the demographics of our society, and those costs are formulaically driven higher every year,” Maschino says. “So, dealing with the discretionary piece of it is just one part of the problem – but not the larger problem.”

Getting the national debt under control or slowing its growth involves many moving parts. Most economists agree that it's an important issue to address, even if they have different ideas on the best ways to do so.

Regardless of how it plays out, Maschino encourages Americans not to spend too much time stressing over the national debt – at least not yet. 

“We're the world's strongest economy. As long as we're the place where people want to put their money by buying treasuries, which finances our debt, it's not an immediate emergency,” he says. “However, our current fiscal path is unsustainable over time.”

Immigrants kept the largest urban counties in the U.S. growing last year.

Core counties in the Houston, Miami and Phoenix metropolitan areas grew more than any others in the country primarily because of people moving in from outside the United States, according to population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau released Thursday.

Without the international migration, Harris County, Texas; Miami-Dade County, Florida; and Maricopa County, Arizona, would have had nobody moving there last year. That's because more people already living in the country moved out of than into those counties. Miami-Dade County would have lost population without the immigrants, since the number of births outpacing deaths wasn't enough to overcome the tens of thousands of residents who moved out.

Immigration in 2024 drove the overall U.S. population growth to its fastest rate in 23 years as the nation surpassed 340 million residents. The Census Bureau changed how it counted immigrants last year by including more people who were admitted to the U.S. for humanitarian, and often temporary, reasons.

“A substantial excess of births over deaths has long been the primary driver of U.S. population growth, but as this surplus dwindled in the last four years immigration provided the bulk of the nation's population increase,” Kenneth Johnson, a senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire, said in an email.

The 2024 estimates reflect a continued dissonance this decade between where current U.S. residents and immigrants choose to live. Immigrants last year moved to the urban cores of metro areas, while those already living in the country preferred counties in the far suburban reaches of metro areas.

The most popular counties for international migrants last year were Miami-Dade and Harris counties, followed by Los Angeles County and Cook County, Illinois, which is home to Chicago.

The most popular counties for domestic residents last year were Montgomery County, Texas, north of Houston; Pinal County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix; and Pasco County, Florida, northeast of Tampa. Also at the top ranks were Polk County, Florida, located between Orlando and Tampa, and Collin County, Texas, in the far northern suburbs of metro Dallas.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S. in 2020, the New York metro area and others with some of the densest populations in the U.S. lost tens of thousands of residents to relocation.

But the region has been on the rebound since the pandemic subsided. The New York metro area — the largest in the U.S. with 19.9 million people — added more people than any other metropolitan area in the country last year. As 147,000 residents moved out, nearly 288,000 immigrants moved in, including tens of thousands who arrived on buses provided by the state of Texas. San Francisco and Washington, D.C., are other metro areas that have gained population through international migration, after initially losing them during the pandemic.

The New York metro area also had the nation's largest natural growth last year, with nearly 214,000 births outpacing 141,000 deaths.

South Florida last year jumped two spots over metro Washington and metro Atlanta to become the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the United States. Metropolitan Charlotte, North Carolina, bypassed metro Baltimore for the 21st spot. Among counties, Tarrant County, Texas, home to Fort Worth, leapfrogged over San Bernardino County in South California as the nation's 15th most populous county.

Nearly two-thirds of the United States' 3,144 counties grew last year. At the same time, deaths outpaced births in two-thirds of U.S. counties, reflecting the reliance on immigration for growth throughout the United States in the years since the start of the pandemic. Nationwide, last year's natural growth was less than half the average gain of 1.2 million people that the country experienced in the five years before the pandemic, Johnson said.

""These recent levels of natural decrease are unprecedented,"" Johnson said.
