With its first committee approval, the bill that would regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers at the federal level now needs passage by the overall Senate, and a similar version also awaits approval in the House of Representatives. While a number of hurdles remain, including an eventual melding of the different bills from each chamber, the committee advanced the bill with a 18-6 vote.

Many Democrats on the committee acknowledged the need for the bill while also seeking to add a number of amendments to add additional regulatory controls and limits, each of which was shot down with partisan votes.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, the panel's ranking Democrat, led her colleagues' objections against certain provisions of the bill, which she said marks ""a clear threat to our national security"" in its current form. Warren grew increasingly frustrated over the course of the 2.5-hour hearing as each of her proposed amendments to the bill were rejected.

“It would be crazy to advance this bill when it’s got so many holes in it that have been pointed out, and to advance it at the exact moment that news is breaking about Donald Trump trying to create his own stablecoin with an outfit that is notorious for breaking the law,” Warren said near the end of the hearing, referring to reporting that the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial had been in talks with crypto exchange Binance. “Jamming this through while Donald Trump is out there making a deal with a criminal stablecoin platform makes no sense. We will regret this.”

Another Democrat, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, complained that committee Republicans were blowing off debate during the markup — a type of hearing meant to consider and discuss amendments to a piece of moving legislation — and a number of them weren't showing up at the hearing.

""It is a great start, but it is not ready for prime time,"" the senator said of the Republican-driven bill.

""Markups are messy,"" said panel Chairman Tim Scott, a South Caroline Republican, in response. ""We've been working nights, days, weekends to get this accomplished.""

Senate Bill Hagerty, the Tennessee Republican who was the legislation's primary author, called the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) a ""truly bi-partisan effort"" that had taken on Democratic input. Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland? cosponsored the bill, alongside a number of Hagerty's fellow Republicans.

""It presents common sense rules that protect consumers, promote competition, and foster innovation,"" Hagerty said. ""It’s time we provide the clarity and stability that our country and its innovators so desperately need.""

The crypto industry is counting on an increasingly strong majority of lawmakers in both chambers to back its policy efforts this year. So far this month, a separate effort to remove an Internal Revenue Service rule opposed by the crypto sector won wide bipartisan votes.

It was the Democratic-majority Senate Banking Committee in the previous Congress that held back crypto legislation that had advanced in the Republican-led House. The 2024 elections put Republicans in charge of both chambers, and Scott has made stablecoin legislation one of his top opening priorities.

Crypto tokens backed by U.S. Treasuries are at the forefront of tokenization efforts, as digital asset firms and global financial heavyweights race to put traditional instruments such as bonds, private credit and funds on blockchain rails, aiming to achieve faster settlements and operational efficiencies.



BUIDL serves as a building block for multiple yield-generating offerings, and it's increasingly used as collateral on trading platforms. It's a key reserve asset for Ethena's yield-generating USDtb token, which now has a $540 million supply. USDtb's value is backed by USDC and USDT stablecoins and some $320 million worth of BUIDL tokens.



""Ethena's decision to scale USDtb's investment in BUIDL reflects our deep conviction in the value of tokenized assets and the significant role they will continue to play in modern financial infrastructure,"" said Guy Young, founder of Ethena.

Gold, though, is doing what it's been doing for a thousand years — providing a haven during times of distress. The yellow metal is ahead by 1.5% to a new record high and within $10 of pushing through $3,000 per ounce for the first time ever.

Since the Nasdaq peaked for the year three weeks ago, that gauge has dropped almost 15%. Gold over that time frame has gained about 1%, while bitcoin is lower by nearly 20%.

The current outperformance might remind investors of the late summer/early fall of 2024, when crypto markets along with stocks treaded water in a sideways range while gold carved out new highs. While BTC consolidated between $50,000 and $70,000 between March and October, gold climbed almost 40% to $2,800. Bitcoin eventually rallied to above $100,000, buoyed by Trump's election victory, while the gold gains stalled as money flowed from havens into risk assets.

Since late January, the combined market capitalization of Treasury-backed tokens grew $800 million to hit a fresh all-time record of $4.2 billion on Wednesday, data source rwa.xyz shows.

Real-world asset platform Ondo Finance's (ONDO) products, the short-term bond-backed OUSG and USDY tokens, climbed to just shy of $1 billion combined, a 53% surge in market value over the past month. BUIDL, the token issued jointly by asset manager BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize, gained 25% during the same period to surpass $800 million. Asset manager Franklin Templeton's BENJI token expanded to $687 million, a 16% increase, while Superstate's USTB hit $363 million, up more than 63%.

A notable outlier was Hashnote's USYC, shedding over 20% of its market cap to $900 million, predominantly due to DeFi protocol Usual's decline after investor backlash. The token is the main backing asset of Usual's USD0 stablecoin, which plummeted below $1 billion supply from its January peak of $1.8 billion.

""We believe the growth of the tokenized treasury market cap during the recent crypto downturn reflects a flight to quality, similar to how traditional investors shift from equities to U.S. Treasuries during economic uncertainty,"" Brian Choe, head of research at rwa.xyz, told CoinDesk.

Choe based his analysis on comparing the market cap growth of tokenized treasuries with stablecoins between November and January, when crypto markets rallied, and from February when prices corrected.

During the recent bearish period, tokenized treasuries grew faster than stablecoins, contrary to the bullish phase, when stablecoin growth outpaced the treasury token market.

The stake could have been acquired through Trump-family backed crypto project World Liberty Financial, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Steve Witkoff, a friend of the U.S. president, was involved in the deal talks, the report added. Witkoff and his family founded World Liberty Financial two months before Trump was elected President in November.

The talks started last year after Binance reached out to Trump's allies offering to reach a deal with the family so as to bring the crypto exchange back to the U.S.

BNB, the native cryptocurrency of the Binance linked BNB Chain, jumped as much as 5% on the news, surpassing $600 for the first time in a week.

A representative for Binance.US declined to comment on the report. However, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said in a post on X that the Journal ""got the facts wrong.""

""I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone,"" CZ wrote. The WSJ didn't report that CZ was involved in the talks, but rather that Binance executives were pursuing it.

The WSJ had also reported that CZ asked President Trump for a pardon. CZ denied he made a deal but did not explicitly say he hadn't asked for a pardon.

""No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge. Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ""war on crypto"" from the last administration are still at work. I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world. It’s good to see that even WSJ thinks I should be pardoned,"" he continued.

The exchange just recently saw its U.S. dollar fiat services restored after it lost the ability to deposit and withdraw USD under the Biden Administration.

Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler had previously branded Binance.US ""a cauldron of fraud"" and tried everything in his power to crack down on the exchange. As a result, the company lost thousands of customers and was forced to lay off 70% of its staff after losing billions of dollars.

Binance also took its institutional investment on Wednesday as Abu-Dhabi based investment firm MGX put $2 billion in the exchange.

According to Glassnode data, short-term holders — investors who have held bitcoin for less than 155 days — are primarily considered speculators who tend to enter the market during price peaks or periods of market euphoria. Since February, they have sold more than 100,000 BTC (about $8 billion at current prices), a sign they're looking to cut losses (or lock in any profits) before prices fall further.

The decline has pushed the bitcoin price below its 200-day moving average of $86,300. The average is an important metric for long-term market trends, and BTC isn't the only risk-on investment to drop below.

U.S. equities, as measured by the S&P 500, have also lost that level. The index is currently around 5,537 while the 200-day average is at 5,738.

According to Joe Carlasare, a commercial litigator supporting bitcoin, when the S&P 500 struggles to reclaim the 200-DMA, history suggests lower prices are in the offing.

""The S&P 500 continues to struggle to reclaim the 200 day,"" he wrote on X. ""If we can’t get a big rally above it soon, it makes sense to expect lower prices Look back historically what happens when we loose the 200 day.""

Strike (STRK), the preferred stock issued by bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) has been listed for just over a month and is currently 3% higher than at its Feb. 5 introduction. Strategy's common stock, on the other hand, is 20% lower over the same period.

Preferred stock like STRK can be thought of as a hybrid of equity and debt. Holders have a greater right to dividend payments than common stock owners if the company makes them and also to the company's assets in the event of a liquidation. STRK is a perpetual issue, which lacks a maturity date (like equity) and pays a fixed dividend (like debt).

Those features mean preferred stock tends to be less volatile than the common stock. That certainly seems to be the case for STRK. According to Strategy's dashboard, STRK has a 26% correlation with MSTR and a slightly negative -7% correlation with bitcoin (BTC). It's also less volatile, at 49%, compared with bitcoin’s roughly 60% and MSTR’s volatility exceeding 100%.

Last week, Strategy announced a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering for STRK. That is, it's prepared to sell up to that amount of the stock at the current market price over a period of time. If all the STRK is sold, the company would face a total annual dividend bill of about $1.68 billion.

Generating that amount of cash means the company would either to sell common stock through an ATM offering — unlikely given the depressed share price as of late —or use cash generated from operations or proceeds from any convertible debt raised.

STRK offers an 8% annual dividend yield based on its $100 liquidation preference and at the currently price of $87.45, offers an effective yield of around 9%. As with debt, the higher the STRK price, the lower the yield, and vice versa.

STRK also includes a feature allowing each share to be converted into 0.1 share of common stock, equivalent to a 10-to-1 ratio, when the MSTR price reaches or exceeds $1,000. Strategy stock closed at $262.55 on Wednesday, for the option to become viable it would have to appreciate significantly, offering potential upside beyond STRK’s fixed dividend.

As an income-generating product with lower volatility, STRK presents a more stable option with potential upside. However, the massive ATM offering could impact this potential upside, similar to how ATM share sales have affected the common stock’s performance.",coindesk

“We are entering an unprecedented period of growth for the crypto industry, driven by greater regulatory clarity around the world and increasing institutional adoption,” said Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive officer of Ripple, in a release.

“Thanks to its early leadership in creating a supportive environment for tech and crypto innovation, the UAE is exceptionally well-placed to benefit.”

Ripple said it has seen increasing demand across the Middle East from crypto-native firms and traditional financial institutions, and has around 20% of its global customer base already operating in the Middle East.

Payments utility is also expected to drive greater stablecoin adoption in the UAE, with stablecoins offering real time settlements. That can drive further growth for Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin — which stands at a $134 million capitalization as of Thursday (meaning an equivalent amount in USD backing).

Ripple’s DFSA license adds to its growing list of over 60 regulatory approvals worldwide, including a Major Payments Institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Trust Charter, a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration from the Central Bank of Ireland, and Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) across multiple U.S. states.

The industry that battled with pariah status just three years ago has staunch allies now in the White House and inside the U.S. financial agencies, and the recent votes in the Senate and House of Representatives on an Internal Revenue Service rule demonstrate that their support among lawmakers runs deep. So many Democrats joined the sector's reliable Republican allies on those votes that crypto advocates suggest they may not have to give up much in negotiations over legislation that matters even more.

Just before he left office, former President Joe Biden's IRS put a final stamp on a rule to pursue decentralized finance (DeFi) projects as brokers that would have to conduct the full range of tax reporting for users. The House and Senate both cast votes over the past week and a half under the Congressional Review Act to kill that rule, and both of those votes succeeded by massive margins, thanks to 19 Democrats in the Senate and 76 in the House who bucked the policy of their party's administration.

With more than a third of Democrats on board in each chamber, there's little reason to suspect those Democrats wouldn't also be positively inclined to support other crypto topics.

""For years, we’ve been playing defense — trying to protect the industry from hostile regulators and relying on compromises that, in many cases, weakened the final legislative product,"" said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association that advocates for pro-crypto policy in Washington. ""But now we’re able to think a bit more expansively about what’s possible at the federal level.""

The digital assets bill that's closest to completion is the effort to govern U.S. stablecoin issuers. With a House version getting a once-over in committee this week and the Senate's version heading toward a potential sign-off by the Senate Banking Committee, the two chambers may soon find themselves voting on the finished legislation. In a period of extreme partisanship, crypto could be one of the few issues to stand on common ground.

As the details are hashed out, an industry that may once have been pressured into aggressive controls on anti-money-laundering systems in order to maintain the support of some Democrats could instead afford to press on without giving ground, crypto insiders are noting.

The industry's bigger prize, though, is the future legislation that will once-and-for-all set a clear system of regulations for U.S. crypto trading and transactions, and for the businesses and projects that handle people's digital assets needs. If Congress passes such a bill on the operation of the crypto markets, it eliminates any legal fumbling by federal agencies trying to fit existing laws onto the sector, and it would negate the need to look for answers in the courts.

Lawmakers are trying to build off previous efforts — most notably the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which passed the House in the last session, but not the Senate. While a replacement effort may be further out than stablecoins, when it starts moving through this Congress, it could have a significantly easier path than its predecessor.

Even on the same day lawmakers were preparing for the ultimate partisan exercise as President Donald Trump prepared to make his recent address to Congress, the parties made their huge bipartisan showing in the Senate. That ""rare and fleeting"" congressional cooperation should allow the lawmakers to focus on the actual policy, Smith said.

How did crypto get here?

Congress was flooded with new allies after the 2024 elections, in which the industry-backed Fairshake political action committee expended about $139 million to help get pro-crypto lawmakers from both parties elected. Potentially as important in the ongoing legislative negotiations, though, is the fact that the super PAC is already sitting on $116 million (and growing) to do the same next year. As lawmakers approach their votes this year, they'll know that a pro-crypto vote has a good chance of resulting in campaign dollars, and an opposition vote will likely result in spending aimed to snuff out their political careers.

The main sources of money behind Fairshake are Coinbase, a16z and Ripple Labs, with other backers including Jump Crypto and Uniswap Labs. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in an interview outside the White House crypto summit last week that his company will keep supporting Fairshake, which he said ""did an incredible job.""

""Our supporters in this industry are deeply committed to this political strategy,"" said Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Fairshake, in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We are seeing it in action now, and are going to continue to press forward.""

He said the IRS votes were ""a direct result of that strategy,"" which ignored politicians' other views and party affiliations to focus only on whether they'd push for crypto bills.

""There's tremendous political benefit in supporting the growth and smart regulation of the industry,"" Vlasto said.

Even before the recent elections, FIT21 had earned major Democratic support in the House, and a separate effort to try to get rid of a Securities and Exchange Commission crypto accounting policy saw significant bipartisan support in both chambers. The industry was already making headway.

Then the course of the last congressional-election cycle saw a clear rise in voter experience with cryptocurrencies and an increasing interest that the space be regulated. Groups such as the Coinbase-backed Stand With Crypto have sought to tap into that crypto-interested segment of the population.

""That's how we got this most pro-crypto Congress that we've ever seen,"" Armstrong said.

The idea was simple: Fei, with its algorithmic stablecoin, would join forces with Rari, a pioneer in permissionless lending pools, to create a DeFi powerhouse governed by a single DAO. Their communities approved the merger with overwhelming support, and in December, Tribe DAO was born.

Nine months later, it was dead.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

The Fei-Rari collapse sent shockwaves through the ecosystem, but it was hardly the only DAO M&A, even in 2021. Gnosis and xDAI (a qualified success), Aragon and Vocdoni (a middling failure), Yearn and Cream/Sushi/Pickle (hard to tell) all came together. Since 2020, more than 65 deals have been executed by DAOs looking to scale, merge or consolidate. Today, the state of DAO M&A is more vibrant than ever.

Traditional M&A has clear playbooks. Corporate boards negotiate deals, investment banks structure financing, and legal teams ensure compliance. But DAOs have been operating in uncharted waters. Governance is chaotic. There’s no CEO to sign off on a deal, and token holders vote, often with unpredictable outcomes. Or they learn about it after the fact, as with Aragon's community.

As we discovered in writing the State of DAO M&A report: valuations are murky, as DAO tokens fluctuate wildly, making it difficult to price acquisitions fairly or to satisfy token holder expectations, as evidenced in Fei-Rari and in Gnosis-xDAI. Regulation is a landmine. The absence of standards for legally binding DAO transactions prevents potentially valuable agreements from being implemented.

Instead, DAOs are turning to token migrations and swap contracts as workarounds to regulatory uncertainty. Security concerns remain challenging for DAOs, as hacks can erase billions in value overnight. Just ask Fei's token holders, who had to cover $80 million in the Rari exploit.

And sometimes the ""mergers"" aren't mergers at all: Yearn Finance’s advertised mergers with Yearn, PIckle, Cream, SushiSwap, and Akropolis were really a series of loose partnerships that generated significant confusion over governance and responsibilities.

With all that said, we believe that M&A can be a DAO superpower. That is, DAOs can feasibly execute M&As more efficiently and recognize more synergies than any traditional organization. Imagine standardized swap and acquisition contracts, platforms for M&A discovery, or protocol conglomerates that create richer, more integrated on-chain ecosystems.

Despite challenges, DAO M&A is here to stay. If anything, the increasing complexity of Web3 ecosystems makes consolidation inevitable. But, for future deals to succeed, DAOs must rethink how they approach M&A. Better governance alignment is crucial, as DAOs need structured frameworks to align stakeholder incentives and avoid the infighting that doomed Fei-Rari.

More thoughtful valuations are necessary since a token swap is not the same as a cash buyout; valuation models must account for token liquidity, governance power, and future earnings potential. Security must be a top priority, with rigorous smart contract audits and stress tests to prevent both catastrophic exploits. And DAOs must engage with these complex dynamics instead of hand-waving them away — and invest in the infrastructure and partnerships to execute them.

If DAOs can learn from these early experiments, M&A could become a critical tool for building resilient and scalable decentralized organizations.

But we’re not there yet. Merging DAOs isn’t just about putting two treasuries together. It’s about integrating communities, governance structures, and technical systems in ways that enhance — not undermine — the value of these organizations.

Here's what these bills actually do: the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act aim to create responsible guardrails for stablecoins, ensuring consumer protection and financial stability while encouraging innovation. Far from handing the keys to a single billionaire, they lay out clear standards so that no one — the world’s richest man or otherwise — can dominate payment infrastructure by sidestepping important safeguards.

At their core, stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a constant value—most commonly tied to the U.S. dollar and backed by a basket of reserves. However, the transparency and composition of an issuer’s dollar reserves may vary, which some regulatory proposals aim to clarify.

By definition, dollar-denominated stablecoins reinforce the dollar’s role in the global economy rather than undermining it. Contrary to the claim that these bills would allow one person to “print money,” the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act are chiefly about setting minimum reserve, auditing, and licensing standards for stablecoin issuers. The fundamental idea is to ensure transparent, fully backed stablecoins under a clear regulatory regime, not to let a tech titan mint unbacked currency at will.

Stablecoins offer innovations the legacy financial system has long struggled to provide: efficient, low-cost transfers, potentially faster settlements, and ability to instantly execute transactions that can fuel new financial products. They can be sent globally in near-real time, lowering barriers and giving everyday users more autonomy over their money, whether that be for remittances or payments for everyday purchases.

The size of the global stablecoin ecosystem is notable and is forcing traditional financial entities into the market. The growth in transaction volumes is hard to ignore; they climbed to $710 billion in February, compared with $521 billion in the same month last year.

This future of finance is an upgrade over traditional infrastructure, which is dominated by large financial institutions that often dictate costs and limit options for smaller players. By replacing cumbersome, expensive intermediaries, stablecoins empower consumers to transact more directly, preserving their privacy and autonomy without sacrificing efficiency.

Stablecoins also bolster national security and support the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. The U.S. dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency provides significant geopolitical and economic advantages. With the rise of alternative financial systems, including foreign-issued digital assets, the United States must ensure that emerging technologies remain dollar-denominated.

If innovators cannot operate within the U.S. under clear rules, they may turn to foreign jurisdictions, effectively weakening the dollar’s role. Encouraging stablecoin issuers to hold traditional U.S. treasuries as backing — rather than synthetic or foreign-issued substitutes — helps maintain steady demand for U.S. debt instruments and keeps the dollar anchored at the heart of global finance.

At the same time, other countries are exploring strategies to reassert the dollar in ways that loop out American influence — so-called “de-dollarization” plans where foreign governments structure their trades and bonds in dollar equivalents without the traditional oversight or support of U.S. institutions.

If we do not modernize our own financial infrastructure, we risk losing control over the direction of dollar-based innovation. Providing a predictable regulatory framework for stablecoins helps encourage developers and businesses to keep building on U.S. soil, ensuring that America remains at the forefront of this next wave of finance.

Both the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act propose guardrails to ensure stablecoin issuers meet baseline requirements for consumer protection and operational soundness. While each may have its strengths and weaknesses, they reflect a growing effort in Congress to produce thoughtful, bipartisan legislation.

Such legislation would reduce uncertainty, spur responsible innovation, and promote healthy competition in the digital asset marketplace. By clarifying legal obligations around reserve composition, auditing, and anti-money laundering practices, these bills aim to foster an environment where stablecoins can thrive under proper oversight — protecting consumers, upholding financial stability, and supporting national security interests.

Elon Musk’s interest in digital payments, as with any ambitious project, highlights the larger trend: private sector initiatives are moving rapidly, sometimes outpacing existing laws. Establishing solid regulatory foundations for stablecoins is the first step in ensuring that emerging ventures — whether they come from tech entrepreneurs or established financial giants—must operate within rules that protect the public and preserve vital U.S. interests.

Proper legislation isn’t about letting a billionaire corner the market. It’s about providing certainty and accountability so that when a product like “X Money” or another innovative payment system inevitably comes along, it must meet rigorous standards for consumer protection and financial stability.

The future of money is poised to be more digital, transparent, and open. By embracing stablecoin legislation, Congress can strengthen the role of the U.S. dollar, foster innovation at home, and ensure that our financial system remains safe, secure, and competitive. That outcome serves everyday consumers, fortifies national security, and preserves America’s economic leadership in a rapidly evolving world.

This dystopian future sounds outrageous but it’s the logical endpoint of a fully government-controlled and monitored monetary system for which some prominent U.S. policymakers advocate. Its defenders argue that such a government-omniscient system would prevent crime. In reality, it would destroy the core freedoms of financial privacy and autonomy. Stablecoins are an existing alternative to this dystopia. They are both a major financial innovation, and a bulwark against creeping financial authoritarianism. The U.S. Congress must support this technology as the Senate Banking Committee weighs legislation to provide clarity for the industry and its customers.

Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to the value of traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, provide the benefits of cryptocurrency — fast, inexpensive, borderless, and programmable transactions — without the price volatility of assets like Bitcoin. They are typically backed 1:1 with U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents, providing stability and trust. Their programmability allows transactions to be executed automatically when specified conditions are met, unlocking enormous potential for automated finance, supply chain efficiency, and global commerce.

Senators across the U.S. political spectrum, who understand the technology’s current use cases and the vast future possibilities we can’t yet fully envision, have proposed thoughtful legislation to guide regulations that will foster innovation while protecting consumers. This collaborative approach reflects an understanding that stablecoins could revolutionize global finance, enhance financial inclusion, and preserve the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the digital age.

Unfortunately, some senators, especially Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), stand in stark opposition to this progress. Rather than embracing innovation, she pursues legislation that would smother stablecoins in their infancy. Senator Warren paints stablecoins as tools for illicit activity, claiming they primarily facilitate fraud, drug trafficking, and terrorist financing. Her characterization is not just inaccurate — it’s dangerously misleading.

The data directly contradicts Senator Warren’s claims. Multiple reports from blockchain analytics firms consistently show that illicit activity represents a tiny fraction of stablecoin transactions — often less than 1% of total volume. In fact, traditional cash is far more frequently used for money laundering and illicit trade than stablecoins ever have been. Blockchain technology, with its permanent and transparent ledger, actually makes illegal activity easier to track and prosecute than cash-based crime.

Senator Warren’s misinformed worldview leads her to advocate for a closed, government-monitored financial system — one in which every transaction is scrutinized, private financial activity becomes impossible, and access to financial tools is tightly controlled. In addition to being a morally objectionable invasion of privacy, her design would be operationally impossible to implement.

It would also weaken the dollar’s global dominance, as emerging economies and developing nations would turn to other digital currencies that are easier to access and use. Her constraints could not only impede the development of an important new technology, but also disrupt and harm ordinary Americans and businesses, and people around the world, who are using stablecoins today to move value across the internet as easily as sending an email or text message, often at a fraction of traditional costs. For example:

Major American corporations like Visa and PayPal are using stablecoins to settle some cross-border payments, reducing settlement times from days to minutes and lowering costs.

By making dollars the default currency of the digital economy, stablecoins reinforce the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency.

Increased global demand for dollar-denominated stablecoins increases demand for U.S. dollars and treasury securities, helping finance government borrowing at lower rates.

In countries suffering from high inflation or capital controls, stablecoins provide ordinary citizens with a safe, dollar-denominated savings option, protecting their wealth from economic mismanagement.

Migrant workers sending money home can do so more quickly, inexpensively, and more reliably with stablecoins than through traditional remittance services, which often charge exorbitant fees.

The Warren vision rejects the open, public, universally accessible system being developed today — a system where individuals and businesses alike can transact freely, without needing permission from banks or governments. Fortunately, there is still hope for a balanced regulatory approach.

Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Tim Scott (R-SC) have introduced the bi-partisan GENIUS Act which would create a constructive regulatory framework for stablecoins that addresses legitimate concerns while enabling innovation. The GENIUS Act, and the White House Executive Order on Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology, will both ensure that the benefits of blockchain technology can be fully realized on open, freely accessible and transparent public blockchains.

Congress must embrace stablecoins, not fear them. The future of money is being written today. Will the United States lead this transformation, ensuring that digital dollars remain the global standard? Or will fear, misinformation, and stifling regulation hand the future of finance to other nations? The choice is clear: support innovation, enact smart regulation, and let stablecoins flourish.",coindesk

The Bitcoin network is ""evolving into a broader decentralized finance ecosystem with the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi,"" analyst Moulik Nagesh wrote.

This is a sector that ""unlocks bitcoin's capital efficiency"" with the use of financial applications focused on lending, staking, stablecoins and decentralized exchanges (DEX's), the report said.

DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without the need for traditional intermediaries.

Binance noted that only ~0.8% of the bitcoin supply is currently being used in DeFi, and this presents a large ""untapped opportunity."" In fact, last year, Julian Love, a deal analyst at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, said the opportunity could be as much as $1 trillion.

Binance Research report said that Bitcoin needs layer 2s as the network lacks ""native programmability,"" unlike smart contract-based layer 1s. A layer 1 network is the base layer or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.

While there has been some progress on the development of Bitcoin layer-2 networks, these platforms need greater adoption and liquidity incentives to be able to scale up effectively, Binance Research said.

The network's security model is faced with ""long-term sustainability challenges"" as block rewards will continue to halve, the report said, thereby reducing miner incentives.

The long-term viability of Bitcoin DeFi is dependent on execution, the further development of layer-2s, and the ""ability to align with bitcoin's unique value proposition,"" the report added.

""A new testnet, Hooli, is going live Monday to wrap up Pectra testing,"" said Tim Beiko, who coordinates the ecosystem's core developers at the Ethereum Foundation, in an X post following a developer call on Thursday. Pectra will be tested on Hooli on Wednesday, March 26 — when the test chain will be upgraded to the new version of Ethereum and evaluated for performance and stability.

Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

Pectra includes several code changes designed to make Ethereum faster, more efficient, and more user-friendly for both users and developers. One of the most significant improvements adds ""smart contract"" functionality to addresses, allowing user wallets to be programmed with new features, such as the ability to pay transaction fees in currencies other than ETH.

If the Hooli test succeeds, Beiko said developers will launch the upgrade after approximately 30 days, subject to further testing. Should everything proceed as planned, Ethereum users can expect Pectra to reach the ecosystem's main network in late April or early May.

The Hooli testnet was created following complications with Pectra tests on Sepolia and Holesky, Ethereum's primary test networks. In both instances, configuration errors prevented proper testing of the Pectra upgrade. In Holesky's case, the network was offline for multiple weeks due to the flawed test issues.

Test networks like Holesky, Sepolia, and Hooli function almost identically to the main Ethereum network but are generally free to use and not intended to support real value. Major upgrades like Pectra are typically implemented on Ethereum's test networks before full deployment on the mainnet, as any disruptions on the actual Ethereum network could be extremely costly.

According to Beiko, Sepolia and Holesky — which are now running Pectra successfully — serve different testing purposes. ""If you need to test validator exits, be on the lookout for [Hooli]! Everything else can be tested on Sepolia & Holesky,"" Beiko stated in his Thursday post on X.

Pectra's technical setbacks come during a challenging period for Ethereum. The network has faced mounting pressure from declining ETH prices, leadership transitions at the Ethereum Foundation, and growing skepticism about its ability to maintain market dominance amid competition from newer blockchains like Solana. Industry figures view the successful implementation of Pectra as crucial for restoring confidence in Ethereum's technical roadmap.",coindesk

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

The charges stemmed from an initial coin offering Andrade conducted for AML Bitcoin in 2017 and 2018. Early court filings covered by CoinDesk alleged Andrade, a Texas resident, falsely told investors that AML Bitcoin tokens would ultimately be converted into a tradeable AML Bitcoin currency — a cryptocurrency that never launched and was named to resemble the popular Bitcoin token.

The conviction marks the conclusion of one of the first and longest-running crypto ""pump-and-dump"" cases to involve U.S. federal prosecutors.

The Department of Justice named famed D.C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff a co-conspirator and he pleaded guilty in 2020, paying more than $50,000 in disgorgement and interest. Abramoff is better known for his involvement in a federal corruption scandal that resulted in his imprisonment and was depicted in the film ""Casino Jack.""

A statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice accused Andrade of diverting ""more than $2 million in proceeds from the sale of AML Bitcoin"" and using it on ""personal expenses, including the purchase of two properties in Texas and two luxury automobiles.""

According to the statement, Andrade also falsely claimed that the Panama Canal Authority was close to permitting AML Bitcoin to be used for ships passing through the Panama Canal when no such agreement existed.

""Fraudsters often tout new and innovative technology in order to raise money from investors. But raising money through lies and misrepresentations is neither new nor innovative. It's unlawful, plain and simple,"" said Acting United States Attorney Patrick D. Robbins. ""If you deceive investors to enrich yourself and spend their money on personal expenses, homes, and property, you will be held to account.""

Andrade is scheduled to be sentenced in July. According to the DOJ press release, ""he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the wire fraud count and 10 years in prison for the money laundering count, and forfeiture of all property that is traceable to his wire fraud and money laundering violations including property that Andrade bought in Texas.""",coindesk

Whitehouse-Levine, a fixture in U.S. crypto circles, will remain on the organization's board, according to a Thursday announcement, and a person familiar with his plans said he'll be taking a not-yet-announced role that keeps him in the industry lobbying space.

The DeFi corner of the digital assets sector saw a major win in recent days as Congress has been moving toward the elimination of a recent Biden administration rule from the Internal Revenue Service that would have imposed potentially ruinous compliance demands on DeFi projects.

""For the first time in DeFi’s history, there is a significant, bipartisan group of U.S. policymakers and regulators thinking proactively and constructively about sensible crypto legislation, regulatory frameworks, and the way they fit with technological innovation, and our mission at DeFi Education Fund has never been more important,” Tuminelli said in a statement.

Многие демократы в комитете признали необходимость законопроекта, одновременно пытаясь внести ряд поправок для введения дополнительных мер регулирования и ограничений, каждая из которых была отклонена партийными голосами.

Сенатор Элизабет Уоррен, высокопоставленный демократ в комиссии, возглавила возражения своих коллег против некоторых положений законопроекта, которые, по ее словам, в его нынешнем виде знаменуют собой «явную угрозу нашей национальной безопасности». Уоррен все больше расстраивалась в ходе 2,5-часовых слушаний, поскольку каждая из ее предложенных поправок к законопроекту отклонялась.

«Было бы безумием продвигать этот законопроект, когда в нем так много дыр, на которые уже указали, и продвигать его именно в тот момент, когда появляются новости о том, что Дональд Трамп пытается создать свой собственный стейблкоин с организацией, которая печально известна нарушением закона», — заявила Уоррен NEAR к концу слушаний, имея в виду сообщение о том, что связанная с Трампом World Liberty Financial вела переговоры с Криптo биржей Binance. «Проталкивать это, пока Дональд Трамп там, заключая сделку с преступной платформой стейблкоинов, не имеет смысла. Мы пожалеем об этом».

Другой демократ, Кэтрин Кортес Масто из Невады, пожаловалась, что республиканцы комитета проигнорировали дебаты во время разметки — типа слушаний, призванных рассматривать и обсуждать поправки к законопроекту, — и некоторые из них T явились на слушания.

«Это отличное начало, но оно еще не готово к PRIME распространению», — сказал сенатор о законопроекте, продвигаемом республиканцами.

«Наценки — это беспорядочно», — сказал в ответ председатель комиссии Тим Скотт, республиканец из Южной Каролины. «Мы работали ночами, днями, выходными, чтобы добиться этого».

Сенатор Билл Хагерти, республиканец из Теннесси, который был основным автором законопроекта, назвал Закон о руководстве и установлении национальных инноваций для стейблкоинов США (Закон GENIUS) «по-настоящему двухпартийным усилием», в котором приняли участие демократы. Демократы Кирстен Джиллибранд из Нью-Йорка и Анджела Олсбрукс из Мэриленда?выступил соавтором законопроекта вместе с рядом коллег Хагерти по партии республиканцев.

«Он представляет собой правила здравого смысла, которые защищают потребителей, способствуют конкуренции и стимулируют инновации», — сказал Хагерти. «Пришло время обеспечить ясность и стабильность, в которых так отчаянно нуждается наша страна и ее новаторы».

預防失智不只要攝取健腦食材，懂得從源頭避開不必要的毒素也很重要！日本抗老與失智症專家白澤卓二分享，當日常飲食吃下肚的東西，容易誘發慢性發炎與神經退化，久而久之就可能發現腦力變得不靈光，所以選擇食物時更需要謹慎，尤其有兩類食物明明是很常見的早餐品項，卻是他多年來忌口的地雷！早餐喜歡吃麵包嗎？白澤卓二早在10多年前就完全不吃麵包，他經營的高齡養護機構，則全面採用「無麩飲食」。他解釋，小麥當中所含的麩質，無法完全被人體腸道消化吸收，對體質敏感、或是有自體免疫問題的人來說，麩質可能被誤認為敵人，誘發全身慢性發炎。美國研究顯示，約有5％的人對麩質敏感，但白澤卓二在臨床觀察中也發現，麩質過敏的人比想像中更多，因為他約有一半的患者都檢測出麩質抗體，代表持續攝取麩質食品時，身體會視為有害物質發動攻擊，長期下來引起全身性慢性發炎，可能導致腸道粘膜受損，降低消化吸收能力，不單單是脹氣腹瀉等症狀，甚至影響大腦認知功能，還可能有慢性疲勞或關節疼痛等毛病發生。白澤卓二建議，如果懷疑自己對麩質敏感，不妨用一段時間試試無麩質飲食，觀察身體狀況變化，或是藉由過敏原檢測進一步掌握身體狀況。除了擔心對麩質敏感的問題，超加工食品同樣是影響腦部健康的隱形殺手，因此也是白澤卓二的拒絕往來戶！一篇發表於《JAMA Internal Medicine》的研究發現，超加工食品的消費量與死亡風險有所關聯。另一篇刊登在《JAMA Neurology》的研究也顯示，超加工食品攝取量較高的人，整體認知功能及執行功能都衰退比較快，可能提高失智風險。",yahoo

https://finance.yahoo.com,12 features that make the Kia Sorento a stylish family SUV with great tech,https://news.yahoo.com/autos/12-features-kia-sorento-stylish-190742406.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:07:42 GMT","A Kia Sorento X-Line SX Prestige 2.5T AWD in jungle green. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider

The Kia Sorento is a smaller midsize family SUV that comes standard with a third row.

I recently drove a fully loaded Sorento in X-Line SX Prestige trim.

I was impressed by the Sorento's peppy driving dynamics, rugged styling, and well-executed tech.

I recently tested a fully loaded Kia Sorento and was impressed by the family SUV's peppy driving, rugged looks and suite of tech features.

The smaller midsize splits the difference between compact crossovers like the Honda CR-V and larger, three-row midsize SUVs like its bigger brother, the Kia Telluride.

The 2025 Sorento starts at $31,990 and is pretty much unchanged from previous years. The most significant update is the use of black instead of silver badging on X-Line trim models.

With fees, my Georgia-made X-Line SX-Prestige test car came out to $48,285.

12 features jumped out to me that helped make the Sorento a great family SUV that's practical, fun to drive, and packed with cool tech.

Hybrid and ICE engine options

Most vehicles offer consumers one or two engine options. The Sorento has four different powertrains, including a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid.

My high-end test car was powered by a 281 horsepower turbocharged engine with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. More value-minded buyers can opt for the entry model's 191 horsepower, naturally aspirated four-cylinder.

The Sorento can also be had as a hybrid with 227 horsepower and as a plug-in hybrid with 261 horsepower and 31 miles of electric range.

My all-wheel-drive, turbocharged test car boasts EPA fuel economy figures of 20 mpg city, 27 mpg highway, and 23 mpg combined, which is pretty standard in this part of the market.

Rugged styling

The Sorento's revised front end, with its squared edges, vertical LED headlights, and rectangular grille, looks bold and rugged. It draws heavily from the brand's flagship Telluride SUV.

Fun to drive

The Sorento's punchy turbocharged engine really shines. Kia's 2.5-liter turbocharged engine and eight-speed DCT combine to make the Sorento surprisingly peppy. Power delivery felt immediate, consistent, and pretty smooth for a turbocharged four-cylinder.

The SUV's responsive steering makes it one of the better-handling midsize SUVs I've driven.

According to Kia, my 4,250-pound test car could accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in 7.5 seconds with a top speed of 131 miles per hour.

Sage green leather interior

The sage green leather upholstery in my test car looked great and was a happy break from the traditional black, white, and tan interiors found in my vehicles.

The heated and ventilated power front seats are not only incredibly comfortable, but their quilted design also adds an extra dash of flair to the cabin.

Great infotainment system

Every carmaker has an infotainment system, but few do it well. I find the latest Hyundai/Kia system in the Sorento to be among those few. The system is responsive, easy to navigate, and comes packed with helpful features like built-in vehicle diagnostics and a 360-camera system.

All Sorentos also come with standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.

Blind spot view monitor

The blindspot view monitor system debuted a few years ago and has been unique to high-end Hyundai and Kia models. The system, which uses side mirror-mounted cameras, activates when the turn signal is used and proved to be a helpful feature

Seatback USB sockets

Most SUVs' second-row power sockets are usually placed low down on the center console facing the rear passenger. The Sorento's USB-C sockets are on the inside of its front seatbacks. This smart design, also found on a couple of other recent Hyundai/Kia SUVs, makes the USB-C sockets easily accessible to both front and rear seat passengers.

Digital rearview mirror

Although digital rearview mirrors are not as rare as they once were, they are still fairly uncommon. The feature is especially useful in family SUVs like the Sorento, as it gives the driver an unobstructed view even when the cabin is packed with cargo and passengers.

Voice memo

I've encountered the voice memo feature on several recent Hyundai/Kia models. It's offbeat and not something I'd necessarily use, but I can certainly see it coming in handy if inspiration strikes while stuck in traffic.

Standard third row

The Sorento's standard third row isn't terribly spacious. In fact, it offers roughly the same legroom as a coach seat on a low-cost airline. However, its mere presence in a smaller, lower-priced midsize SUV and the flexibility it affords owners make it a standout feature.

Smart handsfree liftgate

There are various smart, hands-free power liftgates on the market, but Hyundai/Kia's system is one of the easiest to use. You don't have to kick or swing your leg under the rear bumper. All you have to do is stand two to three feet behind the Sorento while possessing the key fob. After three seconds, the vehicle will beep, and the rear liftgate will automatically open.

Center-locking differential

As with most crossover SUVs, the Sorento's all-wheel-drive system drives the front wheels most of the time and only sends power outback when it needs additional traction. When road conditions are really bad, the Sorento comes with a center-locking differential, activated by pushing a button on the center console, that ensures power is split evenly between the front and rear wheels.

https://finance.yahoo.com,NHRA’s Most Popular Classes: Pro-Stock,https://autos.yahoo.com/nhra-most-popular-classes-pro-180000712.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 20:15:39 GMT","⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious

This intense class has been a fan favorite for decades after over 51 years in the NHRA.

The NHRA is an iconic association because of its dedication to bringing the American automotive enthusiast community a place to play around with their favorite pastime. With a great emphasis on ensuring that everyone could have fun with their vehicles in a safe and fast environment, the racing brand separated its racers into classes based on a specific set of rules and seed requirements. This decision was very similar to other sports leagues that separate players based on weight class to allow a more fair game. One such class within the NHRA is the famous Pro-stock class which has seen some of the craziest cars ever on the tracks of America.

Starting with the 1970 NHRA Winternationals in Pomona, Ca. This race would be the first Pro-stock race ever to be featured in the NHRA series and would lead to an American automotive revolution as people began to see what they could do with their favorite muscle and sports cars from the 1960s and '70s. Regularly you could see quarter-mile times as low as 9-seconds due to the heavy emphasis on modifying and tuning up the crazy vehicles to their full potential. However, now and then, you might find yourself watching some of the world's most incredible automotive feats, such as in 1984 when Sammy Miller set an insane record of 3.58 seconds on the quarter-mile.

Crazy drivers such as Bill Jenkins, Ronnie Sox, Dick Landy, and Sammy Miller brought Pro-stock drag racing into the eye of the public, and the legends of these ridiculous racers still stand firm to this day. Many have tried and failed to beat records set around that time, and pro-stock racing is still one of the most popular types of drag racing because of its ability to combine the stock, more like stock-adjacent, style with tons of power and extremely low quarter-mile times. Nowadays, this class is still alive and thriving, with tons of racers competing to be the best in their class.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Drop Everything and Watch the Full-Length Trailer For Brad Pitt's F1 Movie,https://autos.yahoo.com/watch-full-length-trailer-brad-200700266.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 20:07:00 GMT","The first trailer for F1, the new feature film about a fictional Formula 1 team starring Brad Pitt, has finally landed online. Unlike previous teasers that focused on how F1 will communicate the sights and sounds of auto racing, this one is all about the movie itself.

As expected, the film seems to be focused mostly on Pitt's character, Sonny Hayes. Pitt, who is 18 years older than the oldest driver currently in Formula 1, plays a driver who comes back to F1 to support a team run by Javier Bardem's Ruben Cervantes. He is joined at the team by Damson Idris' character Joshua Pearce, a young driver who should be filling the roles of both mentee and rival at different points in the movie.

As it so happens, that plot summary sure sounds a lot to us like the plot of Sylvester Stallone's maligned CART movie Driven. The good news is that Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kucinski is directing F1, and production on the project features a similar level of on-location filming with real machinery. The movie filmed at multiple F1 events in the 2023 and 2024 seasons, starting with the 2023 British Grand Prix and ending with the season finale at Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina Circuit in 2024. A modified Formula 2 car was used for filming, complete with unique bodywork that made the car look like an original F1 design for the 2022 through 2025 seasons.

If the trailer looks up your alley, you shouldn't have to wait long to actually see the movie. F1 is scheduled to release in American theaters on June 25th.

Gene Winfield, Hotrod Pioneer, Designer Of Movie And TV Cars, Dies At 97

Gene Winfield, a movie and TV car designer many revere for pioneering hotrod and lowrider methods used by many builders today, died recently at the age of 97. Among the productions Winfield worked on are notable entries like Blade Runner, RoboCop, and even the original Star Trek television series.

Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton inserts himself into a famous movie scene.

Winfield was also a celebrated hotrod builder, something which is common among the old school movie/TV car builder crowd. In fact, he’s recognized as one of the pioneers of hotrod and lowrider culture. That’s why some have referred to him as “the King of Customs.”

At least until right before the very end, Winfield was still building cars and going to events, socializing with other gearheads. The man loved speed and performance, he himself barely slowly down even in his elderly years.

Born in Springfield, Missouri, Winfield grew up during the Great Depression as the youngest of six children. Seeking greater economic prosperity, his family moved to Modesto, California

An enterprising youth, he opened his first automotive shop at the ripe age of 15. Shortly after, he bought a 1928 Ford Model A coupe. After joining the Navy at the end of World War II, Gene returned home and got into the hotrod scene, chopping his brother’s ’41 Plymouth convertible.

It didn’t take the man long to build a huge reputation. With that came Hollywood studios wanting him to use his creativity and fabrication skills to build custom vehicles for television shows and movies. That was how his work reached a more mainstream audience and will continue living on in those beloved productions.

Back on February 27, Winfield’s Custom Shop posted on Instagram about his declining health, revealing his wishes that his museum remain intact instead of the different cars being sold off for big money. He passed away on March 4.

For one race, anyway.

The 47-year-old Mears, who last raced in the NASCAR Cup Series at the 2019 Daytona 500, is entered in the upcoming Cook Out 400 at Martinsville Speedway on March 30. Mears will be racing the No. 66 HitchGo Ford Mustang Dark Horse for the Statesville, N.C.-based Garage 66 race team.

Garage 66 is co-owned by former Cup Series driver Carl Long.

The one-race deal will be Mears' 490th start in the series. Mears was a full-timer in Cup from 2003 through 2016. His best season was 2007 while racing for Hendrick Motorsports. That year, Mears notched his only career Cup win, that coming at the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, and had 10 top-10 finishes in 36 races and scored a pole at Chicagoland.

“I’m happy to be back in a race car and look forward to returning to Martinsville, one of my favorite tracks,” Mears said. “I appreciate Carl working with me to make it happen; he’s a well respected, great guy who’s worked hard to experience longevity in the sport. I’m excited to have HitchGO, Mosby’s Towing and Transport, and Coble Enterprises on board as we chip away at 500 NASCAR Cup Series starts.”

Mears is not giving up on reaching the 500-start milestone. Only five active drivers have reached that milestone: Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin, Joey Logano, Brad Keselowski and Michael McDowell.",yahoo
https://finance.yahoo.com,"How To Pick Up A Motorcycle, Even A Heavy One",https://autos.yahoo.com/pick-motorcycle-even-heavy-one-192500160.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:25:00 GMT","Well, you buffed it. You dropped your bike. It's okay, it happens to the best of us — and also to me, a woman who drops her bikes during such complex maneuvers as ""getting cut off by a bicycle"" or ""turning from a stop."" In fact, I dropped my old 500-pound BMW GS with its 10.5 inches of ground clearance enough times to really nail down the technique of picking it back up without grievously injuring my back. Today, you get to heed the wisdom of all my attempts.

I mention my old GS's ground clearance because, contrary to what you might expect, that matters more than the weight of your motorcycle when you go to pick it up. Think about it like a lever — the bike's weight is acting on a distance from the point around which you're trying to roll it. A taller bike is harder to pick up than a lower one, and a tall heavy bike — like an ADV — is just about the worst thing to pick up. So if all 137 pounds of me can lift a 500-pound GS, you can too. Here's how.

Back To The Bike

A woman lifts a motorcycle - The Girl On A Bike/YouTube

Crouch down with your back against the seat of your bike. Tilt your handlebars all the way inward — to the left if you're on the left side or to the right if you're on the right — and grab the bars with one hand. With the other, find some purchase on the rear of the bike. Luggage racks are great for this, but bodywork can do the job in a pinch. You'll end up positioned like the picture above, crouched next to your bike.

Keep your back as upright as possible and lift with your legs until you feel the bike's weight shift from its side to its wheels. This will happen when the rear wheel meets ground, since the front will almost always have touched down when you turned the bars. That's just a little tilt, though, compared to the next step: Standing up and stepping backwards to push the bike up using your thigh muscles.

Quicker Is Easier

A woman lifts a motorcycle - The Girl On A Bike/YouTube

It's easier to lift a bike than to hold one up, so your motion once the bike's weight is resting on its wheels should be a single, fluid one. Don't try to throw the bike up in an instant but don't tire yourself out by making the process last longer than it needs to. Back to the bike, turn the bars, grab hold, lift to the wheels, then one fell swoop to get the bike upright.

If you're lucky enough to have dropped the bike on its right side, opposite the kickstand, dropping that before lifting the bike can help make sure you don't overshoot. If not, don't worry — you'll feel the bike getting lighter as more of its weight settles onto its wheels, and you can start to taper off your effort, so you don't go too far. I've used this method to pick up that old GS immediately after running myself ragged at the climbing gym, and I can confirm that it spares you the worst of the soreness that you'd get from other lifting methods. Getting your back into the scoop of the seat, as close to the bike's center of mass as possible, is like doing deadlifts with a hex bar. It shifts effort from your lower back muscles to your quads.

Proper technique makes all the difference in the world when lifting a bike, and a technique that works on tall, heavy ADVs should work on anything. Just keep your body close to the center of the bike, your back straight, and your movements smooth. You'll be back on your ride before you know it.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Man Is Restoring Modern Shelby GT350R Wearing Expensive Modifications,https://autos.yahoo.com/man-restoring-modern-shelby-gt350r-221406695.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:00:14 GMT","⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious

Not everyone is going to agree this is a good move, but to each their own.

A lot of people love the modern Shelby GT350Rwith its flat plane-crank Voodoo V8 engine, which sounds just unearthly, carbon-fiber wheels, etc. It’s a true track toy with few comforts, although it’s not nearly as stripped-down as the original. Also, this modern muscle car is a hot collector’s item, so a lot of people buy these and keep them absolutely perfect in hopes of making a ton of money. That’s why it’s shocking to see someone yanked off factory parts from a GT350R and installed aftermarket mods. Don’t worry, though, because Samcrac is restoring everything to factory spec

You might not believe this, but now has been the best time ever to buy a Shelby GT350 since the cars launched. As Samcrac explains, the launch of the C8 Corvette and Shelby GT500 have stolen the spotlight. Some people are even dumping their old Shelby to get one of those new cars.

Advertisement Advertisement

However, the GT350Rs are far rarer, thanks to Ford seriously limiting production. You’d hope the higher price and exclusive nature would prevent people from ruining such a track-focused vehicle, but then if you see what happens to Lamborghinis you’d know better.

The previous owner slapped about $15,000 of modifications on this Shelby GT350R with the aim of improving track performance. Samcrac said that devalued the car so much it was worth the same as a regular GT350 on the market. Yikes.

If you don’t want to do the math, that’s about a $20,000 drop in value. However, the guy who owned it actually took the car to the track, unlike collectors who have a track-ready car with 120 miles on it and have never dared do one burnout. So which is worse?

Topping the list as the most expensive mod for the Shelby are AP Racing lightweight brake calipers and rotors for the front. The setup drops 29 pounds of unsprung weight, which is incredible, but the $4,400 price tag is hard for a lot of people to stomach.

Thankfully, the previous owner was smart and kept all the OE parts he removed, because that’s a good idea. The second owner might really thank you for doing so, plus it’s a good selling point if you don’t want to remove the modifications before listing it for sale.

What do you think about this Shelby GT350R and its modifications? Should a car like this be kept stock for resale value or modded and tracked for the fun of it? Sound off below.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Ford Mustang GTD Buyer Reveals the Options on the Secret Car Configurator,https://autos.yahoo.com/ford-mustang-gtd-buyer-reveals-190000734.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:00:00 GMT","Unfortunately for the supercar configurator enthusiasts among us, Ford does not have a public means of speccing out its supercar-fighting Mustang GTD online. The brand has chosen to restrict that tool only to buyers approved by its own selection process, which is as close to closed-doors as online configurators get. Fortunately, though, Ford seems to have no restrictions against future owners showing the public what that exclusive tool looks like.



One of those approved buyers, Manny Khoshbin, shared the configurator in a YouTube video uploaded last week. The clip reveals a few specifics about how Ford's ultimate supercharged Mustang will be built, including some of the option packages and a few of the visual customization selections available for GTD buyers.

The most notable option is the previously-announced Performance Package, which is headlined by the car's DRS-style active rear wing. The package also features a painted carbon fiber splitter and diffuser, plus lightweight half-shafts and the all-important lightweight carpeting.

Just six paint colors are available in the car's standard palette, but an optional paint-to-sample-style program allows significant customization. Two interior options, a primary black and a black-gray two tone, are available. An optional carbon package adds more exposed carbon fiber to the exterior, while an optional titanium package adds larger paddle shifters behind the steering wheel.

The Spirit of America and Carbon Series, two special edition GTD models already announced by Ford, are separate complete packages at the end of the configurator. Khoshbin says that the Spirit of America edition is limited to 20% of productionm and has already sold out for 2025.

Unlike many other configurators, Ford's GTD tool does not seem to show price changes added by specific packages and options. hat said, Ford enthusiast site Ford Authority reports that the two special editions, Spirit of America and Carbon Edition, are priced at a whopping $429,000 and $428,000, respectively. If options are an additional charge on top of that, the ultimate Mustang certainly does not come cheap. Then again, with a base price of $325,000, it's always been a long way off from the ranks of the best affordable sports cars where siblings like the Mustang Dark Horse play.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Trump Considers Using The Military To Take Over The Panama Canal,https://autos.yahoo.com/trump-considers-using-military-over-183318752.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:33:18 GMT","Donald Trump — the ""Everything's Computer"" President — is directing the U.S. military to come up with options for getting more troops to Panama so he can reach his goal of ""reclaiming"" the Panama Canal. I'd say we live in hell, but I fear this is far too stupid for the devil.

In any case, the U.S. Southern Command is apparently developing potential plans that vary from somewhat reasonable ideas like partnering more closely with the Panamanian military to less likely — more drastic — measures like sending U.S. troops to seize the Canal by force, according to NBC News. Something like that would be set in motion depending on how much the Panamanian military agrees to partner with the U.S. The real end goal is to diminish China's influence over the 50-mile-long canal.

Of course, both China and Panama say there isn't any interference in the canal, a waterway whose neutrality is actually enshrined in Panama's Constitution, NBC News says. Since Trump took office and started making all of the hubbub about the canal, China has hit back, accusing the U.S. of ""coercion"" to pressure Panamanian officials to block Chinese aid projects.

Now, Defense Secretary and party boy Pete Hegseth is set to visit Panama sometime in April. Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the Panamanian president that ""the status quo is unacceptable"" regarding China's presence in Panama, according to the Associated Press.

A Man, A Plan, A Canal, Panama

Trump's joint address to Congress - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images

During Trump's joint address to Congress, the Tesla salesman said he intends to return ownership of the canal to the U.S. after the South American country gained control of it decades ago under a treaty signed by the Carter administration. Privately, he has struck up a very serious tone about sending the military down there, as NBC News explains:

Trump has told his advisers that he sees a U.S. military presence in Panama and on the canal itself as critical to that effort, the U.S. officials said. Trump has also made it clear that he wants U.S. service members to be visible in the canal zone as a show of force. Trump administration officials have argued that China has too large a presence near the canal. In the event of a conflict, they say, Beijing could shut down the canal to American shipping, including military ships.

Right now, the U.S. military has over 200 troops in Panama, but that number fluctuates as troops cycle in an out. Some of them include Special Forces units who are working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats, insurgencies or unrest. Sounds like serious business.

What Comes Next For The Panama Canal

Here's some of what the U.S. might be planning for the canal, from NBC News:

Potential administration strategies include simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal, to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of the passageway, officials said. Other options under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, to build new ports in Panama or using the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal's locks, officials said. There are also discussions about opening Army Jungle Schools, or training camps, in Panama, like the ones U.S. troops trained in jungle warfare until the canal was formally handed over to Panama in 1999.

In any case, I feel like putting a lot of time and effort into who owns and operates the Panama Canal is something you do when you've got all of your other issues figured out. Critically, the U.S. and the Trump administration have a lot of other issues to deal with that are far more pressing than this waterway. I'm sure that no matter how this whole thing shakes out, the history books will look back on it and throw around the word ""fiasco"" rather liberally. Time will tell.

The Panama Canal In The News

Over the past few years, the Panama Canal has been dealing with a lot of news, and most of it hasn't been particularly great. Some of it is, of course, beyond anyone's control. In the past couple of years, the Canal has been dealing with climate change, just like the rest of us. Extreme drought has thrown the whole operation into jeopardy. In fact, back in August of 2023, we told you about a 154-ship traffic jam that clogged up the Panama Canal simply because the water wasn't deep enough for ships to pass through. This wasn't the only instance, either. A very similar event happened in January of last year, stranding over $270 billion in goods at the Canal. That's less than ideal.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Gas Prices Drop To Four Year Low,https://autos.yahoo.com/gas-prices-drop-four-low-183000101.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:30:00 GMT","Read the full story on The Auto Wire

Gas Prices Drop To Four Year Low

If you haven’t noticed lately, gas prices are low. In fact, they’re so low, we haven’t seen prices like this for four years. Considering how expensive it’s been to fill up tanks for the last four years, this kind of relief is very welcome. But there’s plenty of speculation about whether it will last.

What’s also low are Ford Mustang sales.

According to AAA, nationally the average price for a gallon of gas on March 13 is $3.079. While that’s only a penny cheaper than the day before and four cents cheaper than a week ago, exactly a year ago the average was $3.396.

If you live in California, you might be wondering where all the cheap prices are. The average in that state for a gallon is $4.74, making it yet again the most expensive market in the nation. Meanwhile, Mississippi is the cheapest at $2.64 a gallon.

According to a CNN report, the price of oil in West Texas Intermediate, sits at $66.71 which curiously is 11 percent cheaper than the day after President Trump was sworn into office for a second time.

It can take some time for gas prices to come down, but it appears the downward trend will continue as oil prices also tank. However, there are fears that if the price of oil dips below $60 a barrel, that might result in a cut in production, causing prices to start climbing again.

The price of diesel is also down with the national average sitting at $3.619 a gallon versus $4.039 a year ago. That’s great news for truckers and other commercial drivers.

But some fear tariffs could cause fuel prices to jump. Another concern is summer blend gasoline will trigger a slight increase in cost, which in turn will be passed on to consumers.

One of its wildest creations is the One-77, which was meant to show what the British brand could muster when it really put its mind to it.

When it premiered in 2009, the One-77 packed a roaring 7.3 liter V12 under the hood and awesome styling that took Aston's design language of the time to the extreme. Just 77 of the incredible cars were sold, each with a price tag of more than a million dollars.

Well, that's what Aston told its buyers at the time at least, as a 78th One-77 was sold to a buyer in America and it's one of the highest-mileage examples out there.

78 Out Of 77

The 78th One-77 started its life as a prototype car Aston Martin built for the development of its new monster. The car was displayed at the Goodwood Festival of Speed and ran on countless race-tracks around the world during development of the One-77, as CarBuzz reports. Once all 77 One-77s were sold, an Aston collector approached the brand about restoring the prototype, as the site explains:

Two years later, this One-77 had already covered 22,000 miles. It was even used as a safety car for the Aston Martin Racing Le Mans Festival. It caught fire between its stint as a safety car and 2017, but the damage wasn't severe. By 2017, chassis #10711 had clocked 23,835 miles, and around this time, Aston Martin accepted an offer to restore the car for a large sum.

The restoration was pretty extensive, and included the installation of a new grille, new diffuser, new wheels, headlights, taillights and the entire interior as overhauled and replaced. The mechanics of the One-77 were kept intact, however, and the engine and transmission were left ""undisturbed"" in the process.

$45,000 For An AC Pump

Because many of the parts on this car were left fresh from the factory, it's needed its fair share of work over the past few years. After roughly 25,000 miles on the odometer, the One-77 racked up a costly list of repairs, which were documented by High Mileage Reviews over on YouTube.

In a test drive of the One-77, the channel listed off the required repairs, which include a $45,000 bill to replace the air conditioning pump and a $10,000 windshield wiper motor replacement. The mirror controls have also gone and the motor that controls the pop-up sat nav also has issues, but there's no word on what it costs to fix those parts.

Despite the high repair costs, the current owner still drives their One-77, the channel reports. That's good to hear, as this One-77 covered more miles than the three other examples that are currently for sale around the world, so at least one owner is making the most of their 750hp monster.

This initiative, approved by an overwhelming majority of its membership, was executed with the assistance of Proof of Workforce, a nonprofit dedicated to helping unions adopt Bitcoin through education-based initiatives.

IATSE Local 728 said it has long championed service, strength, and solidarity, and its decision to invest in Bitcoin aligns with its mission to fight for financial security for its members. “Today, we make history as the first private-sector labor union in the country to put Bitcoin on our balance sheet and hold it in self-custody,” the union stated. The effort was led by IATSE Local 728 Treasurer Pascal Guillemard, former Executive Board Member Jason Lord, and current Board Member David Graves, in collaboration with Proof of Workforce founder Dom Bei.

“IATSE Local 728 has led the entertainment industry in safety, technology, and training since 1939. Our members have been the proof of work behind the greatest productions in history—now, we’re bringing that same innovation to finance,” stated the IATSE Local 728 Bitcoin Advisory Board. “As the first private-sector labor union in the country to put Bitcoin on its balance sheet and hold it in self-custody, we are taking a stand for financial security and labor empowerment.”

“This is about protecting the value of our members’ labor. Bitcoin isn’t just an asset, it’s the most secure, decentralized financial network in the world, immune to manipulation and inflation. While governments print money and financial institutions strip workers of their wages, we are taking control. This isn’t a gamble. It’s a strategy. We are learning, building, and leading,” the union continued.

Beyond its own membership, IATSE Local 728 sees this move as a catalyst for a broader transformation within the labor movement. “For too long, unions have played defense in a system rigged against workers. That ends now. With Bitcoin, we aren’t just negotiating contracts, we are securing economic freedom. We are setting the standard. We are taking action. We are proving that unions don’t just fight for today, they build for the future.”

In addition to holding bitcoin on the balance sheet, a standing committee will be established to explore ways Bitcoin can provide long-term security for IATSE 728 members and their families. The committee will also help integrate the union’s support into the Bitcoin network.

Proof of Workforce praised IATSE 728’s leadership in adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, stating, “At Proof of Workforce, we understand that within every organization, exists someone who has discovered the true potential of Bitcoin. Our mission is to provide that person with the tools to introduce education-based and responsible adoption to their organization. IATSE Local 728 is a representation of the Proof of Work behind some of the best entertainment in the world. Their members work incredibly hard in motion picture and television lighting, ensuring the highest standards in the industry. They now have begun to explore an innovative network, aligned with the values and proof of work exhibited by its members. It’s now Lights, Camera, Bitcoin!”

As the first private-sector union to integrate Bitcoin into its financial strategy, IATSE Local 728 is setting a precedent that could inspire other private-sector unions across the country to follow suit.

Singapore, Singapore, March 13th, 2025, Chainwire

Aethir, a provider of decentralized cloud gaming infrastructure, has been featured in a newly released case study by SuperScale, a global expert in gaming user acquisition. The study provides an in-depth analysis of how Aethir’s cloud streaming technology enhances user acquisition strategies for gaming studios, presenting a scalable alternative to traditional app store distribution.

Cloud Streaming as a Direct-to-Consumer Solution

Gaming studios often face high service fees when distributing games through commercial app stores, with some platforms taking up to 30% of a game’s revenue. Aethir’s decentralized cloud infrastructure enables studios to bypass these costs by utilizing web-based streaming, providing an independent publishing model designed to enhance user acquisition.

Key aspects of Aethir’s cloud streaming include:

Reduced Reliance on App Stores – Web-based streaming eliminates the need for app store downloads, allowing publishers to retain a greater share of revenue.

– Web-based streaming eliminates the need for app store downloads, allowing publishers to retain a greater share of revenue. Lower User Acquisition Costs – Instant play via social media or advertisements reduces friction in the user journey, improving conversion rates.

– Instant play via social media or advertisements reduces friction in the user journey, improving conversion rates. Expanded Device Accessibility – Games can be played on PCs, mobile devices, and smart TVs without hardware limitations.

– Games can be played on PCs, mobile devices, and smart TVs without hardware limitations. Alternative Monetization Models – Subscription-based access, direct microtransactions, and in-game purchases can be managed independently of third-party platform fees.

Insights from SuperScale’s Case Study

SuperScale conducted a two-phase analysis to assess Aethir’s impact on gaming user acquisition, focusing on conversion rates and return on ad spend (ROAS). The mobile game Tiny Tower was selected as the test subject.

Phase 1: Conversion Rate Analysis

SuperScale examined how different engagement methods—”Stream Now,” “Instant Play,” and “Download”—affected user acquisition metrics, particularly cost per install (CPI) and engagement rates.

Findings from Phase 1:

43% more players opted for instant play over direct downloads.

Click-through rates (CTR) increased by 35% compared to traditional download methods.

Singapore, Singapore, March 13th, 2025, Chainwire

Ourbit, one of the fastest-growing memecoin-focused exchanges of 2024, today announced the launch of Phase 3 of its $BITCH memecoin airdrop campaign. With Phase 1 continuing through March 31 and Phase 2 now completed, Ourbit is allocating 85% of the token’s 1 billion supply directly to community members through this multi-phase airdrop. This airdrop campaign coincides with Ourbit’s debut of the world’s first “SuperCEX,” a hybrid trading model that integrates DEX capabilities with centralized exchange functionality, poised to transcend the boundaries of CeFi and DeFi and reshape how crypto assets are traded.

Prophetic Listings Meets Degen DNA: The Memecoin SuperCEX

While traditional centralized exchanges have kept memecoins at arm’s length, Ourbit has consistently embraced them as a true cultural phenomena that drive expressions of community identity and crypto-native culture. The platform has established itself as a leading hub for memecoin trading because of its comprehensive selection of memecoin trading pairs, industry-leading memecoin liquidity, and its strategic approach – listing tokens like $SPX (up 96x), $VIRTUAL (up 56x), $KOMA (up 49x), and $ACT (up 46x) before their rise.

$BITCH: 85% to the Community, 100% to Degen Energy

From Ourbit’s perspective, memecoins are not simply speculative assets. With $BITCH, Ourbit is acknowledging the central role that memecoins play in onboarding new users to crypto and driving trading volume across the ecosystem. The $BITCH ticker represents the evolution of Ourbit’s beloved iconic “Queen” mascot – the fierce, commanding female figure who has become synonymous with the platform’s degen-first approach to crypto trading. While some centralized exchanges might remain detached observers of memecoin culture, Ourbit understands the unique psychology and motivations of degen traders.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-cnFxSQkhI]

With the total supply of $BITCH being 1 billion, Ourbit is distributing 85% of $BITCH total supply to the community, demonstrating its maximum degen energy. $BITCH represents more than just a token—it serves as a cultural symbol that acknowledges and engages the degen community, which has played a key role in Ourbit’s expansion. This strategic move further solidifies Ourbit’s ambition in forging a new breed of exchange, for the next generation of degen traders.

3-Phase Airdrop: The Ultimate Degen Reward System

The $BITCH airdrop mechanics retroactively reward Ourbit’s early users while incentivizing new user acquisition and high-frequency trading activity for its DEX platform:

Phase 1: February 26th – March 31st, 2025 (ACTIVE)

Retroactive airdrops for Ourbit’s early supporters and users

Existing Ourbit users can visit Ourbit’s dedicated airdrop page at www.ourbit.com/activity/airdrop to check for eligibility for Phase 1 airdrops

Phase 2: March 3rd – March 10th, 2025 (COMPLETED)

Invite & Earn – Users can complete daily tasks and invite others to sign up on Ourbit DEX to accumulate points, with $BITCH distribution determined based on the points earned.

Phase 3: March 13th, 12PM EST (March 14th, 4PM UTC) until all mystery boxes are distributed

Invite & Trade – Mystery box fragments can be obtained through Futures trading, DEX trading, or inviting others to join. These fragments can be used to open mystery boxes, which may contain $BITCH rewards.

Crypto enthusiasts and traders interested in participating in the $BITCH Airdrop Phase 3 can visit www.ourbit.com/activity/airdrop to register for Ourbit’s DEX platform

Redefining Centralized Exchange (CEX) Architecture

Ourbit isn’t stopping with the memecoin launch. The siloed nature of CeFi and DeFi has been a significant barrier to mainstream adoption. Today’s traders shouldn’t have to choose between the speed of centralized platforms and the sovereignty of decentralized protocols. Ourbit has engineered a solution to one of crypto’s most persistent pain points. Its SuperCEX hybrid model is the industry’s first true integration of decentralized exchange (DEX) capabilities into a centralized platform. Ourbit has created the ultimate hassle-free trading experience where it handles all the complexity, so users can focus solely on capitalizing on opportunities.

SuperCEX: Trading Everything On One App

Ourbit’s SuperCEX delivers seamless access to both on-chain and off-chain assets through a single interface, fundamentally transforming how traders discover and access new assets:

No more juggling multiple wallets, exchanges, or Telegram trading bots

AI-curated trading feed for high-potential on-chain asset discovery

Real-time data and smart money tracking

*Currently, Ourbit’s DEX product is in the beta testing phase and only the website version is available, users can expect more upgrades and the app version to be on the way.

With Ourbit – The Future of Trading Is Hybrid

Ourbit is launching more than just a token and a new feature. By combining the $BITCH memecoin with the SuperCEX model, Ourbit creates a practical solution for traders who want access to all types of crypto opportunities in one place. The SuperCEX approach breaks down the walls between centralized and decentralized systems, giving traders what they actually need: maximum degen trading potential unlocked with institutional-grade trading tools.

About OURBIT

Ourbit is the world’s 1st SuperCEX integrating CEX and DEX in one platform, allowing users to trade all on-chain and off-chain assets in just one app. Ourbit delivers the most comprehensive memecoin trading pairs, industry-leading memecoin liquidity, and prophetic listing strategy with a proven track record of identifying explosive gems before other exchanges ($SPX 96X, $VIRTUAL 56X, $KOMA 49X since listed on Ourbit). Founded by ex-founding teams of top-tier exchanges with authentic roots in memecoin ecosystems, Ourbit has earned official endorsements from memecoin projects such as Retardio, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu and more. With its $BITCH memecoin launch in 2025 Q1, Ourbit SuperCEX combines institutional expertise with degen DNA to empower traders in pursuit of “meme-ionaire” dreams.

New York City, New York, March 13th, 2025, Chainwire

XION, a walletless blockchain bridging Web2 and Web3, has announced its compliance with EU regulations, becoming the first L1 on mainnet to release a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) whitepaper. XION has now aligned with the regulatory framework governing crypto-assets in the European Union, demonstrating its commitment to expanding ease of access for institutions, and individuals, that utilize and adopt digital assets.

Title II of MiCA, which came into full effect in December 2024, establishes strong guidelines for issuers, offerors, and those seeking admission to trading of crypto-assets within the EU. XION falls into the latter category, ensuring compliance to facilitate access to its ecosystem in a regulated and transparent manner, giving institutions and individuals in the EU added assurance.

“The release of a MiCA whitepaper is a key step in a broader institutional strategy,” said Burnt Banksy, Founder at XION. “Adhering to the EU’s evolving regulatory landscape ensures that institutions and users can both gain access to XION in a compliant manner, strengthening the foundation for broader adoption of Web3.”

This regulatory milestone comes as part of XION’s mission to make Web3 accessible to everyone, everywhere. By removing blockchain complexities through protocol-level innovations such as Generalized Abstraction, Meta Accounts, Signature Abstraction, and its Parameterized Fee Layer, XION is building an infrastructure layer designed for seamless mainstream adoption of Web3 applications.

With this compliance, institutions within the EU will now have unbridled access to a blockchain that bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3, offering regulatory clarity alongside a user-friendly environment. XION’s ecosystem has already attracted leading brands leveraging its technology to enable frictionless Web3 interactions, further reinforcing its position as a pioneer in expanding access to all internet users.

As XION continues to advance its institutional and regulatory initiatives, this step in ensuring MiCA compliance lays the groundwork for future expansion and wider access to its ecosystem. For more information, the XION crypto-asset whitepaper is available here.

About XION

XION is the first walletless Layer 1 blockchain focused on making Web3 accessible to all users. It achieves this by making crypto disappear through its Generalized Abstraction, simplifying complexities such as wallets, private keys, multi-device usage, gas fees, and more. By removing common Web3 friction points, XION accelerates the mainstream adoption of Web3 by making blockchain technology more accessible to users and developers.

El Cboe BZX Exchange de Chicago ha presentado un formulario 19b-4 aquí en nombre de Franklin Templeton para listar y negociar acciones del ETF de Franklin XRP en EEUU.

La solicitud ocurrió poco después de que Franklin Templeton presentara un formulario de registro S-1 ante la SEC para lanzar un producto de inversión enfocado en XRP, el cuarto criptoactivo más grande por capitalización de mercado, a principios de esta semana.

El principal gestor de activos, que supervisa $1.6 billones en activos de clientes, se ha unido a una lista creciente de grandes firmas que buscan aprobación para ETFs ligados a criptoactivos más allá de Bitcoin y Ethereum.

El propuesto ETF de XRP de Franklin se negociará en el Cboe BZX Exchange con Coinbase Custody actuando como custodio de sus tenencias de XRP. El fondo busca rastrear el rendimiento de precio de XRP, ofreciendo a los inversionistas exposición al activo digital sin requerir custodia directa.

XRP, el cuarto criptoactivo más grande por capitalización de mercado, actualmente se cotiza a $2.2. El precio del token ha ganado impulso tras un informe del miércoles que indica que Ripple Labs y la SEC están trabajando en resolver su demanda legal de larga duración.

La presentación sigue a la reciente expansión de Franklin Templeton en ETFs de cripto, incluyendo una solicitud de ETF de Solana y lanzamientos anteriores de ETFs spot de Bitcoin y Ethereum.

https://decrypt.co,When Will Strategy Buy the Bitcoin Dip?,https://decrypt.co/309938/when-will-strategy-buy-bitcoin-dip,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:56:50 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-buying behemoth has yet to buy the latest dip, possibly signaling Strategy’s approach to acquiring the asset is shifting alongside market headwinds.

Tysons, Virginia-based Strategy, which pivoted from a software focus to become a Bitcoin Treasury, said that it bought Bitcoin 18 times last year, according to Saylor Tracker. Nearly half those announcements followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s reelection in November, as crypto prices boomed.

So far, Strategy has disclosed six Bitcoin purchases this year. However, its holdings have remained unchanged at 499,096 Bitcoin since Feb. 24. At the time, the company said that it had purchased Bitcoin for an average price of $97,500 per Bitcoin.

The pause comes amid Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs, which have battered stocks and crypto, while prompting outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Leading up to Bitcoin’s latest drift below $80,000 on Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs had bled $649 million since Monday, per CoinGlass.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs had a historic U.S. debut last year, and along with Strategy’s insatiable demand for Bitcoin, the two market forces helped buoy Bitcoin’s price to new heights.

Prediction market traders on MYRIAD doubt that Strategy will confirm a new Bitcoin purchase on Monday, penciling in a 60% chance that the firm’s holdings remain unchanged for a third consecutive week. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

Strategy’s stock price has fallen 18% over the past month to $265, according to Yahoo Finance. Despite the recent drop, its shares are still valued 50% up from a year ago.

Strategy’s Strategy

Strategy raises capital to buy Bitcoin by selling shares or bonds. And its ability to raise capital cheaply is influenced by the volatility of its stock price and Bitcoin’s momentum, according to Compass Point Research & Trading analysts Ed Engel and Joe Flynn

“MSTR's cost of capital increases during market corrections, which makes it harder for Strategy to buy BTC when prices dip,” Engel and Flynn wrote in a research note this month.

Within the past few years, Strategy has embraced so-called convertible senior notes as a way to buy Bitcoin. As a form of company debt, investors can convert these notes for shares.

Strategy said that it had sold $3 billion worth of convertible senior notes at a 55% conversion premium relative to its stock price in November. Investors later paid a 35% conversion premium on $2 billion worth of convertible senior shares in February, indicating its offering had become less lucrative.

At the same time, Strategy unveiled “STRK” in January. As perpetual strike preferred stock, the Nasdaq-listed product pays a fixed dividend indefinitely, unless Strategy decides to redeem it.

Strategy raised $563 million through the STRK offering in January, and on Monday, the company said it would offer another $21 billion in STRK “over an extended period.”

Mark Palmer, a senior equity research analyst at Benchmark, told Decrypt that Strategy's recent pause likely stems from a focus on arranging the new offering.

“There is no reason to believe that Strategy’s appetite for buying bitcoin has abated,” he said, describing Monday’s announcement as “an emphatic statement about its commitment to its bitcoin acquisition strategy.”

As market participants waited to see whether that offering would translate into immediate buys, Saylor, Strategy’s ever bullish co-founder and executive referenced the product on Thursday.

In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), he said, “$STRK while the iron is hot.”

Strategy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.

The U.S. Senate Banking Committee voted in favor of advancing the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act to a full Senate vote Thursday, with the legislation receiving bipartisan support.

The bill passed through committee by a vote of 18-6, with five Senate Democrats joining Republicans to push the bill over the finish line with considerable breathing room.

Democrats who voted for the GENIUS Act’s passage include bill cosponsor Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), as well as Senate Banking Committee members Mark Warner (D-VA), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and Ruben Gallego (D-AZ).

The bill’s sponsor, Bill Hagerty (R-TN), said he intends for the bill to receive a full vote on the Senate floor by the end of April.

A massive move in Washington today. The GENUIS Act passed out of Senate Banking with a strong and bi-partisan 18-6 vote. This is a huge step towards providing regulatory clarity for stablecoins, and a huge step towards upgrading and making the dollar more competitive. — Jeremy Allaire - jda.eth / jdallaire.sol (@jerallaire) March 13, 2025

“The Banking Committee’s strong bipartisan passage of the GENIUS Act out of committee brings us one step closer to providing stablecoin issuers with the choice between state and national charters and will secure our nation’s competitive edge in the rapidly evolving digital asset space,” Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), another cosponsor of the bill, said in a statement shared with Decrypt.

🚨THANK YOU to moderate Democrats--the stablecoin bill (GENIUS Act) passed the Senate Banking Committee 18-6. They bucked the far-left Warrenites. 🙏 — Caitlin Long 🔑⚡️🟠 (@CaitlinLong_) March 13, 2025

During Thursday’s meeting of the Senate Banking Committee, longtime crypto critic Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attempted to add multiple new provisions to the GENIUS Act, which creates a legal framework for nonbank stablecoin issuers to participate in the U.S. economy.

Warren proposed amendments to the bill that would have blacklisted any stablecoin issuers whose tokens were found to have been used in connection with state enemies and illegal activity, including drug trafficking and the purchase of child pornography. Another would have expanded the provisions of the Act to apply to crypto exchanges and other third parties that interact with stablecoins.

All her amendments were voted down, mostly along party lines.

It turns out the anti-crypto army is neither anti-crypto nor much of an army — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 13, 2025

“Who are we trying to protect, the child pornographers and Iran and North Korea?” Warren said at one point, in apparent exasperation, after her third amendment was voted down.

“Nobody’s looking to shut this down, no one’s looking to stop innovation,” the progressive senator said at a later point during the meeting. “But we do want to try to make this a little cleaner than it is right now.”

The bill proceeded shortly after to a vote, which it passed handily.

A new version of the GENIUS Act was released earlier this week in anticipation of today’s markup. While it has been generally supported by industry leaders, some crypto users pushed back on a new provision that would require stablecoin issuers to have the ability to ""seize, freeze, burn, or prevent the transfer” of tokens if obligated to comply with legal orders.

Following the recent closure of the Midnight Society gaming studio, disgruntled fans of the discontinued shooter game Deadrop have started claiming refunds for early access passes through their banks and credit card providers.

Players have mobilized in game studio Midnight Society’s abandoned Discord server to spread information on how to successfully chargeback their purchases.

Deadrop was the vertical extraction shooter developed by Midnight Society, co-founded by controversial streamer Dr. Disrespect—who was later kicked out of the company due to allegations of inappropriate conversations with minors.

PSA: For anyone who purchased a Drivers Key Package from Midnight Society in 2023 for @DEADROP - You can charge back and dispute the money you spent on the goods that you never received. Wanted to wait until I had confirmations on this, and it appears everyone should be able to… — Caramel (@Caramel_Hydra) March 7, 2025

The game spent almost two years in early access, after the studio initially sold Founders Access Pass NFTs on Ethereum scaling network Polygon. Following that initial sale, the studio later sold $25 Tower Key passes (which weren’t NFTs), and eventually Drivers Keys for $20-30 apiece, which would unlock future in-game items of varying rarities.

Once Midnight Society shut down at the end of January 2025, much of what users thought they’d spent money on was no longer going to be delivered.

For example, the Tower Key purchase promised a free battle pass available upon the launch of the game’s first official season, which is no longer going to happen, leading some buyers wanting a partial refund. And those that bought a Drivers Key claim to have never received the in-game items at all.

Pseudonymous gaming content creator JustAverageJay, simply known as Jay, shared receipts with Decrypt showing that he spent $449.80 on Deadrop Drivers Keys throughout October 2023, because he wanted to eventually flex the items in-game alongside his son, who also played Deadrop.

On top of this, Midnight Society pledged that legendary items, obtained through the Drivers Keys purchases, would later be tradable on its marketplace. As such, Jay said he piled up on them, anticipating that they’d be heavily sought after in the future—akin to what is happening with early access skins on the pre-mainnet black market for Off the Grid.

“What we paid for was never in the game. We never had access,” Jay told Decrypt. “So, they scammed us—took our money for products [that they] never had to give us because the game was never released.”

Jay isn’t alone in this, with a group of players gathering in the Midnight Society Discord to discuss how they can get a refund. Former Discord moderator, the pseudonymous Caramel, has taken the mantle and claims to have assisted 11 people so far in securing refunds. He said that this is done by contacting your bank and telling them the product was never delivered.

Caramel shared receipts of three bank reversals from Midnight Society totaling nearly $390 for Drivers Keys. He says that there are “many many more” in the works to get refunds.

“I don't want the community that I helped build over the last 4 years to be out [of] hundreds, if not thousands of dollars,” Caramel said.

After popular streamer Dr. Disrespect, aka Guy Beahm, was dismissed from the game studio, players were unsure where the game would go—or if it could succeed without him.

Midnight Society co-founder and creative director Quinn DelHoyo told Decrypt in August 2024 that the game’s development hadn’t “skipped a beat,” and claimed that the “fully featured game” would release in fall 2025. This planned launch would have included the Season 0 battle pass that Tower Key buyers were anticipating.

Just over three months after terminating its relationship with Beahm, Midnight Society confirmed last September that “significant” layoffs took place, after the news spread via ex-employees' social media accounts. But a leaner team wasn’t enough to save the studio, with Midnight Society officially shutting down four months later, leading to Deadrop being discontinued.

One player that asked to remain anonymous provided Decrypt with correspondence from American Express approving a $25 chargeback for a Tower Key, because Midnight Society did not respond to the bank’s queries on the case. This player admitted that they only anticipated a partial refund, but was happy to take the full $25.

Jay, on the other hand, is struggling with his refund due to paying via a local credit union rather than a big, established bank. At first, the union rejected his claim due to the transaction being more than 90 days old, pushing him to contact the merchant.

However, this is an avenue that many players had already gone down to no avail. It appears that no one is monitoring the Midnight Society accounts, with no response from any of their email addresses and the Discord chat largely running free of supervision.

Midnight Society did not respond to Decrypt’s request for comment, nor did former studio head Robert Bowling.

Jay called up his credit union to explain the situation further, adding the detail that others in the community had already secured successful refunds. Now, he claims, his credit union is on his side and is pursuing a way to refund his nearly $450.

“I’m very hopeful I’ll get my money back, but realize it’s a long shot—so I’m not holding my breath,” he told Decrypt. “I’m self-employed, so it’s a huge deal if I can get that money back. It would give me a little more breathing room financially.”

While Jay and others cross their fingers for a refund, users in the Discord continue to criticize Midnight Society and its founders. Chargebacks aside, users are outraged that the studio’s website says that its community events are still occurring every week, that merch is still buyable, and that the game’s NFTs are still tradable on OpenSea.

One wallet bought 13 Founders Passes on Monday, perhaps hoping for a second life for the now-shuttered game.

Representatives for the family of U.S. President Donald Trump are holding discussions with Binance about investing in its U.S. arm, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Thursday.

The WSJ said that the exchange giant's founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, who is the firm's largest shareholder, was also seeking a pardon, citing people familiar with the matter. Zhao, who was then the company's CEO, pleaded guilty on money laundering charges in November 2023 and served four months in prison.

Zhao denied the WSJ report in an X post.

""The WSJ article got the facts wrong,"" he wrote Thursday. ""Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with…well, anyone.""

4. Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ""Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?"" They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In… https://t.co/ELyDPmKD3G — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 13, 2025

As part of his agreement, Zhao has a lifetime ban from ""managing or operating"" the exchange. Binance pleaded guilty for violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws, paid a $4.3 billion fine–one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history–and agreed to ""a complete exit"" from the country.

Steve Witkoff, a friend of the president and negotiator in the war in Ukraine, is involved in the negotiations, The Journal reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

The White House had no comment and referred Decrypt to Zhao’s statement. BNB, the exchange’s native token, rose more than 6% at one point in the hours after the report and was more recently up 3%, according to data provider CoinGecko.

Binance US declined to comment when Decrypt reached out to the firm. And Zhao added: ""Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the 'war on crypto' from the last administration are still at work.""

The Trump Administration has been working to help the digital asset industry after regulators were tough on top crypto companies under the Biden government.

Trump, who campaigned as a supporter of the industry, last week signed an executive order to launch a Bitcoin strategic reserve and separate crypto stockpile.

Aethir, a provider of decentralized cloud gaming infrastructure, has been featured in a newly released case study by SuperScale, a global expert in gaming user acquisition. The study provides an in-depth analysis of how Aethir’s cloud streaming technology enhances user acquisition strategies for gaming studios, presenting a scalable alternative to traditional app store distribution.

Cloud Streaming as a Direct-to-Consumer Solution

Gaming studios often face high service fees when distributing games through commercial app stores, with some platforms taking up to 30% of a game’s revenue. Aethir’s decentralized cloud infrastructure enables studios to bypass these costs by utilizing web-based streaming, providing an independent publishing model designed to enhance user acquisition.

Key aspects of Aethir’s cloud streaming include:

Reduced Reliance on App Stores – Web-based streaming eliminates the need for app store downloads, allowing publishers to retain a greater share of revenue.

– Web-based streaming eliminates the need for app store downloads, allowing publishers to retain a greater share of revenue. Lower User Acquisition Costs – Instant play via social media or advertisements reduces friction in the user journey, improving conversion rates.

Discover SCENE

Singapore, Singapore, March 13th, 2025, Chainwire

Ourbit, one of the fastest-growing memecoin-focused exchanges of 2024, today announced the launch of Phase 3 of its $BITCH memecoin airdrop campaign. With Phase 1 continuing through March 31 and Phase 2 now completed, Ourbit is allocating 85% of the token's 1 billion supply directly to community members through this multi-phase airdrop. This airdrop campaign coincides with Ourbit's debut of the world's first ""SuperCEX,"" a hybrid trading model that integrates DEX capabilities with centralized exchange functionality, poised to transcend the boundaries of CeFi and DeFi and reshape how crypto assets are traded.

Prophetic Listings Meets Degen DNA: The Memecoin SuperCEX

While traditional centralized exchanges have kept memecoins at arm's length, Ourbit has consistently embraced them as a true cultural phenomena that drive expressions of community identity and crypto-native culture. The platform has established itself as a leading hub for memecoin trading because of its comprehensive selection of memecoin trading pairs, industry-leading memecoin liquidity, and its strategic approach – listing tokens like $SPX (up 96x), $VIRTUAL (up 56x), $KOMA (up 49x), and $ACT (up 46x) before their rise.

$BITCH: 85% to the Community, 100% to Degen Energy

From Ourbit's perspective, memecoins are not simply speculative assets. With $BITCH, Ourbit is acknowledging the central role that memecoins play in onboarding new users to crypto and driving trading volume across the ecosystem. The $BITCH ticker represents the evolution of Ourbit's beloved iconic ""Queen"" mascot – the fierce, commanding female figure who has become synonymous with the platform's degen-first approach to crypto trading. While some centralized exchanges might remain detached observers of memecoin culture, Ourbit understands the unique psychology and motivations of degen traders.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-cnFxSQkhI]

With the total supply of $BITCH being 1 billion, Ourbit is distributing 85% of $BITCH total supply to the community, demonstrating its maximum degen energy. $BITCH represents more than just a token—it serves as a cultural symbol that acknowledges and engages the degen community, which has played a key role in Ourbit's expansion. This strategic move further solidifies Ourbit's ambition in forging a new breed of exchange, for the next generation of degen traders.

3-Phase Airdrop: The Ultimate Degen Reward System

The $BITCH airdrop mechanics retroactively reward Ourbit's early users while incentivizing new user acquisition and high-frequency trading activity for its DEX platform:

Phase 1: February 26th - March 31st, 2025 (ACTIVE)

Retroactive airdrops for Ourbit's early supporters and users

Existing Ourbit users can visit Ourbit's dedicated airdrop page at www.ourbit.com/activity/airdrop to check for eligibility for Phase 1 airdrops

Phase 2: March 3rd - March 10th, 2025 (COMPLETED)

Invite & Earn - Users can complete daily tasks and invite others to sign up on Ourbit DEX to accumulate points, with $BITCH distribution determined based on the points earned.

Phase 3: March 13th, 12PM EST (March 14th, 4PM UTC) until all mystery boxes are distributed

Invite & Trade - Mystery box fragments can be obtained through Futures trading, DEX trading, or inviting others to join. These fragments can be used to open mystery boxes, which may contain $BITCH rewards.

Crypto enthusiasts and traders interested in participating in the $BITCH Airdrop Phase 3 can visit www.ourbit.com/activity/airdrop to register for Ourbit's DEX platform

Redefining Centralized Exchange (CEX) Architecture

Ourbit isn't stopping with the memecoin launch. The siloed nature of CeFi and DeFi has been a significant barrier to mainstream adoption. Today's traders shouldn't have to choose between the speed of centralized platforms and the sovereignty of decentralized protocols. Ourbit has engineered a solution to one of crypto's most persistent pain points. Its SuperCEX hybrid model is the industry's first true integration of decentralized exchange (DEX) capabilities into a centralized platform. Ourbit has created the ultimate hassle-free trading experience where it handles all the complexity, so users can focus solely on capitalizing on opportunities.

SuperCEX: Trading Everything On One App

Ourbit's SuperCEX delivers seamless access to both on-chain and off-chain assets through a single interface, fundamentally transforming how traders discover and access new assets:

No more juggling multiple wallets, exchanges, or Telegram trading bots

AI-curated trading feed for high-potential on-chain asset discovery

Real-time data and smart money tracking

*Currently, Ourbit's DEX product is in the beta testing phase and only the website version is available, users can expect more upgrades and the app version to be on the way.

With Ourbit – The Future of Trading Is Hybrid

Ourbit is launching more than just a token and a new feature. By combining the $BITCH memecoin with the SuperCEX model, Ourbit creates a practical solution for traders who want access to all types of crypto opportunities in one place. The SuperCEX approach breaks down the walls between centralized and decentralized systems, giving traders what they actually need: maximum degen trading potential unlocked with institutional-grade trading tools.

About OURBIT

Ourbit is the world's 1st SuperCEX integrating CEX and DEX in one platform, allowing users to trade all on-chain and off-chain assets in just one app. Ourbit delivers the most comprehensive memecoin trading pairs, industry-leading memecoin liquidity, and prophetic listing strategy with a proven track record of identifying explosive gems before other exchanges ($SPX 96X, $VIRTUAL 56X, $KOMA 49X since listed on Ourbit). Founded by ex-founding teams of top-tier exchanges with authentic roots in memecoin ecosystems, Ourbit has earned official endorsements from memecoin projects such as Retardio, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu and more. With its $BITCH memecoin launch in 2025 Q1, Ourbit SuperCEX combines institutional expertise with degen DNA to empower traders in pursuit of ""meme-ionaire"" dreams.

Anchorage Digital was one such custodian that met with Treasury Department officials on Monday, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

When asked about the meeting, Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley told Decrypt that government officials asked him detailed questions about best practices for custodying a national Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. McCauley said the officials also inquired about how custody could impact stablecoins and market structure, two hot-button topics currently before Congress.

“The Treasury Department is asking all the right questions,” the Anchorage CEO told Decrypt. “It’s clear that Treasury officials are treating this move into the digital asset space with care, recognizing that the United States is quite literally writing history.”

The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

A Capitol Hill source with knowledge of the meetings told Decrypt the Treasury Department is in the early stages of figuring out how best to tackle questions of security involved in the U.S. government indefinitely holding billions of dollars worth of digital assets.

“I don't think they have a view yet, and they're trying to figure out what their view is going to be,” they said. “But they are actively seeking additional information from industry participants on the best way to custody the strategic reserve and the stockpile.”

The source elaborated that key decision makers in the industry appear to be in favor of one or multiple third parties assisting with custodying the U.S. government’s Bitcoin reserve in the interim, with the long-term goal of the government eventually self-custodying when ready. Self custody refers to the practice of independently holding crypto in cold wallets accessed with private keys, as opposed to relying on third parties to manage the assets.

The national digital assets stockpile, however, will consist of a wide variety of seized crypto assets on various blockchain networks, and therefore will likely be permanently custodied by a third party.

How are the nearly 200,000 BTC in the government’s possession currently being held? Last summer, the U.S. Marshals Service announced it had tapped Coinbase to custody its large cap digital asset holdings.

When asked by Decrypt whether the company currently custodies the U.S. government’s Bitcoin, however, a Coinbase representative declined comment, pointing only to a recent, vague X post on the subject by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.

In the post, Armstrong boasts that his company “works with 145 government entities in the U.S. and 29 government entities outside the U.S.” and that Coinbase has seen increased interest in its custody services following President Donald Trump’s announcement establishing a Bitcoin Reserve.

During an event in Washington held Tuesday by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, Casa CEO Nick Neuman, and Anchorage Digital’s Nathan McCauley convened a panel on “Safeguarding America’s Bitcoin.”

During the talk, the executives opined as to the current state of the government’s current BTC stash, which is worth some $16.4 billion at writing.

“It’s maybe sitting in a closet at the U.S. Marshals Office,” Casa’s Neuman said.

“Or in a drive at somebody’s desk,” BitGo’s Mike Belshe added.",decrypt

A trio of Solana tokens—Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU, Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Popcat (POPCAT) have all jumped in the last 24 hours, while meme coin leader Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained relatively flat in the same timeframe.

DOGE, which is ranked inside the top 10 crypto assets by market cap, is down by just 0.4% in the last day while the trio of Solana tokens have outperformed amid their listing on Robinhood. Dogecoin was showing a gain earlier Thursday morning, but has since dipped slightly to a current price of $0.165.

POPCAT, the top cat-themed token on Solana, leads the way, gaining more than 20% en route to a current price of $0.186 over the last day of trading. The other new Robinhood listings, PENGU and PNUT, have gained 5.9% and 5.8%, respectively.

The bumps represent a broader relief rally for some of the leading Solana and Ethereum meme coins, which have been in free-fall for the better part of the month. That’s highlighted by losses of more than 30% for DOGE and PEPE, two of the top three largest meme coins by market cap.

Other notables, like the U.S. president’s official Solana meme coin TRUMP and Dogwifhat (WIF) have also posted moderate gains of 2.5% and 3.7%, respectively. The pair are both available for trading on Robinhood as well.

The gains for leaders are merely a reprieve for a bleeding meme coin market, however. According to data from CoinGecko, the meme coin market cap as a whole is down by 0.2% in the last 24 hours, falling just below $50 billion in the process.

That’s a far cry from the numbers the sector held in late 2024, when “dog-themed” tokens alone represented a nearly $105 billion market cap at peak, according to the coin tracking platform.

The market has recently reconsidered the future of meme coins, with some traders going as far as to claim that the “Pump.fun days are over” amid the decline of the popular Solana token launchpad.

Pump.fun is responsible for more than 8 million token deployments since its launch, including some of the top meme coins from this cycle like PNUT and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), though its usage stats have fallen sharply in recent weeks amid market turmoil.

Others though, like Stratos hedge fund founder Renneck Palley, previously told Decrypt that “meme coins are here to stay.”

Meme coins are inherently more volatile and risky than other tokens, and are typically based on relevant pop culture events and figures. They sometimes rise faster than other, more established crypto tokens, but often crash in a hurry based on factors like changing sentiment, large sales from “whale” holders, and moves from bad actors.

https://decrypt.co,WalletConnect Founder: Time Was Right For WCT Token Launch Based on 'Token-Market Fit',https://decrypt.co/309829/walletconnect-founder-time-was-right-for-wct-token-launch-based-on-token-market-fit,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:19:31 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Over the past year, on-chain UX ecosystem WalletConnect has embarked on an ambitious programme of decentralization, establishing the WalletConnect Foundation in 2024 alongside the launch of its WCT token, used for fees, rewards, staking and governance on the network.

WalletConnect founder Pedro Gomes argued that the time was right to launch WCT based on “token-market fit,” explaining that, with multiple SDKs building atop the network, it enabled stakeholders to “find a common ground where we’re incentivized to build together.” The token also encourages node operators to cohere around the network’s mission, he explained, as well as incentivizing the crypto wallets that have onboarded some 40 million users to the network to date.

Finally, he said, there are “developers, users, community members—so many people were involved in bringing WalletConnect to this reality.” Following WCT’s season one airdrop, he said, “We’re seeing them participating more actively through staking and through governance, having discussions and feeling empowered to actually be an owner as well.”

The creation of the WalletConnect Foundation was prompted by the rapid growth of the WalletConnect ecosystem, as it grew to encompass not just WalletConnect’s own network built atop its proprietary SDK, but other SDKs building on the network, Gomes explained.

“We saw an opportunity not only to remove the single point of failure, but also to bring on all of these ecosystem partners to actually collaborate with us,” he said.

Future plans

Looking to the future, Gomes said that the network will take “multiple angles through decentralization to really find a way that we can be as resistant and as global as possible.”

Alongside that push will come changes to the economics of the WCT token, he added. “We have kicked off what I think is a very healthy token ecosystem for WCT,” he explained, but envisions improvements to how rewards are allocated to node operators, wallets and SDKs.

Finally, the introduction of fees on the network will ensure that “all of these rewards are revenue driven,” he explained, adding that, “We’ll not only have a decentralized network, but we might even have a profitable decentralized network.”

Streamlining crypto UX

To date, WalletConnect claims to have enabled over 255 million “seamless, secure connections” for more than 45 million users worldwide, connecting an ecosystem of 600 wallets and 54,000 apps.

As part of its drive to improve user experience in crypto, WalletConnect last year launched its WalletConnect Certified kitemark, which recognizes projects that “meet the highest standards in UX, compliance, security, and feature integration.”

“WalletConnect was born out of standards,” Gomes told Decrypt, adding that the certification helps to align wallets around criteria for “good user experience, good security and meeting interoperability standards.” He explained that, “Obviously, we want every wallet developer to have the freedom to build how they wish—but at the same time, we have to have a baseline where we define a good wallet, and then you build from there.”

For crypto to truly achieve mainstream adoption, wallets need to focus on having “as few clicks as possible,” according to Gomes.

“The number one complaint that people have is that there's just too many steps,” Gomes told Decrypt, adding that, “if there is a click somewhere, it needs to be removed.”

To that end, Gomes said, WalletConnect’s forthcoming Smart Sessions feature, first teased in 2024, will enable users to “connect and forget.” Crypto wallets can use it to connect to apps with just a single click, he explained, adding that, “you never actually have to return to the wallet ever again to approve transactions—you just connect and you’re done.”

“Smart Sessions change not just how wallets work, but how we interact with dapps,” he said, adding that the impact will be “quite pivotal for the user experience.” Ultimately, Gomes envisions crypto wallets having a “persistent connection that protects you from any malicious activity, and it just happens magically in the background.”

The Karrat Foundation, which is linked to the battle royale game My Pet Hooligan, announced Thursday that it is collaborating with the Arbitrum Foundation to launch a gaming-focused chain called Studio Chain, which is aimed at fostering Web3-native capabilities in entertainment and video games.

The collaboration places the KARRAT token at the forefront of the chain built with Arbitrum’s Ethereum layer-2 scaling tech, and makes My Pet Hooligan (MPH)—which is available via the Epic Games Store—the flagship game of the budding ecosystem.

“Studio Chain and the My Pet Hooligan franchise bring with them a rich source of content and culture that we’re thrilled to add to the Arbitrum ecosystem,” Jack Fitzpatrick, Partnerships Manager at Offchain Labs, said in a statement. “We're excited to see how this collaboration will enable truly innovative player and creator experiences.""

To deliver those experiences the blockchain will look to My Pet Hooligan creator AMGI Studios, which counts entertainment icons Paris Hilton and Coldplay as early investors, to deliver AAA gaming experiences, tokenized IP and content rights, and new democratized funding channels.

“By leveraging Arbitrum's powerful infrastructure, we're able to create gaming experiences that were previously impossible,"" said Luke Paglia, co-founder and COO of AMGI Studios. “My Pet Hooligan is just the beginning—this collaboration enables seamless in-game asset ownership, true player-driven interactive extensions, and enhanced interoperability that will transform how audiences engage with entertainment.""

That interoperability will help extend the chain’s headline game to Xbox game consoles and additional PC gaming launchpads in the coming months.

The Web3 components of the game will be controlled by relays between the game and the backend infrastructure which connects to the My Pet Hooligan web portal. In other words, interacting with crypto assets will take place via the website, not within the Xbox game itself.

“That means Web3 fungible and non-fungible assets can be reflected in the Web3 environment and any changes to asset states or balances communicated across platforms,” a representative for the game told Decrypt. A combination of AMGI’s proprietary architecture and the KARRAT protocol will “enable Web3 activations without disrupting the core gameplay experience,” they added.

Other notable crypto games are headed to Xbox and PlayStation consoles, though with mixed approaches—and still a lot of questions in some cases.

Ethereum-based game Moonray will launch on consoles without crypto elements built in, the developer previously said. Meanwhile, Off the Grid—which is currently available in early access on Xbox and PS5—still has yet to launch its Avalanche L1 mainnet to power on-chain trading and token use. But developer Gunzilla has conceded that the crypto elements will be “handled differently” on consoles compared to PC.

While details of Studio Chain’s official launch are still outstanding, when it comes, it will need to fight for users with other entertainment and consumer-focused blockchains like Ethereum scaling networks Ronin and Abstract.

But a representative for the Karrot Foundation said they aren’t thinking about competing with other existing chains, but rather complementing them.

“This isn't a ‘My chain is quicker than yours’ argument,” they told Decrypt. “The aim is to carve out a distinct lane as the go-to blockchain for entertainment innovation—complementing rather than directly rivaling—what other great industry solutions and chains are doing.”

“The traditional entertainment industry is in crunch time, with studios shutting down, frequent layoffs, difficult barriers to entry, red tape, and more as IPs are looking for funding and new paths forward,” they continued. “As the Web3 space continues to mature and offer new opportunities for IP, Studio Chain will be there to facilitate those early adopters.”

https://decrypt.co,Cboe Files to Allow In-Kind Redemptions for Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs,https://decrypt.co/309825/cboe-files-to-allow-in-kind-redemptions-for-invesco-galaxy-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 10:45:15 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Cboe BZX Exchange has filed a proposed rule change with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on behalf of Inveso Galaxy to allow for in-kind creations and redemptions of shares for its spot Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF.

In-kind redemptions and creations allow for the direct exchange of the underlying assets of the ETF (Bitcoin or Ethereum) for ETF shares, bypassing the need for cash.

This method eliminates the need for participants to sell the underlying crypto to create shares, reducing the bid/ask spread and avoiding additional broker commissions.

The proposal, published Thursday morning, pushes the boundaries of crypto ETFs in the U.S., opening new avenues for investors to tap into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) without holding the assets physically.

As the SEC reviews Cboe’s proposed rule change, a public comment period has been opened, allowing stakeholders to share their thoughts before a final decision is made.

Authorized participants—institutions involved in the creation and redemption process—will be eligible to use the in-kind transaction model, says the filing.

Individual investors will still be required to use the cash-based model when purchasing or redeeming ETF shares.

The Invesco Galaxy filing mirrors similar moves by major ETF providers, including BlackRock, which has recently sought approval for in-kind redemption mechanisms.

In a related tweet, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out in January that in-kind creations and redemptions should help “streamline” the ETF market.

Wow. Way too many questions and this stuff goes pretty deep in the weeds. So i'll keep it high level and answer ""What does this mean?"" Not all that much for individual retail investors. Mostly what it means is that ETFs should trade even more efficiently than they already do… pic.twitter.com/LWYsKmo5sH — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025

The analyst explained that fewer steps and parties would be involved in the process, while sharing an image BlackRock reportedly used in a November 2023 SEC meeting to advocate for in-kind transactions for spot Bitcoin ETFs.

“In my opinion the ETFs should have been allowed to do this from the get-go but the Dem SEC commissioners were against it,” Seyffart said.

Bitcoin ETFs face challenges

Last January, the SEC approved the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, making history as one of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs to be listed on a U.S. exchange.

Following the approval of its Bitcoin counterpart, the SEC granted approval for the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF in May of last year.

Like the Bitcoin ETF, it holds Ethereum as the underlying asset and allows shares to be traded on a regulated exchange.

Even so, both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have faced challenges in recent days.

On Tuesday, Bitcoin ETFs experienced significant outflows, with $371 million withdrawn, marking the seventh consecutive day of withdrawals, according to data from UK-based investment management firm Farside Investors.

Ethereum ETFs were similarly impacted, with outflows of $21.57 million, extending their streak to five days.",decrypt

Based on the TON blockchain, TOP launched the wallet in 2023. The company reported that over 100 million users have signed up for an account with Wallet on Telegram. Additionally, it noted that most of these users were new to the crypto ecosystem.

The wallet product has primarily been focused on the Toncoin cryptocurrency, which can be used on the Telegram platform to tip creators or pay for minigames and apps. It also supports Bitcoin and USDT (on the TON blockchain). Since the initial launch, the wallet has also gained support of other currencies like Notcoin.

Following today’s update, TOP says that users will be able to buy, sell, or hold crypto without any on-chain deposits. This makes it easier for newer users to get into crypto holding and trading.

The company is also introducing an earning component to the wallet for holding a certain amount of Toncoin. It said that while the average yield is 4%, it will vary based on validators’ reward. Later this year, TOP plans to add yields for USDT holdings and launch loyalty programs that would benefit Toncoin holders.

Telegram Wallet has undergone a makeover as well, with a new navigation bar at the bottom and an easy way to switch between the Wallet, Trade, and Earn sections.

“This update enhances Wallet’s functionality, to meet consumers’ expectations for an open and wide market. With current update Wallet now operates as a fully-fledged crypto platform within Telegram while remaining as simple and accessible as ever. We also plan to implement a loyalty program specifically for Toncoin holders, to further boost the adoption of TON Ecosystem,” TOP’s CEO Andrew Rogozov said in a statement.

The new wallet update will start rolling out to users in March and April. TOP said that some features might be restricted in some countries based on local regulations.

Last December, Telegram founder Pavel Durov said that the company became profitable. The platform has more than 950 million monthly active users. Cryptocurrencies have contributed to the company’s bottom line thanks to integrations with content and mini app payments.

Token Metrics CEO Ian Balina said Wednesday the SEC is expected to drop its case against him, ending a three-year legal battle over allegations he violated U.S. securities laws.

“It’s official: The SEC is dropping its case against me,” Balina tweeted. “This was never just about me—it’s about fairness in crypto.”

Balina’s charges stem from a September 2022 order alleging he failed to disclose compensation received while promoting the Sparkster (SPRK) initial coin offering.

Backing the CEO’s claim, Token Metrics tweeted Monday the charges had been ""dropped,"" adding that ""a possible shift in enforcement trends"" was underway.

It's worth noting the SEC has yet to provide an official statement on the matter. The SEC and Balina did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.

The SEC has also not officially updated the case's status since September 2022, when it announced Sparkster and its CEO, Sajjad Daya, had settled for $35 million.

""This frivolous SEC charge sets a bad precedent for the entire crypto industry,"" Balina said at the time. ""If investing in a private sale with a discount is a crime, the entire crypto VC space is in trouble.""

The SEC's complaint alleged Balina received a 30% bonus on his $5 million investment in SPRK tokens but never disclosed this consideration when promoting the tokens to his substantial social media following.

In May 2024, a judge ruled SPRK tokens qualified as securities under the SEC's purview.

If confirmed by the regulator, the dismissal would follow several recent SEC decisions to abandon cases against crypto companies since President Trump appointed Mark Uyeda as acting SEC Chair following Gary Gensler's January departure.

So far, the SEC has dismissed a number of cases containing allegations of securities violations against crypto firms including Binance, Coinbase, OpenSea, Robinhood, Uniswap, Gemini, and Kraken, among others.

Crypto exchange Coinbase said Wednesday it is suspending trading of three popular meme coins in New York, following a recent review of its listed assets.

The exchange is halting the trading of Floki (FLOKI), Turbo (TURBO), and Gigachad (GIGA) in New York starting April 14, 2025, at 2 PM ET, per an announcement on X.

While the tokens will remain listed, trading will be suspended for users in the state as part of the exchange’s regular monitoring of its platform, it said.

The announcement has drawn immediate speculation from legal experts, with Ariel Givner, founder of GivnerLaw, suggesting on X, “I’d put a lot of money on this being tied to a pending legal case in NY.”

Despite the news, the market response has been muted. Floki gained 3.6%, Giga rose 1.1%, and Turbo saw a 5.4% increase in the last 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows.

In the case of Coinbase, the move follows the exchange's November announcement that Floki would be added to its listing roadmap, which led the token to a five-month high.

In December 2024, Turbo and Giga followed suit, jumping 15% and 37%, respectively, after their listing roadmaps were revealed.

The price surge was attributed to the so-called “Coinbase Effect,” where tokens often experience price boosts when added to the exchange’s roadmap or listings, only to stabilize afterward.

Meme coins—crypto based on internet jokes, memes, or cultural references—have seen significant popularity in recent years.

One of the most influential platforms driving this trend is Solana-based meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, which, since its launch in January 2024, has spawned 8.5 million meme tokens, Dune Analytics data shows.

The Securities and Exchange Commission under President Donald Trump’s administration recently clarified its stance on meme coins, saying such tokens typically do not qualify as securities under U.S. law.

Meme coins ""do not generate a yield or convey rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business,"" and thus do not fall under its jurisdiction, the SEC said.

Describing the rise of meme coins as “modern value creation,” Tracy Jin, COO of crypto exchange MEXC, told Decrypt that in 2025, ""the flagship of decentralized freedom is no longer Bitcoin, but an entire category of cryptocurrencies: meme coins, which started as simple jokes.""

However, Jin warned, ""Optimism should be met with a dose of caution,"" as the market faces new risks and uncertainties.

While meme coins offer “significant opportunities for traders and investors worldwide”, Jin said, “the green light” for meme coin launches comes with high trading risks, requiring investors to increase their research and analytical efforts.

Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon has requested an Interpol Red Notice for Hayden Davis, creator of the collapsed LIBRA token

The LIBRA token was shared by Argentine President Javier Milei, quickly reaching a $4 billion valuation before crashing

Davis reportedly made approximately $100 million from the token before its collapse

Retail investors lost an estimated $251 million while insiders profited

Legal actions are increasing with allegations of fraud and market manipulation

An Argentine lawyer has formally requested an international arrest warrant for Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the controversial LIBRA cryptocurrency token. The memecoin caused a political scandal in Argentina after being promoted by President Javier Milei.

Gregorio Dalbon submitted the request to prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and judge María Servini. These officials are currently investigating President Milei’s involvement in the memecoin project.

The legal filing asks for an Interpol Red Notice to be issued for Davis. An Interpol Red Notice requests law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition.

Dalbon argued that Davis poses a “procedural risk” if he remains free. He claims Davis has access to vast amounts of money that would allow him to flee or hide.

The petition specifically notes Davis’s “central role in the creation and promotion of the $LIBRA cryptocurrency.” It states this increases the likelihood he might try to evade justice.

Dalbon previously represented former Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in a corruption case. His request specifically asks for Davis’s arrest and extradition.

Libra Token Scandal

The LIBRA token gained massive attention after President Milei shared it across his social media accounts on February 14. This presidential mention happened just minutes after the token’s creation.

The token quickly reached a peak value exceeding $4 billion. However, the price soon crashed when the token’s creators, who held most of the supply, sold their holdings.

Many critics claim the token was a pump-and-dump scheme. The rapid rise and fall left many investors with major losses.

Davis and his firm, Kelsier Ventures, were reportedly the biggest winners from the LIBRA token launch. In an interview with YouTuber Stephen Findeisen (known as “Coffeezilla”), Davis claimed he made around $100 million.

Davis defended the token as a failure rather than a scam. He claimed he didn’t own the tokens and wouldn’t be selling them.

Reports later emerged that Davis sent a text message bragging about paying President Milei’s sister, Karina Milei. The payment was allegedly to have the president share the memecoin’s details on X (formerly Twitter).

Davis later denied these claims. He said he had no record of such messages on his phone and denied making payments to the Milei family.

The scandal has triggered multiple legal actions. Various lawyers have filed fraud charges against President Milei in Argentine criminal court for promoting the token.

Other lawyers have reported the president for financial crimes to local authorities. Some have even taken complaints to the US Justice Department.

President Milei has defended himself by claiming he didn’t “promote” the LIBRA token. He insists he just “spread the word” about it.

$251 Million in Losses

Blockchain analysis firm Nansen reported that retail investors suffered losses of $251 million. Meanwhile, wallets linked to Davis and another figure named Kelsier extracted major profits before the collapse.

Blockchain investigator Bubblemaps found evidence of market manipulation. They cited tactics such as “sniping” – using bots to buy tokens early and control liquidity.

Davis admitted to these tactics. He claimed they were designed to prevent an immediate collapse and reinvest liquidity once President Milei resumed promoting the token.

Investigations have linked the LIBRA team to other controversial crypto projects. Reports indicate connections between LIBRA insiders and a project called MELANIA.

The LIBRA team reportedly discussed launching a similar token with the Nigerian government. This raises concerns about repeated exploitative crypto ventures across multiple countries.

The scandal has caused shake-ups in the crypto industry. Ben Chow, co-founder of the decentralized finance platform Meteora, recently resigned amid the controversy.

As of the most recent reports, the LIBRA token was trading at $0.06435, down over 12% in a 24-hour period. The price continues to decline as the legal and financial fallout intensifies.",blockonomi

PEPE was the biggest gainer among top 100 coins with a 15.85% price increase and over $1 billion in 24-hour trading volume

Three major PEPE whale wallets have purchased a combined 689.79 billion PEPE tokens worth $4.3 million through TornadoCash, a privacy protocol. The purchases happened as technical indicators suggest a possible price rebound for the popular meme cryptocurrency.

The largest purchase came from wallet 0x7A7D, which bought 437.7 billion PEPE for $2.72 million (1,413.4 WETH). Wallet 0x9212 added 158.58 billion PEPE for $1 million, while wallet 0x7779 acquired 93.51 billion PEPE for $574,000.

These large buys show growing confidence in PEPE’s market outlook. When whales make such moves, they often reduce available supply and can create upward price pressure.

Trend Reversal?

The timing aligns with technical signals pointing to a potential trend reversal. The TD Sequential indicator has triggered a buy signal on PEPE’s daily chart, which many traders view as a reversal indication.

PEPE’s daily price closed at $0.00000597, marking a 4.74% increase. This price movement adds weight to the bullish case forming in the market.

The recent low of $0.00000525 might represent price exhaustion, suggesting the downward pressure could be ending. Combined with the buy signal, these factors strengthen the reversal thesis.

If buyers continue to enter the market, PEPE could target $0.00000620 in the short term. A breakout above this level might push prices toward the $0.00000640-$0.00000660 range.

However, traders should watch for possible rejection at these levels. If rejected, PEPE might consolidate between $0.00000540 and $0.00000580 before making another move.

The PEPE/ETH chart also shows interesting developments. Analysts have noted that PEPE is gaining strength against Ethereum despite ETH’s downward trend, showing price decoupling.

This divergence suggests investors may be moving funds from larger cryptocurrencies into meme coins like PEPE. They may be seeking better short-term returns in the current market.

One analyst identified a “massive daily bullish divergence” on the PEPE/ETH chart. This technical pattern occurs when price moves opposite to an oscillator, often signaling a coming trend change.

Based on this breakout pattern, the analyst predicts PEPE could see a price increase of over 50%. Current momentum appears to support this bullish outlook.

Transaction volume will be key to sustaining any upward movement. Large PEPE transactions have been relatively flat since February 2025, ranging between 400-600 trades before dropping to 278 on March 11.

The recent 7-day high of 304 large transactions still represents low activity compared to previous periods. For PEPE to move consistently above $0.00000060, increased whale activity would likely be needed.

At the time of reporting, PEPE is trading at $0.000007230, up 15.85% in the past 24 hours. Trading volume has exceeded $1 billion, representing a 13.41% increase, indicating growing market interest.

The meme coin currently ranks as the top performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market value. This performance comes amid broader volatility in the cryptocurrency market.

A breakdown below the recent low of $0.00000525 would likely negate the buy signal. In that scenario, further selling could push PEPE toward $0.00000495 or lower.",blockonomi

The SEC plans to drop its lawsuit against crypto influencer Ian Balina over his promotion of Sparkster (SPRK) tokens in 2018

Balina allegedly received a 30% bonus on his $5 million investment but didn’t disclose this to followers

The case is one of many crypto enforcement actions the SEC has stopped pursuing since January 2025 following the Trump administration’s arrival

Sparkster previously settled with the SEC for $35.1 million over unregistered securities violations

The shift suggests a new, potentially more crypto-friendly approach from the SEC under acting Chair Mark Uyeda

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its case against crypto influencer and Token Metrics CEO Ian Balina. The case was related to his promotion of Sparkster tokens during the 2018 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom.

Balina announced the news to Cointelegraph on March 11. He stated that the SEC had informed him they would recommend the court dismiss the case filed in 2022.

The SEC originally accused Balina of violating securities laws. The complaint alleged he promoted SPRK tokens without disclosing he received a 30% bonus on his $5 million investment.

🚨 SEC CASE DROPPED. WE WON. The SEC dropped its case against @DiaryofaMadeMan A huge moment for crypto and a possible shift in enforcement trends. The future of crypto is transparency and data-driven research. We’ll keep leading the way at @TokenMetricsInc. Thanks to… — Token Metrics (@tokenmetricsinc) March 12, 2025

This bonus arrangement was not shared with Balina’s social media followers. At the time, he had over 100,000 YouTube subscribers who followed his crypto investment advice.

The case had been moving through the legal system for years. In May 2024, a judge ruled that “SPRK tokens qualify as securities” under the SEC’s oversight.

Balina’s legal team had planned to appeal this decision. A jury trial was initially set for January 2025 but was later postponed.

The dropping of the case wasn’t cheap for Balina.

“It cost a lot of money in terms of legal fees, which definitely sucks,” he told Cointelegraph.

Balina credits the change to the new administration’s priorities. He specifically mentioned President Donald Trump’s appointment of acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda following Gary Gensler’s departure in January.

“Obviously, the new administration is pro-crypto,” Balina said. He added that the “time has ended” for crypto regulation through enforcement actions.

This case is not unique. Since January, the SEC has stopped pursuing investigations against several crypto companies including Robinhood Crypto, Gemini, Uniswap, and OpenSea.

The commission has also dropped cases against other major crypto players. This includes Coinbase, Consensys, Kraken, and others.

The SEC still has an open case against Ripple Labs. This involves an appeal following a $125 million judgment from August 2024.

The Sparkster project itself previously settled with the SEC in 2022. Without admitting wrongdoing, CEO Sajjad Daya agreed to several terms.

These included destroying remaining tokens, requesting their removal from exchanges, and publicly posting the SEC’s order. Sparkster also paid $30 million in disgorgement, $4.6 million in interest, and a $500,000 civil penalty.

The $30 million represented the full value of the ETH raised during the ICO. Daya reportedly failed to cash out before the crypto market crashed.

By the time he finally sold the ETH, he received just $900,000. This was far less than the original fundraise value.

The Sparkster token launch was troubled from the start. The price dropped 92% on its first day of trading.

Investors who had bought in based on Balina’s promotion turned against him. They blamed him for hyping a project that collapsed immediately upon launch.

Some critics suggest the crypto industry has gained influence with the Trump administration. They point to industry support for Republican candidates in the 2024 election.

President Trump recently hosted a crypto summit at the White House on March 7. Many industry leaders who supported “pro-crypto” candidates attended.

Representatives from companies like Robinwood, Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken were present at this meeting. Many of these are the same companies that have seen enforcement actions dropped.

The SEC declined to comment when contacted by Cointelegraph about Balina’s case. As of publication, no official court filing requesting dismissal had appeared in the docket.",blockonomi

Rumble purchased 188 Bitcoin for $17.1 million at an average price of $91,000 per coin

The company previously announced plans to allocate up to $20 million to Bitcoin

CEO Chris Pavlovski views Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation

Tether invested $775 million in Rumble late last year

Rumble joins other public companies holding Bitcoin despite recent crypto market volatility

Video-sharing platform Rumble has purchased 188 Bitcoin for $17.1 million. The Nasdaq-listed company made the announcement on March 12, 2025, revealing it paid an average price of $91,000 per coin.

The purchase follows through on Rumble’s earlier promise to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. In January, the company had stated its intention to allocate up to $20 million of its cash reserves to the cryptocurrency.

Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski explained the move as part of the company’s growing involvement in the crypto industry. He pointed to Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation.

“These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies,” Pavlovski said in a press release.

The company began its Bitcoin buying on January 20, 2025, which coincided with President Trump’s inauguration day. However, Rumble did not disclose the amount purchased during that initial round.

Rumble’s announcement clarified that future Bitcoin purchases would depend on several factors. These include market conditions, Bitcoin’s price movements, and the company’s cash flow requirements.

The video platform stated that its “Bitcoin allocation strategy may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.” This gives the company flexibility to adjust its approach based on changing market dynamics.

Tether’s Stake

Rumble’s move into cryptocurrency comes with strong financial backing. Late last year, stablecoin issuer Tether took a $775 million stake in the video-sharing platform.

Of Tether’s investment, $250 million will be directed toward growth initiatives. These initiatives include the development of Rumble’s cloud services division.

Rumble has been expanding its cloud services business. On January 10, the company signed a cloud services agreement with the Government of El Salvador.

The platform also hosts former President Donald Trump’s social media app Truth Social. This connection has raised Rumble’s profile among conservative users in the United States.

The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced volatility following the post-election rally. Bitcoin prices have faced downward pressure due to recession fears and concerns about inflation from the new administration’s proposed tariffs.

Despite this market turbulence, institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to grow. Rumble now joins other public companies like Metaplanet that hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries.

Rumble’s stock reacted positively to the news. After closing down 2.38% in the previous trading session, shares were up nearly 4% in pre-market trading to $8.10.

The company’s decision to hold Bitcoin represents a trend of public companies treating cryptocurrency as a legitimate financial asset. As inflation concerns persist, more corporations may follow Rumble’s approach to treasury management.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Increases Despite 30% Market Correction,https://blockonomi.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-increases-despite-30-market-correction/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 09:50:37 GMT","TLDR

Bitcoin’s mining difficulty continues to rise despite a 30% market correction

Current data suggests miners are holding onto their Bitcoin reserves rather than selling

Stablecoin transfer activity has increased, potentially indicating market absorption

Binance whales appear to be reducing their selling pressure

Mining difficulty adjustment could lead to miner capitulation, potentially adding new downward pressure

Bitcoin mining difficulty continues to rise despite the recent market downturn, showing resilience in the network even as prices have dropped below $85,000.

This trend, along with changing patterns in whale selling and stablecoin transfers, points to a complex market situation where miners appear to be holding onto their Bitcoin rather than selling at lower prices.

Bitcoin has shown small signs of a potential reversal after a bearish trend. The cryptocurrency has recorded a 2.6% increase, with its price currently at $83,510. Despite this short-term uptick, Bitcoin remains down by about 7.5% over the past week.

While Bitcoin struggles to regain higher levels, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain has spotted an important trend in mining activity. The mining difficulty has stayed in an uptrend even as the market undergoes a 30% correction since March 2024.

During the extended correction phase, mining difficulty saw a temporary drop. This led some to think it resembled the end of the 2021 cycle. However, contrary to those predictions, Bitcoin’s price rebounded sharply.

Historically, a decline in mining difficulty has been linked to miners shutting down less efficient rigs. This often signals broader market distress. The current data suggests miners have not yet begun offloading large amounts of Bitcoin.

The miners appear to be holding onto their reserves rather than selling at lower prices. Another key metric, the Miner Position Index (MPI), previously showed signs of selling pressure in November 2024.

This selling activity did not lead to a major market downturn, according to the CryptoQuant analyst. Instead, miners seem to be maintaining a holding strategy. This suggests that the broader uptrend remains intact.

If Bitcoin’s correction extends further, a decrease in mining difficulty could signal miner capitulation. As of now, the network remains strong. This resilience is a positive sign for the market.

Stablecoin Transfers

CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet has observed a surge in stablecoin transfers. This trend typically does not occur while Bitcoin’s price is declining. It usually happens after a drop, during a market consolidation phase.

Large-scale investors could be absorbing market shocks through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. This reduces the impact of further price declines. Increased activity in stablecoin transfers, combined with a rise in active Bitcoin addresses, signals heightened network participation.

This pattern has historically indicated spot accumulation. Such accumulation can serve as a precursor to price recoveries. If it continues while sentiment remains low, the market could see a short squeeze that forces a rapid upward price movement.

While miners show strength, there’s another side to the market. According to CryptoQuant’s community analyst Darkfost, whale activity on Binance is showing signs of decline. Binance handles some of the largest Bitcoin trading volumes.

The exchange whale ratio, which tracks the proportion of top inflows to total inflows, is decreasing. High values of this ratio typically indicate increased selling pressure from large holders. A decreasing ratio suggests whales are not selling as much Bitcoin.

Reversal?

This pattern has previously signaled market stabilization or the beginning of bullish trends. If it continues, it could indicate the recent market correction is nearing its end. This metric has acted as a leading indicator of potential trend reversals.

Despite positive signs from whale activity, miners may introduce new pressure. CryptoQuant verified author Axel Adler Jr. noted that miners are experiencing conditions similar to those seen after recent Bitcoin difficulty adjustments. These conditions often precede miner capitulation.

The current state of miners resembles the post-halving period following the most recent difficulty adjustment.

Such moments can be seen as potential macro capitulation points for miners, when they are forced to sell their accumulated Bitcoin to cover operating expenses. This,… pic.twitter.com/S2dUB7iBqs — Axel 💎🙌 Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) March 12, 2025

Miner capitulation happens when miners must sell Bitcoin to cover operational costs. This typically occurs when mining profitability declines due to rising costs or falling prices. When miners sell their holdings, additional supply enters the market.

This additional supply could counteract any reduction in selling pressure from whales. The extent to which miners will sell in the current environment remains uncertain. Their activity will be key in determining Bitcoin’s short-term price movement.

Bitcoin currently remains below $85,000, with its price at $83,510. Despite the recent price struggles, the continued uptrend in mining difficulty suggests underlying network strength. The market appears to be in a phase of readjustment as different participant groups react to current conditions.",blockonomi

Chainlink (LINK) reached a critical 644-day support trend line after falling from its $30.95 December high to $11.87 in March 2025

A Chainlink whale sold 356,665 LINK coins ($4.59 million) on March 13, sparking investor concerns

Technical indicators show mixed signals with bearish weekly trends but potential short-term bounce indicated on daily charts

LINK price has shown resilience with a 2% gain despite the whale selloff, closing at $13.15

CEO Sergey Nazarov was a featured speaker at the first White House crypto summit, discussing stablecoins and regulatory clarity

Chainlink (LINK)’s price has declined to test a long-term support trend line that has been in place for 644 days.

The cryptocurrency fell from its December 2024 cycle high of $30.95 to a 2025 low of $11.87 on March 11, invalidating its previous breakout above the $22.50 resistance level.

Adding to market concerns, a Chainlink whale made headlines by selling 356,665 LINK tokens worth approximately $4.59 million on March 13. The sale occurred at an average price of $12.88, according to on-chain data shared by Onchain Lens.

In the past 48 hours, a whale has sold 356,665 $LINK for $4.59M $USDC at an average price of $12.88. Currently, the wallet holds 7,693 $LINK worth $101,533. Address: 0xc6f7fc2735ef7eb0db201dd103f2f2e6cbcfe187 pic.twitter.com/dlIAJPy7TL — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) March 13, 2025

Despite these pressures, LINK has shown some resilience. The price recovered slightly with a 2% gain in the past 24 hours, closing at $13.15 as the broader crypto market eased following cooler U.S. inflation data.

The technical picture for Chainlink presents mixed signals. On the weekly timeframe, indicators are largely bearish. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) are trending downward.

The RSI has fallen below the 50 level. The MACD has formed a bearish cross. These signals typically point to continued downward momentum in the weeks ahead.

Wave analysis also suggests a bearish outlook. The recent price action forms what appears to be an A-B-C structure, indicating the previous rise was likely a relief rally. This pattern often precedes further downward movement.

However, the daily chart offers some hope for LINK investors. The price decline has been contained within a descending parallel channel. Such patterns often lead to eventual breakouts.

Currently, Chainlink is trading near the support line of this channel. Both the daily RSI and MACD are showing bullish divergences, which frequently precede upward price movements.

If LINK does bounce from current levels, the first resistance would be at the channel’s midline around $16.30. The second resistance level sits at the channel’s upper boundary near $20.50.

The whale that sold the large amount of LINK still maintains a position of 7,693 tokens. This suggests the seller hasn’t completely lost faith in the asset despite the large liquidation.

Market Analyts

Market analyst “Bitcoin Buddha” expressed optimism about Chainlink’s prospects. The analyst noted that LINK “seems to be recovering after testing support near $12” and suggested this could pave the way for further gains if the recovery continues.

$LINK seems to be recovering after testing support. I'm optimistic about the possibility of a new all-time high in this cycle. LFG @chainlink DYOR – NAFA pic.twitter.com/xiB9V70LVj — Bitcoin Buddha (@Bitcoin_Buddah) March 12, 2025

Another analyst indicated that a future price target of $45 remains possible if Chainlink maintains key support between $6 and $9. This would represent a new all-time high for the token.

Sergey Speaks

On the fundamental side, Chainlink received positive attention when CEO Sergey Nazarov spoke at the first-ever White House crypto summit. He discussed the growing importance of stablecoins and the need for regulatory clarity in decentralized finance.

Nazarov emphasized that Chainlink uniquely supports these objectives. He followed this appearance by delivering a keynote speech at the Ondo Finance Summit on March 10.

The current price action leaves Chainlink at a critical juncture. A breakdown below the long-term support trend line would confirm a bearish trend has begun. However, a bounce and breakout above the descending channel could invalidate this bearish outlook.

Traders and investors are closely monitoring LINK’s price movements in relation to broader market trends. The next few days may prove decisive for Chainlink’s medium-term direction.

The short-term price behavior will likely be influenced by whether the token can hold above the long-term support trend line that has defined its bull run since June 2023.",blockonomi

XRP price surged 18% to $2.24 after inflation data strengthened expectations for a Fed rate pause

Derivatives markets show bullish sentiment with rising open interest and 2.49 long/short ratio

Traders eyeing potential breakout above $2.50, with possible targets at $2.76 and $3

Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit reportedly nearing resolution, removing a key obstacle for XRP

Franklin Templeton joins other firms in race for XRP ETF, adding institutional interest

Ripple’s digital asset XRP has shown strong recovery in recent days, climbing from lows near $1.90 to reach $2.24. This 18% price jump came as market participants grew more confident about the Federal Reserve’s next move. Let’s look at what’s driving this momentum and where XRP might be headed.

The recent price increase coincided with several positive developments. New inflation data showed that prices are rising at a slower pace than expected. The February Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in at 2.8%, down from January’s 3%.

This cooling inflation has changed how traders view the Fed’s upcoming decision. According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, there’s now a 99% chance the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged at its March 21 meeting.

This outlook marks a shift from earlier concerns. Last week’s disappointing jobs report had raised fears about a possible recession. Those worries now appear to be fading as the inflation picture improves.

XRP traders are responding to this changing landscape. The token opened at $2.24 on Thursday, its highest level this week. This represents an 18% rise from Tuesday’s low of $1.90.

Market data shows growing confidence among traders. Derivatives statistics reveal open interest has increased by 3.48% to $3.05 billion. This suggests traders are holding their positions rather than closing them.

Options trading for XRP has seen even stronger growth. Open interest in options jumped 10.69% to $1.37 million, showing more traders are betting on future price movements.

The ratio of long positions to short positions also tells an interesting story. On Binance, the long/short ratio for XRP stands at 2.49. OKX shows a similar pattern with a 2.14 ratio. This means more than twice as many traders are betting on price increases versus decreases.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis shows XRP attempting to break above the $2.34 resistance level. This price point lines up with the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). If buyers push through this barrier, the next target could be $2.60.

For a stronger rally, XRP would need to overcome resistance near $2.50. This would require more trading volume to sustain the upward momentum. If successful, traders see potential for XRP to reach the $3 mark.

On the downside, if XRP fails to hold above $2.24, selling pressure could return. The lower support level sits around $1.92, where buyers might step in again.

Beyond market conditions, XRP faces a key legal situation. The long-running lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC appears to be approaching resolution. Recent reports suggest the case may be wrapping up soon.

The delay reportedly centers on a $125 million fine proposed by the SEC. There’s also discussion about restrictions on Ripple selling XRP to institutional investors. A resolution would remove a major obstacle that has limited XRP’s growth.

Despite being delisted from some U.S. exchanges due to the lawsuit, XRP has maintained strong interest. Franklin Templeton has joined Grayscale, WisdomTree and others in pursuing an XRP ETF. This signals growing institutional interest in the asset.

Ripple is also expanding its business operations. The company is working on a DFSA license to enable blockchain-powered crypto payments. These developments could support higher valuations if the legal situation is resolved favorably.

The combination of improving macro conditions and possible legal clarity has created a more positive outlook for XRP. Many traders believe these factors could help XRP reach double-digit prices in the coming year.

For now, XRP continues to navigate between technical resistance and support levels. The token is consolidating between $2.03 and $2.27 as traders await the next major catalyst.",blockonomi

North Korean hackers stole over $1.3 billion in crypto across 47 attacks in 2024, double the amount stolen in 2023

North Korea’s Lazarus Group has moved 400 Ethereum (ETH) worth approximately $750,000 to Tornado Cash mixing service on March 13, 2025. Blockchain security firm CertiK detected the transaction and traced it back to the group’s activity on the Bitcoin network.

The Lazarus Group has been connected to many large crypto hacks. They were responsible for the $1.4 billion Bybit exchange hack in February 2025. They were also linked to the $29 million Phemex exchange hack in January.

After the Bybit hack, the group used various methods to hide the stolen funds. They used decentralized exchanges like THORChain that don’t require identity checks. Reports show that around $2.91 billion was moved through THORChain in just five days.

This made it much harder for authorities to track and recover the stolen money. The group has become known for using mixing services and other techniques to launder cryptocurrency after their attacks.

The hacking group has also started a new malware campaign. On March 11, security firm Socket reported that the group had launched six new malicious software packages on the Node Package Manager (NPM) platform.

NPM is a tool used by developers to manage and install JavaScript packages for their projects. The malware, including a package called “BeaverTail,” is designed to steal credentials and crypto wallet data.

Typosquatting

The hackers use a trick called typosquatting. This involves slightly changing the names of trusted software to fool developers into downloading the malicious versions. For example, they might create packages with names very similar to legitimate and widely used libraries.

The malware targets stored credentials in Chrome, Brave, and Firefox browsers. It also specifically looks for data from Solana and Exodus cryptocurrency wallets.

Socket researchers noted that while it’s challenging to attribute this attack with absolute certainty, “the tactics, techniques, and procedures observed in this npm attack closely align with Lazarus’s known operations.”

Fake Zoom Calls

The North Korean hackers have also tried to trick crypto founders with fake Zoom calls. They pose as venture capitalists and send fake meeting links. When they claim to have audio issues, they send victims a supposed fix that actually installs malware.

Security researchers have reported that several crypto founders have encountered these scams. The approach shows how the group adapts their methods to target specific people in the cryptocurrency industry.

The Lazarus Group has a long history of crypto attacks. They were behind the $600 million Ronin network hack in 2022, one of the largest crypto thefts in history.

According to data from Chainalysis, North Korean hackers stole over $1.3 billion in cryptocurrency across 47 different attacks in 2024. This amount is more than double what they stole in 2023.

The increase in both the number and size of attacks shows that North Korean hacking operations are growing. Cybersecurity experts warn that the group continues to develop new methods to steal and launder digital assets.

CertiK and other security firms continue to monitor blockchain transactions to detect suspicious activity. Their work helps exchanges and users be more aware of potential threats.

As these attacks continue, cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms are working to improve their security measures. However, the Lazarus Group’s techniques keep evolving, creating an ongoing challenge for the crypto industry.",blockonomi

Analysts identify $3 as potential target if current support holds

Dogecoin’s Technical Bounce and Network Expansion

Dogecoin’s price has gained 5.38% as it rebounds from a key support level. This comes after a steep 70% decline from its cycle high of $0.479 reached in November 2024.

The popular meme coin is now trading at $0.172. This represents a modest recovery after hitting a low of $0.142 on March 11, 2025.

Technical analysts have identified a bullish pattern forming on the charts. Dogecoin is currently trading inside a descending wedge pattern on the daily timeframe.

This pattern is typically considered bullish. It suggests a potential breakout could occur as the price approaches the end of the wedge formation.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted Dogecoin’s position within a key price channel. “If this support holds, we might see a rebound toward the mid or upper boundary of the channel,” Martinez noted.

$DOGE remains at a key support level within this channel. If it holds, a rebound toward the mid or upper boundary could be in play! pic.twitter.com/iojmu7kIk4 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 13, 2025

The analyst pointed to previous stock RSI bullish crossovers on the weekly chart. These led to price surges of 88% and 187% in October 2023 and February 2024 respectively.

Another bullish crossover appears to be forming now. This technical signal has some analysts setting price targets as high as $3 for DOGE.

Network data shows growing adoption of Dogecoin. The number of new DOGE addresses has doubled over the past month.

This increase from 16,400 to 34,600 new addresses indicates rising interest in the Dogecoin network. It may provide fundamental support for price appreciation.

Despite these positive short-term signals, the weekly chart shows bearish indicators. The price broke down from the $0.215 horizontal support area that had previously acted as resistance in March 2024.

This breakdown suggests Dogecoin’s upward movement may have ended. If the decline continues, the next support level to watch is around $0.110.

Technical indicators on the weekly timeframe remain bearish. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) are falling.

The RSI is below 50. The MACD has made a bearish cross, both considered signs of a bearish trend.

Trader Tardigrade has identified a recurring pattern in Dogecoin price action. According to this trader, DOGE typically forms an initial low as the RSI enters the oversold zone.

#Dogecoin follows the pattern of its last bottom 🔥$DOGE forms an initial low as the RSI falls into the oversold zone, then creates another lower low with a similar RSI reading in the same zone. If history repeats, an upcoming Bull Run is ahead 🚀 pic.twitter.com/zxLPZrfkOq — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) March 12, 2025

This is followed by a second, lower low with the RSI maintaining a similar oversold reading. If this historical pattern holds, Dogecoin could be preparing for an upward move.

The futures market shows increasing interest in DOGE. The open interest has surged more than 4% to $1.40 billion, with 24-hour liquidations exceeding $7.24 million.

Asset managers like Bitwise are pursuing a Dogecoin ETF. This development could trigger major activity for the meme coin if approved.

The current technical setup suggests a potential relief rally in the short term. However, this may be followed by another downward movement unless DOGE achieves a weekly close above the $0.215 level.",blockonomi

SOL price has declined 24.5% over five consecutive days, reaching seven-month lows around $115

Short traders have deployed $730 million in leverage against SOL, vastly outpacing the $93.6 million in long positions

Key support levels at $125 and $120 were broken over the weekend, triggering significant liquidations

The sell-off follows both macroeconomic concerns and Solana-specific factors including the FTX token unlock

Without increased demand, SOL could potentially drop further to $99

Solana’s price has taken a sharp downturn, dropping to seven-month lows amid heavy selling pressure. The cryptocurrency has faced a perfect storm of challenges, combining broader market concerns with specific issues tied to the Solana ecosystem.

SOL began its downward movement when it failed to clear the $155 resistance level. This triggered a fresh decline that mirrored similar drops in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The downward momentum picked up speed as Solana broke below several key support levels.

The price dipped below $140 and $132 support zones. It continued its decline past the $120 mark before finding a temporary low at $114. Since then, SOL has made modest recovery attempts, climbing back above the $120 level.

Technical indicators paint a bearish picture for Solana. The cryptocurrency is trading below both $130 and its 100-hourly simple moving average. A short-term rising channel has formed with support at $124 on the hourly chart.

On the upside, Solana faces resistance near $128. The next major hurdle stands at $130. The $132 level represents the main resistance point, aligning with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward move.

If SOL manages to close above the $132 resistance zone, it could set the stage for a steady increase. The next key resistance would then be $140. Further gains might push the price toward the $150 level.

However, failure to rise above $132 could trigger another decline. Initial support sits near $124. The first major support level is around $120. Breaking below $120 might send SOL toward the $114 zone again.

The recent price action shows SOL has lost 24.5% over five consecutive days. This marks the worst decline in months for the cryptocurrency. Bollinger Bands are expanding downward, with SOL’s price firmly below the midline at $149.13.

Reasons for Decline

Several factors have contributed to Solana’s steep decline. Macroeconomic concerns, including Trump’s trade tariffs and global inflation fears, have weighed on the broader market. The U.S. Non-Farm Payroll data released on Friday sparked another round of sell-offs.

Solana has also faced internal bearish catalysts. The limited price reaction to Trump’s crypto strategic reserve announcement on March 2 failed to provide lasting support. More importantly, the massive token unlock from the FTX estate since March 1 has increased short-term market supply.

Derivatives market data shows a strong bearish sentiment. Short traders have deployed over $732 million in leverage on SOL positions in the past seven days. This vastly outpaces the $93.6 million in active long positions, highlighting a decisive shift in market sentiment.

Long traders have closed their positions in large numbers. SOL traders surrendered over $174 million in long contracts as the price broke below the critical $125 and $120 support levels over the weekend. These liquidations weakened buying support and accelerated the drop.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers at 32.66, approaching but not yet reaching oversold conditions. The RSI’s downward trajectory suggests sustained selling pressure, particularly as it remains below the signal line at 35.91.

Without a meaningful resurgence in demand, Solana appears poised to slip further toward $99 before encountering the next significant support cluster. Any recovery would require bulls to reclaim the $125 level, which could potentially trigger a short squeeze targeting $149.13.

The steep price decline has left many investors wondering whether to hold or sell their SOL positions. With technical indicators leaning bearish and significant short leverage in play, the short-term outlook remains challenging for Solana.",blockonomi

Ethereum price started recovery wave from $1,750 but faces resistance at $1,920

ETH continues to trade below $2,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average

US House passed bill to repeal IRS crypto tax rule, potentially benefiting DeFi projects on Ethereum

Traders have formed a major support cluster at $1,825, with bulls deploying $753 million in leverage

Technical indicators show ETH in downtrend but could rally toward $2,018 if $1,825 support holds

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been struggling to maintain momentum above the $2,000 mark despite some positive developments in the broader market. The digital asset has shown signs of recovery but continues to face hurdles on its path upward.

ETH formed a base above the $1,750 level and started a recovery wave. This recovery push allowed the price to clear several resistance levels including $1,800 and $1,820.

The bulls managed to push the price above the $1,880 level. There was also a move above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,150 swing high to the $1,752 low.

However, the bears seem to be active near the $1,920 resistance zone. This zone has proven to be a tough barrier for Ethereum to overcome in its recovery attempt.

Ethereum price is now trading below $1,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price appears to be facing hurdles near the $1,920 level with a short-term bearish trend line forming.

The next key resistance is near the $1,950 level. This corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,150 swing high to the $1,752 low.

If Ethereum can clear these hurdles, the first major resistance would be near the $2,000 level. A move above this psychological barrier might send the price toward the $2,060 resistance.

Should the upward momentum continue, an upside break above $2,060 might call for more gains. In such a scenario, Ether could rise toward the $2,120 resistance zone or even $2,250 in the near term.

On the downside, if Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support sits near the $1,850 level, with the first major support near the $1,800 zone.

A recent development that could boost Ethereum’s prospects is the US House of Representatives’ vote to repeal an IRS rule. The rule had required decentralized finance brokers to report user transactions similar to traditional securities brokers.

The bill, led by Rep. Mike Carey and Sen. Ted Cruz, secured approval in the House after gaining traction in the Senate. It now moves to President Donald Trump’s desk for final approval.

If approved, this regulatory change could create a more favorable environment for the cryptocurrency sector. It might increase the appeal of various DeFi services built on the Ethereum network, potentially driving demand for ETH.

Bullish Reversal Incoming ?

Despite Ethereum’s current struggle below $2,000, derivatives market positions suggest traders are bracing for a bullish reversal. Data from Coinglass shows bulls deployed $753 million in leverage on ETH long positions, narrowly exceeding the $744 million leveraged on active short positions.

This increase in bullish betting comes even as ETH price has dropped 3% in the last 48 hours. Long leverage exceeding shorts after a prolonged bearish period is often an early signal of an impending bullish reversal.

Technical indicators on the daily chart reveal a persistent downtrend. The 5-day, 8-day, and 13-day Super SMAs continue sloping downward, reinforcing bearish control as Ethereum trades near $1,881.

The Bull-Bear Power indicator at -393.47 highlights extreme selling pressure, confirming the sustained bearish trend. However, a potential bottoming-out scenario could emerge if the $1,825 support level holds.

This $1,825 zone represents the last major accumulation area before the March rally attempt. A rebound from this level could trigger a relief rally toward the $2,018 and $2,111 resistance areas, where previous price consolidations took place.

If leveraged longs continue to outpace shorts, Ethereum could witness short-covering momentum. This might accelerate a recovery above $2,000 and keep hopes of a $2,500 rebound alive in the coming weeks.",blockonomi

A crypto trader lost $215,000 in a sandwich attack while swapping stablecoins on Uniswap v3

The MEV bot front-ran the transaction, leaving the victim with only $5,271 (98% loss) in just 8 seconds

The attacker paid block builder “bob-the-builder.eth” a $200,000 tip and kept $8,000 profit

Same trader may have been attacked 6 times in one day using different wallets, losing over $480,000 total

Uniswap CEO clarified these transactions didn’t use their official interface which has MEV protection

A crypto trader fell victim to a costly sandwich attack on March 12, losing more than $215,000 while attempting to swap stablecoins.

The attack happened on Uniswap v3’s USDC-USDT liquidity pool and highlights the dangers of Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) bots in decentralized finance.

The trader started with $220,764 worth of USD Coin (USDC) to swap for Tether (USDT). What should have been a routine swap between stablecoins turned into a disaster. Within just eight seconds, the victim was left with only $5,271 in USDT.

This represents a loss of nearly 98% of the original value. The attack took place on Uniswap v3’s USDC-USDT liquidity pool, which currently holds about $19.8 million in locked value.

The MEV bot carried out what experts call a “sandwich attack.” This involved the bot front-running the victim’s transaction. The attacker first removed all USDC liquidity from the pool before the victim’s swap went through.

After the victim’s transaction executed at a terrible exchange rate, the bot returned the liquidity to the pool. This type of attack is named for how it “sandwiches” the victim’s transaction between two bot transactions.

Michael Nadeau, founder of The DeFi Report, shared details about how the profits were split. The attacker paid the Ethereum block builder known as “bob-the-builder.eth” a $200,000 tip from the stolen funds. The bot operator kept around $8,000 as their own profit.

Is anyone safe using DeFi? A user on @Uniswap v3 was just sandwiched attacked out of $216k while simply trying to swap $221k USDC to USDT. Mind you, this was a pool that had over $35m of USDC and USDT it. This is insane. How did it happen? An MEV bot front-ran the tx by… pic.twitter.com/cyzu4M6qfz — Michael Nadeau | The DeFi Report (@JustDeauIt) March 12, 2025

This may not be an isolated incident. DeFi researcher “DeFiac” believes the same trader was targeted multiple times on the same day. Using internal tools, the researcher found evidence suggesting the trader was hit by six sandwich attacks in total.

Two other wallet addresses linked to the same trader were also attacked earlier that day. The wallets “0xDDe…42a6D” and “0x999…1D215” lost $138,838 and $128,003 in similar attacks. These attacks happened just minutes apart from each other.

Unknown entity got sandwiched for 714k today on six separate USDC -> USDT swaps. (Traded with 100% slippage allowed.) They swapped 732583.429405 USDC for 18636.232611 USDT. A promised 🧵: pic.twitter.com/0rFNE4DfoP — DeFiac (@TheDEFIac) March 12, 2025

All the attacked transactions followed the same pattern. The funds first moved from Aave, a popular borrowing and lending protocol. Then they were deposited into the same Uniswap v3 USDC-USDT pool where the attacks took place.

Some experts have raised the possibility that these unusually bad trades might be connected to money laundering. 0xngmi, the founder of crypto data dashboard DefiLlama, suggested this could be a method to wash illicit funds.

This theory involves creating transactions that are easy targets for MEV bots. By privately sending these transactions to specific bots, someone could potentially launder money while accepting the losses as a cost of cleaning the funds.

Uniswap CEO

Initially, some critics blamed Uniswap for the incident. However, Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams quickly clarified that these transactions did not come through Uniswap’s official interface.

The Uniswap front-end includes built-in MEV protection features. It also has default slippage settings that would have prevented such losses. Slippage refers to the difference between expected and actual prices in a trade.

Users who access Uniswap through its official interface benefit from these protections. However, those who interact with the protocol through other means may remain vulnerable to such attacks.

This incident serves as a reminder of the risks in decentralized finance. Even when trading between stablecoins, which should maintain steady values, traders can fall victim to technical exploits.

MEV attacks continue to be a problem in the DeFi ecosystem. They allow sophisticated bots to extract value from regular users’ transactions, often without those users even realizing what happened.

Blockchain data showed that the entire attack happened in just eight seconds. This highlights how quickly MEV bots can identify and exploit opportunities for profit at the expense of other users.

The $215,000 loss from this single transaction adds to the growing list of funds extracted through MEV techniques on various blockchains. Similar incidents have happened before, including one where a trader lost over $700,000 in a comparable attack.",blockonomi

While mainstream coins recover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is emerging as a top performer for exponential growth. The operational success of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) occurred during this time period. MUTM tokens are available in Phase 3 presale for $0.02 per token during the present phase.

Phase 3 price increases to $0.025 after the opportunity ends when current phase 3 exists at $0.02. Since its launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) collected $3.2 million through the investments of more than 5500 holders. Analysts project that MUTM assets will experience an astonishing growth rate of 12,020% during the next six weeks and may eventually exceed a value of $7. DeFi gem MUTM displays the potential to become the breakout success of this season as more investors join.

Mutuum Finance: Transforming DeFi Lending

Mutuum Finance has succeeded in attracting many investors through its attractive opportunity structure. Mutuum Finance introduces innovative financial services through its next-generation dual-lending approach which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) smart contracts operate lending pools through the process of receiving USDT stablecoins to issue ETH asset-backed loans.

Users maintain exclusive ownership of their confidential loan arrangements through the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system because it operates without requiring any intermediaries. Users can access maximum security and adaptive operations together with profit generation through current APY rates that reach up to 10% during liquidity provision.

The platform prioritizes both security and transparency by having third-party examine all procedures and implementing open-source smart contracts to build user trust. The platform will stabilize its operations through introducing a stablecoin which backs USD value together with fee-supported token buyback procedures to maintain price stability over the duration.

Stakeholders who can obtain staking rewards gain financial incentives for keeping their liquidity on the platform thus building stronger confidence throughout the system. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 5300 investors.

Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity

Throughout the Phase 3 presale event people may purchase MUTM tokens at their initial value of $0.02. Throughout its 11-staged sale period the MUTM token price growth will expand from $0.02 to $0.06 to create up to 200% investor gains before trading commencement. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens will achieve a price of $3 after the launch becoming a leading DeFi token in 2025. Investors who participated in the first phase and purchase MUTM tokens at the $0.025 price point will receive 75% instant profit and the current MUTM capital now exceeds $3.2 million.

$100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives

Mutuum Finance is set to achieve wider adoption through its prize giveaway of $100,000 for donating ten $10,000 MUTM tokens to users. The site adds more value to users who are capable of attracting new investors as it drives user engagement and community growth rates higher.

Mutuum Finance stands among the top DeFi alternatives as cryptocurrencies start to regain value. Analysts project MUTM’s value to reach $7 at a projected 12,020% rise by six weeks based on existing investors surpassing 5,500 accounts with $3.2M invested. At launch investors who enter during the initial phase will receive double their capital ($0.06) before it reaches an expected value of $3 or more by 2025.

A $100,000 prize draw giving away 10 rewards will motivate people to adopt the system and an extra incentive program runs through referrals. The DeFi project Mutuum Finance demonstrates all the potential to become a breakout success in the market. Don’t miss out.

XRP, bolstered by legal clarity from recent regulatory developments, is positioning itself as a staple in cross-border payments. Meanwhile, Litecoin continues to draw attention as the go-to “digital silver,” solidifying its reputation as a practical and lightweight alternative to Bitcoin.

Both projects represent resilience and reliability, which are highly valued in a volatile market. Investors are eyeing potential surges, particularly with broader network upgrades and increasing adoption on the horizon.

Yet, while XRP and Litecoin promise growth, the real conversation isn’t just about steady progress. It’s about exponential opportunity, and that’s where BinoFi (BINO) steals the spotlight.

BinoFi Looks Beyond the Horizon

While XRP and Litecoin cater to existing crypto use cases, BinoFi is tackling inefficiencies across the entire industry with cutting-edge technology. Analysts are calling it a game-changer for trading, providing solutions that address scalability, accessibility, and cost barriers.

At its core is BinoFi’s hybrid exchange model, smoothly merging the liquidity of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with the independence and security of decentralized platforms (DEXs). This approach is already turning heads, as it resolves long-standing compromises traders often face.

What excites analysts most is the direct cross-chain trading functionality, enabling seamless swaps without bridges. By removing the complexities of multi-chain compatibility, BinoFi positions itself as a unifier in an increasingly fragmented blockchain world.

The 100x Growth Potential

BinoFi’s features are not just speculative; they have garnered tangible investment interest. Its presale alone saw over 10 million tokens sold, in just the first days after the launch, signaling strong early community support. With a listing price of $0.30 and forecasts of scaling well beyond that value, many experts are seeing BinoFi as a rare chance for 100x returns.

This projection isn’t without merit. BinoFi is capitalizing on both market demand and user needs with innovations like gasless transactions using its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet technology. By lowering transaction costs while boosting accessibility, the project appeals to investors and traders struggling with Ethereum gas fees or limited trading options on other platforms.

Why Investors Are Taking Notice

Seasoned investors are drawn to BinoFi because it offers something XRP and Litecoin cannot: next-generation solutions for future market needs. XRP may continue to dominate cross-border payments, and Litecoin might reinforce its position in crypto payments, but BinoFi directly addresses inefficiencies in how crypto is traded across the board.

This timing also plays a crucial role. BinoFi is currently in a phase where the project has demonstrated enough traction to be credible but is still early enough to deliver outsized returns to early entrants.

With a robust roadmap and a rapidly growing user base, it perfectly combines innovation with execution.

Bold Moves for Forward-Thinking Investors

For those who favor projects with proven track records like XRP and Litecoin, the urge to stick with safe, established bets is understandable. However, high rewards often come from early adoption of fresh ideas, and BinoFi is creating an ecosystem that could redefine trading for years to come.

Adding BinoFi to your portfolio isn’t just about chasing quick returns; it’s an opportunity to capitalize on the backbone technology that could reshape crypto markets.

With strong community interest, innovative technology, and huge projected upside, BinoFi offers investors a compelling chance to join one of crypto’s most exciting rising stars. The window is open, but time is critical.

Ourbit, one of the fastest-growing memecoin-focused exchanges of 2024, today announced the launch of Phase 3 of its $BITCH memecoin airdrop campaign. With Phase 1 continuing through March 31 and Phase 2 now completed, Ourbit is allocating 85% of the token’s 1 billion supply directly to community members through this multi-phase airdrop. This airdrop campaign coincides with Ourbit’s debut of the world’s first “SuperCEX,” a hybrid trading model that integrates DEX capabilities with centralized exchange functionality, poised to transcend the boundaries of CeFi and DeFi and reshape how crypto assets are traded.

Prophetic Listings Meets Degen DNA: The Memecoin SuperCEX

While traditional centralized exchanges have kept memecoins at arm’s length, Ourbit has consistently embraced them as a true cultural phenomena that drive expressions of community identity and crypto-native culture. The platform has established itself as a leading hub for memecoin trading because of its comprehensive selection of memecoin trading pairs, industry-leading memecoin liquidity, and its strategic approach – listing tokens like $SPX (up 96x), $VIRTUAL (up 56x), $KOMA (up 49x), and $ACT (up 46x) before their rise.

$BITCH: 85% to the Community, 100% to Degen Energy

From Ourbit’s perspective, memecoins are not simply speculative assets. With $BITCH, Ourbit is acknowledging the central role that memecoins play in onboarding new users to crypto and driving trading volume across the ecosystem. The $BITCH ticker represents the evolution of Ourbit’s beloved iconic “Queen” mascot – the fierce, commanding female figure who has become synonymous with the platform’s degen-first approach to crypto trading. While some centralized exchanges might remain detached observers of memecoin culture, Ourbit understands the unique psychology and motivations of degen traders.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-cnFxSQkhI]

With the total supply of $BITCH being 1 billion, Ourbit is distributing 85% of $BITCH total supply to the community, demonstrating its maximum degen energy. $BITCH represents more than just a token—it serves as a cultural symbol that acknowledges and engages the degen community, which has played a key role in Ourbit’s expansion. This strategic move further solidifies Ourbit’s ambition in forging a new breed of exchange, for the next generation of degen traders.

3-Phase Airdrop: The Ultimate Degen Reward System

The $BITCH airdrop mechanics retroactively reward Ourbit’s early users while incentivizing new user acquisition and high-frequency trading activity for its DEX platform:

Phase 1: February 26th – March 31st, 2025 (ACTIVE)

Retroactive airdrops for Ourbit’s early supporters and users

Existing Ourbit users can visit Ourbit’s dedicated airdrop page at www.ourbit.com/activity/airdrop to check for eligibility for Phase 1 airdrops

Phase 2: March 3rd – March 10th, 2025 (COMPLETED)

Invite & Earn – Users can complete daily tasks and invite others to sign up on Ourbit DEX to accumulate points, with $BITCH distribution determined based on the points earned.

Phase 3: March 13th, 12PM EST (March 14th, 4PM UTC) until all mystery boxes are distributed

Invite & Trade – Mystery box fragments can be obtained through Futures trading, DEX trading, or inviting others to join. These fragments can be used to open mystery boxes, which may contain $BITCH rewards.

Crypto enthusiasts and traders interested in participating in the $BITCH Airdrop Phase 3 can visit www.ourbit.com/activity/airdrop to register for Ourbit’s DEX platform

Redefining Centralized Exchange (CEX) Architecture

Ourbit isn’t stopping with the memecoin launch. The siloed nature of CeFi and DeFi has been a significant barrier to mainstream adoption. Today’s traders shouldn’t have to choose between the speed of centralized platforms and the sovereignty of decentralized protocols. Ourbit has engineered a solution to one of crypto’s most persistent pain points. Its SuperCEX hybrid model is the industry’s first true integration of decentralized exchange (DEX) capabilities into a centralized platform. Ourbit has created the ultimate hassle-free trading experience where it handles all the complexity, so users can focus solely on capitalizing on opportunities.

SuperCEX: Trading Everything On One App

Ourbit’s SuperCEX delivers seamless access to both on-chain and off-chain assets through a single interface, fundamentally transforming how traders discover and access new assets:

https://blockonomi.com,Coldware’s Explosive Growth Provides A New 1000X Opportunity for Solana Investors As SOL Price Dumps,https://blockonomi.com/coldwares-explosive-growth-provides-a-new-1000x-opportunity-for-solana-investors-as-sol-price-dumps/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:12:45 GMT","The cryptocurrency market is always full of opportunities, and for investors who have witnessed the explosive growth of Solana (SOL) in recent years, there’s now a new chance to capitalize on the next big move. As Solana’s price continues to face significant corrections, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a new opportunity, offering Solana investors a potential 1000X return.

Why Coldware (COLD) Is Attracting Solana Investors

Coldware (COLD) offers a solution that is increasingly relevant in today’s blockchain landscape. As DeFi continues to grow in popularity, Coldware provides an intuitive, mobile-first approach that is easy to use and accessible to a wider audience. For Solana investors who may have been burned by recent market downturns, Coldware offers a chance to diversify and potentially earn significant returns through its growing ecosystem.

Moreover, Coldware (COLD)’s ability to integrate PayFi and decentralized finance solutions on mobile devices positions it to become a dominant player in the DeFi space. Solana investors who were initially drawn to Solana’s high throughput and scalability are now seeing similar capabilities in Coldware, but with a more accessible and mobile-centric approach.

Coldware’s $1.5M Presale Signals Big Potential for Solana Investors

Coldware (COLD)’s presale success has raised $1.5M, signaling that this project is gaining traction with investors looking for the next big opportunity. With predictions of a 1000X return for early investors, Coldware presents an attractive option for Solana investors who are seeking growth beyond the current bear market. The momentum behind Coldware’s presale is strong, and as the platform continues to expand, it is poised for massive growth once it is listed on exchanges.

The growth of Coldware’s community and the success of its presale demonstrate that investors see the potential for Coldware to outperform existing projects, including Solana (SOL). As the crypto market matures, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself to become a leading platform for decentralized finance solutions, especially for mobile users.

Solana’s Struggles and the Rise of Coldware (COLD)

Solana (SOL) made headlines in the past for its incredible performance and high throughput, but recently, the blockchain has faced significant challenges. With a 93% drop in weekly revenues and a significant decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity, Solana’s position in the market has weakened. The price of SOL has also experienced a sharp decline, making many investors question the long-term potential of the network.

In the wake of these struggles, Coldware (COLD) has captured the attention of Solana investors who are now seeking better opportunities. Coldware’s innovative mobile-first DeFi solutions offer a fresh perspective for investors who are looking to capitalize on new projects with strong growth potential. With Coldware’s $1.5M presale success and explosive growth, it’s quickly becoming the next big thing in the crypto space, and many Solana investors are now looking to Coldware (COLD) for a 1000X opportunity.

What’s Next for Solana and Coldware?

For Solana investors who are facing uncertainty, Coldware (COLD) offers a fresh opportunity with its mobile-first DeFi solutions. As Coldware continues to attract more investors and grow its ecosystem, it is on track to become one of the most promising platforms in the blockchain space. For Solana investors looking to diversify, Coldware presents an exciting opportunity for future growth, with the potential for a 1000X return as the platform gains traction in the crypto market.

As the market shifts, Coldware (COLD) is positioned to take advantage of growing interest in decentralized finance and mobile accessibility, setting the stage for explosive growth in the coming months. For Solana investors seeking the next big move, Coldware offers the perfect opportunity to get in early and potentially reap massive rewards.

https://blockonomi.com,"Coldware’s $1.5M Presale Momentum Attracts Dogecoin Millionaires To Increase Profits, Coldware To Overtake DOGE",https://blockonomi.com/coldwares-1-5m-presale-momentum-attracts-dogecoin-millionaires-to-increase-profits-coldware-to-overtake-doge/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:10:05 GMT","The world of meme coins is constantly evolving, with investors always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a standout meme coin for years, earning itself a loyal following, with many early investors reaping substantial rewards. But now, a new contender is emerging in the crypto space—Coldware (COLD) —which is attracting attention from Dogecoin millionaires eager to increase their profits.

Coldware (COLD) is riding the momentum of a $1.5M presale, signaling its potential to outperform established tokens like DOGE. As Dogecoin holders diversify their portfolios, they are increasingly turning to Coldware (COLD) due to its innovative approach to mobile-first decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. This is more than just another meme coin—Coldware is set to disrupt the market and could even overtake DOGE in the near future.

Coldware (COLD): A New Era in DeFi

Coldware (COLD) is a mobile-first Web3 platform built to make decentralized finance more accessible to the masses. Its focus on easy integration with smartphones provides a seamless user experience for individuals new to the world of blockchain and DeFi. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, which often require complex setups and desktop-based interfaces, Coldware (COLD) offers a simple way for anyone to access decentralized exchanges (DEXs), stake tokens, and interact with smart contracts—all directly from their smartphones.

For new investors and Dogecoin (DOGE) millionaires looking for the next big opportunity, Coldware (COLD) presents a perfect entry point into the world of decentralized finance. The token’s presale success, already reaching $1.5M, indicates that there is significant demand for its mobile-first DeFi solutions, and the potential for future growth is substantial.

Why Dogecoin Millionaires Are Shifting to Coldware (COLD)

Dogecoin’s meteoric rise over the years has generated a massive following. However, many investors are beginning to see the limits of their initial profits, as Dogecoin (DOGE) has plateaued in recent times. While DOGE has become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world, its potential for explosive gains has become more limited compared to newer projects like Coldware (COLD).

Coldware’s presale momentum is attracting a new wave of investors, particularly those who have profited from DOGE’s past success. The $1.5M presale shows that there’s significant appetite for a new solution in the DeFi space, and Coldware’s innovative mobile-first approach is giving investors a fresh avenue for potential profit. For Dogecoin millionaires looking for the next 100x move, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming the go-to option.

The $1.5M Presale Success: What’s Next for Coldware (COLD)?

Coldware (COLD) is in the midst of a highly successful presale, and its momentum shows no signs of slowing down. With $1.5M raised and strong community support, Coldware is positioning itself to make waves in the cryptocurrency market. As the presale progresses, early investors are expected to see significant returns, with predictions suggesting up to a 1200% increase during the presale stages.

The presale’s success reflects the growing demand for Coldware’s mobile-first DeFi solutions. With a rapidly expanding user base, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a serious competitor in the DeFi space. If the momentum continues, it could eventually overtake Dogecoin, offering even bigger profits for those who got in early.

Dogecoin’s Future: A Strong but Saturated Market

While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, its price growth has slowed in recent years. As a meme coin, Dogecoin’s value has often been driven by social media trends and hype rather than solid technological advancements. Although DOGE continues to hold a strong position in the market, it may not offer the same growth potential that it did when it first rose to prominence.

In contrast, Coldware (COLD) offers more than just meme coin value. With its focus on bringing decentralized finance solutions to smartphones, Coldware is solving a significant problem in the blockchain space—mobile accessibility. By integrating DeFi into everyday mobile devices, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a leader in the next generation of blockchain technology.

What’s Next for Coldware (COLD)?

For investors looking to capitalize on the next big cryptocurrency movement, Coldware (COLD) is one of the most promising opportunities. With a mobile-first DeFi solution, a growing community, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem, Coldware (COLD) is poised to disrupt the market and potentially outpace meme coins like Dogecoin.

As the cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, projects like Coldware (COLD) that focus on user accessibility and technological innovation are likely to lead the way. With its impressive presale success and strong market demand, Coldware (COLD) has the potential to become the next big thing in the world of DeFi, offering investors the chance to capitalize on the future of blockchain technology.

Solana (SOL)

Over the past week, Solana (SOL) has dropped by 13.80%. The past month shows a larger fall of 37.85%. Over six months, the price has decreased by 8.40%. These declines reflect challenging times for the cryptocurrency.

Based on this data, the price might continue to face pressure. The current price ranges between $108 and $162, which is below both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $123.75 and $128.85. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 52.34, indicating neutral momentum. The MACD level is negative at -0.1430, suggesting bearish sentiment.

If SOL can rise to the nearest resistance level at $198, it would represent a significant gain from the current price range. Conversely, dropping below the nearest support at $90 could lead to a decline toward the second support level of $35.70. Traders are watching these levels closely to gauge Solana’s next moves.

Ripple (XRP)

Over the past six months, XRP has surged by 295.05%. However, recent movements show a dip, with a -9.28% change in the last week and -7.12% over the past month. Currently trading between $1.83 and $2.71, the price reflects some volatility in the market.

Technical indicators offer insight into XRP’s potential direction. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $2.19 and $2.20 respectively, suggesting a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index sits at 58.91, below the overbought threshold, indicating possible room for upward movement. The Stochastic value of 61.87 supports this, while the MACD level of 0.01916 hints at bullish momentum.

Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $3.28. Breaking through this could see XRP aiming for the second resistance at $4.16, which would be an increase of over 50% from current prices. On the downside, if the price drops, it may find support at $1.52 or even $0.6352, indicating significant potential decreases. Based on these levels, XRP might continue to experience fluctuations, but the data suggests there could be growth opportunities ahead.

Cardano (ADA)

Cardano (ADA) has experienced significant price fluctuations recently. In the past week, its price dropped by -20.85%, indicating a short-term decline. However, over the past month, the price increased by 9.09%, and in the last six months, it surged by 108.40%. This long-term growth suggests strong underlying momentum.

Currently, ADA is trading between $0.56 and $1.03. The nearest support level is at $0.40, providing a potential floor if prices dip further. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is at $1.33, with a secondary resistance at $1.80. Breaking through these levels could signal further upward movement and potential gains.

Technical indicators show a moderately positive outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 57.84, suggesting the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $0.73 and $0.75 respectively, indicating steady growth. The MACD level is 0.0035, slightly above zero, hinting at bullish momentum. With a Stochastic value of 60.33, there is potential for continued price increases. Based on this data, ADA’s price may rise if it surpasses the resistance levels.

NEAR Protocol (NEAR)

NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has faced price declines lately. Over the past week, its price fell by 11.95%. In the last month, it dropped 22.22%, and over six months, it decreased 41.90%. This downward trend shows bearish market sentiment.

NEAR is currently trading between $2.18 and $3.24. The 10-day moving average is $2.43, below the 100-day average of $2.60, indicating weaker short-term momentum. The RSI is 53.09, suggesting a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator at 45.28 also points to neutrality. The MACD is slightly negative at -0.0041, hinting at possible further declines.

Resistance levels are at $3.94 and $5.00. Rising to $3.94 would require an increase of about 22%. Breaking these could signal a bullish reversal. Support levels are at $1.81 and $0.74. Falling to $1.81 means a decrease of around 17%. If NEAR breaches these supports, it could face more significant drops. Based on current data, unless NEAR gains positive momentum, it may continue to struggle.

Conclusion

While SOL, XRP, ADA, and NEAR are strong choices, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends sports and memes, aiming for massive growth and community-driven success in the upcoming bull run.
