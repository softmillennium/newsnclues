	The spots and stripes familiar to us today didn't arise until later in mammalian evolution

Small mammals during the Mesozoic Era (some illustrated) may have had uniformly dark coloring, allowing them to blend into nocturnal environments.

Zebra stripes? Leopard print? Neither were in vogue among the earliest mammals during the Age of Dinosaurs.

Early mammals and their close relatives probably sported dark, drab coats from snout to tail, researchers report in the March 14 Science. The monochrome ensembles may have helped ancient mammals blend into their nighttime surroundings and evade predators.

Many dinosaurs — especially birds — showcase a vibrant array of colorful feathers. But the diversity of fur color among modern mammals is underappreciated, says Matthew Shawkey, an evolutionary biologist at Ghent University in Belgium. “There's obviously lots of patterns, stripes, spots, blotches, all those types of things,” he says. “But also fairly diverse colors: grays, yellows, oranges.”

Yet very little is known about the evolution of mammals' colors or their presence in the fossil record, Shawkey says. Though pigment-containing structures called melanosomes have yielded details about the bright feathers of extinct birds, details about fossilized mammals' coat colors remain scarce, save for recent evidence of reddish fur in a 3-million-year-old mouse fossil. 

Shawkey and his colleagues used a scanning electron microscope to analyze melanosomes in the hairs of 116 modern mammals, linking their shapes and sizes to the colors they produce. After organizing the known melanosomes by various physical features, the team used statistics to test their ability to predict which colors others would produce. Melanosomes responsible for brighter colors, such as reds and oranges, are rounder, the researchers found, while blacks and browns generally come from elongated melanosomes.

Working with colleagues in China, the team applied this predictive power to melanosomes in preserved hairs from six early mammals and close relatives that lived in China 120 million to 167 million years ago, mostly during the Jurassic Period — the middle phase of the Mesozoic Era. While modern mammals exhibit an extensive range of these pigment-bearing structures, those from the six protomammals fell within a narrow range associated with dark grays and browns across their bodies, suggesting the ancient beasts had the same dark shade throughout. 

The early mammals in this study — like many during the Mesozoic Era — were small creatures much like rodents, shrews or moles. They also appear to have had similarly gray and brown coats. It's not unexpected given the world they evolved in, Shawkey says.

“They were basically dinosaur food,” he says. “They're going to be hiding in the shadows. So it makes sense that they were dark.”

Despite being a mix of gliders, burrowers and scamperers, all the mammals in the study had dull, dark fur. This suggests a nocturnal existence was ubiquitous for Mesozoic mammals and their relatives, regardless of their ecological role.

“I think this is the first good evidence that we have of an antipredation strategy among early mammals,” says Luke Weaver, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved with the research.

Dark, melanin-rich fur may have been useful in other ways. It heats up easily, and potentially helped early mammals stay warm. The dark hairs may have also been particularly tough and wear-resistant, protecting the mammals' skin.

Shawkey notes that the study was limited to six extinct species, leaving the possibility that some early mammals exhibited patterns or bright colors. The team's monochrome hypothesis could be upended, he says, if paleontologists “find a [fossil] rat with a giant orange mohawk.”

Determining when those kinds of fashion statements first arose is a natural next step, Shawkey says. “When do we start seeing spots and these patterns? When do we start seeing light browns and oranges and things like that?”

It's possible the extinction of nonavian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago played a key role. Mammalian diversity exploded in response, and the movement to a wide range of finally-safe daytime habitats may have triggered a broader spectrum of colors, too.

However, Weaver notes, some studies suggest that this diversification might have begun earlier. “There's emerging evidence to suggest that [mammals] might have been diversifying ecologically — and potentially inhabiting more daylight habitats — prior to the extinction of dinosaurs,” he says. Sampling melanosomes from mammals that lived during the late Cretaceous Period, at the twilight of the Age of the Dinosaurs, would be particularly informative. 

Maria McNamara, a paleontologist at University College Cork in Ireland, would like to know if mammals that lived in different biomes or latitudes during the Jurassic Period were similarly dark.

“We need more papers like this to be published,” McNamara says. “It's really important to demonstrate that modern paleontology is much more than describing dusty old bones. It's a thriving analytical science.”

The mummy of a first-century-B.C. individual found in Egypt was not pregnant and did not have cancer, according to a new CT study.

An ancient Egyptian woman thought to have been pregnant and dying of cancer was actually just embalmed with a technique that mimicked these diagnoses, researchers have concluded, settling a four-year scientific debate.

Nicknamed the "Mysterious Lady," the first-century-B.C. mummy was found in the Egyptian city of Luxor (ancient Thebes) but was brought to the University of Warsaw in Poland in 1826. The mummy was not scientifically studied for over a century.

In 2021, experts with the Warsaw Mummy Project concluded that, contrary to their assumption that the mummy was a male priest based on the sarcophagus, it was actually the remains of a woman in her 20s who was 6.5 to 7.5 months pregnant.

In the first published study of the mummy, researchers used X-ray imaging and CT scans to identify several bundles of mummified organs in her abdomen. They also suggested that a poorly preserved fetus, around 28 weeks in gestational age, could be seen on the scans.

In a second study, the research team proposed that the reason no fetal bones could be clearly identified was that the mother's uterus lacked oxygen and had become acidic over time, essentially "pickling" the fetus. And finally, the team suggested that they had found evidence of potentially fatal nasopharyngeal cancer in the mummy's skull.

These interpretations were controversial, however. Radiologist and mummy expert Sahar Saleem told Live Science in 2022 that the Warsaw team failed to "identify any evidence of anatomical structures to justify their claim of a fetus." Instead, Saleem was convinced the mysterious structures in the mummy's abdomen were embalming packs.

To settle the debate, a team of 14 researchers with varied expertise led by archaeologist Kamila Braulińska of the University of Warsaw studied the Mysterious Lady and published their findings in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences last month.

Members of the research team each examined more than 1,300 raw CT image slices of the mummy produced in 2015 to determine whether there was any radiological evidence of a pregnancy or of cancer.

Every expert who reanalyzed the CT scans concluded that there was no fetus and that the material assumed to be a fetus was actually part of the embalming process. Further, the suggestion that the fetus' skeleton and soft tissue did not show up on the scans because the body was "pickled" is impossible, the researchers noted in the study, because acids within the human body are insufficient to dissolve bone, especially after a body is embalmed.

Similarly, none of the experts on the new study could identify clear evidence of cancer in the mummy. Some suggested instead that the damage to the woman's skull most likely occurred when her brain was removed during the embalming process.

Given the diagnostic consensus of the international panel of experts, the researchers concluded in the study that "this should resolve once and for all the discussion of the first alleged case of pregnancy identified inside an ancient Egyptian mummy, as well as the dispute about the presence of nasopharyngeal cancer."

But given the public's intense interest in the "case of the pregnant mummy" over the past four years, the researchers suggested that, going forward, additional focus should be given to questions of maternal and pediatric health in ancient Egypt.

	Helium atoms filled gaps in iron crystals under high pressure and temperature

Under high temperature and pressure, helium atoms (red circles) move into the spaces between iron atoms (red circles with black centers) in a piece of iron metal, as show in this map called an electron localization function.

Scientists have coaxed one of the universe's most stubborn elements into a new compound.

Formed under intense pressures, the newly discovered compound packs helium atoms into crystalline iron, researchers report February 25 in Physical Review Letters. The compound joins a short list of materials that incorporate the normally unreactive element and suggests that helium from the early solar system could be stored in the iron that makes up Earth's core.

Helium is one of the least reactive elements on the periodic table. Like the other noble gases, helium doesn't gain or lose electrons easily and so does not normally form chemical compounds. But under extremely high pressures, helium can interact with a few other elements, including nitrogen and sodium — and now iron, research shows.

To make the new iron compound, physicist Kei Hirose of the University of Tokyo and his colleagues squeezed iron and helium together in a diamond anvil cell, a high-pressure device that subjected the elements to pressures greater than 50,000 Earth atmospheres and temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. This compression formed crystals containing both iron and helium.

The volume of the crystal formed was larger than that of a crystal of pure iron at the same pressure, the team found. The researchers attributed this increase to helium ions packing into interstitial sites, the tiny spaces between iron atoms in the crystal. But the helium atoms don't bond directly to iron — they're too unreactive, even at extreme conditions.

“Helium is very happy as it is. It doesn't want to share an electron,” says Stefano Racioppi, a chemist at The State University of New York at Buffalo. But it can still participate in “chemistry without chemical bonds” to form these ordered, crystalline compounds.

The new compound could help explain observations of helium in Earth's interior, Hirose says. Most of Earth's helium atoms have two neutrons and form from the radioactive decay of elements like uranium. But some ocean volcanic eruptions release helium atoms with just one neutron. These atoms first formed shortly after the Big Bang. Earth picked up this “primordial” helium as the planet formed.

Its loss from magma suggests that the planet has a deep reservoir of primordial helium, and the new compounds suggest that Earth's iron-rich core could hold some of that helium. But the team will need additional experiments to determine whether helium is more likely to reside in Earth's core or higher in its mantle.

“The partitioning of helium between magma, silicate melt and metallic iron is really the key,” Hirose says. If helium is more stable in iron than in the silicates found in the mantle, that would suggest that the helium is more likely to reside in the core — and vice versa.

Computational physicist Ronald Cohen agrees. “I wouldn't say that it's a proof that there's helium in Earth's core, but it suggests that it's possible,” says Cohen, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.

Aside from the geophysical implications, the findings could further expand noble gas chemistry. “I would like to see whether this is unique for iron or if it could also happen to other transition metals,” says Maosheng Miao, a chemist at California State University, Northridge. Forming other helium metal compounds, he says, could lead to “chemistry that we never thought of.”

Rowing machines and treadmills do not challenge your cardiovascular system in the same way, so what is the science behind it?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Rowing and running are undoubtedly some of the most popular forms of cardiovascular exercise. Both activities can send your heart rate through the roof and get your blood pumping, and both have been shown to decrease the risk of developing heart disease and high blood pressure. When it comes to cardiovascular benefits, rowing and running seem to be on equal footing, according to a 2023 study published in the European Heart Journal.

However, there is an interesting twist — evidence suggests that elite rowers tend to have notably bigger hearts compared to elite runners.

Take the landmark 1994 study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, for example. One of the biggest of its kind, it investigated structural and functional changes within the heart of 947 elite athletes representing 27 sports disciplines. Scientists used echocardiography — images of the heart obtained with an ultrasound scan — and found that, of all study participants, rowers had the thickest left ventricular wall.

This is the layer of muscle and connecting tissue surrounding the largest chamber of the heart. Rowers also had some of the largest left ventricles during the resting phase between heartbeats, when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. On the other hand, runners did not seem to display such far-reaching changes to their hearts, the study authors noted.



So how does rowing affect your heart, and is it different from running?

While both of these activities challenge your cardiovascular system, they do not do so in the same way, Dr. Bhaskar Semitha, a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon at Fortis Hospital Vashi in Mumbai, India, told Live Science by email. "[This is why] elite rowers tend to have bigger, stronger hearts compared to elite runners, even when they have similar levels of cardiovascular fitness," Semitha said.

The reason lies in the movement itself. Running predominantly targets your legs. Rowing, on the other hand, is a low-impact exercise that simultaneously engages muscles in your legs, core and upper body.

"Rowing is a full-body workout that demands a high oxygen supply, so the heart has to pump more blood per beat," Semitha said. As such, exercising on one of the best rowing machines may force your heart to pump blood more efficiently than if you opted for a jog on a treadmill.

"Over time, this leads to a lower resting heart rate and a higher stroke volume [the volume of blood pumped from the ventricle per beat.] The heart is working less while delivering more oxygen," Semitha said.

This also leads to a significant increase in VO2 max, the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during exercise, which is one of the key markers of performance in cardiovascular exercise. "That's why you will often see rowers with some of the lowest resting heart rates of any athletes," Semitha said.



Rowing and running elicit different heart rate responses even if these activities are performed at the same intensity, according to a 2002 study published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology. Scientists measured the blood lactate concentration — a biochemical marker of fatigue within exercising muscle — in 55 young, healthy men rowing on a rowing machine and running on a treadmill, and found that their heart rate was consistently lower during rowing even when both these exercises were performed with maximum effort.

Why? Again, it is all about the movement. The seated position during rowing makes it easier for blood to flow from the body's lower extremities back to the heart, scientists concluded.

There is a slight twist to the tale, though. Running, even at moderate intensity, is still more effective than rowing for increasing VO2 max, Sergii Putsov, PhD, a professional weightlifter, researcher and head of sports science at coaching service Torokhtiy Weightlifting, told Live Science. "Running forces your body to work against gravity, amplifying oxygen consumption and utilization. Since rowing is less weight-bearing than running, its overall ability to increase VO2 max is slightly lower for people who do not push themselves to high intensity," Putsov said.



Running also tends to cause more dramatic spikes in heart rate, particularly during high-intensity sprints. "[This is why] running puts more demand on arterial flexibility than rowing," Semitha said. "The repeated impact and fluctuations in intensity force the blood vessels to expand and contract rapidly, which can make arteries more elastic over time and therefore help prevent high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease."

— How running changes your body

So in the rowing vs running debate, which activity wins for cardiovascular benefits? Neither. Both rowing and running are good exercises for boosting stamina and strengthening the heart muscle, according to Putsov.

"However, their effectiveness may depend on your fitness level, specific goals and physical condition," Putsov said. "The full-body nature of rowing helps improve oxygen utilization efficiently without the harsh repetitive impact associated with running. Running, on the other hand, generates repetitive pounding on your joints and requires relatively high initial energy which can be overwhelming for beginners and people with poor cardiovascular fitness."

By: Carlyn Scott, Science Communications Manager

A brown alga called Sargassum has inundated beaches in the Caribbean since 2011, impacting tourism, harming the
                     health of humans and marine life, and costing local governments millions of dollars
                     per year to clean up.

Scientists have been divided on the causes of the phenomenon known as the Great Atlantic
                     Sargassum Belt (GASB). But a new study published in Nature Communications may have identified what drove a tipping point that established this alga in the
                     tropical Atlantic Ocean.

The key drivers were wind, ocean currents, and nutrients, according to the international
                     team of researchers who published the recent study. Specifically, two consecutive
                     years of a strong negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a shift in atmospheric
                     pressure over the Atlantic that changes circulation and wind patterns, pushed Sargassum
                     into the tropics. There it found warm, nutrient-rich waters, and lots of sunlight,
                     all year-round.

“At first, the evidence is that just a few patches of Sargassum were being pushed
                     south by winds and currents during this NAO period of 2009-2010,” said co-author Frank Muller-Karger, Distinguished University Professor and biological oceanographer at the USF College
                     of Marine Science (CMS). “But these algae patches met the right conditions to grow
                     and perpetuate blooms when they reached the area close to the equator.”

Every year, patches of Sargassum come together in the tropical Atlantic, pushed by
                     the Trade Winds into an area where the ocean is rich in nutrients brought up from
                     deeper waters below, explains Muller-Karger. These Sargassum patches form a new, large
                     population in the region that spans from Africa to the Americas.

Authors of the recent paper in Nature Communications use a computer model that helped them to go into more details and test new scenarios
                     than was possible in a prior study published in Progress in Oceanography. That study first identified the possible influence of the NAO on the dispersal of
                     Sargassum. In both papers, researchers used models to simulate the transport of Sargassum from
                     the northern to the southern part of the North Atlantic, testing if the NAO was the
                     root cause of the first bloom that occurred in the tropical Atlantic in 2011.

“Both models showed that some patches of the Sargassum were swept up by the wind and currents from the Sargasso Sea toward Europe, then moved
                     southward, and from there were injected into the tropical Atlantic. There, this population
                     of algae, now separated from the Sargasso Sea, forms new blooms every year thanks
                     to having enough light, nutrients, and warmer temperatures,” said Muller-Karger. 

IMAGE ABOVE: Multiple MODIS satellite images were aggregated to show the typical annual
                           Sargassum coverage and chlorophyll distribution after 2011. Sargassum was moved from
                           the Sargasso Sea to the tropics via currents depicted by arrows. Figure from Jouanno
                           et al. (2025).

These patches enriched with nutrients were identified as a driver of the GASB in a
                     2023 paper published in Nature Communications and co-authored by Chuanmin Hu, professor of physical oceanography at CMS.

Still, the question remained: What provided the nutrients to promote the growth of
                     Sargassum in the tropical Atlantic?   

Popular hypotheses included rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco, Niger, Congo, the
                     Mississippi, or even iron-rich dust from the Sahara Desert. But researchers lacked
                     sufficient data to support any of these theories.

To determine nutrient sources, the group of international researchers again turned
                     to computer models to analyze decades-worth of wind, currents, and three-dimensional
                     nutrient measurements collected in the Atlantic Ocean. These models successfully reproduced
                     the annual blooms.

The model showed that nutrients were supplied via an ocean process known as vertical
                     mixing, in which water masses mix on a seasonal basis due to shifting winds, bringing
                     deeper water that has higher nutrient concentrations to the surface. In this sunlit
                     surface layer photosynthesis occurs and Sargassum grows. This vertical mixing of waters in the tropical Atlantic fuels the massive blooms
                     that eventually ends up on the beaches of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf Coast.

                        Atlantic. The alga was pushed southward and injected into the tropics, where it proliferates
                        today, through a series of currents.  Video from Jouanno et al. (2025). 

“This was a surprising result,” said Muller-Karger. “We had posed the hypothesis before
                     that it is not the rivers that feed the formation of the Sargassum blooms in the tropical
                     Atlantic. This model supports that nutrients from slightly deeper layers in the ocean
                     feed the blooms.”  

Despite the recent and largely negative press Sargassum has received, the seaweed is not new to the Atlantic. Sailors in the 15th century
                     first recorded this Sargassum in the western North Atlantic, which they named the Sargasso Sea. However, the large-scale
                     recurring blooms of Sargassum that flow into the Caribbean every year are a new phenomenon.
                      

Julien Jouanno, lead author of the study and physical oceanographer at the University
                     of Toulouse, emphasized the complex changes in the circulation of the atmosphere and
                     the ocean that led to the transport of Sargassum from the Sargasso Sea to the tropical Atlantic.  

“At this stage, we cannot say for certain whether this abnormal event is a direct
                     result of climate change,” said Jouanno. “There are many moving parts in a computer
                     simulation, and we may still not have good representation of the factors that control
                     Sargassum growth and mortality.”  

Indeed, there are unanswered questions regarding the biology and ecology of Sargassum, and the species present within the GASB remains a mystery. Researchers hope that
                     by investigating the physiology and biology of Sargassum in the Sargasso Sea, they can understand how it might react to environmental changes.

Still, the authors remain hopeful that collaborative efforts can help advance the
                     study of Sargassum.  

“This analysis and the publication highlight the importance of international cooperation
                     in studying and dealing with the ‘Sargassum problem' in the Atlantic,” said Julio Sheinbaum, a physical oceanographer from Center
                     for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CICESE) at Ensenada, Mexico.

This publication was an international collaboration between University of Toulouse, the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education CICESE, Sorbonne University, and the University of South Florida.

Sunburns and aging skin are obvious effects of exposure to harmful UV rays, tobacco smoke and other carcinogens. But the effects aren't just skin deep. Inside the body, DNA is literally being torn apart.

Understanding how the body heals and protects itself from DNA damage is vital for treating genetic disorders and life-threatening diseases such as cancer. But despite numerous studies and medical advances, much about the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair remains a mystery.

For the past several years, researchers at Georgia State University tapped into the Summit supercomputer at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to study an elaborate molecular pathway called nucleotide excision repair, or NER. NER relies on an array of highly dynamic protein complexes to cut out, or excise, damaged DNA with surgical precision.

In their latest study, published in Nature Communications, the team built a computer model of a critical NER component called the pre-incision complex, or PInC. PInC plays a key role in regulating DNA repair processes in the latter stages of the NER pathway. Decoding NER's sophisticated sequence of events and the role of PInC in the pathway could provide key insights into developing novel treatments and preventing conditions that lead to premature aging and certain types of cancer.

“We're interested in the way cells repair their genetic material,” said lead investigator Ivaylo Ivanov, a chemistry professor at Georgia State University. “NER is a versatile pathway that repairs all kinds of different DNA damage using a three-stage process that relies on delicately balanced molecular machinery. Unfortunately, harmful mutations can develop that interfere with this machinery and cause severe human diseases.”

“Yet, the effects of genetic mutations can be strikingly different depending on their positions within the repair complexes. In some cases, mutations result in patients having UV light sensitivity and an extreme cancer predisposition. In other cases, they cause abnormal development and premature aging,” he said. “Why that happens is not completely understood at the molecular level. That's the mystery our computer modeling efforts aim to unravel.”

The three acts of repair

NER unfolds in three distinct stages: recognition, verification and repair. Each stage requires different groups of proteins to perform specific functions, much like a trauma team has different specialists needed to treat injured patients in the emergency room. In that way, the NER machinery can adapt and change its shape depending on the task at hand.

In the first stage, the NER protein XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum group C) acts like a first responder that locates the site of the damaged DNA, or lesion, and then twists the DNA helix to make the damage accessible. XPC then calls in other repair proteins to help initiate the second stage, called damage verification, or lesion scanning.

Here, the NER protein machinery shifts into its next shape. As XPC steps back, the protein complex called transcription factor IIH, or TFIIH (pronounced T-F-2-H), moves into position. TFIIH further unwinds the section of DNA and scans the newly exposed strand for lesions.

After that, it's in the hands of the surgeon — the PInC — in the third and final stage of repair.

With the “patient” stabilized and prepped for surgery, the operation to remove the damaged DNA strand can begin. Two enzymes, XPF and XPG (xeroderma pigmentosum groups F and G), position themselves precisely on each side of the lesion and act as molecular scissors to cut out the damaged segment of DNA.

Once the lesion is removed, new DNA is synthesized to fill in the gap left behind. Finally, the DNA backbone is sealed, and the damaged DNA is restored back to health.

“What we want to know is how the PInC forms after the lesion scanning phase,” Ivanov said. “How does it control the positioning of the two enzyme subunits that perform the dual incision of the damaged DNA strand? And importantly, is there any cross talk between the two enzymes? Do they sense each other?”

“That matters because once the damaged DNA strand is cleaved, it's vital that the repair process is completed by filling in that gap,” he added. “Otherwise, it will lead to cell death or to the introduction of double-stranded breaks, which are extremely harmful to the cell.”

Answering those questions required the researchers to solve the structure of the PInC. In biology, understanding protein structure is essential for understanding the behavior or function of protein assemblies. The shapes, sizes and interactions of proteins determine how they fit together to form large biomolecular assemblies.

“We integrated the structural model of PInC using data from a variety of biophysical techniques, notably cryo-electron microscopy,” Ivanov said. “But in the end, the computation is what puts everything together.”

Much like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the PInC model had to be assembled from known structures of constituent proteins, and all the individual pieces had to be put together in 3D. However, many of the PInC components had no known experimental structures.

To overcome this challenge, the researchers used a neural network-based model called AlphaFold2 to predict the unknown structures and the interfaces between the proteins that hold PInC together.

Summit's final simulations

“Computationally, once you assemble the PInC, molecular dynamics simulations of the complex become relatively straightforward, especially on large supercomputers like Summit,” Ivanov said.

Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics, or NAMD, is a molecular dynamics code specifically designed for supercomputers and is used to simulate the movements and interactions of large biomolecular systems that contain millions of atoms. Using NAMD, the research team ran extensive simulations. The number-crunching power of the 200-petaflop Summit supercomputer — capable of performing 200,000 trillion calculations per second — was essential in unraveling the functional dynamics of the PInC complex on a timescale of microseconds.

“The simulations showed us a lot about the complex nature of the PInC machinery. It showed us how these different components move together as modules and the subdivision of this complex into dynamic communities, which form the moving parts of this machine,” Ivanov said.

The findings are significant in that mutations in XPF and XPG can lead to severe human genetic disorders. They include xeroderma pigmentosum, which is a condition that makes people more susceptible to skin cancer, and Cockayne syndrome, which can affect human growth and development, lead to impaired hearing and vision, and speed up the aging process.

“Simulations allow us to zero in on these important regions because mutations that interfere with the function of the NER complex often occur at community interfaces, which are the most dynamic regions of the machine,” Ivanov said. “Now we have a much better understanding of how and from where these disorders manifest.”

Most of the molecular dynamics simulations were performed on Summit. However, after 6 years of production, Summit was retired at the end of 2024.

Looking ahead, Ivanov and his team plan to use Summit's successor, Frontier, the exascale-class supercomputer that debuted as the world's most powerful supercomputer when it came online in 2022.

Their work on Frontier will involve examining transcription-coupled NER, which is a DNA repair process that fixes damage in actively transcribed genes to ensure that essential proteins can continue being made.

In addition to Ivanov, the research team includes Jina Yu, Chunli Yan, Tanmoy Paul and Lucas Brewer at Georgia State University; Susan E. Tsutakawa and John A. Tainer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chi-Lin Tsai at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; and Samir M. Hamdan at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.
