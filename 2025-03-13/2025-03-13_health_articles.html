1. Why am I using BRUFEN PLUS 200/12.8?

BRUFEN PLUS 200/12.8 contains the active ingredients ibuprofen and codeine phosphate hemihydrate. Ibuprofen belongs to a family of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This group of medicines work by relieving pain, inflammation (e.g. swelling, redness, soreness) and fever. Codeine is an opioid analgesic that works in the brain and spinal cord to relieve pain. BRUFEN PLUS 200/12.8 is used to provide temporary relief of acute to moderate pain and inflammation in patients over the age of 12 years. Once taken, your body processes the codeine into its active form, morphine, in the liver. In about 8% of people, they may experience less pain relief compared to others as their body doesn't convert codeine to morphine very well.

Future directions in dairy and gut health research

Weighing the evidence

Did you know that your daily glass of milk could be shaping your gut microbiome in ways both beneficial and potentially harmful? With increasing research on the influence of diet on the gut microbiome, the debate over dairyâs impact on gut health has become more complex than ever.

Dairy consumption has long been a staple in human diets, providing essential nutrients such as calcium, protein, and probiotics. However, its effects on gut health remain a topic of scientific debate. While some studies highlight the benefits of dairy products in promoting a balanced gut microbiome, others suggest potential adverse effects, including lactose intolerance and inflammation.1

In this article, we critically examine the impact of dairy on gut health, outlining both the beneficial and detrimental effects, as well as the ongoing controversies in scientific research.

The good: Benefits of dairy for gut health

Dairy products, including milk, yogurt, and kefir, play a significant role in promoting gut health through various mechanisms. Consumption of dairy products has been associated with an increase in beneficial bacterial genera such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.1

These probiotics are known to improve metabolic balance, modulate the immune system, and regulate inflammation. Components such as lactose and milk proteins, including casein and whey, serve as substrates that stimulate the growth of these beneficial bacteria. For instance, lactose possesses a prebiotic index similar to other known prebiotics, fostering the proliferation of beneficial gut bacteria.1

Certain dairy products have also been shown to suppress the growth of pathogenic bacteria. For example, yogurt consumption has been linked to a reduction in the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis, a pathogenic strain associated with gastrointestinal disturbances. This suppression contributes to a healthier gut microbiota composition, potentially reducing the risk of infections and inflammatory conditions.1

Milk also contains bioactive components such as casein, Î±-lactalbumin, Î²-lactoglobulin, and lactoferrin, which are known to protect the gut against various threats, including biological, chemical, mechanical, and immunological challenges, thereby maintaining the integrity and function of the gut barrier. A robust gut barrier is essential for preventing the invasion of dietary pathogens and toxins, which can cause severe intestinal inflammation.2

Furthermore, fermented dairy products like yogurt and kefir are rich in live active cultures that can colonize the gut, enhancing microbial diversity and stability. Regular consumption of these products has been associated with an increased abundance of beneficial bacteria and improved gut health.3,4 Research suggests that regular consumption of probiotic-rich dairy products may help balance gut microbiota, potentially reducing the risk of gastrointestinal diseases and metabolic disorders.5

Studies have also reported that lactic acid bacteria can enhance immune responses, improve gut barrier function, and contribute to the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease.3

Moreover, dairy-derived bioactive peptides and postbiotics may further support gut health. Fermented dairy products are also rich in postbiotics, which include beneficial enzymes and metabolites that can exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects.4

Another significant advantage of dairy is its contribution to gut integrity through calcium. Calcium is essential for maintaining tight junctions in the gut lining, reducing intestinal permeability, and preventing leaky gut syndrome.6

Furthermore, certain dairy products contain prebiotic components such as oligosaccharides, which serve as food for beneficial gut bacteria, further promoting microbial diversity and digestive health.7

The bad: Potential adverse effects of dairy

Despite its benefits, dairy consumption is not without potential drawbacks. Lactose intolerance, which is believed to affect approximately 65% of the global population, results from a deficiency in lactase, the enzyme required to digest lactose. The condition leads to symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain after dairy consumption.8

Additionally, dairy allergies, particularly to casein and whey proteins, can trigger immune responses ranging from mild gastrointestinal discomfort to severe allergic reactions. Dairy protein digestion also plays a role in gut health, with some individuals experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort due to inadequate protein breakdown and the formation of bioactive peptides that may influence gut motility.8

Emerging research suggests that dairy consumption may influence gut inflammation, although the findings remain inconclusive. Some studies indicate a potential link between high dairy intake and increased gut permeability, leading to systemic inflammation. However, other studies have indicated that there is no significant association between dairy intake and markers of gastrointestinal inflammation in healthy adults.9

Furthermore, certain dairy components, such as saturated fats and hormones in full-fat dairy, may contribute to inflammatory responses and metabolic disorders, though this remains a subject of ongoing investigation.10

The controversy: Conflicting research on dairy and gut health

The scientific community remains divided regarding the long-term effects of dairy on gut microbiota. Some research indicates that dairy consumption can enhance beneficial bacterial populations, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which play a crucial role in maintaining gut health.1

Conversely, other studies suggest that dairy might negatively impact gut microbiota diversity, particularly in individuals with dairy sensitivities.5

The role of full-fat versus low-fat dairy products further complicates the debate. While full-fat dairy has been associated with higher microbial diversity and potential anti-inflammatory effects, some researchers argue that it may contribute to metabolic and cardiovascular issues when consumed in excess.11

Similarly, dairy processing methods and the presence of added sugars in flavored dairy products can also influence gut health outcomes. Additionally, the presence of antibiotics and hormones in conventionally produced dairy products has been a growing concern, as these factors may disrupt gut microbial balance and contribute to antibiotic resistance in the human microbiome.10

Moreover, the impact of dairy on conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohnâs disease also remains controversial. While some studies suggest that fermented dairy products may alleviate symptoms, others indicate that dairy elimination diets improve gut health in sensitive individuals.6

These conflicting findings indicate that more research is needed to determine the specific dairy components responsible for these effects and to understand how they interact with individual gut microbiomes.

Future directions in dairy and gut health research

Given the complexity of dairyâs impact on gut health, future research needs to focus on personalized nutrition approaches that account for genetic, microbiome, and lifestyle factors. Advances in microbiome sequencing and metabolomics could help identify specific biomarkers that predict an individualâs response to dairy.

Additionally, long-term, randomized controlled trials comparing different types of dairy products â fermented versus non-fermented, full-fat versus low-fat, and conventional versus organic â could provide more definitive answers regarding the role of dairy products in gut health.

Another promising area of research involves the development of dairy alternatives that retain probiotic and prebiotic benefits while minimizing adverse effects.

Emerging technologies in food science, such as the fermentation of plant-based dairy substitutes with probiotic cultures, may offer new solutions for individuals with dairy sensitivities.

Weighing the evidence

Overall, the body of evidence indicates that the relationship between dairy and gut health is complex and highly individualized. While dairy can offer significant benefits through probiotics, calcium, and bioactive peptides, potential risks such as lactose intolerance, allergies, and gut inflammation should not be overlooked.

The available scientific evidence suggests that individuals with no intolerance or allergies can safely consume dairy, particularly fermented dairy products, to support gut health. However, those experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort may benefit from limiting or eliminating dairy and exploring plant-based alternatives.

Moreover, further research is needed to clarify the impact of dairy on gut microbiota and inflammatory responses, particularly through long-term, well-controlled human studies. Until then, personalized nutrition approaches should guide dairy consumption decisions, ensuring that dietary choices align with individual gut health needs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the top questions I am asked repeatedly is how to safely send a child with food allergies to school, particularly those first years of preschool and kindergarten. My boys are now in middle school, and in hindsight, I can tell you with certainty that those early school years were the hardest to manage.

At that age, children are still putting everything in their mouths. Kids are really too young to fully understand their food allergies or advocate for themselves. And the mess! It is age-appropriate for youngsters to eat and play while leaving a path of destruction behind them. This is all fine, unless, of course, the mess includes your childâs food allergen.

Thankfully, Iâm far on the other side now. That said, I still clearly remember my fear, stress, and worry during those years. A big part of the problem was that I didnât know what to request of the school in order to make the classroom as safe as possible for my boys. How could I, as a first-time preschool parent and first-time food allergy parent? However, I have learned so many important lessons. Iâm happy to share my top three tips with you about how to safely get your child with food allergies through the first school years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center have found a new way to boost cancer immunotherapy by targeting a protein called macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, or MARCO. Their study, published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer, shows that blocking MARCO in combination with a type of immunotherapy known as anti-CTLA4 therapy, significantly enhances tumor regression in melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer.

The researchers found that inhibiting MARCO changes the behavior of certain immune cells in the tumor, leading to more immune cells entering the tumor and making the anti-CTLA4 therapy more effective. This new approach could help overcome resistance to current treatments, especially in tumors that usually have few immune cells, known as "cold" tumors.

Our findings provide strong evidence that targeting MARCO can enhance the effectiveness of existing immunotherapies without requiring macrophage depletion. This discovery paves the way for new combination treatment strategies that could improve outcomes for patients with melanoma and potentially other cancers." James MulÃ©. iPh.D., associate center director for Translational Science at Moffitt and lead author of the study

The study highlights that the combination of an anti-MARCO monoclonal antibody with anti-CTLA4 therapy significantly increases immune cell infiltration, including conventional dendritic cells, a key factor in activating a robust anti-tumor immune response. This effect was not observed when MARCO was targeted alongside anti-PD1 therapy, emphasizing the importance of this approach in boosting anti-CTLA4 treatment.

These findings open new avenues for clinical research, with potential applications in treating patients who do not respond to current immunotherapy options. The study also suggests that incorporating MARCO-targeting strategies into neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings may help reduce cancer recurrence risks by enhancing immune priming within the tumor microenvironment.

This study was supported by the National Cancer Institute (P30-CA076292).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People's social connections play a critical role in determining whether they adopt preventative health measures that could help to reduce the spread of diseases such as malaria, a new study reveals.

Researchers focused on malaria prevention in 10 villages in rural India - looking at how different factors influence people's use of preventative measures like bed nets, insect repellent and protective clothing.

The scientists discovered that exposure to similar behaviors within a person's social network is the most significant factor in predicting individual prevention behaviors. Furthermore, their study highlighted the indirect influence of households as crucial contexts for social ties.

Publishing their findings in Scientific Reports, researchers from the Universities of Birmingham and Manchester, the Indian Institute of Public Health Shillong, New York University, and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health outline a novel framework to understand how social factors influence disease prevention.

Social networks can either help or hinder disease prevention efforts that rely on a combination of behaviors. For example, if your friends and family use insect repellents, you are much more likely to use them yourself. This suggests that health behaviors are heavily influenced by our social connections and are not just the outcome of individual choices. By understanding how social networks influence behavior, we can develop more effective public health interventions." Dr. AndrÃ¡s VÃ¶rÃ¶s, Co-author, University of Birmingham

The study involved detailed interviews with over 1,500 adults in the Meghalaya state of Northeast India, gathering information about their health practices and social networks to help develop a new assessment framework that combines social network analysis with research on multiple health behavior change.

While the research focused on malaria in India, the implications extend to various diseases and populations globally â the approach provides a valuable framework for developing more effective public health strategies around the world to help prevent infectious and non-communicable diseases.

Households are critical for shaping health-related discussions â the researchers note that people tend to discuss health matters with those within their own household, which means that the information and practices shared at home have a large impact.

Individual characteristics like age, gender or education - as well as advice from health experts - appear to have a much smaller direct influence on whether people adopted preventative measures.

"We found that people do not necessarily adopt prevention behaviors in bundles, but rather tend to simply adopt ones which are common among the people they talk to," explained Dr VÃ¶rÃ¶s. "Exposure to preventative behaviors within someone's social network is the main factor influencing whether they adopt those same behaviors.

"In other words, if your friends and family use insect repellents, you are much more likely to use them yourself. This suggests that health behaviors are heavily influenced by our social connections and are not just the outcome of individual choices."

The researchers say that instead of focusing solely on individuals, public health programs should recognize and utilize the power of group influence - for instance, public health campaigns could focus on educating and supporting community leaders and influential people who can then act as a channel to promote health behaviors among their social circles.

They also highlight the importance of household level interventions - this means targeting entire families, rather than individuals, which could result in more effective prevention strategies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>High-grade glioma, an aggressive form of pediatric and adult brain cancer, is challenging to treat given the tumor location, incidence of recurrence and difficulty for drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier.

Researchers from the University of Michigan, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and the Medical University of Vienna established a collaborative team to uncover a potential new avenue to address this disease.

A study, published in Cancer Cell, shows that high-grade glioma tumor cells harboring DNA alterations in the gene PDGFRA responded to the drug avapritinib, which is already approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors with a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation as well advanced systemic mastocytosis and indolent systemic mastocytosis.

We were excited to see that avapritinib essentially shut off PDGFRA signaling in mouse brain tumors." Carl Koschmann, M.D., ChadTough Defeat DIPG Research Professor and clinical scientific director of the Chad Carr Pediatric Brain Tumor Center at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital

Aside from surgery and radiation, there aren't effective drugs to treat high-grade gliomas, especially upon recurrence. Koschmann and his collaborators targeted PDGFRA, which is one of the most commonly mutated genes, as a potential inroad to discover new drug therapies.

"We'd been doing screens with a lot of commercially available drugs that inhibit PDGFRA. We found avapritinib to be the strongest and most focused inhibitor that targets PDGFRA alterations," Koschmann said.

Along with colleagues from the labs of Mariella Filbin MD, PhD (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) and Johannes Gojo (Medical University of Vienna) who were investigating the effectiveness of PDGFRA inhibitors, Koschmann and his team were excited to see that avapritinib crosses the blood brain barrier, a normally high hurdle for drugs.

"When we gave mice the drug and showed that it reached the brain, we knew we were onto something," explained Kallen Schwark, a U-M M.D./Ph.D. student and one of the study's lead authors.

The team was able to treat some patients with high-grade glioma through an expanded access program established by Blueprint, while a clinical trial was not yet available.

"Across multiple international institutions, we treated the first eight patients with high-grade glioma with avapritinib," Koschmann explained.

"The patients tolerated the drug well and in three of the eight patients, we were able to see their tumors shrink."

This early data and preclinical data helped provide the basis to include pediatric high-grade glioma in a phase I pediatric solid tumor trial, which recently completed accrual, and for which analysis is underway.

"We have very few examples of drugs entering brain tumors like this and shutting down key oncogenic pathways. These results support a lot of ongoing efforts to build on the success of avapritinib and other brain penetrant small molecule inhibitors," Koschmann continued.

High-grade gliomas are very aggressive, with a prognosis of less than two years and limited treatment options. Though this work is preliminary, Koschmann is hopeful that avapritinib could be an additional tool to help patients.

"We know a single drug is not going to be enough for this disease," he said.

"The way to make true progress will be combining many different types of modalities, like combining drugs that are target pathways activated by the first drug. We already have a follow-up story on targeting avapritinib with MAP kinase inhibitors that we are just as excited about."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A discovery by Mayo Clinic researchers may help explain why immunotherapy hasn't been helpful for many patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In findings published in Clinical Cancer Research, the team identified specific proteins - fibronectin and smooth muscle actin - within colorectal cancer tissues that are associated with resistance to immunotherapy treatment.

Immunotherapy is a major advance in treating cancer, but many patients, including those with metastatic colorectal cancer, do not respond to it. Until now, researchers have not known why.

We need predictive biomarkers to guide the selection of immunotherapy for patients. Identifying those who may have resistance to treatment can be useful, because then we can spare them from receiving treatment that may not be beneficial and could produce significant toxicities." Frank Sinicrope, M.D., medical oncologist, gastroenterologist, senior author of the study

The research team used digital spatial profiling, an advanced technology that simultaneously analyzes the expression of multiple proteins and where they are located within tissues. This approach allowed researchers to zoom in to get a bird's eye view of a tumor that includes proteins both within and surrounding the tumor cells and how they interact.

Dr. Sinicrope compares the spatial tools to an aerial view of a neighborhood where one can see relationships between driveways, houses, yards and neighboring structures. Similarly, this detailed view provides physicians and researchers with critical information about the proteins in and around a patient's cancer, potentially informing the best treatment for the patient.

"We wanted to learn more about the patients who did not respond to immunotherapy. We investigated the leading edge of the tumor where cancer cells are invading and where the immune system is attempting to fight the cancer," says Dr. Sinicrope. "It's like a battle going on here and we're getting a snapshot into who is in attendance."

The researchers focused on 10 regions at the invasive margin of a tumor. They applied digital spatial profiling to investigate 71 distinct proteins in both the tumor's epithelial compartment and the surrounding stromal compartment. Fibronectin and smooth muscle actin are two extracellular matrix proteins that were found in the epithelial region of the tumor and were associated with resistance to immunotherapy and shorter time before disease progression.

Upon further analysis, the researchers observed that cancer-associated fibroblasts were producing these proteins. The evidence, they say, suggests that these proteins can contribute to suppression of the anti-tumor immune response.

The discovery offers a step toward more personalized and effective colorectal cancer treatments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers conducting a clinical trial of immunotherapy drugs for people with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) found that patients responded better to a combination of two immunotherapies than patients who received just one immunotherapy drug.

The scientists also analyzed immune cells in each person's tumor after one month of immunotherapy to see which type of immune cells were activated to fight their cancer, suggesting that some of the cells and targets they identified could help individualize treatment benefit.

The findings appeared March 13, 2025 in Cancer Cell.

HNSCCs occur in the oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, nasal cavity and salivary glands and comprise the seventh most common cancer diagnosis worldwide. With an estimated 890,000 new cases and 450,000 deaths occurring annually, HNSCC accounts for roughly 4.5% of cancer diagnoses and deaths worldwide.

Current HNSCC treatments can be disfiguring and negatively impact a patient's quality of life. Shrinking a tumor prior to surgery increases the chance that a surgeon can preserve a person's tongue and voice box, which are important for speaking, breathing and swallowing.

My group has conducted pre-operative trials in head and neck cancers for over 15 years, and the ability to shrink tumors with existing drugs prior to surgery has been relatively disappointing. While a recent trial has shown that single-drug immunotherapy provides a benefit, it only worked in a small number of patients." Robert L. Ferris, MD, PhD, executive director of UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center

"In our clinical trial, we compared two different combinations of immunotherapy drugs to using a single immunotherapy drug, and found that either combination regimen doubled or tripled the response rate versus the single immunotherapy, and led to a survival benefit. Up to a third of patients who received two drugs saw over 50 percent of their tumor disappear after only one month of treatment."

Ferris started the research while on faculty at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, then completed it after being appointed as the executive director of UNC Lineberger and system chief of oncology services at UNC Health in June 2024.

Others from the Ferris group included Lazar Vujanovic, PhD, of UPMC Hillman, as second corresponding author. Housaiyin Li and Dan P. Zandberg, MD, a graduate student and medical oncologist at UPMC Hillman, respectively, are the first authors.

The study randomly assigned 42 patients (one would later withdraw consent) to three immunotherapy treatment arms: nivolumab alone, nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab plus relatlimab. Both immunotherapy combinations appeared to perform equally well. The researchers attribute this to the drugs activating tumor-specific T lymphocytes, a type of immune T cell that specifically recognizes and attacks cancer cells. Even after surgical removal of a treatment-shrunken tumor, the T lymphocytes remain alive and circulating in patients' bodies, providing surveillance that can increase long-term survival benefit.

"In this trial, we were able to specifically identify biological signatures that helped us decide which immunotherapy combination was best to use. The Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3, or LAG-3, protein was a good marker for some people while the CTLA-4 protein was a good marker for others," Ferris said. "The immune status or markers a patient might have at diagnosis can help dictate which regimen is best to select for their treatment, and because of this marker's promise, we have filed a patent for our diagnostic paradigm."

Based on their discovery that the outcomes of the two different immunotherapy combinations appear similar, Ferris and his colleagues have extended this trial to include another 40 patients. They are also using a higher dose of relatlimab. They hope to see even better responses and longer survival in the expanded trial, which is ongoing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease or dementia, so identifying those with cognitive issues early could lead to interventions and better outcomes. But diagnosing MCI can be a long and difficult process, especially in rural areas where access to licensed neuropsychologists is limited.

To increase accessibility to cognitive assessments, a team of researchers at the University of Missouri created a portable system to efficiently measure multiple aspects of motor function. The device is simple and affordable, combining a depth camera, a force plate and an interface board.

The interdisciplinary team of Mizzou researchers includes Trent Guess, an associate professor in the College of Health Sciences, Jamie Hall, an associate teaching professor in the College of Health Sciences, and Praveen Rao, an associate professor in the College of Engineering. In a recent study, the team examined older adults, some of whom had MCI, and asked them to complete three activities: standing still, walking and standing up from a bench. The catch? Participants had to complete these activities while counting backwards in intervals of seven at the same time.

Based off their performance, which was captured by the new portable system, the data was fed into a machine learning model - a type of artificial intelligence - that accurately identified 83% of those in the study with MCI.

The areas of the brain involved in cognitive impairment overlap with areas of the brain involved in motor function, so when one is diminished, the other is impacted as well. These can be very subtle differences in motor function related to balance and walking that our new device is able to detect but would go unnoticed through observation." Trent Guess, Associate Professor, College of Health Sciences, University of Missouri

With the number of Americans with Alzheimer's disease expected to more than double by 2060 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the portable device has the potential to help millions of older adults given that MCI is one of the precursors to Alzheimer's and dementia.

"Alzheimer's disease is a significant problem here in the U.S. We know that if we can identify people early, we can provide early intervention to halt or slow the progression of the disease," Hall said. "Only about 8% of people in the U.S. who are believed to have MCI receive a clinical diagnosis."

Hall added the team's long-term goal is get the new portable system into various settings such as county health departments, assisted living facilities, community centers, physical therapy clinics and senior centers to allow for more screenings.

"There are new drugs coming out to treat those with MCI, but you need a diagnosis of MCI to qualify for the medications," Hall said. "Our portable system can detect if a person walks slower or doesn't take as big of a step because they are thinking very hard. Some people have more sway and are less balanced or are slower to stand up when they are sitting. Our technology can measure these subtle differences in a way that you could not with a stopwatch."

Guess will continue the research with additional participants and also look at the portable system's ability to detect fall risk and frailty among older adults.

"This portable system has many other applications, too, including looking at those with concussions, sports rehabilitation, ALS and Parkinson's disease, knee replacements and hip replacements," Guess said. "Moving is an important part of who we are. It's rewarding to see that this portable system can be beneficial in a lot of different ways."

And those participating in the study are invested in the research, Hall added.

"Many of those who came in to be tested either have been diagnosed with MCI or have a family member who has Alzheimer's disease, so they feel strongly about helping us move this forward," Hall said. "It really amplifies why this is so important to me."

"Feasibility of using a novel, multimodal motor function assessment platform with machine learning to identify individuals with mild cognitive impairment" was published in Alzheimer's Disease and Associated Disorders. Funding was provided by the University of Missouri Coulter Biomedical Accelerator, which provides internal funding for engineers and clinicians at the university interested in working together to develop devices that improve society.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hydrogen and methane breath tests (HMBT) are a noninvasive diagnostic tool commonly employed to evaluate small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and issues with carbohydrate malabsorption, such as lactose and fructose intolerance. While this technique is frequently used in adults, its application in children is not as standardized, leading to uncertainties regarding the adoption of adult protocols for the pediatric population.

The following article discusses the use of HMBT in children, presents the key considerations for interpreting results, and examines the most reliable available guidelines, particularly the 2017 North American Consensus.

Background and current challenges to HMBT

SIBO and carbohydrate malabsorption, such as lactose and fructose intolerance, can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms in children and adults, such as bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malnutrition. In pediatric clinics, nutritional deficiencies that fail to thrive present a significant challenge. Since children need a steady intake of nutrients for proper growth, precise diagnosis is particularly important in this demographic.

Although the demand for HMBTs in children is critical, there is a notable lack of literature focused on this age group, forcing testing clinics to depend on the more established consensus guidelines for adults. Adapting adult HMBT protocols for children presents major challenges due to variations in gut physiology, metabolic rates, and transit times.

The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) has released guidelines for pediatric breath testing; however, these guidelines have limitations, such as inconsistencies in test execution, absence of pediatric-specific threshold values, and variability in the interpretation of results. This has resulted in a reluctance to adopt these guidelines in clinical practice fully.

Consequently, many experts suggest adhering to the 2017 North American Consensus guidelines, even though they were primarily created for adults. The North American Consensus provides more comprehensive guidance that can be tailored for pediatric applications with careful attention.

Testing protocols and dosages for children

Despite the lack of pediatric-specific guidelines, a dependable approach is to use the same substrates and dosages recommended for adults. For instance, the North American Consensus suggests using:

Lactulose: 10 g or 15 mL for diagnosing SIBO

Lactose or fructose: 25 g for diagnosing intolerance

It is crucial to recognize that while these dosages are suitable for adults, they may be excessive for children. For instance, a 25 g dose of lactose is approximately the same as drinking 500 mL of milk, which could be too much for a child and may result in false positives. As a result, clinicians need to be careful when interpreting positive results and should always consider the child's capacity to absorb these amounts.

Just like in adults, it is essential to prioritize ruling out SIBO before assessing for intolerance in children. SIBO can lead to secondary malabsorption and intolerance, meaning that addressing SIBO could alleviate symptoms of carbohydrate intolerance.

This is especially critical for pediatric patients, as diagnosing lactose intolerance can significantly limit the vital nutrients necessary for healthy childhood development.

SIBO testing and the role of methane

Lactulose is generally used as the substrate to test for SIBO. Lactulose is fermented by the bacteria in the small intestine and is a non-absorbable sugar, producing hydrogen (H 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) because of the fermentation. The consensus suggests using a 20 ppm rise in H 2 from the baseline as the threshold for diagnosing SIBO.

Although this threshold was designed for adults, it can also serve as a cautious guideline for pediatric populations. It is considered conservative because if the test returns negative for SIBO after administering an adult dose of lactulose, SIBO can be excluded. In children, a positive result for SIBO might stem from rapid oro-caecal transit due to a shorter gastrointestinal tract or faster gut motility.

Thus, a positive result is not definitive unless a pediatric oro-caecal transit study verifies the timing of lactulose transit for that specific patient to aid in interpretation.

Methane detection in children: Thresholds, prevalence, and clinical implications

Detecting CH 4 is crucial in hydrogen and methane breath testing (HMBT) for identifying intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO). Elevated CH 4 production is associated with slower gastrointestinal motility, which contributes to constipation, a common issue in children with IMO.

High CH 4 levels indicate the presence of methanogenic flora and underscore the need for targeted treatments to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating and malabsorption, especially in children whose growth and nutrient absorption are vital.

One key factor in interpreting breath test results in children is oro-caecal transit time, which does not seem to affect CH 4 analysis. Unlike H 2 production, which can vary with rapid transit, CH 4 detection remains unaffected by how quickly food moves through the small intestine.

This makes CH 4 results more reliable in adult and pediatric populations, reducing the likelihood of false positives or negatives related to gut transit time. When considering CH 4 thresholds, it is important to recognize the differences in methanogen prevalence between children and adults.

Research, including one by Vanderhaeghen et al. (2015), demonstrated that children typically possess a lower prevalence of methanogens such as Methanobrevibacter smithii. The study's findings indicated that 65% of children had detectable levels of methanogens compared to 89% of adults, and the relative abundance of methanogens in children was lower (0.15% vs. 0.52%).

Despite this lower prevalence, it does not mean that CH 4 production is consistently low among children with detectable methanogens. Those children may still produce CH 4 levels similar to adults since the metabolic activity of Methanobrevibacter smithii is influenced more by substrate availability than by species prevalence. Although fewer children may test positive for CH 4 , those who do might produce significant amounts.

The same study highlighted that children who host methanogenic species tend to produce less CH 4 , suggesting that using adult thresholds could lead to underdiagnosis. Therefore, applying the 10 ppm threshold for CH 4 in children is considered a conservative approach, preventing overdiagnosis of methanogen overgrowth.

Given these findings, maintaining the adult threshold of 10 ppm for CH 4 in children seems wise, as it minimizes false positives. A positive result can be confidently viewed as evidence of CH 4 overproduction, potentially linked to conditions like IMO.

However, negative results may still create uncertainty, as the lower prevalence of methanogens in children means that the absence of detectable CH 4 does not completely rule out overgrowth in those with small but metabolically active populations.

Testing for lactose and fructose intolerance

Once SIBO or IMO has been ruled out, lactose and fructose intolerance testing can be conducted. The same dosages used in adult testingâ25 g of lactose or fructoseâmay be used in children. Due to shorter oro-caecal transit times in children, there is a heightened risk of false-positive results.

Clinicians should consider that a 25 g dose may exceed a childâs typical absorption capacity, leading to test results that do not accurately reflect their usual dietary intake. This could also lead to false-positive test results that do not necessarily reflect the childâs usual dietary intake, which may only involve smaller quantities of these sugars.

Generally, a negative result is more reliable, even with the high adult doses of substrates and the potential for rapid transit or reduced absorption in children.

Oro-caecal transit time and confirmation of results

A challenge in interpreting breath test results, particularly in children, is determining whether an increase in H 2 or CH 4 genuinely indicates SIBO or merely reflects normal oro-caecal transit.

Scintigraphy can confirm oro-caecal transit time, allowing clinicians to ensure that the timing to reach the caecum aligns with the breath test's expectations. This step is vital for preventing false positives and enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

Limitations of alternative tests for lactose intolerance

Genetic testing (LCT gene) and intestinal biopsies are alternative methods some clinicians consider for diagnosing lactose intolerance. While genetic tests can help identify congenital lactase deficiency (CLD), they have limitations. Acquired lactose intolerance, the most common type, is not uniformly detectable through genetic testing, as lactase production can vary along the intestinal lining. Similarly, biopsies may yield false-negative or false-positive results depending on the sampling site. LCT testing does not aid in monitoring treatment responses or dietary changes, and not all individuals with a positive LCT test are genuinely lactose intolerant.

Another diagnostic method is the lactose tolerance test (LTT), which measures blood glucose levels after lactose ingestion. If lactose is properly digested, blood glucose should rise. However, this test is not standardized for children and varies considerably in execution and interpretation, making it less reliable than breath testing in pediatric populations.

HMBT offers distinct advantages over these methods. It provides a non-invasive way to directly measure H 2 and CH 4 gases produced by undigested lactose fermentation in the colon. This method effectively detects lactose malabsorption, whether congenital or acquired, and allows for monitoring treatment or dietary response, offering a comprehensive approach to managing lactose intolerance.

Conclusion and future directions

HMBT is one of the most reliable diagnostic tools for assessing SIBO and carbohydrate malabsorption. While no definitive pediatric protocol exists, the North American Consensus guidelines are a solid foundation for adapting adult protocols for younger patients.

Clinicians should exercise caution when interpreting positive results, especially when substrate doses may be excessive for children or when quicker oro-caecal transit could lead to false positives. Ruling out SIBO or IMO should always be the initial step, as addressing these underlying conditions often alleviates intolerance symptoms.

Ultimately, HMBT remains the most practical method for diagnosing SIBO and carbohydrate malabsorption in pediatric patients. However, further research is essential to refine protocols, establish pediatric-specific thresholds, and enhance testing accuracy and interpretation for this vulnerable population.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National No Smoking Day is observed in the UK annually on the second Wednesday of March, which falls on the 12th of March 2025. Launched on Ash Wednesday in 1984, this day seeks to promote awareness about the risks associated with smoking and motivate smokers to quit, emphasizing the benefits of living a smoke-free life.

Smoking poses significant health risks, impacting most organs in the body. Smokers significantly elevate the risk of developing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), lung cancer, and heart disease.

The positive aspect is that quitting smoking results in immediate and long-term health benefits, lowering health risks and enhancing well-being overall. While quitting can seem overwhelming, the right resources and support can make the process more manageable and increase the likelihood of success without unnecessary stress.

Why quit smoking?

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a harmful gas found in cigarette smoke and is inhaled when smoking. Once inhaled, CO is absorbed into the bloodstream, reducing oxygen levels and increasing the risk of heart disease.

However, improvements can be observed in as little as 8 hours after smoking the last cigarette.

Eight hours after the last cigarette, oxygen levels will begin recovering, and CO levels in the bloodstream will drop by half.

48 hours after, CO levels will be decreased to those of a non-smoker. 1

Two weeks to three months after, lung function and circulation will improve. 2

After nine months, there will be a reduction in coughing and shortness of breath, and your lungs will recover. 2

One year after your last cigarette, the risk of coronary heart disease is halved. 2

Five years after your last cigarette, your risk of many types of cancer is reduced.2

Smoking also has significant financial impacts. If you smoke the average amount of cigarettes a day (11.1), you could save Â£1,239 after six months of not smoking based on the cheapest price of a pack of cigarettes.2

Healthcare impact

Smoking also places a significant burden on the NHS as resources are stretched from more GP visits and health complications due to smoking. It is believed that eliminating smoking could free up 75,000 GP appointments every month, enabling healthcare professionals to concentrate more on preventive care and other important matters.3

UK âSmokefreeâ by 2030

In 2019, the UK government set an ambitious target to make England âSmokefreeâ by 2030, aiming to lower adult smoking rates to 5% or below.4 This initiative is part of a larger strategy focused on proactive, predictive, and personalized prevention, which also involves plans to gradually increase the legal smoking age, ensuring that anyone born after 2008 cannot legally buy tobacco.

The government announced additional measures in January 2024 to support these efforts to enhance public health, especially among youth. By the end of 2025, disposable vapes will be prohibited to limit their availability to children.

New regulations will also introduce plain packaging and restrictions on sweet-flavored vapes, which tend to attract younger users. These actions are designed to address smoking and vaping rates, steering the country toward a smoke-free future.

What help is available?

Quitting smoking can be difficult, and various resources aid smoking cessation. This ranges from support groups to stop-smoking clinics. Here are some of the available options to help stop smoking:

NHS stop smoking services

Free expert support, advice, and resources offered by the NHS Smokefree service

Personalized plans to stop smoking can be found at the Local Stop Smoking Clinics, along with medication access.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)

Nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, nasal sprays, and inhalers help reduce withdrawal symptoms from smoking.

NRT is available on prescription or over the counter and provides a controlled dose of nicotine without the harmful chemicals in cigarettes.

CO devices

CO devices provide real-time feedback on CO levels in exhaled breath.

CO devices can help reduce cigarette consumption, according to research, giving them the motivation to quit.

The SmokerlyzerÂ®

The SmokerlyzerÂ® is a CO device used to measure the amount of CO in a personâs exhaled breath. By providing real-time CO readings, people can measure their progress during a quit attempt with the SmokerlyzerÂ®. The instant feedback the device provides can help detect relapses and reinforce progress. As a result, the SmokerlyzerÂ® makes quitting smoking more structured, motivating, and achievable.

The SmokerlyzerÂ® can be combined with a remote BluetoothÂ® device, the iCOquitÂ®, allowing users to track their smoking cessation efforts from their homes. The device can be used with the iCOquitÂ® app, available on Google Play and Apple App Store.

Users can monitor their CO levels from a distance and share their results with smoking cessation advisors, friends, and family. This feature offers visual encouragement and lets users track their quitting journey in real-time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Converting one type of cell to another - for example, a skin cell to a neuron - can be done through a process that requires the skin cell to be induced into a "pluripotent" stem cell, then differentiated into a neuron. Researchers at MIT have now devised a simplified process that bypasses the stem cell stage, converting a skin cell directly into a neuron.

Working with mouse cells, the researchers developed a conversion method that is highly efficient and can produce more than 10 neurons from a single skin cell. If replicated in human cells, this approach could enable the generation of large quantities of motor neurons, which could potentially be used to treat patients with spinal cord injuries or diseases that impair mobility.

We were able to get to yields where we could ask questions about whether these cells can be viable candidates for the cell replacement therapies, which we hope they could be. That's where these types of reprogramming technologies can take us." Katie Galloway, the W. M. Keck Career Development Professor in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering

As a first step toward developing these cells as a therapy, the researchers showed that they could generate motor neurons and engraft them into the brains of mice, where they integrated with host tissue.

Galloway is the senior author of two papers describing the new method, which appear today in Cell Systems. MIT graduate student Nathan Wang is the lead author of both papers.

From skin to neurons

Nearly 20 years ago, scientists in Japan showed that by delivering four transcription factors to skin cells, they could coax them to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Similar to embryonic stem cells, iPSCs can be differentiated into many other cell types. This technique works well, but it takes several weeks, and many of the cells don't end up fully transitioning to mature cell types.

"Oftentimes, one of the challenges in reprogramming is that cells can get stuck in intermediate states," Galloway says. "So, we're using direct conversion, where instead of going through an iPSC intermediate, we're going directly from a somatic cell to a motor neuron."

Galloway's research group and others have demonstrated this type of direct conversion before, but with very low yields - fewer than 1 percent. In Galloway's previous work, she used a combination of six transcription factors plus two other proteins that stimulate cell proliferation. Each of those eight genes was delivered using a separate viral vector, making it difficult to ensure that each was expressed at the correct level in each cell.

In the first of the new Cell Systems papers, Galloway and her students reported a way to streamline the process so that skin cells can be converted to motor neurons using just three transcription factors, plus the two genes that drive cells into a highly proliferative state.

Using mouse cells, the researchers started with the original six transcription factors and experimented with dropping them out, one at a time, until they reached a combination of three - NGN2, ISL1, and LHX3 - that could successfully complete the conversion to neurons.

Once the number of genes was down to three, the researchers could use a single modified virus to deliver all three of them, allowing them to ensure that each cell expresses each gene at the correct levels.

Using a separate virus, the researchers also delivered genes encoding p53DD and a mutated version of HRAS. These genes drive the skin cells to divide many times before they start converting to neurons, allowing for a much higher yield of neurons, about 1,100 percent.

"If you were to express the transcription factors at really high levels in nonproliferative cells, the reprogramming rates would be really low, but hyperproliferative cells are more receptive. It's like they've been potentiated for conversion, and then they become much more receptive to the levels of the transcription factors," Galloway says.

The researchers also developed a slightly different combination of transcription factors that allowed them to perform the same direct conversion using human cells, but with a lower efficiency rate - between 10 and 30 percent, the researchers estimate. This process takes about five weeks, which is slightly faster than converting the cells to iPSCs first and then turning them into neurons.

Implanting cells

Once the researchers identified the optimal combination of genes to deliver, they began working on the best ways to deliver them, which was the focus of the second Cell Systems paper.

They tried out three different delivery viruses and found that a retrovirus achieved the most efficient rate of conversion. Reducing the density of cells grown in the dish also helped to improve the overall yield of motor neurons. This optimized process, which takes about two weeks in mouse cells, achieved a yield of more than 1,000 percent.

Working with colleagues at Boston University, the researchers then tested whether these motor neurons could be successfully engrafted into mice. They delivered the cells to a part of the brain known as the striatum, which is involved in motor control and other functions.

After two weeks, the researchers found that many of the neurons had survived and seemed to be forming connections with other brain cells. When grown in a dish, these cells showed measurable electrical activity and calcium signaling, suggesting the ability to communicate with other neurons. The researchers now hope to explore the possibility of implanting these neurons into the spinal cord.

The MIT team also hopes to increase the efficiency of this process for human cell conversion, which could allow for the generation of large quantities of neurons that could be used to treat spinal cord injuries or diseases that affect motor control, such as ALS. Clinical trials using neurons derived from iPSCs to treat ALS are now underway, but expanding the number of cells available for such treatments could make it easier to test and develop them for more widespread use in humans, Galloway says.

The research was funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent review published in the journal Engineering delves into the significant advancements and potential of CRISPR technologies in the field of regenerative medicine. The study, authored by Veronica E. Farag, Elsie A. Devey, and Kam W. Leong from Columbia University, explores how gene editing is transforming the way we approach tissue repair and disease treatment.

Regenerative medicine aims to repair or replace damaged tissues and organs, offering hope for patients with various conditions. Traditional strategies, such as using progenitor cells and biological stimuli, have had some success but face limitations like off-target effects and a lack of precision. Gene editing, particularly CRISPR/Cas9-based systems, provides a more precise and efficient alternative.



CRISPR/Cas9 allows for precise modifications to the genome, including knock-ins, knockouts, transcriptional activation and repression, and base conversions. This technology has been used to treat genetic diseases, control cell fate for tissue repair, and enhance tissue functions. For example, in the treatment of monogenic diseases like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and osteogenesis imperfecta, CRISPR technologies have shown promise in correcting disease-causing mutations.



In cystic fibrosis, researchers have used CRISPR HDR-mediated knock-in to correct mutations in the CFTR gene in airway stem cells. For sickle cell disease, the FDA has approved a CRISPR/Cas9 therapy that silences the Bcl11a gene to increase fetal hemoglobin production. In osteogenesis imperfecta, studies have demonstrated the correction of mutated genes in patient-derived cells.



CRISPR technologies also play a crucial role in augmenting tissue repair. They can be used to drive somatic cell reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), differentiate iPSCs into desired cell types, and create tissue constructs for in-vivo repair. Additionally, gene editing can prevent post-transplantation immune responses by modifying the HLA profile of cells, reducing the risk of rejection.



Furthermore, CRISPR is a powerful research tool in regenerative medicine. It enables genetic screening to identify genes involved in differentiation and disease progression, and helps create disease models for drug development. Organoid and organ-on-a-chip models, combined with CRISPR editing, allow researchers to study diseases in a more physiologically relevant context.



However, there are still challenges to overcome. Delivery of CRISPR components remains a hurdle, as current methods have limitations in terms of immunogenicity, packaging capacity, and targeting efficiency. Off-target editing is another concern, which may lead to unwanted genetic changes. Future research will focus on enhancing delivery systems, optimizing CRISPR knock-in efficiency, and reducing off-target effects.



Despite these challenges, the potential of CRISPR technologies in regenerative medicine is immense. With continued research and development, these technologies could lead to more effective treatments for a wide range of diseases and injuries, revolutionizing the field of regenerative medicine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research group, led by Dr. Pavel Majer from IOCB Prague, in collaboration with the laboratories of Barbara Slusher and Louis Garza at Johns Hopkins University, have developed a compound that could potentially treat the autoimmune disorder alopecia areata, which causes hair loss leading to the formation of bald patches. The results of their study, recently published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, confirm the efficacy of a series of prodrugs based on derivatives of itaconic acid, simply referred to as itaconates. What is more, there is a good chance that the substances will be administrable orally in the form of tablets and not just as an ointment.

Itaconate is a naturally occurring substance with anti-inflammatory effects elicited by interacting with the immune system. However, itaconate has the weakness that it does not easily penetrate the cells. The team of Pavel Majer, which has spent several years developing a drug for alopecia, has surmounted this obstacle by developing prodrugs, compounds that convert into the active drug only within the body.

"We have prepared a series of prodrugs, at least two of which appear to be highly effective. Tests on mice have confirmed that the compounds are absorbed well and release the active ingredient in the skin at the right concentration. Our itaconate derivatives could thus represent a completely new method of treating alopecia," says Pavel Majer.

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks hair follicles, leading to their inflammation and consequently to hair loss and impaired hair growth. The condition affects about 2% of people, mostly women, and is the second most common cause of hair loss, after androgenetic alopecia (pattern baldness). Current treatments are predominantly based on corticosteroids, which come with a number of side effects.

The scientists have proved that the new substances could bring significant relief to patients with alopecia areata. The current article builds on an earlier study by these groups, published in 2022 by the journal PNAS Nexus. The considerable potential of this discovery has also been recognized by the pharmaceutical company SPARC, which has purchased a licence for the patented technology utilizing itaconate prodrugs. One of the compounds developed, SCD-153, when applied as an ointment, relieves inflammation, protects hair follicles and, according to previous tests on mice, accelerates the growth of new hair. It does so by making hair follicles transition from a dormant state to an active one. SPARC has already started hiring patients for phase 1 clinical trial on this promising compound.</p>
