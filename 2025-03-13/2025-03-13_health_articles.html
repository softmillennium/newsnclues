Las Vegas (KSNV) — Nevada State Senator Melanie Scheible has introduced Senate Bill 352, a significant legislative effort aimed at ensuring equal access to quality health care for all Nevadans, including LGBTQ+ individuals. 

The bill seeks to prohibit discrimination by both public and private health insurance carriers and providers based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability.

The proposed legislation would apply to health insurance policies, including Medicaid and the Nevada ACA Exchange, and would also prevent healthcare providers from engaging in discriminatory practices. 

Additionally, it empowers state regulatory boards and agencies to adopt regulations and discipline providers who violate these prohibitions.

André C. Wade, State Director for Silver State Equality, expressed strong support for the bill. "This bill makes a resolute stance against discriminatory practices that can hinder the delivery of healthcare service to a large portion of Nevada's population," Wade said. 

He emphasized the importance of enshrining these protections into state law, particularly for the LGBTQ+ community, and praised Senator Scheible's commitment to the health and well-being of every Nevadan.

"In Nevada, we believe in equality, and that includes equality in healthcare," said Scheible. "Senate Bill 352 will maintain our commitment to non-discrimination in health insurance and give Nevadans equal opportunities to access health plans."

Silver State Equality has endorsed the passage of SB 352, highlighting it as a critical step toward a fair healthcare system in Nevada.</p>

In the wake of the recent Change Healthcare/UHC data breach, critical vulnerabilities in healthcare have been exposed, including outdated systems and weak security measures. In response, global IT research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group has published new insights, providing cybersecurity strategies to help healthcare organizations defend against evolving threats. In the resource, Info-Tech stresses the urgent need for improved cybersecurity practices and offers key strategies to security leaders to mitigate ransomware risks, strengthen data protection, and enhance incident response capabilities.

TORONTO, March 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - The 2024 Change Healthcare/UHC data breach underscored the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity within the healthcare sector. Exposing sensitive patient records and disrupting hospital operations, the breach highlighted significant vulnerabilities, particularly around the growing reliance on third-party vendors and outdated IT disaster recovery plans. To help security leaders take proactive measures to strengthen their defenses and protect patient care in the aftermath of cyber incidents, Info-Tech Research Group has published its blueprint Lessons Learned and Life After a Breach in Your Healthcare Organization.


"In today's healthcare landscape, organizations face increasing cybersecurity challenges due to their reliance on third-party vendors and complex IT environments," says Sharon Auma-Ebanyat, research director at Info-Tech Research Group. "The largest healthcare breach involving Change Healthcare/UHC highlighted significant vulnerabilities, disrupting hospital operations and billing and exposing patient records. This underscores the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address these risks."


"In today's healthcare landscape, organizations face increasing cybersecurity challenges due to their reliance on third-party vendors and complex IT environments," says Sharon Auma-Ebanyat, research director at Info-Tech Research Group. "The largest healthcare breach involving Change Healthcare/UHC highlighted significant vulnerabilities, disrupting hospital operations and billing and exposing patient records. This underscores the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address these risks."

The firm reports that despite the escalating cyber threat landscape, many healthcare organizations have yet to fully implement multifactor authentication, especially for remote access services, leaving critical systems exposed to attackers who exploit stolen credentials.

Info-Tech's insights also highlight the challenges posed by interconnected IT environments, making it difficult for organizations to detect and address security gaps.

"Many healthcare organizations encounter obstacles such as outdated IT disaster recovery plans that fail to address virtual and digital connections, limited budgets and resources, and complex, interconnected systems that make it difficult to identify and fix vulnerabilities," adds Auma-Ebanyat.  "Traditional disaster recovery approaches often overlook the evolving nature of third-party risks and virtual environments, increasing susceptibility to cyberattacks."

Info-Tech advises the need for a more comprehensive and proactive cybersecurity approach to mitigate these risks.

Five-Step Approach to Mitigate Third-Party Ransomware Risks

In its recently published resource Lessons Learned and Life After a Breach in Your Healthcare Organization, Info-Tech provides a structured five-step approach to help healthcare organizations mitigate third-party ransomware risks.

The five-step approach includes:

"This research offers a roadmap to mitigate third-party ransomware and data breach risks, featuring insights on current healthcare cybersecurity threats, lessons from the Change Healthcare/UHC data breach, and strategies to prevent future incidents," explains Auma-Ebanyat

By leveraging insights from Info-Tech's blueprint, healthcare organizations can take decisive steps to enhance their cybersecurity strategies and disaster recovery plans. The expert-driven recommendations outlined in the data-backed resource will help security leaders protect sensitive patient data, maintain operational resilience, and prepare for evolving cyber threats.

Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: AVAH) is still working on executing its transformation strategy — which focuses on preferred payers and obtaining adequate rates from its government partners — while also navigating a tricky labor environment. 

For 2024, the company's goal was to increase the number of private-duty services preferred payer agreements from 14 to 22. The company achieved this goal with the addition of eight additional preferred pay agreements. 

“Our Q4, and full year 2024, results highlight that we continue to align our objectives with those of our preferred payers and government partners,” Aveanna Healthcare CEO Jeff Shaner, said Thursday during the company's fourth quarter earnings call. “By focusing our clinical capacity on our preferred payers, we achieved solid year over year growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA.” 

Atlanta-based Aveanna Healthcare offers a range of pediatric and adult health care services, including nursing, rehabilitation, occupational nursing in schools, therapy services, day treatment centers for medically fragile and chronically ill children and adults, and home health and hospice services. The company has 327 locations across 34 states. 

Though Shaner called out the current labor environment as a primary challenge, he also credited Aveanna Healthcare's preferred payer strategy for the company's improved retention and hiring rates. 

“We also experienced improvement in our caregiver hiring and retention trends by aligning our efforts with those payers willing to engage with us on enhanced reimbursement rates, and value-based agreements,” he said. “While we continue to operate in a challenging environment, our preferred payer strategy allows us to return to a more normalized growth rate in our business segments.” 

Aveanna Healthcare's preferred payer strategy has allowed the company to invest in caregiver wages and recruitment efforts.

Since Aveanna Healthcare's third quarter earnings call, the company has also made strides on a number of its rate improvement initiatives with both government and preferred payers. The company is also seeing signs of improvement in the caregiver labor market, according to Shaner.

The company's 2024 goal was to improve reimbursement rates in our various states, with a particular emphasis on Georgia, Massachusetts and California. Aveanna Healthcare secured double-digit rate improvements in both Georgia and Massachusetts.

“These states demonstrate our government affairs strategy, to partner with state legislatures and governors to identify shortfalls in private-duty nursing wages and to align reimbursement rates to improve access to care for patients with complex medical conditions,” Shaner said.

Overall, Aveanna Healthcare secured 12 private-duty services state rate increases for 2024.

Despite seeing success, Stephens identified this as a potential area of exposure.  

“[Aveanna Healthcare] generates a significant percentage of revenue (~90%) from government payers,” Stephens analysts wrote in the research brief. “[The company] could experience pressure on revenues/adjusted EBITDA from unanticipated changes in government reimbursement rates.”  

On the home health side, the company's 2024 goal was to maintain its episodic payer mix above 70%.

“In Q4 our episodic mix was 76%,” Shaner said. “However, our total episodic volume growth was slightly lower as compared to the prior year period. We ended 2024 with a total of 38 episodic agreements, and are well-positioned for growth in 2025. We are committed to growing our home health volumes, and I expect us to return to positive year-over-year growth trends in the first half of 2025. We will remain focused on aligning our home health caregiver capacity with those payers willing to reimburse us on an episodic basis, and focus on improved clinical and financial outcomes.” 

Shaner also outlines the five primary strategic initiatives that Aveanna Healthcare plans to focus on this year.

“First, enhancing partnerships with government partners and preferred payers to create additional capacity and growth,” he said. “Second, identifying cost efficiencies and synergies that allow us to leverage our growth. Third, modernizing our medical solutions business to achieve our top target operating model. Fourth, managing our capital structure and collecting our cash while producing positive free cash flow, and finally, engaging our leaders and employees and delivering our Aveanna mission.” 

For Q4, Aveanna Healthcare reported revenues of $519.9 million, a 8.6% increase compared to $478.8 million during the same period last year.

The company's private-duty services segment brought in $422 million, a 10.1% increase compared to $383 million in Q4 2023. Its home health and hospice segment checked in at $54.4million, a 0.6% increase compared to $54.1 million during the same period last year.

The company anticipates a 2025 revenue range of $2.10 to $2.12 billion.

“We believe this initial [2025] outlook provides a prudent view, considering the challenges we still face with the evolving environment,” Shaner said.

By Vatican News

The Holy See Press Office updated reporters on the Pope's condition on Thursday evening, as he marked the 12th anniversary of his election to the papacy.

In the afternoon, the medical staff brought a cake with candles to the Pope's room.

The Pope also followed the Spiritual Exercises for the Roman Curia via video link with the Paul VI Hall, and resumed respiratory therapy.

He continues to alternate between non-invasive mechanical ventilation at night and high-flow oxygenation with nasal cannulas during the day.

His clinical situation remains stable within a complex condition. A new medical bulletin is expected on Friday evening.

Pope Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital on February 14 to receive treatment for bilateral pneumonia.

Longtime Memphis television broadcaster Richard Ransom is leaving ABC24 to join Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare on March 24, the hospital system announced Thursday.

Ransom spent almost a decade at ABC24 but has been in the Memphis media landscape for 20 years.

At the end of February, Richard posted to his Facebook account that he would be leaving the news industry to embark on a "new chapter."

“I am excited to join the team at Methodist and continue to share the stories that matter to Mid-Southerners and support the expert healthcare professionals right here in the Bluff City,” Ransom said in a statement Thursday.

Ransom will join the healthcare system as the Director of Strategic Communication, where he will "provide guidance" on employee communications and media relations and support "community initiatives."

Methodist President and CEO Dr. Michael Ugwueke said in a statement that Ransom was "drawn" to the healthcare system's mission.

“I'm confident that his communications expertise and his familiarity with the health concerns impacting Mid-Southerners will be a benefit to our organization and the community at large,” Ugwueke said.

A graduate of the University of Missouri, Ransom started covering Memphis in 2001 with WMC where he stayed for seven years, according to his LinkedIn. He briefly moved away from Memphis before moving back to work with WREG.

House Republicans proposed Medicaid cuts last month that would have disastrous financial consequences for hospitals, especially for those in rural areas. While the plan aims to reduce government spending, healthcare executives are pointing out that these cuts would actually exacerbate the financial instability of the overall U.S. healthcare system — as well worsen health outcomes for millions of people, many of whom are children.

As Congress deliberates what the future of Medicaid funding will look like, healthcare executives are worried.

House Republicans proposed Medicaid cuts last month that would have sweeping and disproportionate consequences — particularly for rural hospitals and underserved populations. The plan, which seeks to reduce Medicaid spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, lacks specifics but could be implemented through reduced federal funding, block grants or stricter eligibility requirements. Healthcare leaders warn that these cuts would cause uncompensated care costs to balloon, leading to hospital closures and diminished care access.

The experts interviewed for this article agreed that while the proposed Medicaid cuts aim to reduce government spending, the plan will actually end up exacerbating the financial instability of the overall U.S. healthcare system — as well worsen health outcomes for millions of Americans.


					Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.				

House Republicans introduced a budget plan last month ordering various congressional committees to find at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years. It directs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, to reduce its spending by $880 billion over that time period.

The GOP's budget blueprint doesn't outline how the committee would achieve this target, but it's clear that doing so would involve significant cuts to Medicaid. The nation's Medicaid program, which provides health coverage for about 72 million Americans, accounts for one-sixth of all healthcare expenditures and is one of the largest programs under the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction.

The day the plan was released, one federal budget expert — Bobby Kogan, senior director of Federal Budget Policy at Center for American Progress and former adviser to the director of the Office of Management and Budget under the previous presidential administration — wrote on X that this plan would undoubtedly require major cuts to Medicaid.


					Transitioning to PDPM models significantly shifted the healthcare industry. By replacing the RUG system, healthcare providers cut waste and more accurately reflect the care each patient received.				

“For Energy and Commerce, it's mathematically impossible to achieve $880 billion in savings if you don't cut Medicaid or Medicare. There's not enough money they have jurisdiction over. Republicans say they're not cutting Medicare, so that means they're cutting Medicaid,” he wrote.

A March 5 report from the Congressional Budget Office also found it is impossible to achieve $880 billion in savings without broad cuts to Medicaid.

The House passed the budget resolution on February 25, and the Senate is expected to vote on the plan this month. 

Healthcare leaders certainly don't have a sunny outlook about the budget resolution making its way through Congress, but it's presently difficult to quantify exactly how disastrous its effects would be because the plan lacks specifics, said Harold Miller, CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.

There are several ways Congress might go about reducing Medicaid funding, he noted. 

For example, lawmakers could lower the federal government's share of Medicaid funding, which would force states to either cover the difference or slash services. Alternatively, Congress could withdraw federal support for specific services, such as expensive GLP-1 drugs, which would shift financial responsibility to state governments, Miller explained.

Another tactic Congress may choose is cutting eligibility. With Medicaid eligibility reduced, fewer Americans would be insured, which would cause a surge in hospitals' uncompensated care, Miller remarked.

He also mentioned block grants as a possibility. Instead of covering a percentage of costs, the federal government could provide states with a fixed sum for Medicaid — which would limit funding growth and force states to make tough decisions about whether or not to make their own cuts.

“Many people have argued that [block grants] could give the state greater flexibility in terms of exactly what it covers and how it structures the program. The concern is, if Congress decides it's going to cut the overall amount, then the state might not have enough money to be able to provide the same level of benefits,” Miller remarked.

He pointed out that Medicaid cuts would likely lead to many difficult decisions for state-level leaders. Since Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, states would have to figure out how to respond to federal cuts — whether to reduce provider payments, get rid of services or maintain coverage by increasing state spending.

Medicaid cuts would affect many more Americans than just those covered by Medicaid, noted Megan Cundari, senior director of federal relations at American Hospital Association. This is because the financial ramifications would force hospitals to make cost-cutting adjustments like eliminating departments or laying off staff members — thereby affecting all patients.

Slashing Medicaid funding means hospitals would deliver more uncompensated care. Fewer people would have Medicaid coverage, leading to more uninsured patients unable to pay for their services. A report released this week predicted that Medicaid cuts would result in an $80 billion revenue loss for providers next year, due in large part to a spike in uncompensated care costs.

This would strain providers' finances, and many hospitals would be forced to eliminate certain service lines or reduce their staffing levels, Cundari pointed out.

“There may be, for example, longer wait times at the emergency department because there's just not as many staff to help serve all the people that need to be served in the community. I think it's important to understand that the Medicaid cuts are not just Medicaid cuts — and they will not just impact the people who are involved in the program. They're also going to impact entire communities,” she declared.

There are hundreds of rural and safety-net facilities across the nation that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursements to cover the cost of care — and for some of these organizations, a significant decline in Medicaid payments will be the straw that breaks the camel's back, forcing them to close their doors, added Ben Finder, the AHA's vice president of policy, research, analytics and strategy.

When a rural or safety-net hospital closes, its patients don't just disappear, he noted. These patients must seek care at the next nearest facility, which is often a regional hospital that is already operating at capacity. 

This surge in patient volume can overwhelm staff and decrease provider availability, further diminishing care quality and access for all patients in the area, Finder explained.

Medicaid cuts would hit rural hospitals, those who can least afford it, the hardest. For one, most of these hospitals operate on razor-thin margins — research from last month shows nearly half of the country's rural hospitals are operating at a loss.

Secondly, many rural Americans receive coverage through the Medicaid program. In rural communities, 18% of adults are covered by Medicaid. 

In six states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico and South Carolina — more than half of children in rural areas are covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP provides low-cost health coverage to children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance. While CHIP is technically a separate program from Medicaid, CHIP is typically managed and administered in conjunction with it.

Nick Olson, CFO of Sanford Health, called Medicaid “the bedrock” of rural healthcare. Sanford is a South Dakota-based system operating 56 hospitals and more than 270 clinics across several states. 

Most of the health system's patients live in rural communities, Olson said. He also pointed out that more than half of Sanford's skilled nursing facility residents are covered by Medicaid.

“Hospitals across the country are already struggling to break even, and this really puts pressure on their ability to reinvest back into the communities that they're serving — to reinvest back into increasing and expanding access,” Olson declared. “For us, in 2022 alone, and I believe more recent years are similar, we provided over $159 million in uncompensated care.”

Reducing Medicaid funding would cause that figure to rise to an even more unsustainable level, Olson said.

Another healthcare executive — Alan Morgan, CEO of National Rural Health Association — said there is no question that rural hospitals would close should the government cut Medicaid spending.

“Somewhere between 400 to 700 rural hospitals are at financial risk for closure right now, so any type of reduction in revenue is going to have a dramatic impact on these facilities,” he remarked.

Rural hospital closures would force many Americans to travel long distances for even basic treatments and emergency care. This would cause many rural residents to forgo routine care, leading to greater utilization of emergency departments — the most expensive place to get care — Morgan explained.

This problem would destroy the purported intent of the budget resolution, which is to save money, argued Effie Carlson, CEO of care coordination company Watershed Health.

In other words, the House Republicans' plan to cut Medicaid funding aims to save money, but it will likely increase overall healthcare spending. Higher utilization rates in expensive settings like ERs and long-term care facilities will lead to higher costs for taxpayers, Carlson said.

“In healthcare, you don't avoid paying for things — it just gets paid for somewhere else in a less controllable way,” she declared.

To paint an even bleaker economic picture, rural hospitals are often the largest employers in their area, which means that if they reduced staffing or closed, unemployment in those regions would increase, Carlson added.

This would also lead to greater unemployment and reduced tax revenue, thereby pushing rural communities deeper into economic distress, she remarked.

At first, slashing Medicaid funding may appear to save dollars on paper, but experts agree that the real costs are hidden beneath the surface. When hospitals close and care disappears, expenses don't just go away — they get passed to struggling communities and overwhelmed providers.

Drug-resistant infections are linked to over a million deaths a year in India. A health crisis compounded by the country's healthcare inequalities. Dr Gautham and her team are working with rural healthcare providers to better understand the challenges of tackling AMR in these settings – and co-develop innovative solutions.

India is home to the world's largest rural population — an estimated 900 million people.

Across this patchwork of towns, villages and farmlands, access to formal healthcare is extremely limited. Despite the country's extensive private medical system, most doctors and hospitals are found in cities.

“The moment you leave cities behind, there are no qualified doctors around. People have to travel to the nearest urban centre or government health centre if they want to access a qualified doctor," says Dr Meenakshi Gautham, Assistant Professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Project Leader of One Health Antimicrobial Stewardship for Informal Health Systems (OASIS).

In India, Gautham grew up away from rural life, in the capital city of New Delhi. She trained as a social scientist and then pursued a career in public health. As she began working more closely with rural communities, she was struck by the exceptional contrast in healthcare availability.

“In cities, within a radius of five kilometres, you can find about 50 different private doctors. You have so many options. But the private formal sector is unaffordable [and inaccessible] for the people who live in villages.”

This inequality can have significant impacts on the health of rural populations. For example, infant mortality rate is 46 per thousand live births for rural areas compared to 32 per thousand live births for urban areas.

With limited formal healthcare services, a vast and resourceful network of informal, rural healthcare providers exists to fill the gap.

“When you go into rural India, there are a lot of village doctors,” explains Gautham. “These are health care providers who have not received formal training in health, but they have been trained by doctors as their assistants or technicians.” After a few years working in the city, informally trained healthcare workers often return home to set up clinics in their villages. Once established, an intricate ecosystem of professional networks, teleconsultation services and training conferences exist to support the informal practices.

“The informal provider is just as trusted and knows just about enough to manage your problem,” says Gautham. “If they have a doubt, they will consult doctors they are connected to. They learn about new drugs and new therapies through pharmaceutical representatives. This mosaic is an amazing entrepreneurial way of managing a lot of people's health needs. We can't shut them down because the health system will collapse otherwise.”

Rather than fight against this informal system, Gautham's research hopes to work with it to tackle one of India's greatest health threats: drug-resistant infections. 

Drug-resistant infections are linked to over a million deaths a year in India. A health crisis compounded by the country's healthcare inequalities.

Since 2016, Gautham and her team at the OASIS project have been working closely with rural communities to better understand the drivers of antibiotic use and the challenges of tackling AMR in rural settings.

Their findings paint a complex picture. Antimicrobial resistance is poorly understood, antibiotic use is difficult to control and disease surveillance data in community settings is almost non-existent.

“It's a result of the ecosystem in which [the rural healthcare providers] function,” explains Gautham.

Due to a lack of formal medical training, many rural healthcare providers see antibiotics as a cure-all drug. And this misconception extends to the communities they serve. As a result, antibiotics are often dispensed when they are not the appropriate treatment.

“These are communities who need to get better quickly because many of them are daily wage labourers. They cannot take more than a day off work. And they think that giving an antibiotic is the best way of curing a person quickly,” says Gautham.

Another important aspect of Gautham's research has been to investigate how rural communities and healthcare providers understand the concept of antimicrobial resistance.

“We find that knowledge of what causes [ill] health is very mixed – biomedical concepts blend with traditional medicine,” says Gautham. “And so, their understanding of AMR is limited to some medicines not working because you have taken too many of them.”

Without an understanding of the dangers of AMR, rural healthcare providers aren't motivated to collect data or monitor antibiotic use. And without the data, it's difficult to demonstrate the dangers of AMR.

But Gautham and her team have been investigating this for a long time. As well as identifying the problems, they've also been working with communities and other important stakeholders in this ecosystem to find solutions.

We're ensuring research considers the needs and priorities of the most affected communities, so evidence and interventions are acceptable, affordable and accessible in the locations they are most needed.

The OASIS project identified two priority issues to address: there were no suitable antibiotic guidelines for rural healthcare providers and no one was collecting any data.

Gautham and her team knew that the only way to create effective solutions was to co-develop them with people across the informal and formal healthcare ecosystems.

The OASIS team collected years of data from in-depth interviews, surveys and stakeholder consultation groups. They wanted to understand the most common symptoms clinics were facing, how patients were being diagnosed and managed, and which antibiotics were being dispensed and why.

Their findings revealed a clear path forward.

“The [rural healthcare providers] wanted more information about antibiotics, but they wanted it in a flexible format, not where they would have to travel and attend some training program, but something which they could easily manage, like on a mobile phone.”

With support from the Wellcome-funded Trinity Challenge on Antimicrobial Resistance, Gautham and her team are developing the Antibiotic Bandhu App – which means, ‘friend of antibiotics'. This easy-to-use tool will guide users from identifying symptoms to providing first level management for six of the most common illnesses clinics face. Most of which do not require any treatment with antibiotics.

As well as helping reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, the clinics can use the app to record data about which infections they're treating and whether or not they are dispensing antibiotics in a responsible way.

The OASIS team were winners of the Trinity Challenge on Antimicrobial Resistance. A second funding opportunity focussed on antimicrobial resistance has now launched, supported by Wellcome.

The new challenge is a call for low-cost technology and data-driven solutions to improve access to effective antibiotics in community settings in low- and middle-income countries. A prize fund of up to £1 million is available.

Early feasibility assessments of the guidelines show promising results. “It's like a doctor present near us,” noted one participant.

The OASIS team will be training more rural clinics to use the app and guidelines.

But for the guidelines to be successful, the whole community needs to be on board. Gautham is optimistic that rural healthcare providers are the key:

“A really strong enabling factor is that the future of the community and its health is very important to the rural healthcare providers. If they were to counsel patients to not misuse antibiotics, people would listen to them.”

The OASIS team will also be able to collect and analyse larger sets of data through the app. It will help to inform the practices of the rural providers, and Gautham is hopeful it will be invaluable for local, district and national policymakers too.

“I think it can transform healthcare, the healthcare system, healthcare practices – it can transform our understanding of AMR because there isn't any data coming from the community level. So whatever data we collect it's going to be really, really valuable.”

Meenakshi Gautham leads the One Health Antibiotic Stewardship (OASIS) project. She is an interdisciplinary researcher interested in the dynamics of informal health systems, where both formal and informal health actors collaborate to shape healthcare practices. Focusing on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in community settings, her work uncovers the interactions within these systems, shedding light on health system and policy barriers that impact healthcare delivery and access in resource-constrained contexts.

‘Gutfeld!' panelists discuss reports claiming California Gov. Gavin Newsom secretly funded thousands of dollars for a monument of himself.

The California Department of Finance cleared a $3.44 billion loan to make up for a gap in Medi-Cal spending, which critics say is due to illegal immigrant healthcare costs, whereas the governor's office argues it's not out of the ordinary.

It was revealed a few weeks ago that the state had $6 billion in expected costs for Medi-Cal, but it is now roughly $9.5 billion. This comes after it became state law to allow people to qualify for the program regardless of their immigration status. Medi-Cal is the state's Medicaid system for certain Golden State residents, which takes both federal and state taxpayer dollars, according to a state government website. 

Critics of allowing the program's availability to those who are in the country illegally strongly believe it is cause for concern.

"Gov. Gavin Newsom lied and cooked the books to gift all illegal immigrants free healthcare and now has stuck California taxpayers with a multi-billion dollar bill," Rep. Carl DeMaio, R-San Diego, told Fox News Digital in a statement.

"This is so egregious that he needs to resign," he continued.

DeMaio was the lawmaker who, in a hearing last month, questioned a state budget official who ended up revealing the higher spending figure for MediCal. DeMaio was later removed from the California State Assembly budget committee.

However, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said that California is not the only state facing spending issues with their state-based healthcare programs, such as Pennsylvania, Colorado and Indiana.

"This isn't new — as the administration already outlined in the Governor's January budget proposal, additional funding is needed to support Medi-Cal," Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for the governor told Fox News Digital in a statement.

"Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike. This is not unique to California."

The border state continues to face scrutiny for its policies pertaining to people in the country illegally, whether it is for healthcare eligibility or "sanctuary" policies.

War-torn Sudan's healthcare system is approaching breaking point as three or four patients are sharing single beds, Islamic Relief revealed on Thursday. 

Overwhelmed healthcare workers in eastern Sudan described dire conditions, with patients either turned away or dying on the floor, the aid group said. 

The conflict-stricken country has seen countless displaced families seeking care, and the collapsing medical infrastructure has been unable to accommodate demand, with ongoing violence outstripping limited resources and two thirds of all main hospitals out of service. 

Dr Abdalbasit Alameen Mohamed Adallah, director of al-Gedaref Teaching Hospital, told Islamic Relief that the number of displaced people seeking treatment is increasingly at double or triple the rate that the hospital can find new beds.  

He said: “The health situation is very serious. The existing hospitals take all of the burden [from displacement as a result of the conflict]. 

“After recent displacements, the number of patients has increased many times,” he added. “Two or three patients can be treated in one bed, some treated on the couch, and some we just give them the treatment and let them go if they have a place to stay. People are begging for prescriptions.” 

Adallah went on to say there was a severe lack of medication available, including for vital emergency treatments such as infusions and laboratory testing. 

He continued: “There has been a systematic destruction of all health facilities across Sudan. Most of the medical staff have themselves been displaced and many hospitals destroyed completely, resulting in no medical services. 

“In Gedaref we took the biggest burden since the very start of the war from the displacement of Khartoum and Al Jazirah state, where half of the population was displaced to Gedaref including the elders, children, and people with chronic diseases. It's a huge number.”

Many doctors and medical staff have fled the country, after facing violence, attacks, decimated infrastructure and corruption, Islamic Relief said.

Since the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began fighting, there have been 542 attacks on healthcare facilities between April 2023 and December 2024, according to a report by Insecurity Insight. 

During these attacks, 122 health workers have been killed and 90 arrested, with medical facilities including clinics and hospitals damaged 136 times, and taken over 51 occasions for non-medical purposes, the report said.

Insecurity Insight has attributed almost two thirds of these attacks to the RSF. 

Since April 2023, Sudan has been embroiled in a brutal civil war between the SAF and the RSF militia.

The country has fallen into a humanitarian crisis, with 12.5 million Sudanese displaced from their homes, according to UNHCR.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (TNND)  — California is in need of a $3.44 billion loan to cover a shortfall in "Medi-Cal," which is the state's Medicaid program, according to reports. 



POLITICO said Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration informed lawmakers about the shortfall in a letter sent on Wednesday.

Citing Department of Finance Spokesman H.D. Palmer, the media outlet said the money is the maximum amount the state is allowed to borrow, adding that it "will only be enough to cover bills for Medi-Cal" through the end of March.

Paul Winfree, who is the president and CEO of the Economic Policy Innovation Center, or EPIC, told Fox News Digital the state is "exploiting an existing loophole" in an existing law.  

The news comes a year after the state expanded Medi-Cal to offer free healthcare to residents in need -- as well as undocumented migrants. 

The state previously described the initiative as a public health insurance program that provides "needed health care services for low-income individuals including families with children, seniors, persons with disabilities, foster care, pregnant women, and low income people with specific diseases such as tuberculosis, breast cancer, or HIV/AIDS.  Medi-Cal is financed equally by the state and federal government," according to a statement Newsom's team shared online.</p>

This week, several health IT vendors announced new tools to apply advanced analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to help providers and payers spot potential gaps across care settings by embedding real-time insights into existing workflows.

Innovaccer is offering health plans a new platform integration that targets gap closure and streamlines risk adjustment with a proactive approach, the company announced Wednesday.

Health plans have historically relied on disconnected tools and resource-intensive manual processes that pose compliance risks and increased costs. 

Combining prospective, concurrent and retrospective reviews, payers can use the new platform, called 360-Degree Gap Closure, to leapfrog traditional data silos and close gaps across care provider offices, pharmacies and patients' at-home interventions.

The key to risk adjustment and quality improvement is seamless data exchange with provider EHRs, Innovaccer said. 

With the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services accelerating value-based care adoption, gap closure can improve coding accuracy with automation and enhance member outcomes with advanced analytics.

"We are bringing a much-needed shift in how payers approach risk and quality," Abhinav Shashank, Innovaccer's cofounder and CEO, said in a statement. 

"Instead of piecing together multiple vendors and solutions, health plans can now close gaps efficiently across the entire care journey, whether at a provider's office, in pharmacies or through at-home test kits."

Veradigm announced a gap closure workflow integration for its payer insights platform on Tuesday. 

The company said that more than 3,500 healthcare practices across the United States are now receiving gaps-in-care alerts from several national and regional health plans directly in their EHRs. 

With the alerts, providers can address risk and quality care gaps in their point-of-care workflows, which could enhance clinical decision-making for better patient outcomes. 

"By embedding risk and quality-driven insights into provider workflows, we are fostering a more interconnected healthcare ecosystem that enhances efficiency and improves patient outcomes," Jay Bhattacharyya, Veradigm senior vice president and general manager, said in a statement. 

The alerts could also improve claims acceptance rates. With streamlined access to payer incentive programs, providers can earn on average $100 in incentive payments per patient gap addressed in the platform, creating an additional revenue stream, Veradigm said.

For Medicare Advantage plans, improving risk adjustment accuracy and reducing avoidable hospitalizations by closing gaps could result in substantial savings each year. 

The insights have "made it incredibly easy for us to identify and close care gaps while unlocking significant financial incentives," Sneha Patel, chief operating officer of Metroplex Medical Centers in Texas, said in a statement. 

"The ability to take action directly within our EHR makes the entire process seamless."

MedeAnalytics, a healthcare enterprise data platform and analytics service, has formed a strategic partnership with Holon Solutions, a vendor of workflow integration technology, to develop an integrated patient insights platform that enhances care and reduces overall administrative burdens.

The partners said in their announcement earlier this month that providers will see significant improvements in their operations and patient care quality, including an 80% increase in gap closure rates and a 5% improvement in revenue capture.

Their proprietary artificial intelligence sensor technology powers an overlay located on top of EHRs that provides additional patient data without deviating from clinicians' existing workflows. The integration provides claims and social determinants of health data, which can lead to timely interventions for patients and improved efficiency for care teams, the companies said. 

The overlay also reduces the need for multiple log-ins, and data searches and alerts can be customized for organizational priorities.

"Our partnership with Holon represents a pivotal moment in healthcare data management and analytics," said Steve Grieco, MedeAnalytics' CEO, in a statement.

"This synergy not only leads to better patient outcomes and care quality but also optimizes value and increases revenue for both payers and providers."

"We break down data silos and bring critical information to the forefront of patient care," Jon Zimmerman, Holon Solutions' CEO, added.

The senator said removing financial conflicts of interest would build confidence in Oz's impartiality. His confirmation hearing is Friday.

Oz will appear before the Senate Finance Committee on Friday for his confirmation hearing.

“If confirmed, you will be expected to steward CMS's $1.5 trillion budget in the best interest of the over 140 million Americans on Medicare and Medicaid,” Warren wrote. “Entering this role with financial conflicts of interest would undermine your effectiveness and the effectiveness of the programs you are slated to administer.”

Oz works with or previously worked with numerous companies that the CMS could oversee, including Eko Health and SandboxAQ, which sell medical diagnostic technologies, and could require the CMS' approval for reimbursement requests.

The nominee also founded and still holds up to $5 million of stock in ShareCare, a digital health company that provides in-home supplement benefit programs used by approximately 1.5 million Medicare Advantage enrollees. 

“Your relationships with these and other entities will raise serious doubts about your impartiality if you participate in coverage decisions and other matters that impact them,” said Warren, urging the nominee to both divest his stake and recuse himself from matters concerning previous business interests.

The senator is also concerned about Oz's activity upon leaving Washington, if confirmed.

Warren said previous agency heads, including Biden appointees and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who was just confirmed to lead the HHS, had agreed to a “cooling-off period” for working in industry after leaving office. 

“By agreeing to a cooling off period, you can mitigate concerns about your potential conflicts of interest in this role,” Warren said.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April Health, a leader in integrating behavioral health into primary care, today announces a transformative merger with Wysa, the global leader in AI for mental health. Together, they address one of the most pressing issues in healthcare, ensuring patients receive timely, effective mental health support, by combining human-led care with Wysa's clinically proven therapeutic AI.





The collaboration will provide patients with continuous, personalized care, through a combination of behavioral health specialists, psychiatrists, and Wysa's AI-driven guidance, ensuring that no referral goes unanswered. This groundbreaking combination of AI and human resources in one model of care guarantees that patients receive support between clinician visits and eliminates the wait times that often plague mental health care.



Redefining Behavioral Health in Primary Care



Behavioral health care is often difficult to access, particularly in rural and underserved areas where mental health providers are scarce. Half of the US population lives in a mental health desert, leading to an average wait time of 3-4 months for psychiatric support. 80% of patients turn to their primary care providers (PCPs) for help, but without dedicated behavioral health support, providers face limited options for effective treatment.



Founded to change this reality, April Health embeds virtual behavioral health services into primary care practices to ensure patients receive the care they need. Now, with Wysa's Therapeutic AI Coach integrated into its model, April Health patients can access a hybrid of human and AI-guided care—expanding access without increasing the burden on providers and overcoming insurance barriers.



“Mental healthcare doesn't fit neatly into appointment slots. Patients need support between visits, and providers need solutions that don't add to their workload,” said Jesse Weinberg, CEO at April Health. “By integrating Wysa's AI, every patient referred to us receives ongoing care—whether through a behavioral health specialist, a psychiatrist, or AI-powered guidance tailored to their needs. This combined approach drives better outcomes in less time, helping to bridge America's mental health gap.”



No Referral Unfulfilled



More than 50% of behavioral health referrals in primary care settings are unsuccessful, leaving patients without critical support. April Health is addressing this by taking full responsibility for patient follow-through. Once a provider refers a patient, April Health ensures they receive the right level of care—whether that means direct engagement with a behavioral health care manager, psychiatric medication recommendations, or digital support from Wysa's Therapeutic AI Coach. Every patient, regardless of insurance coverage, will have access to Wysa's AI-powered support, making this a scalable solution for expanding mental health care without financial barriers.



“No one should have to wait for behavioral health care, yet the reality is most patients face long delays, assuming they ever get the support they need,” said Ramakant Vempati, Co-founder and President of Wysa. “By bringing Wysa's AI into April Health's care model, we're creating a seamless system where patients can engage with mental health support immediately, while still receiving expert-led care.”



A Model That Works for Patients and Providers



April Health's integration of AI reinforces Collaborative Care Management (CoCM), a proven model allowing primary care and specialty clinics to be reimbursed for behavioral health services. This approach not only improves patient outcomes but also makes behavioral health financially sustainable for healthcare practices.



By partnering with April Health, Primary care, pediatrics, women's health and more can now integrate behavioral health into their practice without hiring additional staff or disrupting existing workflows. Providers simply refer patients to an introductory call with April Health, where care managers assess needs and initiate a psychiatrist-led collaborative care plan. This ensures patients receive comprehensive behavioral health support within the time constraints of primary care.



The Future of Integrated Behavioral Health



With this integration, April Health and Wysa demonstrate that behavioral health care can be both accessible and scalable—offering human support where it's needed while ensuring every patient has continuous access to clinically validated mental health tools. The first providers to adopt this integrated model are April Health's existing primary care partners within LifePoint Healthcare and The Newton Clinic (affiliated with MercyOne).

For Eckerd College students interested in volunteering, interning or having a career in public health, this was an event not to miss. And they didn't.

More than 100 students gathered around tables inside Fox Hall on a recent Wednesday afternoon to learn about opportunities in the healthcare industry. Titled Careers in Public Health: An Informational Fair, the event was part of larger efforts by Eckerd's public health faculty to prepare students for future educational and career paths in the field of public health. The fair was co-sponsored by Eckerd's public health minor and the College's Pre-Health Club.

Among the presenters were representatives from the St. Petersburg Free Clinic, Feeding Tampa Bay, CAN Community Health, Metro Wellness, the Suncoast Center, the Peace Corps, the Florida Department of Health, Empath and the Master's of Public Health programs at Rollins College and at the University of South Florida.

“I was really pleased with the event,” says Lisa Miller, Ph.D., associate professor of sociology at Eckerd, who organized the fair along with Sarah Lyle, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychology. Miller adds that along with visiting with the various organizations, “a number of students stopped by to learn about Eckerd's public health minor, so they could be able to focus on coursework in that area.

Peace Corps recruiter Claudale Daniels drew a large crowd of students.

“We have a huge need for public and community health workers across the globe, especially in the area of illness prevention,” Miller says. “Public health professionals help stop disease and other poor health outcomes in their tracks before they even begin. The students also got to meet with people who work in the field and learn about internship opportunities, careers and master's programs. The fair went over so well that we're planning for a bigger one next spring.”

Eckerd's public health minor, coordinated by Miller, is designed to provide a pre-professional background for students interested in careers in public health, medicine, healthcare administration, health education, epidemiology and related fields. The minor requires five courses: Foundations of Public Health, a Statistics course and three approved electives.

Also represented at the fair was the student-run Pre-Health Club, which includes fields such as pre-vet, biomedical research, pre-nursing, pre–physician assistant and pre-med. There are approximately 200 student names in the club mailing list, and the aim is to network, guide and support pre-health students at Eckerd. Lisa Bonner, assistant professor of chemistry, and Denise Flaherty, associate professor of biology, are the faculty advisers.

Pre-Health Club Secretary Emma Rodriguez is a senior from Hillsborough, New Jersey, majoring in international relations and global affairs and minoring in Spanish and public health. She also volunteers at Metro Inclusive Health, a nonprofit organization that provides health and wellness services throughout the Tampa Bay area and had a table at the event.

“I think we got a ton of freshmen and sophomores at the fair,” Emma says. “And that's great because Metro and many other organizations are offering positions of employment as well as internships and volunteering. After COVID, I think people were exhausted hearing about public health issues. Now people have room to breathe and time to process the idea of not letting that happen again.”

Emma took a break to visit a crowded Peace Corps table and chat with Claudale Daniels, the Peace Corps' Central Florida recruiter. A member of the Eckerd College Peace Corps Prep program, Emma will travel to the Dominican Republic in August to spend two years teaching healthy living practices to middle school– and high school–aged students.

“I get goosebumps when I meet with the students and hear how interested they are,” Daniels says. “Not a lot of people think about it, but the Peace Corps is one of the most challenging things you'll ever do in your life. But living and teaching in an underserved community, there's nothing more rewarding.”

Deenah McFadden, a senior from Willoughby, Ohio, who is co-president of the Pre-Health Club, plans to take a gap year before she starts medical school. She intends to use that year to work in public health or medical research. “I want to see how much I like the public health field to see if I should pursue a dual-degree program,” she explains, “and talk with people already in the public health field about what they enjoy and what they don't.”

An anthropology and biology student who is minoring in public health, Deenah got a good start at the fair, visiting with representatives of all 10 organizations while also helping out at the Pre-Health table.

“I was surprised at first to see so many people at the fair,” she admits. “I know how much interest there is in the public health minor, but to see them follow through on it was exciting.”
