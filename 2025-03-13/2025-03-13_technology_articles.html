NATIONAL REPORT — Whether a single store or a large chain, operating expenses are something every convenience store retailer must deal with. Finding ways to streamline operations and increase efficiency can have a huge impact on an operator's bottom line and so, many c-store retailers are turning to technology to accomplish this goal.

"Operating expenses are expensive and one of the biggest is labor, which has become much more expensive since the pandemic," said Kay Segal, founding partner at Business Accelerator Team, a convenience retailing consultancy based in Phoenix. "We need to rethink processes and use technology that can take repetitive actions away, and enhance the guest interaction."

Technology, both in-store and at the headquarters level, is helping convenience retailers save on labor, monitor equipment, speed up training and onboarding of new employees, and improve customer satisfaction. In many cases, a company's operations and technology departments are coming together to execute plans.

"More and more, I'm hearing about solutions that provide retailers with the ability to take a proactive approach to their operations," said Ed Collupy, owner of Collupy System Solutions LLC, which offers consulting services to the industry. "IoT [Internet of Things] and remote management systems where devices are monitored, such as temperatures and equipment status, or accessed from headquarters, allow retailers to take corrective action sooner rather than later."

Adding new technology also can remove tasks from staff that are better handled with data, giving store employees and managers more time to interact with customers onsite, according to Ed Burcher, a partner at Business Accelerator Team. One example is automated ordering and replenishment, which he said is more accurate with real-time inventory and sales data.

"This applies to all product lines, including foodservice and ingredients," Burcher said. "IoT, and now AI [artificial intelligence], may seem like overused terms, but they are areas where convenience stores can apply technology, connectivity and data to improve their operations."

Atlantis Management Group, which has 300 stores, 100 of which are company owned, is focused on giving its store managers more time to interact with shoppers.

"We are looking to get the manager out of the back office and more in the front of the store and forecourt," said Rick Rigby, chief technology officer for the Mount Vernon, N.Y.-based company. "We are using tablets and mobile tools to free them up."

Customer interaction and satisfaction can be improved by increasing transaction speed as well, using mobile apps for ordering and payment, and self-checkout, according to Burcher.

Additionally, he pointed out that using data "to gain more insight into shopping behaviors to improve the store and digital experience for the guest" can improve operations in real-time and provide ongoing feedback to the operator that can be acted upon at the store level.

"Whether you call it improved data analytics or AI, technology can be applied at many touchpoints for the guest and staff to improve the experience," Burcher said.

Atlantis Management uses InStore.ai's artificial intelligence audio tool to gather information from customers shopping in its stores and provide feedback to its operations team for areas of improvement, according to Rigby.

"Technology can help with customer service by tracking guest interactions and reviewing transactions for opportunities," Burcher noted. "This involves reviewing actual transactions and providing feedback and dashboards to the staff and store. These reviews can be used not only in a call center environment, but also at the point of purchase in-store."

With foodservice becoming such an integral part of many convenience store's offering, finding ways to streamline and improve operations in this high-margin category is crucial. C-store retailers still struggle to compete with the integrated technology available to quick-service restaurants that links customer ordering, food preparation, supply chain and more.

"Some retailers are investing in developing their own solutions or starting up integration projects that will unite kitchen management systems with back-office and POS [point-of-sale] systems," Collupy explained. "There is still a lot of work to be done."

Many c-stores today have automated food ordering through in-store kiosks, screens at the fuel pumps, mobile apps and online ordering. This data, which can be used with other systems, is helping operators forecast demand, create a detailed plan for food prep and get a better handle on inventory replenishment, according to Burcher.

"These systems can not only lead to having the right products available when needed, but also avoid waste by not overproducing," he said, noting that companies such as Supplyit offer an integrated solution that takes "staff preferences out of the equation" to create a detailed production plan for foodservice team members. "This helps all facets of preparation and is probably most critical for hot items like breakfast and roller grill where is there is a very short shelf-life."

Automating reordering and the monitoring of temperatures and equipment for food safety are other ways retailers are utilizing technology to streamline foodservice operations at the store level. Atlantis Management is in the early days of meeting with vendors to leverage foodservice technology such as temperature probes, Rigby shared.

At Kansas City, Mo.-based Fav Trip, which operates five stores, the retailer offers Caribou Coffee and is monitoring the machines to know how much coffee is being sold at what time, as well as for reordering purposes, according to President and CEO Babir Sultan.

"In the world of IoT, every piece of equipment can be connected to analyze usage, cleaning, stock levels, temperature and 'up time,' and report these metrics," Burcher said. "This is being applied to programmable equipment to ensure proper time and temps for heating items and downloading the most up-to-date programs."

Whether it's automating label printers for hundreds of stores or uploading a new recipe with cook times and temperatures for a new menu item or limited-time offer, automation in foodservice operations is aiding convenience retailers, he added.

Technology is playing a role in other facets of c-store operations, including labor optimization. For instance, Fav Trip streamlined its training process from a 20-page booklet down to three pages, and then eventually shifted to a technology-based approach.

"Now, we have them watch a video with a quiz at the end online, and it has reduced our training time. The feedback on it has been amazing," said Sultan, adding that the company tries to connect everything back to data, even its labor decisions. "We use our internal data to see how many people we should have working at what times."

Accounting processes are getting a technology overhaul as well. At both the store manager and headquarters level, Atlantis Management is working with its operations team and accounting department to consolidate and optimize forms, and take processes including invoicing and accounts payable from manual to automated, Rigby reported.

"Tools like Microsoft Power Automate and AI-powered Copilot are what we are using," he said, adding that these tools are being used also for notetaking, meeting summation, email automation and report writing for both managers and headquarters employees.</p>

IRIS, the global provider of mobile F&B and guest experience platforms for the hospitality sector, today announces it has partnered with Coury Hospitality, the leading hospitality management company, to extend F&B mobile ordering across its portfolio following a 44% year-on-year increase in in-room dining sales.

Currently live in 12 Coury Hospitality-managed hotels, the new partnership agreement will see IRIS deliver the brand standard for F&B mobile dining to all the group's properties worldwide. Built to enable operators to deliver swifter, more efficient order processing, it is a seamless way for guests to order F&B items via their own device, without the need for an additional app.

The agreement follows the successful implementation of the IRIS mobile ordering solution at several Coury Hospitality hotels which has delivered an impressive 44% growth in in-room dining sales over the past year, demonstrating the platform's popularity and adoption.

Mobile ordering has enabled the hotels to capture more guest orders and boost guest spend, mainly driven by the ease of ordering and visibility of additional items and upsells which encourages guests to order more per transaction.

Commenting on the partnership, Nicole Haarklau, Director of F&B Operations, Coury Hospitality said, “The response from both guests and staff since we first introduced the IRIS F&B Ordering solution has been overwhelmingly positive. Delivery times have been reduced, and the growth in order volumes, revenue and guest satisfaction is testament to its accessibility and performance.

“Indeed, the number of orders made via mobile now significantly exceeds those made over the phone as guests have been swift to engage at an encouraging rate. The added convenience and time saved have really added to its appeal.

“As guests increasingly turn to mobile ordering it is vital that we partner with a provider that has the knowledge and capability to deliver a solution that enables us to meet this demand and critically, grow with us as we look to expand our portfolio in the future. The IRIS team have proven to be a valuable, dynamic ally with integrations across both our PMS and POS systems which has meant deployment and adoption by staff has been straightforward. We look forward to extending the partnership as they deliver the brand standard for mobile ordering across our portfolio in the future. “

Graham Rushin, VP Sales and Marketing at IRIS added, “Guest demand for mobile dining is accelerating at an unprecedented rate and the growth in digital order volumes and revenue speak for themselves. Across our portfolio we are continuing to invest in the development of solutions that enhance both the guest and staff experience so that ordering is seamless and hoteliers are equipped to realise their full revenue potential.

“Coury Hospitality has undergone an incredible period of growth and we look forward to continuing to work with the team to support and drive forward their plans for the future, delivering a brand standard for mobile ordering that will continue to exceed expectations across its portfolio.”

In Coury Hospitality-managed hotels, IRIS mobile in-room dining is accessible to guests via a QR code situated in strategic locations within guest rooms. The direct integration to the hotel's POS enables orders to be digitally delivered directly to the kitchens, reducing guest wait times and eliminating errors. Likewise, guests benefit from a more readily available menu to view, order and pay at their convenience.

“Today, mission-critical industries require uninterrupted access to precise timing and synchronization,” said Andrea Casalegno, managing director at TOP-IX. “But developing and providing dedicated timing infrastructure can be expensive and resource-intensive, putting it out of reach for many organizations. That's why we introduced our new TaaS offering, which is a secure and reliable alternative to GNSS systems. As the first service of its kind in Italy, it provides our customers with a highly cost-effective and accessible way to achieve the precision synchronization required for even the most demanding applications. Built on Adtran's scalable and flexible Oscilloquartz technology and underpinned by national metrological standards, this solution ensures unmatched accuracy and reliability.”



Adtran's OSA 5410XG and OSA 5412 grandmaster clocks provide the backbone of TOP-IX's TaaS platform. The OSA 5410XG's compact design and high-speed capabilities, including multiple 10Gbit/s ports, enable TOP-IX to meet the increasing demands of high-bandwidth applications while ensuring rapid scalability. Both devices feature Syncjack™ technology, which gives TOP-IX and its customers real-time performance monitoring, ensuring uninterrupted synchronization even in the face of external threats. With low-touch provisioning, the devices can be easily deployed, empowering TOP-IX to offer a secure and affordable alternative to building private timing infrastructures.



“This is a major milestone for Italy's digital infrastructure, enabling organizations to access precise and secure timing without the need for costly dedicated systems,” commented Stuart Broome, GM of EMEA sales at Adtran. “Our technology offers features like jamming and spoofing detection, multi-band GNSS receivers and timing assurance to ensure highly accurate and secure synchronization. With their compact, cost-effective design and low-touch provisioning, our devices enable TOP-IX to quickly deploy services across its network and meet the growing demand for ultra-reliable timing. What's more, by supporting compliance with evolving PNT standards, our solutions help TOP-IX future-proof its offerings and strengthen Italy's national timing infrastructure.”

Police have issued a warning to all phone users over a simple text that could put you in danger - no matter how legitimate it might look. 

Another day, another scam warning. It seems like determined criminals always have a new trick up their sleeve to trick innocent victims, so authorities took to Facebook this week to urge members of the public to remain vigilant.

This particular warning came from Hampden County Sheriff's Office in Massachusetts, though similar scams have been reported elsewhere in the US.

Advert

It all starts with a simple text from a number that's not in your phone contacts, and it explains that you're being contacted in relation to an ongoing investigation.

The text claims that the sender has repeatedly attempted to make contact, reading: "This call is to notify [you] that this is our second attempt to be made to serve you a notice of action pertaining to an investigation being finalized against you."

The text then goes on to encourage the recipient to call back for 'further details on the case or to change its active service status'.

Advert

"Please reference case number 1112525814," one example of the text reads, adding: "Failure to contact them immediately will result in further legal action against you."

Sheriff Nick Cocchi, of the Hampden County Sheriff's Office, issued a warning alongside a screenshot of the text on Facebook, telling the public that if they receive a similar text, they shouldn't trust it.

The post explained: "Criminals are sending alarming messages, claiming the recipient is under investigation and demanding a call back to avoid "legal action." These scammers may also include fake case numbers and links that could install malware."

Cocchi said the alarming nature of the text was all part of the scam, as he continued: "These scammers want to scare people into acting before thinking. Law enforcement will never call, text, or email to demand money, resolve a warrant, or conduct official business. If you receive a message like this, do not engage—delete it and report it."

Advert

The post added that even if the ID attached to the text might appear to be from a 'legitimate agency', it's likely that the scammer actually faked the ID using online services.

"The Hampden County Sheriff's Office will never request payment or personal information over the phone, via text, or online," the post added. "Please share this warning with your family and friends, especially those who may be more vulnerable to scams. Stay safe!"

The warning from Cocchi comes as residents in North Carolina have been experiencing scam texts which claim recipients owe money on an outstanding toll.

Advert

The scam texts claim to be from E-ZPass, EZDriveMA, and FasTrak, ABC 11 reports, with some warning that if you don't pay the toll within 12 hours, the charges will increase and you'll be turned into The Registry of Motor Vehicles.

Steve Grobman, of the security company McAfee, told the outlet: "We need to recognize that what scammers do is they focus on things that scare people and create a sense of urgency."

Experts have warned that you should never click links sent in messages that could be from a scammer, and instead do your own research into whether the claims could be legitimate.

An explosion on the Texas Tech University campus in Lubbock set off fires and power outages Wednesday, leading school officials to issue evacuation orders for several buildings and cancel classes for the rest of the week.

An alert sent to the campus community around 8:45 p.m. described the explosion as occurring at a substation but a later update said it was at a manhole.

No injuries were reported, Lubbock Fire Rescue Capt. Jon Tunnell said.

Videos circulating on social media and local TV stations showed a heavy presence of firefighters on campus and fire and smoke coming out of at least one manhole cover.

It wasn't clear what might have caused the explosion.

Power will be shut down to the entire campus in Lubbock, Texas, while repairs are underway, said Caitlynn Jeffries, a spokesperson for the university's police department.

“You can go ahead and go home for Spring break. We are closing school down for the next couple days,” Jeffries said.

The school also instructed faculty and staff to work remotely if possible until further notice.

Lubbock Fire Rescue responded to a possible gas leak around 7 p.m. local time and found “multiple manhole covers with smoke and fire issuing from them,” Tunnell said.

“This remains a very active scene as crews continue to assist Texas Tech University in mitigating this emergency,” he said.

There are more than 40,000 students at Texas Tech and the school sits on 1,800 acres in West Texas.</p>

Tata Technologies Ltd, a subsidiary of Tata Motors encountered a ransomware attack earlier this year that affected the company's network and forced it to suspend some of its services. Now, TechCrunch has reported that a ransomware group that goes by the name Hunters International has published what it claims to be data stolen from the Pune headquartered company.

According to TechCrunch, who claims to have seen the data published on the gang's dark web leak site said it includes personal details about current and former employees along with some confidential information like purchase orders and some contracts with customers in India and the United States.

The leaked data, which amounts to about 1.4TB in size includes more than 7,30,000 documents like Excel spreadsheets, PDF files and PowerPoint presentations. However, it is still unclear if the data shared by the Hunters International group is in any way related to the recent ransomware attack.

In a filing with the Indian stock exchanges, Tata Technologies had said that an investigation was underway “in consultation with experts to assess the root cause and take remedial action as necessary.”

For those unfamiliar, Hunters International is a relatively new ransomware-as-a-service group that offers its infrastructure to hackers and takes a cut of the ransom payments. It is also affiliated with the Hive gang, which may have previously leaked stolen data from Tata Power back in 2022.

Founded in 1989 as an automotive unit of Tata Motors, Tata Technologies focuses on automotive design, aerospace engineering and research and development and has an annual revenue of $600 million, operating in more than 18 locations in India, Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America.

The topic of nuclear energy continues to be a hot-button item in Eagle Mountain.

The city is exploring the idea of integrating small modular reactors, or SMRs, among other forms of advanced power generation facilities within the city.

In January, the Eagle Mountain City Council halted on voting in favor or against a code amendment to the city's Regional Technology and Industry overlay zone.

The code change, according to city officials, could open the door in facilitating the use of a variety of energy options in the city, including battery energy storage systems, solar energy projects, electrical substations, power lines and small modular reactors.

However, Eagle Mountain city leaders wanted to allow more time to gather information about nuclear technology.

On Monday, the city hosted an energy town hall at Cedar Valley High School, featuring a panel of energy experts with an abundance of experience in the field.

Expertise among the six panelists include coal, renewable and battery storage, biofuels, oil shale, nuclear power, hydrogen and advanced combustion.

Mayor Tom Westmoreland moderated the discussion and presented a slew of questions from community members to the panel.

“We're not going to solve any problems tonight, but we're going to begin the discussion,” Westmoreland said during the town hall. “Definitely the place to start is by informing and educating ourselves and learning all that we can about energy so that we can make good decisions going forward.”

City leaders note the exploration of SMRs comes as Eagle Mountain examines sustainable and long-term energy solutions to meet the growing needs of its population and business landscape.

Matthew Memmott, an associate professor in chemical engineering at Brigham Young University, said nuclear technology such as SMRs are making headway but often face opposition from the public due to the perception regarding radiation.

“In reality, the world is awash with radiation, and if we can't handle even the slightest bit of radiation, we should not be living on the planet,” Memmott said.

Panelists noted the need for a modernized power grid with a capacity to meet the future energy demands that Eagle Mountain anticipates.

With safety being top of mind for many who are skeptical of allowing such technology to enter the area, due to the smaller footprint of modern SMRs, only the boundaries of the nuclear site would be required to evacuate.

“So for large (nuclear) plants, they actually plan the escape for how traffic has to move; that is done out to 10 miles,” said Jess Gehin, associate laboratory director at Idaho National Laboratory. “For modern SMRs, that is reduced down to the site boundary.”

Panelists also discussed regulatory frameworks, economic considerations associated with these energy solutions and potential health risks.

Eagle Mountain officials say nuclear energy, particularly through the deployment of nonwater cooled SMRs, is being considered for its potential to provide a stable and low-carbon power supply.

Currently, the city has not authorized any nuclear energy projects, but they aren't ruling it out for the future.

As Eagle Mountain continues to weigh the option, leaders encourage citizens to get involved in the decision-making process by attending public meetings and connecting with elected officials.

The City Council's next meeting will be held Tuesday at Eagle Mountain city hall, located at 1650 Stagecoach Run.
