All these will strengthen Kyiv's position in negotiations and deter Russia from breaching any deal, they say. Russia hasn't committed to it yet, and many here are skeptical that Moscow will deal in good faith. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting a summit by video this weekend to discuss the still-undefined international force that would back any long-term truce. The idea of a European force in Ukraine backed by air and sea power has gained support, but it's certainly not unanimous. A peace deal could unfold in multiple phases, others have said, with more countries joining the coalition as plans advance.</p>

The comments signal there will be tough negotiations ahead that could frustrate President Donald Trump's hope for a swift peace deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday refused to fully embrace a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war, stating that there were “nuances” that required “painstaking research,” especially since Russian forces were advancing in the war. Putin also talked about how Russian troops were advancing against the remaining Ukrainian forces in its southern Kursk region. It would also allow Russia to capture more territory and continue its slow advance in eastern Ukraine. Syrsky said Russia had “almost completely destroyed” the town of Sudzha with its aerial bombardment.</p>

Raphael Satter had his OCI card taken away after publishing a story critical of an Indian businessman According to the letter sent to Satter in December 2023, his OCI status was revoked for his alleged “practising [of] journalism without proper permission” and for work that had been “maliciously creating adverse and biased opinion against Indian institutions in the international arena”. Rajat Khare's US representative, the lawfirm Clare Locke, rejected any association between its client and the cyber-mercenary business, telling Reuters that Khare “has never operated or supported, and certainly did not create, any illegal ‘hack for hire' industry in India or anywhere else”. Khare has been active in pursuing news organisations that have published articles on the activities of Appin. In a statement sent to the Guardian, Satter said the Indian government's decision to cancel his OCI had “effectively cut me off from members of my family and a country I hold in great affection and respect”.</p>

Is a deadly past replaying for Congolese as M23 rebels march on Kinshasa amid presence of Rwandan and Ugandan troops? Tariffs and threats to annex Canada fall into Donald Trump's wider vision for US dominance in the world, experts say. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Algeria produce nearly half of the world's dates.

They devote a lot of time to this issue, and we are thankful to them because it's all for the noble cause of stopping hostilities and preventing human casualties," he said. I have already said to President Putin that this is not the era of war. Since the Ukraine conflict began in February last year, PM Modi has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a number of times. "He put out a very promising statement but it wasn't complete," Trump, who was meeting NATO chief Mark Rutte at the White House, told reporters when asked about Putin's remarks.</p>

When Donatella Versace took over the house of Versace in the aftermath of her brother Gianni's murder, most observers privately assumed that her reign would be no more than a postscript. She was praised for taking a stand against Italy's anti-gay policies after saying in a speech in 2023: “Our government is trying to take away people's rights to live as they wish.” She has always seen herself as the custodian queen of Versace, with a responsibility to keep her brother's spirit alive. “I am excited to see Versace through new eyes,” she said in a statement.

Researchers say environmental impact from Kakhovka dam explosion comparable to Chornobyl nuclear disaster Lakebed sediments holding 83,000 tonnes of heavy metals were exposed when the Kakhovka dam was blown up one year into Russia's invasion, researchers found. They said the remaining pollutants would leach into rivers as rains wore down the sediment, threatening human health in a region where river water is widely used to make up for shortages in municipal water supplies. Its reservoir supplied water to cool the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and irrigate southern Ukraine. Water has repeatedly been used as a weapon of war in Ukraine, with attackers and defenders having blown up dams for military gain.</p>

Key points of 30-day ceasefire agreed by US and Ukraine, with ball ‘now in Russia's court' Ukraine has said it is ready to accept a US proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia. The key part of a joint statement released after the Jeddah meeting was that Ukraine was willing to “enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire which can be extended”. That goes further than a previous suggestion from Kyiv for an initial air and sea ceasefire, which left open the possibility of ground warfare to continue. However, Zelenskyy's key demand was that the US would provide it with security guarantees – essentially a commitment to protect it if Russia were to renege on any ceasefire or peace deal.</p>

An American influencer who was filmed snatching a baby wombat from its mother has sparked deep upset in Australia, prompting an investigation by immigration authorities into her visa status, ire from the country's prime minister and a mass petition calling for her deportation. “My dream of holding a wombat has been realized!” the video's caption read, according to Australian media. “Baby and mom slowly waddled back off together into the bush,” it added — a claim that was not immediately verifiable. He also noted that — while not normally aggressive — mothers can be defensive when separated from their offspring. They have powerful claws designed for digging a tunnel system, which can range from two to 20 meters in length.</p>

Homes searched in inquiry into alleged corruption at European parliament relating to Chinese technology giant Several people have been arrested and homes searched as part of an investigation into alleged bribery and corruption at the European parliament relating to the Chinese technology giant Huawei, Belgian prosecutors have said. The first statement said that several individuals had been arrested for questioning over their alleged involvement “in active corruption within the European parliament”, as well as forgery and use of forgeries. Investigators are also examining whether money laundering took place, as they suspect intermediaries may have received payments to disguise the trail. The authorities said “several people” had been arrested for questioning, including one male suspect in France under a European arrest warrant, but declined to give further details.</p>

Poul Petersen, a senior official for Demokraatit said he did not expect the party to win this big. Demokraatit won 29.9% of the vote by campaigning to improve housing and educational standards while delaying independence until Greenland is self-sufficient. “But this party who won, they don't want to hurry things so everything must be done right.” “What approach to independence will win the day will ultimately depend on if Demokraatit decides to form a coalition government, and if so, with which party,” said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen congratulated Demokraatit and warned that Greenland's new government would likely have to “deal with massive pressure” from Trump.</p>

Judge William Alsup said the justification of "poor performance" for mass lay-offs was "a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements," the New York Times reported. Ruling on a lawsuit brought by employee unions, Alsup ordered the departments of the Treasury, Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy and Interior to reinstate anyone improperly fired. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has taken an axe to the US government, cutting spending programs and firing tens of thousands of federal employees. His actions have faced pushback from the courts, with several judges issuing injunctions intended to halt them.

“My husband was kidnapped from our home, and it's shameful that the US government continues to hold him because he stood for the rights and lives of his people,” his wife, Noor Abdalla, who is eight months pregnant, said in a statement read by her lawyer outside a New York court this week. Khalil worked for years on the British government's flagship grant programme that brings foreign students to study at UK universities, as well as in a support role for which he helped to inform and shape British foreign policy on Syria through his knowledge and Arabic skills. “Nobody can protect you,” said Cobb, advising them to avoid filling their social media with commentary on the Middle East. “It's completely absurd that US government is saying Mahmoud presents a threat to its foreign policy interests,” said Sisay. Before starting work for the British government, Khalil would have been questioned about his political beliefs, said Waller.</p>

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan's military said Wednesday that a two-day battle with separatist militants over a hijacked passenger train had ended in bloodshed, claiming the lives of at least 25 soldiers and civilians held hostage and dozens of militants. More than 400 people were believed to be on board when the train was seized. Hours later, Pakistan's military said its operation to free the hostages has been completed. The army said it had killed all 33 attackers and lost four of its men. The deepwater Gwadar port in southern Baluchistan is a key component of that plan.</p>

Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, quickly condemned the report's findings as baseless. A report last year by the U.N. commission that investigated killings, torture and other crimes by Hamas and affiliated Palestinian militant groups during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel found “reasonable grounds” that perpetrators had committed sexual violence. Israel's energy minister said Sunday that he would immediately cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip, in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas on negotiations after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired on March 1. Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.</p>

Tusk made the statement on Thursday after meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, urging him to play a key role in any potential peace process. Tusk told reporters that Poland would invest heavily in “securing” its eastern frontier, deploying drones and other military assets. “After all, we are not talking about a common European army,” Tusk said, “but a very specific problem, namely securing Poland's eastern border, the border with Russia and Belarus.” Tusk argues that Poland must serve as a “bastion” to protect NATO's eastern border and should expand its military capabilities. Moscow has rejected accusations that it poses a military threat to Europe, with Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissing the claims as “nonsense” designed to justify increased military budgets.</p>

Parts of Los Angeles hit by January blazes under evacuation warnings as west coast braces for heavy rain and snow The US west coast is facing an atmospheric river event threatening flooding and power outages due to heavy rain and snow, with more than 20 million people in southern California under flood watches. “While we prepare for another storm headed towards LA, I want to urge Angelenos to stay vigilant, especially in burn scar areas,” the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, said in a statement. “In Altadena and the Palisades, we're continuing our months-long efforts to protect against potential debris flows,” Newsom stated on social media. The California governor's office of emergency services explained in areas burned by intense wildfires, the soil can develop a layer that repels water rather than absorb water, resulting in significantly less rain to produce a flash flood.</p>

Three more Norwegian ski jumpers were suspended on Thursday in a widening cheating scandal that has shocked the sport. FIS said it was asked to seize all jump suits used by Norway at the world championships in Trondheim last week and found no irregularities. But it said findings that “raised additional suspicions of manipulation” led to the suspensions of Pederson, Sundal and Johansson, who will not be able to take part in any events organized by FIS or national ski associations. “We know exactly the situation and I heard [it said] that, ‘Yeah, but ski jumping is special. “We are all aware that this is not the best moment for ski jumping, but I think this is the way that we want to go,” FIS race director of ski jumping Sandro Pertile said.</p>

Although Versace's status in popular culture rose on Gianni's watch – he designed Liz Hurley's safety-pin dress and choreographed the 1991 show in which the supermodels Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista lip-synched to George Michael's Freedom on the catwalk – it was consolidated by Donatella, who went on to work closely with Madonna and design, among other things, interiors, hotels and Jennifer Lopez's plunging “jungle” dress worn to the Grammy's in 2000. It is also thought that the Prada group, which owns Miu Miu, wants to buy Versace and has an exclusive bidding window on the brand – and that Vitale will provide a new wave of energy. But he had been rumoured to be a contender for roles at Bottega Veneta and Gucci.</p>

Russia is ready for a ceasefire in the Ukraine conflict, President Vladimir Putin has said, stressing that such an agreement “must lead to long-term peace.” Moscow believes that the “idea” of a ceasefire is the “right one,” Putin told journalists during a joint press conference with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Moscow on Thursday. Certain issues still need to be discussed and resolved before a truce can be reached, Putin stated, adding that Moscow particularly needs to discuss them with the US. “Should we just let them out after they committed numerous crimes against civilians?

Former Philippines president filmed a video message en route to the Hague, saying ‘I will be responsible for everything' Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has said he will accept responsibility for his government's so-called “war on drugs” in a video message filmed on board a plane shortly before he was taken into the custody of the international criminal court (ICC). “I am OK, do not worry,” Duterte, who will turn 80 this month, said in the video message. Lawyers for Duterte on Wednesday filed a petition on behalf of his youngest daughter, Veronica, accusing the government of “kidnapping” him, and demanding he be returned to the Philippines. The country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who once ran in an alliance with vice-president Sara Duterte but is now embroiled in a bitter feud with the family, told reporters this week he was confident “the arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures”.</p>

Trump has arguably been most antagonistic toward Canada with persistent talk of it becoming the 51st U.S. state, additional tariffs and repeated insults against its leadership. Rubio had downplayed Trump's earlier comments, saying the president was only expressing what he thought would be a good idea. On tariffs, Rubio said G7 partners should understand that these are a “policy decision” by Trump to protect American competitiveness. Rubio notably skipped a meeting of G20 foreign ministers — a bigger but less powerful group that includes developing nations — last month in South Africa because of his concerns that the agenda, which included climate change and diversity, did not align with Trump administration policies. “So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,” Putin said at a news conference in Moscow.</p>

Meloni believes that Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are “rushing ahead” with their idea, according to La Repubblica. Shortly after the summit, Meloni stressed that “Italy will not be sending troops to Ukraine.” She suggested that European politicians should instead focus on developing conditions for a just and lasting peace between Moscow and Kiev, including security guarantees for Ukraine.

A plane carrying former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to The Hague takes off in Manila, Philippines on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. Police secure an area where former President Rodrigo Duterte is held after his arrest at the Villamor Air Base in Manila, Philippines on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. Duterte was once feared for his brutal anti-crime crackdowns and reviled for his irreverence while in office — he called Pope Francis a “son of a bitch” at one time and said that U.S. President Barack Obama could “go to hell.” Duterte was arrested Tuesday after he arrived at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport with his common-law wife, daughter and friends from Hong Kong. Duterte's lawyers said that Philippine authorities didn't show any copy of the ICC warrant and violated his constitutional rights.</p>

Gold soared to a record high Thursday as US president Donald Trump threatened to impose huge tariffs on champagne, wine and other alcoholic products from European Union countries.

The fresh threats added to global trade uncertainty pushing gold, seen as a safe-haven investment, to an all-time high of $2,971 per ounce in afternoon deals, surpassing its late February record.

The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of war crimes in Gaza, which they deny. The Jewish Voice for Peace protesters, who carried banners and wore red shirts reading “Jews say stop arming Israel,” chanted “Bring Mahmoud home now!” Syria's interim rulers have struggled to exert their authority nationwide since they overthrew ex-President Bashar Assad last year in a lightning offensive led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. These 25,000 patients include chronically ill people with cancer, heart disease or hemophilia whose regular treatment has been interrupted due to Gaza's destroyed healthcare infrastructure. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants.</p>

Predictions that US firms could retain manufacturing plants in Ireland but move profits back to America About €50bn (£42bn) of medicines are exported worldwide from Ireland every year, according to official data, and Regan says many “never touch Irish soil”. “One could argue that up to half of the corporate tax take in Ireland is volatile and based on, quite frankly, phantom exports,” Regan said. Dermot O'Leary, an economist with Goodbody stockbrokers in Dublin, agreed that tax would be far quicker to repatriate than jobs. The country's fiscal watchdog estimates 75% of all corporate tax is paid by large US multinationals, with three firms alone responsible for almost 40%.</p>

Exclusive: Jotham Napat said pact must be taken ‘back to the drawing board' and should reflect climate change as security issue Climate change is mentioned once in the document, under a section on “Environment and Resource Security”. In addition to greater reference to climate change, Napat said he also wanted “an official waiver-free agreement with Australia” as part of a new deal so citizens could more easily travel between the two countries. Australia's push for security and policing agreements with Pacific countries – including Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu, Solomon Islands, Fiji – has been widely viewed as part of its effort to counter China's growing influence in the region.

Farmers sweat as they await word on whether Donald Trump will extend tariffs to $6.2bn in meat exports Australian farmers are anxiously waiting to hear whether $6.2bn in meat exports will be hit in the next round of Trump tariffs, as Anthony Albanese says the fight to reverse American imposts on steel and aluminium could last months. Gordon, a former chief economist at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said retaliatory tariffs would simply lead to Australians paying more for imported goods. The United States is Australia's number one international market for beef, lamb and goat meat. Albanese on Thursday preached patience, saying, “The last time around it took many months of negotiations and lobbying in order to achieve an outcome.”</p>

Russia is not interested in temporary solutions to the Ukraine conflict and instead wants to achieve a lasting peaceful settlement that takes Moscow's interests and concerns into account, President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov has said. His comments come as US envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow to present the results of talks between representatives from Kiev and Washington in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, after which they released a joint statement backing a 30-day ceasefire. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has hinted that US-Russia talks could take place in the near future, perhaps even later on Thursday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also confirmed that US negotiators are already on their way to Russia but has not disclosed whether or not Putin intends to meet with Witkoff on Thursday. Moscow has previously spoken out against any temporary truce in the Ukraine conflict, arguing that Kiev would simply use it to rearm and continue fighting.</p>

A group of NGOs linked to billionaire George Soros has placed the US on a watchlist of “countries with faltering civic freedoms,” citing executive orders signed by President Donald Trump since he assumed office in January. USAID, Washington's primary channel for sending money to causes abroad, was accused of misusing taxpayer money and fostering corruption, and had most of its employees laid off or placed on leave. A self-proclaimed “global alliance of civil society organizations and activists working to strengthen citizen action,” CIVICUS has received funding from the Open Society Foundations (OSF), established by Hungarian-American financier Soros, according to Spanish outlet Okdiario. Soros is well known for financing liberal causes and political candidates across the Western world. Most recently, Soros has been accused of spending millions of dollars to block Trump's political agenda, a claim that has been supported by the US president's close ally and adviser, Elon Musk.</p>

Vladimir Zelensky's leadership is coming to an end, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing a senior official in Kiev. The current US administration has recently been trying to negotiate a path toward ending hostilities. US President Donald Trump briefly halted military assistance and intelligence sharing with Kiev, but resumed it following a bilateral meeting in Saudi Arabia earlier this week. According to Ukrainian soldiers, analysts, and officials cited by the newspaper, Kiev would be able to keep fighting for “at least six months” in case of a complete halt of military assistance from the US. Last month, US President Donald Trump questioned Zelensky's legitimacy, branding him a “dictator without elections.”</p>

Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani's Jio, the largest telecom operator in the country, has announced a partnership with Elon Musk's SpaceX to bring Starlink internet service to India. Jio, a part of Ambani's vast Reliance Industries conglomerate, which operates ini hydrocarbons and petrochemicals, retail, telecom and media, said in a statement on Wednesday that it will utilize its vast data traffic network to bring Starlink's broadband services to all parts of India, particularly in the rural and remote areas. While Reliance Jio had advocated for an auction-based approach, the Indian government ultimately decided to allocate the spectrum administratively, a method supported by Elon Musk and in line with international practices. In December, the Indian Army conducted a search operation across multiple districts in Manipur, seizing a range of items including guns, bombs, ammunition, and Starlink devices. Elon Musk responded to these claims, denying them and stating on X that this was false and clarified that Starlink's satellite beams are turned off over India.</p>

US President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived for high-end talks in Moscow on Thursday. Moscow has a number of questions about the US ceasefire proposal that will need to be raised in upcoming talks, Putin explained. ”This means we must prevent any risks of revanchism, which logically entails that Ukraine should not maintain offensive military capabilities or embrace an aggressive Nazi ideology aimed against Russia,” Primakov stressed. Russian President Vladimir Putin is not expected to hold a telephone conversation with Trump on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has told reporters.

In a statement on Wednesday, the region's communication affairs bureau said some senior Tigray army commanders have been plotting a coup against the government since January. A faction of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) – formerly Ethiopia's dominant political party – reported on Tuesday that it has taken over the northern town of Adigrat. Tigray's interim administration was established in 2023 as part of the Pretoria Agreement, an African Union-mediated peace deal concluded in the South African capital that ended two years of fighting between Tigrayan forces and the federal government. “It must not remain silent as the Pretoria Agreement is violated and the people of Tigray enter into a second round of destruction,” it added. The TPLF responded by accusing government officials of “betraying” national interests and “becoming agents of external forces.” It condemned the removal of top generals as “concerted internal and external conspiracies to disband” the army.</p>

Finland's Defense Ministry said other contents of the aid package would not be divulged at this time.

Putin's remarks came hours after the jet of Trump's envoy and close ally, Steven Witkoff, landed in Moscow, where he is expected to meet the Russian leader to push for a ceasefire after Washington's talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Ukraine has said it would need some kind of security guarantee in order to sign a lasting ceasefire deal. Putin could also revisit some of his broader demands from 2021, which go beyond Ukraine, including a call for Nato to halt the deployment of weapons in member states that joined after 1997, when the alliance began expanding into former communist countries.</p>

Sailors crossing the Atlantic in March are used to dealing with rough seas. “Coming to an actual agreement is a better weapon in our arsenal,” the source said. Another steel industry executive, whose business exports about 10% of its products to the US, says Trump's argument for restrictions on the vast supply from China in particular was “something that I don't totally disagree with”. Trump's argument when faced by global stock market turmoil in recent days is that there will be a “period of transition” – and maybe even a recession – while businesses are forced to shift manufacturing to the US, “reshoring” jobs. “It's hard to think that anyone is looking at the US as a reliable partner.”</p>

"It would be nothing more than a temporary breather for the Ukrainian military," Yuri Ushakov told state media after speaking by phone to US national security advisor Mike Waltz. He said President Vladimir Putin would "probably make more specific and substantive assessments" on Thursday. "That is what we are striving for," he said. "Any steps that imitate peaceful action are I believe not needed by anyone in the current situation," he said.

The outgoing parliament met on Thursday to debate the creation of a €500bn (£420bn) fund for infrastructure investment and radical changes in Germany's borrowing limits in order to boost defence spending. An expanded group of far-right and far-left MPs could oppose it in the new Bundestag, a “blocking minority” Merz is keen to avoid. He asked the Greens: “What more do you want from us in so short a time?” The Greens' parliamentary co-leader Britta Haßelmann accused Merz of “bad manners”, saying he had not sought a proper, respectful conversation with her party but had instead simply left a message on her voicemail. Economists have described Merz's multibillion-euro package as everything from a “bazooka” to “an extremely risky bet”, while he has called it vital “in light of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent”.</p>

Russia and the US have begun talks in Moscow on the results of Tuesday's meeting between American and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. The US envoy's arrival in Moscow comes after representatives from Kiev and Washington issued a joint statement confirming that Kiev had agreed to a proposed 30-day ceasefire while the US announced the resumption of military aid and information sharing with Ukraine, after nearly 9.5 hours of talks in Jeddah on Tuesday. At a press briefing on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova revealed that Moscow had closely examined the results of the talks and the relevant statements, but added that Moscow had yet to receive a formal ceasefire proposal. Moscow has previously opposed any temporary truce in the Ukraine conflict, arguing that Kiev will simply use it to rearm and continue fighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted that a resolution to the conflict must address the root causes in order to establish a long-lasting peace.</p>

The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage and sent 11 people to hospital, officials said. One woman was injured after part of a ceiling fell, and several others suffered cuts from glass that broke in the quake, Manfredi said. Seismologists have reported a fresh increase in activity around the Phlegrean Fields over recent weeks. Authorities last summer conducted drills in preparation for a major emergency as the frequency of temblors increased. The surface has been pushed up 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) since 2006, which is higher than prior to the last major event in 1984, but seismologists have emphasized it is impossible to predict when an eruption or stronger quake might occur.</p>

Germany's historic shift on fiscal expansion is set to reshape Europe's economic landscape, unlocking a wave of public spending that could boost growth across the eurozone. Goldman Sachs analysts have identified 12 buy-rated European companies outside the defence sector that could ride this spending boom, spanning industries from airport operations to renewable energy. RWE – A re-industrialisation effort in Germany could drive power demand growth by one percentage point per year, boosting investment across the electricity value chain. “Akzo's shares are trading at a significant discount to historical averages,” said Goldman Sachs's Georgina Fraser, PhD, adding that European fiscal expansion and post-war reconstruction in Ukraine could provide further tailwinds. “The new policies could incentivise private homeowners to modernise their properties by leveraging subsidies and tax incentives,” said Jonathan Kownator, a Goldman Sachs analyst.</p>

One of the complaints has been that Jags have been too restrictive in interpreting rules of engagement and took the requirement that soldiers positively identify a target as an enemy combatant before opening fire to mean soldiers needed to identify the target having a weapon. Some of those rules were a deliberate policy shift by the US military, after senior officers such as Gen David Petraeus came to believe that civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan were turning the local population against US forces and drawing support to the enemy. But he intends to change how they are interpreted, the people said. But it did not constrain a reform of the Jag corps from within.</p>

Last week, Kinshasa's Health Ministry reported that more than 8,500 people have been killed this year. Congolese authorities had previously refused to hold talks with the rebels, and Angola-mediated peace efforts were halted last December after Rwanda demanded that Kinshasa engage directly with the M23. On Wednesday, Tina Salama, spokesperson for Congolese President Tshisekedi, told Reuters that the government had received an invitation from Angola but had not confirmed whether it would participate in the dialogue. In response, Bertrand Bisimwa, an M23 leader, said dialogue is “the only civilized option to resolve the current crisis that has lasted for decades.” “We are committed to defeating Mr. Tshisekedi's military option and bringing him, willingly or by force, to the negotiating table,” he wrote on X.</p>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.rt.com/russia/614070-sudzha-liberation-kursk-ukraine/'>Russian forces liberate largest Ukrainian-held town in Kursk Region</a></h2><b>Source:</b> rt.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 09:11:00 <p>
In the last 24 hours the Ukrainian forces fighting in Kursk Region have lost more than 340 servicemen, two infantry fighting vehicles, three armored personnel carriers and dozens of pieces of other hardware, the ministry said. Ukraine launched an incursion into the Kursk Region on August 6 last year, in the largest attack on internationally recognized Russian territory since the escalation of hostilities between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022. The Ukrainian advance, involving some 35,000 troops according to Moscow's estimates, was swiftly halted, and the territory under Kiev's control has steadily shrunk since then. On Wednesday, videos were also published by Telegram channels purporting to show troops unfolding a Russian flag in the town's main square. According the latest data from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Kiev's losses in the eight months since the launch of its incursion total over 67,100 servicemen killed or injured, 392 tanks, 316 infantry fighting vehicles, 278 armored personnel carriers, and hundreds of other pieces of equipment, including 13 US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers.</p>

President Ursula von der Leyen has labeled the figure “by far, too low.” The proposed rules “will ensure that those who have no right to stay in the EU are actually returned” to their countries of origin, EU Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration, Magnus Brunner, has claimed. The reforms aim to encourage voluntary returns and close loopholes currently exploited by illegal immigrants who evade forced repatriation by moving between EU countries. Illegal immigration has remained a hot-button issue in the EU since the 2015 crisis, which saw over a million people arrive in member states. Political guidelines issued by von der Leyen last July pledged to strengthen the EU's borders and crack down on human trafficking, a significant driver of illegal immigration.</p>

However, Ukraine's stock of ATACMS had been fully exhausted by late January, the AP reported on Wednesday. The previous administration of US President Joe Biden initially forbade Ukraine from striking deep into Russia with American-made weapons, but eventually reversed its stance on the issue. Moscow had warned the US and its allies against greenlighting long-range Ukrainian strikes, arguing that they would make NATO a direct participant in the conflict due to Kiev's inability to fire sophisticated weapons on its own. The Russian military says it has been successful in shooting down ATACMS and other longer-range Western-made munitions on most occasions. The Defense Ministry in Moscow has not reported intercepting American missiles since mid-January.</p>

Russian state media claimed that Moscow's operation to remove Ukrainian forces from Kursk had entered its final stage, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. At the same time, Ukraine's army commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi suggested his troops were pulling back to minimise losses. "My priority has been and remains saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers," Syrskyi said, adding his troops would move to "more favourable conditions" if necessary. Because right now, Russian strikes have not stopped," Zelenskyy said on Wednesday evening about the ceasefire negotiations. For its part, the Kremlin has not publicly said whether it supports a ceasefire or not, with foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Russia was ready to talk to the US about a potential peace initiative "as early as today."</p>

Australia's interior minister said on Thursday his department was reviewing the visa status of an American influencer who uploaded a video of her grabbing a baby wombat in an incident that has caused outrage in the country. It shows her picking up the baby wombat, a protected species of marsupial found only in Australia, that is seen struggling and heard hissing as its mother follows on the road behind. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement his department was reviewing the conditions of Jones' current visa and determining whether immigration law had been breached.

Despite its highly educated female population, Japan is ranked 118th out of 146 in the 2024 World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap report and women leaders remain rare in Japanese business and politics. The university said there was an unwritten rule that two spouses should not work there because it was a small institution, public broadcaster NHK said. Even then the man was demoted to associate professor while the woman, an assistant professor, was made a clerical official, UMK reported. "I felt I had been demanded to choose between marriage and career," the woman said in television footage that did not show her face.

In a social media post this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that 83 percent of all USAID programs have been canceled and that the remainder will be folded into the State Department. An emergency U.N. campaign for Sudan, where an estimated 30 million people are in extreme need of basic assistance for food, medical care and shelter, has reached between 5 and 10 percent of its funding target so far, Fletcher said. About 10 percent of all nongovernmental organization, or NGO, workers for humanitarian agencies were laid off during February, he said. During a January tour there before the latest cutoff, Fletcher said, “it was much, much worse than I'd anticipated, and I'd really prepared myself for the worst,” he said. In a “humanitarian reset” document distributed Tuesday, he set out 10 actions to deal with the funding crisis, including tasking senior representatives to report by the end of this week on how they can “prioritize urgent life-saving actions.” He also stressed the need to find new funding sources, including from wealthy Persian Gulf countries and renewed grassroots appeals for private donations.</p>

The European Commission published a 99-page list of U.S. goods that could be hit, including chewing gum, soybeans, home appliances, beef, poultry and alcoholic beverages. “There's so much unpredictability these days.” The administration has pledged more tariffs on a broader range of imports from U.S. trading partners that could start in April. “We jointly identified the few areas that would allow us to move forward by fostering a mutual benefit,” he told reporters.</p>

One caveat raised in recent days, following President Trump's blockage of aid to Ukraine, is the U.S. actively impeding European NATO action.

Already, Ethiopia has been forced to lay off 5,000 local healthcare workers who were working on its HIV response. More than two years after the war killed hundreds of thousands, full-scale recovery efforts are yet to start. Efforts to assist thousands of women who were raped during the war have been derailed, said Rigat Bishaw at Ayder Hospital, Tigray's biggest healthcare facility.

Stargazers in North and South America will be able to view a red-colored "Blood Moon" starting Thursday night in the first total lunar eclipse visible on the continents since 2022. The celestial event, observable with the naked eye, will have more than an hour of totality and can additionally be seen in parts of western Europe and Africa, as well as New Zealand. "That totality will last for close to an hour, so even if it's cloudy you may still be able to glimpse it if the clouds are scattered." For about an hour both before and after totality, the moon will also be obscured in a partial eclipse.

Earlier this month, outgoing Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau called US president Donald Trump's tariffs “very dumb”. We don't yet know just how many more exports may be in the firing line. Just under one-third of Australian super fund balances are held in overseas listed equities so, even if we don't face recession at home, and our share market manages to recover some of its recent losses, those balances remain vulnerable to the brewing global economic storm. We have no certainty around what the ultimate size or duration of economic fallout will be, because we still have no certainty around what tariff regimes will look like when the dust settles (nor other chaotic policies that may be on Trump's agenda). While we are just seeing the signs that the pain of higher interest rates has indeed paid a dividend in bringing inflation close to target, our consumer and business confidence levels remain in a delicate condition.</p>

US President Donald Trump said he would respond to the European Union's retaliatory tariffs as a global trade war escalates. Other countries did not take immediate countermeasures against Trump's metal tariffs, but most expressed a willingness for dialogue. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Trump's tariffs are “entirely unjustified” and that Australia will continue discussions for an exemption. Nonetheless, the European stock markets continued to outperform global peers, driven by expectations of easing fiscal rules for defence spending.</p>

President Trump couldn't help but laugh as he was momentarily distracted by Mr Vance's crazy-patterned socks. I will say when we meet later in the Oval Office, President Trump is a very big fan of conservative dress, so if he notices these socks, you have to defend me in the Oval Office by saying, 'This is an important part of cementing the Irish-American relationship,p and this is the only reason he is wearing these socks.'"

Even as calls grew to investigate accusations of systematic, state-sanctioned killings by police, Duterte remained popular. A national survey in 2019 found that around 80 percent of Filipinos polled were “satisfied” with the administration's campaign. The Philippine government in June 2022 reported that at least 6,252 people had died “during antidrug operations” since July 2016. He was expected to meet with then-President Barack Obama, who called the meeting off after Duterte in that briefing used a Tagalog expression literally meaning “son of a whore” in threatening to curse Obama if he raised the subject of extrajudicial killings. The ICC began investigating Duterte in 2018, and three years later it formally authorized an investigation on accusations of extrajudicial killings amounting to a crime against humanity.</p>

An elected leader once dubbed “The Punisher” was handed to The Hague to face trial for crimes against humanity over his brutal war on drugs, in a breathtaking reversal of fortune for a politician who once openly boasted about killing people and placing opponents on hit lists. Authorities were waiting for Duterte to return from Hong Kong, and arrested him at the main airport in Manila, sparking chaotic scenes. Nobel laureate Maria Ressa told CNN Duterte's arrest marks a major moment for the country and signals that years of impunity can be ended.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday warned his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, of "devastating" sanctions if Moscow refused a deal on a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. And if we do, I think that would be 80 percent of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished," he said while speaking about the three-year war. He later also halted military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine but resumed after Kyiv agreed to the truce proposal on Tuesday. After US and Ukrainian officials concluded talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Volodymyr Zelensky backed the ceasefire proposal but said that Washington needed to persuade Russia to accept it. "I have emphasized this many times: none of us trust the Russians."</p>

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The International Criminal Court took custody of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity for deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office. An ambulance drove to the hangar where his plane was taken, and medics wheeled a gurney inside. If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Duterte could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Duterte's supporters, however, criticized his arrest as illegal and sought to have him returned home.

But Duterte arguably would not have been surrendered to The Hague if it weren't for his family's dramatic feud with that of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the current president. His government has continued to maintain that it would not assist the court, of which the Philippines is no longer a member, but explained that it would cooperate with any arrest warrant issued via Interpol. Shortly after the plane carrying Duterte took off on Tuesday night, Marcos Jr told reporters: “The arrest that we did today was in compliance with our commitments to Interpol. According to Tony La Viña, a lawyer and former dean of the Ateneo de Manila University school of government, the arrest was a “perfect execution” by Marcos Jr's administration. Rodrigo Duterte's supporters have portrayed him as a victim who was denied due process by the vengeful Marcos family, and who has been wrongly handed over to foreigners.</p>

They included demands that would constrain US and NATO military operations from Eastern Europe to Central Asia. In those talks, Russia demanded that Ukraine give up its NATO ambitions and accept a permanent nuclear-free status. It also demanded a veto over actions by countries that wanted to assist Ukraine in the event of war. US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who is helping lead the discussion with Moscow, last month on CNN described the Istanbul talks as "cogent and substantive negotiations" and said that they could be "a guidepost to get a peace deal done."

Vladimir Zelensky changed his stance and “agreed to peace,” only following meetings between officials from Kiev and Washington in Saudi Arabia, which produced a proposal for a temporary ceasefire with Russia, US President Donald Trump has said. “As you know, I've always said that Ukraine might have been the more difficult party. You saw – you were here a week ago – when some interesting things happened,” Trump said, referring to a heated exchange with Zelensky in the Oval Office that ended with the Ukrainian leader being asked to leave prematurely. And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished.” He emphasized that Russia first needs to receive “detailed information” on the proposed ceasefire.</p>

QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — Insurgents who attacked a passenger train carrying 440 passengers in restive southwestern Pakistan killed 21 hostages before security forces killed all 33 of the assailants, and all other passengers were rescued, officials said Wednesday. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Pakistani security forces have exchanged gunfire with separatist militants as they seek to free hundreds of hostages aboard a train in the country's rugged southwest. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said her country “will continue to firmly support Pakistan in advancing its counterterrorism efforts.” Some relatives of hostages were angry at Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who last year claimed that the BLA was not a threat and “an ordinary police inspector could fix this situation.”</p>

While Russia has yet to signal that it would sign up for any ceasefire, analysts warned that Moscow still has a multitude of ways it could drag out agreeing to even a temporary pause in hostilities. And a simple ceasefire which doesn't take that into account is of no interest to Russia. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin “was not aware of such recommendations,” calling them “extremely contradictory” and adding, “We are working with more-considered options.” The document dismisses what it says are initial proposals made by Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, for a peace agreement in which one suggested element would be Ukraine's ceding of territories taken by Russia and Kyiv's agreement not to attempt to regain them in the future through military or diplomatic means. The document also dismisses any potential political concessions by Ukraine — such as Kyiv's rejection of NATO membership and the holding of elections in which pro-Russian parties would be allowed to participate — as not being far-reaching enough.</p>

In addition to Sheikh Hasina, some other properties have been seized, owned by her son Sajib Wazed Joy, daughter Saima Wazed Putul, sister Sheikh Rehana, and her daughters, Tulip Siddique and Radwan Mujib Siddique. On August 5, a student-led movement ousted Bangladesh's Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, after weeks of protests and clashes that killed over 600 people. Hasina, 77, fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.

LONDON (AP) — The captain of a cargo ship that collided with a U.S. tanker is a Russian national who remains in U.K. police custody, the vessel's owner said Wednesday, as it emerged that the ship failed several safety checks last year. U.K. authorities say they have found no evidence of foul play in the crash, and there is nothing so far to indicate that it's connected to national security. Humberside Police said that detectives were conducting inquiries alongside partner agencies. The Solong was drifting and still smoldering Wednesday, but is likely to remain afloat rather than sinking, officials said. “We're not quite out of the danger zone yet, but it's starting to look like an environmental disaster may have been narrowly averted,” said Paul Johnston from the Greenpeace Research Laboratories.</p>

Barack and Michelle Obama are in talks to produce a new biopic about golf superstar Tiger Woods, a source familiar with the negotiations told AFP Wednesday. Reinaldo Marcus Green, the filmmaker behind "King Richard" -- which told the story of the childhoods of tennis greats Venus and Serena Williams and their coach father Richard -- is attached to direct, Deadline said. The former US president and first lady run Higher Ground Productions, which has produced the Oscar-winning documentary "American Factory" and Netflix hit thriller "Leave the World Behind," as well as TV shows and podcasts. The movie is not expected to tackle Woods' subsequent self-inflicted downfall that began with a car crash near his home In November 2009, which led to the exposure of a slew of extramarital affairs and the collapse of his marriage.

However, the judge had issued indefinite restraining orders against Benfield, stopping him from contacting them. Each of them suffered serious mental health problems arising from Mr Belfield's conduct," BBC quoted Justice Saini as saying during the trial. Later, in 2022, Belfield was convicted of stalking a BBC Radio presenter, Bernard Spedding and videographer, Ben Hewis.

The group had warned that it would begin executing hostages if authorities failed to meet its 48-hour deadline to release Baloch political prisoners, activists, and those it claimed were abducted by the military. In recent months, the militants have intensified their attacks, adopting new tactics to cause heavy casualties and strike at Pakistan's military.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte jokes to photographers as he holds an Israeli-made Galil rifle at Camp Crame in suburban Quezon city northeast of Manila, Philippines on April 19, 2018. The ICC, which has a budget this year of more than 195 million euros ($213 million), does not have a police force and has to rely on the cooperation of states to arrest suspects. Each cell contains a bed, desk, cupboard, toilet, hand basin, television and an intercom system to contact guards when the door is locked. The ICC has issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects since it was established in 2002. Associated Press writer Molly Quell in The Hague, Netherlands, contributed to this report.</p>

Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz, discussed the proposal with his Russian counterpart on Wednesday, and special envoy Steve Witkoff will be dispatched to Moscow later this week, a spokeswoman said. In a joint statement, the United States and Kyiv vowed to “immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security.” Putin ruled out a truce or temporary ceasefire in July, while insisting that “Russia stands for a complete and final end to the conflict,” which according to his conditions for peace would involve Ukraine's demilitarization, neutrality and surrender of large chunks of territory. Russian far-right ideologue Alexander Dugin, whose revanchist ideas are believed to influence Putin, said that Moscow would certainly reject the ceasefire proposal. This is not boasting, but an understanding that real agreements are still being written there, at the front.</p>

This could pick up people such as Rudakubana, who was identified as a risk three times by the Prevent counter-terrorism programme but then dropped due to a lack of evidence of any clear extremist ideology. “This means that no prosecution would be available if the police raided an address and found careful handwritten but uncommunicated plans for carrying out a massacre,” he wrote. “Today's report is an important step in that search for answers, and to tackle horrific acts driven by a fixation on extreme violence,” they said.</p>

President Donald Trump and his policies sit squarely at the center of these tensions: Illegal immigration has been one of the president's favorite subjects to talk about since the start of his first successful White House campaign in 2015, and has become entwined with his approach to areas including crime, trade and foreign policy. Upon his return to the Oval Office in January, Trump took a number of actions aimed at stopping what he's often called an “invasion” at the southern border, after attempted crossings rose to very high levels under former President Joe Biden. Trump, however, effectively halted asylum access on Day One of his second term. Trump was also only in office for the last third of January.

Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland weighs in on the funding fight in Congress, the new playbook Democrats are developing to counter Trump and how he's leaning on his legal background to push back. “Our position has been that they have majorities, albeit narrow ones, across the government. I believe that tax-paying draftable U.S. citizens have the right to equal representation through statehood. I'm making friends with (Ohio Republican Rep.)

"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact," a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs. One farmer in Massachusetts told CBS News Boston that she was concerned the funding cut could hurt her business.

President Trump speaks very softly and respectfully about General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping. We all fell for the open secret that Deng Xiaoping proclaimed as China's key principle during his long run as the PRC's leader: "Hide your strength, bide your time." More retaliation from China followed.Don't expect this confrontation to be toned down or delayed. That's a very good thing, for if even half of Trump's and Cotton's shared, clear-eyed understanding of China spreads throughout Team Trump, the country will be prepared for Trump's most important fight among many important fights, one that will have to be carried consistently forward for decades.

On Thursday, gold futures (GC=F) climbed above $2,990 per ounce as a trade war intensified and the release of modest inflation data raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve may be more inclined to cut rates this year. "President Trump's rapid move to announce, if not always to enact, import tariffs has contributed to geopolitical uncertainty and boosted inflation expectations, helping push down front-end real rates and supporting gold in the face of periodic USD strength and initially reduced expectations for Fed rate cuts," the strategist wrote.

Spirit Airlines is out of bankruptcy, hitting its target to emerge in the first quarter, after a crippling few years. CEO Ted Christie says the carrier is leaner and ready to take on competitors, including rival Southwest Airlines. As Southwest starts charging for bags and introduces its first basic economy class, which doesn't include a seat assignment or allow free changes, Spirit could possibly win over customers, Christie said. If customers look on travel sites like Expedia, where Southwest is a new entrant, Spirit's tickets could be cheaper and appear higher in results, Christie said. Spirit, for its part, has recently been offering more ticket bundles that include things like seat assignments and luggage.</p>

But Republican leaders are confident they have Schumer and his colleagues cornered with Senate GOP leader John Thune saying of Democratic shutdown threats Thursday morning: "It's time for Democrats to fish or cut bait." "Historically, government shutdowns have had limited market reaction," analysts at Raymond James wrote in a note to clients this week. That climate is one of economic unease following recent sell-offs that put markets in correction territory, cuts to S&P 500 year-end targets, and a trade war breaking out on multiple fronts with President Trump seemingly unconcerned about the impact of it all on markets. As for next steps, Senate Democrats appear to be pushing for a standalone or amendment vote on their monthlong plan (without things like D.C. cuts) before any final passage vote, but Republicans are able and likely willing to block such an approach.

Tan frequently pushed for a better artificial intelligence strategy to take on Nvidia (NVDA) and faster decision making in the notoriously bureaucratic Intel. To be sure, Tan has a mess on his hands at the iconic American tech giant. Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years.

Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz recently offered similar sentiment, writing in a note to clients: "[We're] unlikely to see a material recovery in equities until we see the start of fiscal policy uncertainty abating," noting that a recent surge in fiscal policy uncertainty, as measured by an index tracked on Bloomberg and seen below, has coincided with the market's recent slide. Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote that the firm's lower target reflects its recently reduced GDP growth forecast and a "high assumed tariff rate." Kostin's work shows that for every five percentage point increase in tariffs, S&P 500 earnings per share would be reduced by 1% to 2%.

Bitcoin price faces pressure, but macroeconomic trends and regulatory shifts could drive future growth with BTC poised to reach six-figures once again. Bitcoin (BTC) price has risen 8% from its March 11 low of $76,703, driven in part by large investors aggressively buying the dip with leverage. When central banks drain liquidity by raising interest rates or reducing bond holdings, traders become more risk-averse, leading to weaker demand for Bitcoin. For example, Donald Trump's election as US president in November 2024 significantly fueled Bitcoin's rally due to the new administration's pro-crypto stance, regardless of global M2 trends and liquidity conditions. If this trend continues, it should ultimately create conditions for Bitcoin's price to meet Pakpakchicken's $105,000 prediction by May 2025 and possibly go even higher.</p>

Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has denied many of the claims in a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that he has been actively seeking a federal pardon from US President Donald Trump. “No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA [Bank Secrecy Act] charge,” said CZ. Having already served time in prison, CZ seeking any potential pardon from Trump would not erase the former CEO's felony charge. Since Trump took office in January, the SEC has dropped several investigations and enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including those who donated to his campaign or inauguration fund.

Related: 3 reasons why Ethereum can outperform its rivals after crashing to 17-month lows Based on its technicals, Solana remains in a tricky spot when comparing previous death cross returns and collective market sentiment. Since March 2024, SOL prices have rebounded six times after testing the support range, closing above $125 on each weekly retest. If Solana manages to avoid another lower low, the divergences will remain valid, which can push prices higher above $125, enabling Solana to avoid a drop below $100 and possibly establish a bottom at $112.</p>

According to CoinGecko data, daily trading volume hit its highest level this year in early February when it reached $440 billion. Santiment added that trader behavior “indicates a mix of exhaustion, hopelessness, and capitulation” following further market capitalization declines over the past fortnight. “Essentially, reduced trading activity reflects uncertainty, as fewer traders are convinced that buying at current levels will yield profitable outcomes,” the analysts added. Weakening trading volume amid minor price bounces can serve as an “early warning sign of weakening market momentum,” Santiment reported, adding that without robust buying participation, price gains can quickly lose steam, “as there simply isn't enough underlying support to sustain the upward trend.”</p>

A crypto trader fell victim to a sandwich attack on March 12, losing over $215,000, and one industry pundit suspects they may have been attacked another five times on the same day. Data from Ethereum block explorer shows the MEV attack occurred on decentralized exchange Uniswap v3's USDC-USDT liquidity pool, where $19.8 million worth of value is locked. DeFi researcher “DeFiac” speculates the same trader using different wallets has fallen victim to a total of six sandwich attacks, citing “internal tools.” They pointed out that all funds traveled from borrowing and lending protocol Aave before being deposited on Uniswap. Two of the wallets fell victim to an MEV bot sandwich attack on March 12 at around 9:00 am UTC. “That way you wash all the money with close to 0 losses.”</p>

Small mammals during the Mesozoic Era (some illustrated) may have had uniformly dark coloring, allowing them to blend into nocturnal environments. Early mammals and their close relatives probably sported dark, drab coats from snout to tail, researchers report in the March 14 Science. But the diversity of fur color among modern mammals is underappreciated, says Matthew Shawkey, an evolutionary biologist at Ghent University in Belgium.

Formed under intense pressures, the newly discovered compound packs helium atoms into crystalline iron, researchers report February 25 in Physical Review Letters. But the helium atoms don't bond directly to iron — they're too unreactive, even at extreme conditions.

How do people's epigenetics change, for example, in a population exposed to upheaval or violence multiple times over generations? There were several studies in lab animals that suggested epigenetic changes can pass from one generation to the next. Finally, they took samples from Syrian families that had left the country before either incident, to use as a point of comparison. "What it seems to say is that there might be a common epigenetic signature of violence across generations, exposures and developmental stages," Mulligan told Live Science. Dajani also recently became a grandmother and reflected on what she would say to her granddaughter about the discovery.</p>

Commissioner Rob Manfred and several owners are reportedly pushing him to do so. Why are they pushing Sternberg to sell and not, say, Athletics owner John Fisher?

Owner Stu Sternberg announced Thursday that the team "cannot move forward with the new ballpark and development project at this moment," citing "a series of events beginning in October that no one could have anticipated."

Harper's admission the school can only afford two years of Mullen's five-year contract is arresting yet not without precedent. "We don't have the money yet, but I know we'll have it so I'm not worried about that piece," Colorado AD Rick George said after Sanders' hiring. Paying Mullen $3.5 million annually is a significant financial commitment at that level, and puts him above Power Four coaches such as UCLA's DeShaun Foster and Arizona's Brent Brennan.</p>

Carla Leite, a 19-year-old French guard who the Golden State Valkyries selected in their expansion draft, is one prospective impact player. Dominique Malonga, a 6'6 center who could dunk at 16, is one of the most exciting prospects in recent WNBA history, as detailed in a Ringer piece by Mark Schindler. Inevitably, women's basketball will eventually follow suit to become a more globalized game — and France very well could be at the forefront.</p>

EA Sports has yet to reveal any details about "College Football 26," though it did confirm in January via social media that it will drop sometime in the summer.

This should have happened a long time ago, when the women's basketball Final Four started selling out. But many coaches wanted to see women's basketball spun off onto its own separate media rights deal. Like, you want to talk about value in women's basketball, then put some money on postseason success, right? Further units – more often to teams from power conferences – are rewarded for additional at-large bids and games-played. To get more resources pumped directly into women's basketball is critical,” Virginia Tech coach Megan Duffy said.</p>

Udokda was hired to accelerate their post-James Harden rebuild, and he's done that despite not having a true superstar. Şengün always had some special talent with the ball in his hands, and Udoka has molded him into a serviceable defensive center who can stay on the floor in big moments. Şengün has obviously watched a lot of Nikola Jokic growing up. You can see Jokic's fingerprints all over Şengün's game, and it especially shows up in his confidence passing the ball. 2 seed in the West for much of this season, and they still have a decent shot at it with under 20 games left to play.</p>

Both programs were in the running for a CFP berth well into November just this past season. A source familiar with that meeting told CBS Sports there was "no support" from Oversight to honor the request. NCAA Bylaw 17.11 sets the maximum number of regular-season FBS games at 12. Former Army athletic director Mike Buddie, now at TCU, told CBS Sports previously it was important for both schools to have an extra "data point" in regard to CFP consideration. The Army-Navy request is not believed to impact desires for any FBS conference to play additional games on the weekend of conference championship games.</p>

This is just the way things are going to be until losing is no longer rewarded with a better chance at a top pick, but it's unfortunate that it can affect the outcomes for teams that are embroiled in actual, competitive playoff races. You just have to hope that the teams in the remaining part of your schedule are less incentivized to win than those of your competition. Golden State now has the league's third-best defense and fifth-best offense since Butler's first game and has finally cracked the top 10 in this week's Power Rankings after consistent upward movement. James and Luka Dončić were starting to develop some real chemistry, and that will now be delayed for as long as James will have to sit out. Those aforementioned Grizzlies were the week's biggest risers, moving up three spots to No.</p>

Only four horses, including the legendary Arkle and Best Mate, have ever won a hat-trick of Gold Cups. "I think he's got just lots of heart," Mullins told BBC Sport at his sprawling Closutton stables in County Carlow. However, no-one knows how to train a Cheltenham Festival winner better than Mullins, who celebrated a century of them last year and is the leading trainer so far this week. Mullins said he believes Galopin Des Champs is in better form than in previous years but will face stiffer competition as he tries to emulate some of racing's all-time greats. So perhaps it will all come down to the "lucky charm" that has been brought over from Ireland - a red football in his stable.</p>

Rodgers is reportedly trying to decide whether he will either retire or play a 21st season in the NFL. Former NFL GM Doug Whaley said on Wednesday that Rodgers is "holding the entire Steelers organization hostage" during a Pittsburgh radio hit. The Steelers are indeed reportedly waiting for Rodgers to give them an answer, although NFL Media reported Wednesday morning that it could be weeks before a decision is made. If he were to sign with Cleveland, Wilson could find himself in a position battle with Kenny Pickett, who was traded from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia shortly after Wilson was signed by the Steelers last offseason. Teams be warned: An NFL team executive told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones that teams still waiting for the future Hall of Famer to make his decision should "do so at their own risk."</p>

But he is a possible future Hall of Fame quarterback who was named to his 10th Pro Bowl in 2024.

Josh Hart with a lane violation in clutch.HUGE mistake by him.Blazers can do it! After the game, Tom Haberstroh noted a somewhat shocking bit of NBA history that came on this Bridges shot. That was set in an overtime game between the Brooklyn Nets and Atlanta Hawks. If nothing else, Hart owes him a big thank you for the bail out.</p>

So let's try to figure out what we can learn from this clash and put that in perspective ahead of a possible Finals matchup. Sure, defense matters on those long shots to an extent, but a lot of that is just bad variance. It's a one-game sample, and Williams wasn't even involved, but the Thunder have to be encouraged by what they saw offensively on Wednesday. A lot of those acrobatic finishes Thunder guards pulled off on Wednesday aren't going to be available when he's patrolling the basket at 7-foot-2. Additionally, the Thunder average 16.1 fast break points per game, but have reached only 13 in both Celtics games.</p>

Top 10 lock -- Collin Moriakwa: There's a clear closing problem with Morikawa -- look no further than Bay Hill last Sunday. Scheffler winning three straight is certainly possible given his immense skill, but he still needs to put it all together in 2025. I'd rather back him at these odds than someone twice as long who is far less likely to win. Being given twice as many spots in which to back a guy who has already defended his title at The Players feels generous, but I'll take it. Surprise prediction -- Rickie Fowler contends on Sunday: There is nothing from his season thus far that points to Fowler making a run at TPC Sawgrass, though he does have two finishes near the top 10 this year, and obviously he's won at this course before.</p>

Both sides had their chances in extra time, but neither side was able to find a go-ahead goal before the end of 120 minutes. The referee has ruled that Alvarez took two touches and so his penalty doesn't count! Alvarez is next for Atletico and he slides his strong strike underneath the crossbar. 115' With five minutes plus stoppage time to go until penalties, Ancelotti makes a big call -- he takes off Vinicius for Endrick.

Alexa Fiffick, a board-certified family medicine physician specializing in menopause, stated that previous data has shown higher symptom burden is somehow related to decreased cognitive function and possibly dementia.
