Donald Trump has said Vladimir Putin's comments on the US ceasefire plan are "promising" but incomplete - after the Russian president suggested there were "questions" about the proposals.

After hearing Vladimir Putin's layered response to the ceasefire this afternoon, we have now had reaction from Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In his evening statement, the Ukrainian president describes Putin's words as "very predictable" and "very manipulative" and says Russia's president is preparing a rejection of the ceasefire proposal.

"Putin, of course, is afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, he wants to kill Ukrainians," Zelenskyy says.

"That's why they in Moscow are framing the idea of silence with such preconditions that nothing will happen at all or that it will not happen for as long as possible."

He labels Putin's words as "just another Russian manipulation".

Zelenskyy continues by saying Ukraine does not "set conditions that complicate anything" while stating that Russia does.

"As we have always said, the only one who will drag things out, the only one who will be unconstructive, is Russia," he says. 

"They want a war. Putin has stolen years of peace and continues this war - day after day."

Zelenskyy ends by calling for allies to ramp up the pressure on Putin and impose further sanctions.

We can bring you more from Vladimir Putin's news conference earlier, and while much of the attention was on his comments around the ceasefire, he did also address the situation in Kursk.

It follows his visit to the region yesterday while dressed in camouflage after Russia's military continued its advances on the front.

In his news conference, Putin said Russia had trapped the remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the western Kursk region, where they had clung on for more than seven months in one of the war's key battles.

He said the troops were cut off inside the invasion zone, and issued a warning to the Ukrainian forces still in the area. 

"If a physical blockade occurs in the coming days, then no one will be able to leave at all, there will only be two ways - to surrender or die," he said.

Ukraine's incursion into the region last August came as a major surprise, and aimed to divert Russian forces from elsewhere on the frontlines while also taking land to trade for its own captured territory.

But with the support of troops from its ally North Korea, Russian forces have gradually been clawing back the lost ground, heightening the pressure on Ukraine.

Donald Trump has been hosting NATO's secretary general at the White House - but with the world's media assembled in the Oval Office, he took the opportunity to also discuss the ceasefire.

Trump has been increasing the pressure on Vladimir Putin to agree to the proposals, with his envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow for talks right now.

Watch what the US president had to say in the video below....

Vladimir Putin does not expect to give up regions of Ukraine as part of a peace deal, nor does he expect Volodymyr Zelenskyy to remain as Ukraine's president, an expert has told Sky News.

Baroness Catherine Ashton, the former EU high representative for foreign affairs, said this afternoon's news conference with Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, was "really interesting".

She told our presenter Kamali Melbourne that Putin "says he supports the idea of a ceasefire".

What follows, though, is a "whole series of details".

These include: "Who monitors the ceasefire, how will we know when it's being violated, what happens if it is, does it lead on to talks for peace, what does that look like, and who's in the room?"

There is also the issue of Russia "making sure it's in the best possible position".

Such matters will lead to "very difficult conversations, I think, for the American envoy to have this evening", Ashton commented.

The negotiation is being set up as "Russia and America decides", she said.

Putin "expects that Zelenskyy won't be there" afterwards.

"He expects that he will not be returning parts of Ukraine to Ukraine." 

Our security and defence analyst Michael Clarke says Vladimir Putin's response to the ceasefire comes as no surprise.

"This is the way the Russians always do things and they think they are doing very well in the war and are actually now in control of the diplomacy of this," he said.

Clarke explained that the main question is over how far Russia can push Donald Trump.

"The danger for Europe is that Trump will be so anxious for a deal that he will press the Ukrainians on all sorts of really important things," he said.

"The Americans have now demonstrated through the use of intelligence, turning it off and back on again, they know they have got a tap, they could turn up the pressure or turn down the pressure," Clarke said.

He added that this left Ukraine in a "very difficult" situation.

As we've been reporting, Vladimir Putin has given his first response to the ceasefire, but his answer wasn't exactly definitive.

While he said Russia agrees with the proposal, he indicated its position is based on the assumption that it would lead to "long-term peace" and "something that would remove the initial reasons for the crisis".

Watch what he had to say when asked about the ceasefire in the video below...

While it is perhaps more tangentially related to the war in Ukraine, Trump has given some new remarks on another recurring topic of his presidency - expressing confidence that the United States will annex Greenland.

"I think that will happen," he told reporters during the meeting in the Oval Office.

"I didn't give it much thought before, but I'm sitting with a man that could be very instrumental [NATO chief Mark Rutte].

"You know, Mark, you need that for international security, not just security.

"It's really a very appropriate question, thank you."

Greenland's pro-business opposition Demokraatit party, which wants a slow approach to independence from Denmark, won Tuesday's parliamentary election. Trump said that election was good for the US - although his latest comments are unlikely to go down well in Denmark, which has repeatedly said Greenland is not for sale. 

By Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent

Vladimir Putin was never going to flat out reject the US proposal for a ceasefire, but he also wasn't going to fully endorse it either. Russia's agreement, as expected, comes with several strings attached.

The Kremlin leader didn't specify Moscow's demands but he did allude to them by saying that any peace deal had to eliminate the "root causes" of the conflict. 

It's become a frequent refrain of his, and shows that Moscow's maximalist position hasn't changed. By "root causes", the Russian president is referring to NATO's eastward expansion, which he blames as the catalyst for the war in Ukraine.

It's a very clear indication that his agreement to a ceasefire relies on getting some kind of security guarantees of his own, eg a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO, or that there'll never be any European peacekeeping forces from NATO members based in the country in the future.

He also articulated why Moscow is reluctant to agree to an immediate truce, talking at length about his forces' advances in the Kursk region. 

Ukraine's incursion there has been humiliating for the Kremlin, but their expulsion is finally within reach. Vladimir Putin doesn't want that opportunity to slip away. By pausing Russia's offensive, he fears they'll lose the advantage and give the enemy time to regroup.

Vladimir Putin was, however, careful to thank Donald Trump for his efforts in trying to reach a peace agreement, perhaps wary of any backlash from the White House. But despite that, he still doesn't appear to be showing any sign of compromise.

So in many ways, it feels like nothing has changed.

We are now seeing some comments from Donald Trump in his news conference with Mark Rutte that indicate a potentially significant change of tone on NATO.

As mentioned in our previous post, the US president has praised NATO's secretary general for doing "some really good work", and has also told reporters NATO "is stepping up".

Both before and since his election, Trump has repeatedly criticised NATO countries for not meeting the current member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defence - and said they should pay even more.

He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts a burden on the US.

While his recent public pronouncements on the alliance have been heavily critical, leaders of fellow member countries will be hopeful his remarks today represent a shift in the White House's stance.

Trump also told reporters that he noticed "very few people were paying" when he first went to NATO, adding that if they were, they were not paying their "fair share".

He says he was able to raise "hundreds of billions of dollars... the money started pouring in" and claims the alliance became much stronger because of his actions.

Meanwhile, Rutte has urged NATO to produce more weapons, stating the alliance is not doing enough and is lagging behind Russia and China.

Donald Trump has taken his seat in the Oval Office alongside NATO's secretary general Mark Rutte - with the US president using the opportunity to update the media on the ceasefire proposal.

He tells reporters that his envoy Steve Witkoff is in serious discussions in Russia - Witkoff is expected to meet Vladimir Putin shortly.

"Hopefully Russia will do the right thing," he says, repeating that he would like to see a ceasefire from Russia.

He tells reporters that a peace deal "shouldn't be very complicated" and urges all parties to get the process over with quickly.

Trump: Putin's statement 'wasn't complete'

Trump also addressed Putin's news conference with ally and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

He says the Russian president put out a promising statement, but insists it was not complete, and reiterated he is willing to talk to Putin about the ceasefire proposal.

The US president has also broken away from his high-profile criticism of NATO and praised Rutte for his role, saying he has been doing "some really good work".

European leaders are working to bolster the Ukrainian military and recruiting partners for a “coalition of the willing” to serve in a postwar Ukraine.

LONDON — European leaders, buoyed by progress in talks between Washington and Kyiv and enjoying praise from U.S. officials, are pushing for a larger role in President Donald Trump's drive to halt the war between Russia and Ukraine and discussing how their forces can help secure a post-conflict landscape.

French and British officials, initially sidelined in the U.S. effort, helped coax Washington and Kyiv back to talks after the relationship appeared to break down last month. Now they're working to bolster the Ukrainian military and recruiting partners for a “coalition of the willing” to back Ukraine, while continuing to seek a European say in U.S. discussions with Russia. All these will strengthen Kyiv's position in negotiations and deter Russia from breaching any deal, they say.

Revived U.S.-Ukrainian talks this week yielded a preliminary agreement on a 30-day ceasefire. Russia hasn't committed to it yet, and many here are skeptical that Moscow will deal in good faith. But it has led Washington to resume military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv — and has dramatically improved the tone between the two governments, whose ties had seemed in danger of rupturing entirely.

“The signs of Europe focusing on this are very real,” said Bronwen Maddox, director of the  think tank Chatham House. “It's been an impressive change.”

Now leaders are trying to build on the momentum. “This is the moment when Europe must pull its full weight for Ukraine, and for itself,” French President Emmanuel Macron told European and NATO military leaders in Paris on Tuesday. He beseeched them to accelerate planning.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting a summit by video this weekend to discuss the still-undefined international force that would back any long-term truce.

Russia has opposed the deployment of NATO troops in Ukraine. “NATO countries are not neutral,” Sergei Markov, a hawkish Kremlin-connected analyst, told the BBC on Wednesday. NATO soldiers on Ukrainian territory would not be peacekeepers, he said, and “would be killed by Russian soldiers.”

Some European officials say their willingness to put boots on the ground sends a message to Russia and also to Trump, who is pushing Europe to do more for its own defense. Starmer's office says several countries have signaled they would contribute by providing soldiers, materials or both.

The idea of a European force in Ukraine backed by air and sea power has gained support, but it's certainly not unanimous. Italy, led by right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has opposed sending soldiers. She has not decided whether to attend Starmer's video conference, Italian media reported.

Some countries have been reluctant to commit to greater military involvement without a better understanding of what U.S. backing they might expect. Trump has not ruled out a role for European troops but has said little about whether the United States would support them.

European officials describe U.S. political and logistical backing as vital amid questions about how a European force should respond if Russia breaks a deal or attacks the force itself.

London and Paris want to pool the capabilities of several countries for a force powerful enough to deter Russia from reigniting a full-blown conflict. Some European diplomats say a concrete plan would provide a means to negotiate with the Trump team on a possible “U.S. backstop.”

A peace deal could unfold in multiple phases, others have said, with more countries joining the coalition as plans advance. The proposed one-month ceasefire could be a first step.

It's time to “move from concept to plan,” Macron told military leaders, according to his office. The army chiefs of more than 30 European and NATO countries gathered in Paris without the United States on Tuesday to discuss Ukraine's postwar “security architecture.”

About 15 countries were ready to move ahead with planning, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu told reporters Wednesday. He did not name them. There was consensus, he said, that the first task was to shore up “the Ukrainian army itself, its capacity, equipment, training and format.” (Russia, in contrast, has called for demilitarization.)

Military planning would go well beyond a possible troop deployment, he said; it would also, for example, “urgently” address security in the Black Sea and of nuclear sites in Ukraine.

The talks have included a broad range of countries — Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the Nordic and Baltic states. Some, such as NATO ally Turkey, have expressed openness to pooling resources.

On the diplomatic front, Europeans are hoping to build on what they see as a triumph of fence mending since Zelensky's disastrous Feb. 28 visit to the Oval Office.

Trump's abrupt tilt toward Moscow and his hostility to Zelensky in the early weeks of his presidency blindsided and sidelined European leaders. But they have since pushed on several fronts to assert more influence.

European leaders met in London days after the White House confrontation. Macron's proposals for a one-month ceasefire helped clear a pathway to the agreement between Washington and Kyiv on Tuesday. British officials have been coaching Zelensky on repairing the breach with Trump and embracing the approach.

European leaders and Zelensky say such a truce could serve as a test of Russia's interest in ending its war in Ukraine. At the least, the agreement appears to have shifted the narrative of the negotiations. Trump had called Zelensky a dictator and accused him of standing in the way of peace.

Now, European leaders have said repeatedly, “the ball is in Russia's court.”

The proposal has been presented at the talks as an American one, but some diplomats here quietly call it the “European plan” and hope it is a sign that Europe's struggles to sway Trump's peace process are beginning to bear fruit, at least for now.

A senior British official familiar with the efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said London began a full-court press immediately after the Oval Office blowup. Jonathan Powell, Starmer's national security adviser, personally engaged the Ukrainians and discussed the text of a proposal to send to the Americans, this official said.

“We think it clearly led directly to the invitation for Zelensky to join the discussions in Jeddah [Saudi Arabia] that has led to some pretty swift progress in restoring aid and intelligence,” the official said,

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio singled out Britain and France as European powers he has worked with closely on the Trump administration's efforts to end the war in Ukraine.

“They've been very helpful, and, frankly, we've worked very closely with them on the prelude to this meeting and hopefully in the days to come,” Rubio said Tuesday during his flight to Saudi Arabia.

Francis reported from Brussels. John Hudson in Jeddah contributed to this report.

 March 13 - A top United Arab Emirates official plans to visit Washington to press for easier access to American technology and discuss investment in the United States, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, is expected to meet U.S. President Trump's cabinet officials as soon as next week, the report said. 

 These officials would likely include Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, though it remains unclear if the president will participate. 

 At the start of the year, the U.S. government tightened restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips, such as those made by Nvidia, while finding ways to block China's access to the advanced technology. 

 Under the regulations, countries such as Japan, Britain, South Korea and the Netherlands would essentially be exempt from the rules while others, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Singapore, will face some caps. 

 The U.S. Commerce Department, Nvidia and the Abu Dhabi Media Office did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 

 The UAE, a wealthy oil producer, is keen on gaining increased access to American technology to build its own advanced tech industry, but the U.S. has expressed concerns about its warm relationship with China. 

 Sheikh Tahnoon's visit comes at the request of the Trump administration, the Bloomberg report said.

Raphael Satter had his OCI card taken away after publishing a story critical of an Indian businessman

A US journalist has taken the Indian government to court after his Indian overseas citizenship was unilaterally cancelled, after the publication of a story critical of a prominent Indian businessman.

Raphael Satter, who covers cybersecurity for the Reuters news agency in the US, received a letter from India's ministry of home affairs in early December 2023, accusing him of producing work that “maliciously” tarnished India's reputation and informing him that his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card had been cancelled.

OCI status is given to foreign citizens of Indian origin, or those married to Indian nationals, and allows for visa-free travel, residency and employment in India. Satter received his OCI through marriage. The cancellation of his OCI status means he is no longer able to travel to India, where members of his family live.

In recent years, the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, led by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has been accused of revoking OCI privileges for those it has deemed critical, part of what Human Rights Watch has called a campaign of “politically motivated repression”.

Journalists, academics and activists have been a particular target. Several high-profile journalists have been forced to leave the country after their OCI cards were revoked and academics have been turned away at the Indian border.

According to the letter sent to Satter in December 2023, his OCI status was revoked for his alleged “practising [of] journalism without proper permission” and for work that had been “maliciously creating adverse and biased opinion against Indian institutions in the international arena”.

Satter, who works in Washington DC, denies ever conducting journalism in India and has only travelled to the country to visit family.

The Indian government provided no specifics to Satter's lawyers on how his journalistic work had been deemed a national security threat to India. However, Satter's lawyers noted that the cancellation of his OCI came at exactly the same time that a defamation case had been filed against him in India for a story he had written on the Indian cybersecurity company Appin and its co-founder Rajat Khare.

Satter's investigation for Reuters, titled “How an Indian startup hacked the world”, exposed the workings of Appin, alleging it had become “a hack-for-hire powerhouse that stole secrets from executives, politicians, military officials and wealthy elites around the globe”.

Rajat Khare's US representative, the lawfirm Clare Locke, rejected any association between its client and the cyber-mercenary business, telling Reuters that Khare “has never operated or supported, and certainly did not create, any illegal ‘hack for hire' industry in India or anywhere else”.

During the course of his inquiries into Appin and Khare, Satter said that he had received a series of threats made by individuals associated with the company, “one of whom alluded to potential ‘diplomatic action' unless I abandoned my reporting”.

“The petitioner and his employer, Reuters, began receiving threats from individuals linked to a company called Appin, which has hacked organisations in India and abroad,” Satter's court petition says.

On the same day that Satter received the notice of the OCI cancellation, a Delhi judge granted an injunction against the story, forcing it to be temporarily taken down. It was restored 10 months later. Karuna Nundy, the lawyer representing Satter, said the timing clearly “linked” the two events. She emphasised that, under Indian law, defamation is not grounds for OCI cancellation.

Khare has been active in pursuing news organisations that have published articles on the activities of Appin. According to an investigation by Reporters Without Borders, at least 15 media outlets investigating Appin received legal notices and five have been subjected to legal proceedings.

The New Yorker and the Sunday Times are among those who have faced legal action by entities representing Khare, who also has initiated legal proceedings in Switzerland against a story that mentioned his name. Reporters Without Borders described the magnitude of these gag lawsuits as “unprecedented”.

The first court hearing for Satter's case was heard in Delhi this week. In a statement sent to the Guardian, Satter said the Indian government's decision to cancel his OCI had “effectively cut me off from members of my family and a country I hold in great affection and respect”.

Satter was insistent that the decision was a “mistake or on a misunderstanding” by the ministry of home affairs and that he had only decided to go to court after not receiving any response to his appeal to the government for more than a year.

“I am confident that, once the integrity of my journalism is demonstrated before the Indian courts and the true and correct facts are brought to the fore, the ministry of home affairs will see fit to restore my OCI card,” he said. The ministry of home affairs did not respond to requests for comment about Satter's case.

The Indian government now has until the next hearing, on 22 May, to respond to the petition and give legal justification for Satter's OCI cancellation.

The Modi government has cancelled more than 100 OCI cards while in power for the last decade. Among them was the journalist Aatish Taseer, after he wrote a cover article for Time magazine criticising the prime minister.

“The Indian authorities should not be attempting to silence critics by revoking residency rights or other means,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, the deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “Instead, the authorities should have the maturity to accept legitimate criticism and work on reforms.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday made his first comments on Washington's plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. During the press briefing, he started with "words of gratitude" for US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with other state heads, for paying attention to the Ukraine conflict despite having "a lot on our plates".

"First of all, I would like to start with words of gratitude to the president of the United States, Mr Trump, for paying so much attention to the Ukraine settlement. All of us have lots on our plates, but many state leaders, the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the Prime Minister of India, president of Brazil and South African Republic. They devote a lot of time to this issue, and we are thankful to them because it's all for the noble cause of stopping hostilities and preventing human casualties," he said.

PM Modi, during a meeting with Trump at the White House last month, stressed that "India is not neutral" in its stand on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. "India is not neutral. India is siding with peace. I have already said to President Putin that this is not the era of war. I support the efforts taken by President Trump," the Prime Minister had said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India have been stressing that this is "not an era of war but of dialogue and diplomacy". Since the Ukraine conflict began in February last year, PM Modi has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a number of times.

The United States, meanwhile, has called for Russia to agree to the ceasefire proposal without any conditions.

Putin, however, said that while he was "for" the proposed ceasefire, but "there are nuances", and he had "serious questions" about how it would work.

Trump said Putin's statement was "promising" but "not complete".

"He put out a very promising statement but it wasn't complete," Trump, who was meeting NATO chief Mark Rutte at the White House, told reporters when asked about Putin's remarks.

Ukraine agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire at talks in Saudi Arabia this week, bowing to pressure after a showdown between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on February 28.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and injured, displacing millions of people, reducing towns to rubble and triggering the sharpest confrontation between Moscow and the West in decades.

When she took over after her brother Gianni's murder, few expected her to last 27 years and become a household name

When Donatella Versace took over the house of Versace in the aftermath of her brother Gianni's murder, most observers privately assumed that her reign would be no more than a postscript. The bottle-blond younger sister, with no formal training and a drug addiction that was the fashion industry's worst kept secret, was seen as a sentimental appointment by a shell-shocked family.

She proved everyone wrong. Versace is now defined as much by Donatella as by Gianni. She steps down from designing after 27 years as an icon in her own right, one of the most successful female designers in modern fashion history. Sober for 20 years, she has steered Versace to become a global household name, valued at $2bn (£1.6bn) when it was sold to Capri Holdings six and a half years ago.

Versace found her voice as a designer and as a champion of LGBTQ+ rights. She was praised for taking a stand against Italy's anti-gay policies after saying in a speech in 2023: “Our government is trying to take away people's rights to live as they wish.”

She looked destined to be consigned to the fashion history books with the untimely death of Gianni Versace. But her talent and determination have helped the brand thrive as a living force that still has the power to set trends, and made it potent and desirable to a generation of consumers who have only ever known her as its designer. Gianni recognised and championed her instincts – the safety pin as a Versace motif was an idea she had brought to his atelier – and her fluency with the codes of the house fuelled a growing self-confidence.

With an appetite for pop culture, many of Versace's defining moments, from Jennifer Lopez in a jungle-green dress slashed to the navel in 2019 to a collection co-designed with Dua Lipa in 2023, have happened under her watch. She has been a hands-on presence in the design studio. “Versace is what it is today because of Donatella Versace,” said Emmanuel Gintzburger, the brand's chief executive, when the succession plan was announced.

In private, she is kind and generous, funny and self-aware. When a journalist enquired how old her adored jack russell was during an interview in 2016, she replied: “Audrey is eight – but can you write six?” Her cartoonish image – shellacked walnut skin, platinum hair, petite frame jacked up on spike heels – belies a lack of ego unusual in a star designer.

She has always seen herself as the custodian queen of Versace, with a responsibility to keep her brother's spirit alive. That she is handing her job title to Dario Vitale, a well-respected designer and image maker who has played a major role in the success of Miu Miu, one of the hottest brands in the world, demonstrates her desire to champion the Versace name, not just her own. “I am excited to see Versace through new eyes,” she said in a statement.

Donatella will remain a Versace figurehead as chief brand ambassador. She inspires fierce loyalty in her glamorous circle, and will continue to leverage the A-list names she has on speed dial. In 2017, when she reunited Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington and Claudia Schiffer on her runway, she revealed that the moment in 1991 when the supermodels lip-synced to Freedom in a Versace show, re-enacting their roles in the video to George Michael's song, was something she had suggested to her brother. “The combination of fashion and personality was magic,” she recalled of that show. A very Donatella kind of magic.

When US President Donald Trump appeared to turn his back on long-time ally Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia, it would have been understandable if a few eyebrows were raised and concern spread in Taiwan.  This is not the case, however, according to the island's representative in Israel, Abby Ya-ping Lee.Sitting down with The Jerusalem Post this week, Lee spoke with confidence about Taiwan's resilience, emphasizing that while global geopolitics are shifting, her archipelagic nation remains steadfast in defending its sovereignty and concentrating on deepening ties with like-minded allies. Advertisement“Three years ago, when we saw the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was like a watershed moment for Taiwanese people,” she said. “We know that we have to be quick to prepare ourselves from such military conflicts replicated in other countries. So we are not only strengthening our national defense but also increasing our whole society's resilience.”For Taiwan, the lessons of Ukraine and Israel in dealing with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran have reinforced a fundamental truth: self-reliance is key. As the world watches Trump's evolving stance on foreign conflicts, Taipei is taking proactive measures, from military reforms to diplomatic initiatives, to safeguard its future.  IN RESPONSE to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the island has significantly bolstered its defenses.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Lee, who has served as Taiwan's representative in Israel for three years, heads the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO). Due to diplomatic constraints stemming from China's influence and the “One China” policy, Taiwan does not officially designate its diplomatic missions as embassies. AdvertisementShe has spearheaded a campaign of solidarity with the Jewish state, particularly in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks. “Taiwan was among the first in the world [post-Oct.7] to support Israel, to express our solidarity with the State of Israel,” she said.Beyond diplomacy, Taipei has also provided humanitarian support. “My office here also engages with a lot of NGOs in providing humanitarian relief goods, including livelihood goods, medical assistance, trauma therapies, and education to the communities and people affected by the war, such as parents who lost their children at the Nova festival,” Lee explained.But the relationship is more than just symbolic. Economically, Taiwan and Israel are natural partners. “Taiwan is a leader in hardware, and Israel is a leader in software,” she noted. “Our business and technological cooperation opportunities are enormous. We see a lot of Israeli start-ups coming to Taiwan to find reliable partners, and we have a very business-friendly infrastructure for them.”  This synergy extends to security and democratic resilience. “Taiwan and Israel are standing on the forefront to defend the democratic way of life,” Lee said. “We have been the testing ground for democracy, facing cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and psychological warfare.”Trump's first monthsTrump's return to the White House has prompted intense speculation about his policies toward China and Taiwan. Lee, however, remains measured.“The US is Taiwan's most important partner in security, science, and technology,” she emphasized. “We pay a lot of attention to trade policies and will adapt quickly. A close and deep partnership between Taiwan and the US is essential for maintaining peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.”She pointed out that Trump's fundamental policies on Taiwan have remained consistent. “The US has long-standing policies on Taiwan – support for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo, and bipartisan Congressional backing. We have many good friends in the Trump administration who continue to engage with us and provide substantive support.”However, Taiwan is under no illusions about the volatility of geopolitics. “We are very clear, realistic, and efficient in optimizing our leverage to strengthen our partnership with the US,” Lee stated. “Taiwan's peace and stability are essential for global peace.”One of Trump's most aggressive policies has been his renewed economic war on China, particularly tariffs and restrictions on Chinese technology.Lee acknowledged that Taiwan is watching these moves closely. “Trump's trade policies aim to address issues such as trade imbalances, Chinese overcapacity, and state subsidies. Taiwan, as a trade economy, carefully analyzes all relevant policies.”However, Taiwan's position in global trade is unique. “Currently, 91% of Taiwanese exports to the US are intermediate goods, not consumer goods,” she explained. “These include servers, electronic components, and networking equipment—essential for AI and 5G networks. Our trade with the US is complementary and healthy.”While Taiwan could benefit from US-China tensions by strengthening trade with America, it must also ensure that it does not become collateral damage in any broader economic conflict. “We remain proactive in maintaining a smooth and effective dialogue with every US administration,” Lee said.Taiwan's Silicon ShieldPerhaps the most significant development in US-Taiwan economic relations is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's $100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five cutting-edge fabrication plants in Arizona.“This is a milestone in US-Taiwan trade relations and a historical moment for TSMC,” Lee stated. “It strengthens Taiwan's relevance with the US and helps TSMC better serve its American customers, who make up 60% of its business.”When announced, Trump stated that TSMC's investment ensures the company – a key supplier of the world's most advanced semiconductors – can sidestep the tariffs he has considered applying to the global chip industry. His broader goal is to strengthen US manufacturing and solidify America's trade leverage over both competitors and allies.However, there are concerns that shifting semiconductor production overseas could weaken Taiwan's strategic importance. Lee dismissed such fears. “Even when all overseas manufacturing lines are completed by 2030, 80% of TSMC's production will still remain in Taiwan, and the most critical technology will be kept on the island.”Taiwan's dominance in chip production remains staggering: 60% of the world's total chips are made in Taiwan, 92% of the world's advanced chips (such as 5 nanometer and 3nm semiconductors) come from Taiwan, and 99% of the world's AI chips are produced by Taiwanese companies.“That's why the semiconductor chief industries and TSMC is always referred to as ‘Taiwan's silicon shield' as a protection of our national security,” she told the Post.Taiwan, Ukraine, and lessons learnedTaiwanese leaders have watched the war in Ukraine with deep concern, drawing direct parallels to their own situation with China. However, they are determined not to be caught off guard.“The Ukrainian people are very resilient,” Lee said. “This has been an awakening call for Taiwanese people – that our determination to defend ourselves is critical to our survival.“The future of Taiwan should be determined, decided by Taiwanese people,” Lee expressed to the Post. “That is the reason why we fight so hard to build democracy in Taiwan – and Taiwan and China: We don't have jurisdiction over each other. China did not rule Taiwan for a single day. We are enjoying different political systems, and Taiwan is independent by its reality.”In response to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the islands have significantly bolstered their defenses. By increasing its defense budget to 3% of GDP, extending military conscription from four months to one year, developing a domestic defense industry, and enhancing cyber defense against China's daily cyberattacks, the government hopes it will maintain the status quo and deter Beijing from any thoughts of attack.“The Chinese government conducts three million cyberattacks on Taiwan every day,” Lee revealed. “We have adopted countermeasures, including real-time debunking of disinformation campaigns and media literacy programs to teach our youth to identify fake news.”She also noted the disturbing rise of anti-Israel content on Chinese social media platforms like TikTok. “Pro-Hamas, anti-Israel content is freely spreading inside China. I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.

Due to diplomatic constraints stemming from China's influence and the “One China” policy, Taiwan does not officially designate its diplomatic missions as embassies. AdvertisementShe has spearheaded a campaign of solidarity with the Jewish state, particularly in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks. “Taiwan was among the first in the world [post-Oct.7] to support Israel, to express our solidarity with the State of Israel,” she said.Beyond diplomacy, Taipei has also provided humanitarian support. “My office here also engages with a lot of NGOs in providing humanitarian relief goods, including livelihood goods, medical assistance, trauma therapies, and education to the communities and people affected by the war, such as parents who lost their children at the Nova festival,” Lee explained.But the relationship is more than just symbolic. Economically, Taiwan and Israel are natural partners. “Taiwan is a leader in hardware, and Israel is a leader in software,” she noted. “Our business and technological cooperation opportunities are enormous. We see a lot of Israeli start-ups coming to Taiwan to find reliable partners, and we have a very business-friendly infrastructure for them.”  This synergy extends to security and democratic resilience. “Taiwan and Israel are standing on the forefront to defend the democratic way of life,” Lee said. “We have been the testing ground for democracy, facing cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and psychological warfare.”Trump's first monthsTrump's return to the White House has prompted intense speculation about his policies toward China and Taiwan. Lee, however, remains measured.“The US is Taiwan's most important partner in security, science, and technology,” she emphasized. “We pay a lot of attention to trade policies and will adapt quickly. A close and deep partnership between Taiwan and the US is essential for maintaining peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.”She pointed out that Trump's fundamental policies on Taiwan have remained consistent. “The US has long-standing policies on Taiwan – support for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo, and bipartisan Congressional backing. We have many good friends in the Trump administration who continue to engage with us and provide substantive support.”However, Taiwan is under no illusions about the volatility of geopolitics. “We are very clear, realistic, and efficient in optimizing our leverage to strengthen our partnership with the US,” Lee stated. “Taiwan's peace and stability are essential for global peace.”One of Trump's most aggressive policies has been his renewed economic war on China, particularly tariffs and restrictions on Chinese technology.Lee acknowledged that Taiwan is watching these moves closely. “Trump's trade policies aim to address issues such as trade imbalances, Chinese overcapacity, and state subsidies. Taiwan, as a trade economy, carefully analyzes all relevant policies.”However, Taiwan's position in global trade is unique. “Currently, 91% of Taiwanese exports to the US are intermediate goods, not consumer goods,” she explained. “These include servers, electronic components, and networking equipment—essential for AI and 5G networks. Our trade with the US is complementary and healthy.”While Taiwan could benefit from US-China tensions by strengthening trade with America, it must also ensure that it does not become collateral damage in any broader economic conflict. “We remain proactive in maintaining a smooth and effective dialogue with every US administration,” Lee said.Taiwan's Silicon ShieldPerhaps the most significant development in US-Taiwan economic relations is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's $100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five cutting-edge fabrication plants in Arizona.“This is a milestone in US-Taiwan trade relations and a historical moment for TSMC,” Lee stated. “It strengthens Taiwan's relevance with the US and helps TSMC better serve its American customers, who make up 60% of its business.”When announced, Trump stated that TSMC's investment ensures the company – a key supplier of the world's most advanced semiconductors – can sidestep the tariffs he has considered applying to the global chip industry. His broader goal is to strengthen US manufacturing and solidify America's trade leverage over both competitors and allies.However, there are concerns that shifting semiconductor production overseas could weaken Taiwan's strategic importance. Lee dismissed such fears. “Even when all overseas manufacturing lines are completed by 2030, 80% of TSMC's production will still remain in Taiwan, and the most critical technology will be kept on the island.”Taiwan's dominance in chip production remains staggering: 60% of the world's total chips are made in Taiwan, 92% of the world's advanced chips (such as 5 nanometer and 3nm semiconductors) come from Taiwan, and 99% of the world's AI chips are produced by Taiwanese companies.“That's why the semiconductor chief industries and TSMC is always referred to as ‘Taiwan's silicon shield' as a protection of our national security,” she told the Post.Taiwan, Ukraine, and lessons learnedTaiwanese leaders have watched the war in Ukraine with deep concern, drawing direct parallels to their own situation with China. However, they are determined not to be caught off guard.“The Ukrainian people are very resilient,” Lee said. “This has been an awakening call for Taiwanese people – that our determination to defend ourselves is critical to our survival.“The future of Taiwan should be determined, decided by Taiwanese people,” Lee expressed to the Post. “That is the reason why we fight so hard to build democracy in Taiwan – and Taiwan and China: We don't have jurisdiction over each other. China did not rule Taiwan for a single day. We are enjoying different political systems, and Taiwan is independent by its reality.”In response to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the islands have significantly bolstered their defenses. By increasing its defense budget to 3% of GDP, extending military conscription from four months to one year, developing a domestic defense industry, and enhancing cyber defense against China's daily cyberattacks, the government hopes it will maintain the status quo and deter Beijing from any thoughts of attack.“The Chinese government conducts three million cyberattacks on Taiwan every day,” Lee revealed. “We have adopted countermeasures, including real-time debunking of disinformation campaigns and media literacy programs to teach our youth to identify fake news.”She also noted the disturbing rise of anti-Israel content on Chinese social media platforms like TikTok. “Pro-Hamas, anti-Israel content is freely spreading inside China. I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.
            



This is not the case, however, according to the island's representative in Israel, Abby Ya-ping Lee.Sitting down with The Jerusalem Post this week, Lee spoke with confidence about Taiwan's resilience, emphasizing that while global geopolitics are shifting, her archipelagic nation remains steadfast in defending its sovereignty and concentrating on deepening ties with like-minded allies.

So we are not only strengthening our national defense but also increasing our whole society's resilience.”For Taiwan, the lessons of Ukraine and Israel in dealing with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran have reinforced a fundamental truth: self-reliance is key. As the world watches Trump's evolving stance on foreign conflicts, Taipei is taking proactive measures, from military reforms to diplomatic initiatives, to safeguard its future.

Our trade with the US is complementary and healthy.”While Taiwan could benefit from US-China tensions by strengthening trade with America, it must also ensure that it does not become collateral damage in any broader economic conflict. “We remain proactive in maintaining a smooth and effective dialogue with every US administration,” Lee said.Taiwan's Silicon ShieldPerhaps the most significant development in US-Taiwan economic relations is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's $100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five cutting-edge fabrication plants in Arizona.“This is a milestone in US-Taiwan trade relations and a historical moment for TSMC,” Lee stated. “It strengthens Taiwan's relevance with the US and helps TSMC better serve its American customers, who make up 60% of its business.”When announced, Trump stated that TSMC's investment ensures the company – a key supplier of the world's most advanced semiconductors – can sidestep the tariffs he has considered applying to the global chip industry. His broader goal is to strengthen US manufacturing and solidify America's trade leverage over both competitors and allies.However, there are concerns that shifting semiconductor production overseas could weaken Taiwan's strategic importance. Lee dismissed such fears. “Even when all overseas manufacturing lines are completed by 2030, 80% of TSMC's production will still remain in Taiwan, and the most critical technology will be kept on the island.”Taiwan's dominance in chip production remains staggering: 60% of the world's total chips are made in Taiwan, 92% of the world's advanced chips (such as 5 nanometer and 3nm semiconductors) come from Taiwan, and 99% of the world's AI chips are produced by Taiwanese companies.“That's why the semiconductor chief industries and TSMC is always referred to as ‘Taiwan's silicon shield' as a protection of our national security,” she told the Post.Taiwan, Ukraine, and lessons learnedTaiwanese leaders have watched the war in Ukraine with deep concern, drawing direct parallels to their own situation with China. However, they are determined not to be caught off guard.“The Ukrainian people are very resilient,” Lee said. “This has been an awakening call for Taiwanese people – that our determination to defend ourselves is critical to our survival.“The future of Taiwan should be determined, decided by Taiwanese people,” Lee expressed to the Post. “That is the reason why we fight so hard to build democracy in Taiwan – and Taiwan and China: We don't have jurisdiction over each other. China did not rule Taiwan for a single day. We are enjoying different political systems, and Taiwan is independent by its reality.”In response to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the islands have significantly bolstered their defenses. By increasing its defense budget to 3% of GDP, extending military conscription from four months to one year, developing a domestic defense industry, and enhancing cyber defense against China's daily cyberattacks, the government hopes it will maintain the status quo and deter Beijing from any thoughts of attack.“The Chinese government conducts three million cyberattacks on Taiwan every day,” Lee revealed. “We have adopted countermeasures, including real-time debunking of disinformation campaigns and media literacy programs to teach our youth to identify fake news.”She also noted the disturbing rise of anti-Israel content on Chinese social media platforms like TikTok. “Pro-Hamas, anti-Israel content is freely spreading inside China. I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.

Lee dismissed such fears. “Even when all overseas manufacturing lines are completed by 2030, 80% of TSMC's production will still remain in Taiwan, and the most critical technology will be kept on the island.”Taiwan's dominance in chip production remains staggering: 60% of the world's total chips are made in Taiwan, 92% of the world's advanced chips (such as 5 nanometer and 3nm semiconductors) come from Taiwan, and 99% of the world's AI chips are produced by Taiwanese companies.“That's why the semiconductor chief industries and TSMC is always referred to as ‘Taiwan's silicon shield' as a protection of our national security,” she told the Post.Taiwan, Ukraine, and lessons learnedTaiwanese leaders have watched the war in Ukraine with deep concern, drawing direct parallels to their own situation with China. However, they are determined not to be caught off guard.“The Ukrainian people are very resilient,” Lee said. “This has been an awakening call for Taiwanese people – that our determination to defend ourselves is critical to our survival.“The future of Taiwan should be determined, decided by Taiwanese people,” Lee expressed to the Post. “That is the reason why we fight so hard to build democracy in Taiwan – and Taiwan and China: We don't have jurisdiction over each other. China did not rule Taiwan for a single day. We are enjoying different political systems, and Taiwan is independent by its reality.”In response to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the islands have significantly bolstered their defenses. By increasing its defense budget to 3% of GDP, extending military conscription from four months to one year, developing a domestic defense industry, and enhancing cyber defense against China's daily cyberattacks, the government hopes it will maintain the status quo and deter Beijing from any thoughts of attack.“The Chinese government conducts three million cyberattacks on Taiwan every day,” Lee revealed. “We have adopted countermeasures, including real-time debunking of disinformation campaigns and media literacy programs to teach our youth to identify fake news.”She also noted the disturbing rise of anti-Israel content on Chinese social media platforms like TikTok. “Pro-Hamas, anti-Israel content is freely spreading inside China. I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.
            



But the relationship is more than just symbolic. Economically, Taiwan and Israel are natural partners. “Taiwan is a leader in hardware, and Israel is a leader in software,” she noted. “Our business and technological cooperation opportunities are enormous. We see a lot of Israeli start-ups coming to Taiwan to find reliable partners, and we have a very business-friendly infrastructure for them.”  This synergy extends to security and democratic resilience. “Taiwan and Israel are standing on the forefront to defend the democratic way of life,” Lee said. “We have been the testing ground for democracy, facing cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and psychological warfare.”Trump's first monthsTrump's return to the White House has prompted intense speculation about his policies toward China and Taiwan. Lee, however, remains measured.“The US is Taiwan's most important partner in security, science, and technology,” she emphasized. “We pay a lot of attention to trade policies and will adapt quickly. A close and deep partnership between Taiwan and the US is essential for maintaining peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.”She pointed out that Trump's fundamental policies on Taiwan have remained consistent. “The US has long-standing policies on Taiwan – support for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo, and bipartisan Congressional backing. We have many good friends in the Trump administration who continue to engage with us and provide substantive support.”However, Taiwan is under no illusions about the volatility of geopolitics. “We are very clear, realistic, and efficient in optimizing our leverage to strengthen our partnership with the US,” Lee stated. “Taiwan's peace and stability are essential for global peace.”One of Trump's most aggressive policies has been his renewed economic war on China, particularly tariffs and restrictions on Chinese technology.Lee acknowledged that Taiwan is watching these moves closely. “Trump's trade policies aim to address issues such as trade imbalances, Chinese overcapacity, and state subsidies. Taiwan, as a trade economy, carefully analyzes all relevant policies.”However, Taiwan's position in global trade is unique. “Currently, 91% of Taiwanese exports to the US are intermediate goods, not consumer goods,” she explained. “These include servers, electronic components, and networking equipment—essential for AI and 5G networks. Our trade with the US is complementary and healthy.”While Taiwan could benefit from US-China tensions by strengthening trade with America, it must also ensure that it does not become collateral damage in any broader economic conflict. “We remain proactive in maintaining a smooth and effective dialogue with every US administration,” Lee said.Taiwan's Silicon ShieldPerhaps the most significant development in US-Taiwan economic relations is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's $100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five cutting-edge fabrication plants in Arizona.“This is a milestone in US-Taiwan trade relations and a historical moment for TSMC,” Lee stated. “It strengthens Taiwan's relevance with the US and helps TSMC better serve its American customers, who make up 60% of its business.”When announced, Trump stated that TSMC's investment ensures the company – a key supplier of the world's most advanced semiconductors – can sidestep the tariffs he has considered applying to the global chip industry.

Taiwan, as a trade economy, carefully analyzes all relevant policies.”However, Taiwan's position in global trade is unique. “Currently, 91% of Taiwanese exports to the US are intermediate goods, not consumer goods,” she explained. “These include servers, electronic components, and networking equipment—essential for AI and 5G networks. Our trade with the US is complementary and healthy.”While Taiwan could benefit from US-China tensions by strengthening trade with America, it must also ensure that it does not become collateral damage in any broader economic conflict. “We remain proactive in maintaining a smooth and effective dialogue with every US administration,” Lee said.Taiwan's Silicon ShieldPerhaps the most significant development in US-Taiwan economic relations is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's $100 billion investment in the US, including the construction of five cutting-edge fabrication plants in Arizona.“This is a milestone in US-Taiwan trade relations and a historical moment for TSMC,” Lee stated. “It strengthens Taiwan's relevance with the US and helps TSMC better serve its American customers, who make up 60% of its business.”When announced, Trump stated that TSMC's investment ensures the company – a key supplier of the world's most advanced semiconductors – can sidestep the tariffs he has considered applying to the global chip industry. His broader goal is to strengthen US manufacturing and solidify America's trade leverage over both competitors and allies.However, there are concerns that shifting semiconductor production overseas could weaken Taiwan's strategic importance. Lee dismissed such fears. “Even when all overseas manufacturing lines are completed by 2030, 80% of TSMC's production will still remain in Taiwan, and the most critical technology will be kept on the island.”Taiwan's dominance in chip production remains staggering: 60% of the world's total chips are made in Taiwan, 92% of the world's advanced chips (such as 5 nanometer and 3nm semiconductors) come from Taiwan, and 99% of the world's AI chips are produced by Taiwanese companies.“That's why the semiconductor chief industries and TSMC is always referred to as ‘Taiwan's silicon shield' as a protection of our national security,” she told the Post.Taiwan, Ukraine, and lessons learnedTaiwanese leaders have watched the war in Ukraine with deep concern, drawing direct parallels to their own situation with China. However, they are determined not to be caught off guard.“The Ukrainian people are very resilient,” Lee said. “This has been an awakening call for Taiwanese people – that our determination to defend ourselves is critical to our survival.“The future of Taiwan should be determined, decided by Taiwanese people,” Lee expressed to the Post. “That is the reason why we fight so hard to build democracy in Taiwan – and Taiwan and China: We don't have jurisdiction over each other. China did not rule Taiwan for a single day. We are enjoying different political systems, and Taiwan is independent by its reality.”In response to threats posed across the Taiwan Strait, the islands have significantly bolstered their defenses. By increasing its defense budget to 3% of GDP, extending military conscription from four months to one year, developing a domestic defense industry, and enhancing cyber defense against China's daily cyberattacks, the government hopes it will maintain the status quo and deter Beijing from any thoughts of attack.“The Chinese government conducts three million cyberattacks on Taiwan every day,” Lee revealed. “We have adopted countermeasures, including real-time debunking of disinformation campaigns and media literacy programs to teach our youth to identify fake news.”She also noted the disturbing rise of anti-Israel content on Chinese social media platforms like TikTok. “Pro-Hamas, anti-Israel content is freely spreading inside China. I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.

I think this is also an awakening call for all the democracies to work together and to coordinate our countermeasures to deter the playbook that is shared by these authoritarian regimes.”Despite the uncertainties of a new Trump presidency, Taipei is confident in its ability to navigate the future.“We see every challenge as an opportunity,” Lee said. “Taiwan is seeking to be great and strong. We are committed to defending ourselves and expanding partnerships with like-minded countries.”With deepening ties with Israel, a reinforced partnership with the US, and a hi-tech economy that remains indispensable to the world, Taiwan's message is clear: it will not be intimidated, and it will not stand alone.

The Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se), an international research and policy institute, has released a groundbreaking report examining Uzbekistan's educational curriculum, highlighting its attempts at promoting tolerance, interfaith respect, and cultural openness in the Central Asian nation.The report is the second installment in a three-part series analyzing curricula in Central Asian countries, produced in partnership with the Ruderman Family Foundation. The series, which began with Azerbaijan and will conclude with Kazakhstan, sheds light on otherwise relatively unknown educational trends in the region.The comprehensive analysis reviewed over 100 textbooks across multiple subjects, including Language, Ethics, Civics, History, and Religion. The report specifically examined how Jews, Judaism, the Holocaust, Israel, and the Arab-Israeli conflict are depicted in educational materials.  The report found that Uzbekistan's curriculum emphasizes the nation's identity as a secular, multi-ethnic republic where promoting cultural diversity and religious harmony is a cornerstone of education.The report highlights several positive aspects of Uzbekistan's educational approach. For instance, textbooks provide clear overviews of Judaism, covering key terms, historical origins, scriptures, and religious practices. Grade 11 students are explicitly taught that tolerance is not only a “spiritual duty, but also a political and legal need,” reinforcing the importance of interfaith respect. Samarkand, Uzbekistan by Dan Lundberg. Licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0. (credit: FLICKR)Additionally, in a rare approach, materials cover the migration of Jewish tribes to Canaan, the kingdom of King David, Jewish scriptures, the Ten Commandments, daily prayers, synagogue services, and major holidays, including Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Hanukkah.Also, on the issue of Judaism, the curriculum highlights the Jewish presence in Uzbekistan, featuring images of a Jewish theater and a Bukhari Jewish family from the early 20th century. Interfaith harmony is demonstrated through examples like the Mausoleum of Daniel in Samarkand. Uzbek textbooks also refer to the Holocaust. A grade 10 World History textbook accurately describes the Holocaust as the persecution and extermination of six million Jews, placing it within the broader context of World War II and Nazi war crimes.Strikingly, textbooks also stress the dangers of extremism, the distinction between faith and radicalism, and the role of education in preventing radical ideologies. They specifically identify organizations like Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah as “banned in Uzbekistan.”REGARDING ISRAEL, the socioeconomic development of the Jewish state is highlighted as a “developed country of transplanted capitalism.” The curriculum features Israel's engineering achievements and economic growth, including an image showcasing Israeli drip-irrigation technology adopted in Uzbekistani agriculture.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Finally, the issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict is presented with remarkable neutrality, focusing on diplomatic efforts and peace talks, particularly the Oslo Accords. According to the report, this approach reflects Uzbekistan's diplomatic stance and commitment to peaceful relations with Arab countries and Israel.The report also identified areas for improvement. These include some historical inaccuracies, such as using “Palestine” instead of “Canaan” or “Land of Israel” when referencing the historic Jewish homeland and recognizing Tel Aviv rather than Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Additionally, while the Holocaust is addressed, the curriculum could benefit from a more comprehensive treatment of antisemitism and Jewish persecution throughout history. ‘Report shows Uzbekistan's commitment to coexistence'The IMPACT-se report concludes that Uzbekistan's educational materials reflect a genuine commitment to fostering harmonious coexistence among diverse communities while maintaining a distinctly Uzbek cultural identity. As the country continues to develop its educational system, these foundations of tolerance and mutual respect provide promising groundwork for future generations. “This study is a very encouraging insight into children's education in Uzbekistan. It demonstrates that the precious values of tolerance and respect are deeply ingrained in the Uzbekistani curriculum. Furthermore, Judaism, Jewish practices, and Jewish history are taught in depth and placed in the context of their social importance in Uzbekistan and beyond.This example of bridge-building through education bodes well for the future of a country with an important geopolitical role to play,” President of the Ruderman Family Foundation Jay Ruderman said.IMPACT-se CEO Marcus Sheff added: “Uzbekistan holds a strategically important place in Central Asia – it is positioned between the influences of various regional powers while also facing the challenge of radical Islamism.However, the country's textbooks demonstrate Uzbekistan's commitment to fostering an inclusive and multicultural society. They firmly reject extremism and promote respect between minorities and faiths, including extensive content on Judaism, Jewish history and traditions. With the region at a critical geopolitical crossroads, Uzbekistan's example of moderation and forward-thinking education is significant as a model for other countries in the region.”DR. ZEEV LEVIN, an expert on Central Asia from the Ben-Zvi Institute and the author of the current report, commented to The Jerusalem Post: “Uzbekistan boasts an education system that is separated from religion, meaning that there are no religious studies per se, but rather chapters within a framework of a “World Religions” theme, taught in a cultural approach.”Levin continued: “In this context, classes about Judaism are quite significant in terms of the material they teach, which is a pleasant surprise. The local communities of Bukhara and Samarkand are mentioned, and this is not at all obvious in the environment we are talking about, where knowledge and encounters with Jews and Judaism are usually scarce.”According to Levin, the curriculum also features quotes from the Constitution and the president regarding the importance of maintaining interreligious tolerance and resisting extremist frameworks, mainly Islamic ones.“The Holocaust is mentioned Iranian briefly, and the murder of six million Jews is also discussed,” Levin added. “Surely one can always call to expand on antisemitism and how it differs from ordinary xenophobia, and this is very relevant in light of the exposure of locals to media originating in Turkey and Iran, which is disturbing in and of itself.”As for the Middle East, Levin lauded the mentions of Israel as a country with developed agriculture and the highlighting of cooperation between the countries.“The textbooks do mention the conflict but in a shallow manner with mainly headlines, and this is true for mentions of other conflicts as well. Interestingly, the peace agreements and collaborations between Israel and Arab countries are not mentioned, so one may still believe that much of the conflict is still ongoing and that there are no further developments in this issue.”“Tel Aviv is defined as the capital of Israel, a Soviet legacy which has obviously never been true,” he continued. “Generally speaking, it was refreshing to see these mentions of Judaism, Jews, and Israel. The subject of religions was taboo during the Soviet era, and so was Israel, which was presented only from the Palestinian perspective, so this was a pleasant surprise.”

They firmly reject extremism and promote respect between minorities and faiths, including extensive content on Judaism, Jewish history and traditions. With the region at a critical geopolitical crossroads, Uzbekistan's example of moderation and forward-thinking education is significant as a model for other countries in the region.”DR. ZEEV LEVIN, an expert on Central Asia from the Ben-Zvi Institute and the author of the current report, commented to The Jerusalem Post: “Uzbekistan boasts an education system that is separated from religion, meaning that there are no religious studies per se, but rather chapters within a framework of a “World Religions” theme, taught in a cultural approach.”Levin continued: “In this context, classes about Judaism are quite significant in terms of the material they teach, which is a pleasant surprise. The local communities of Bukhara and Samarkand are mentioned, and this is not at all obvious in the environment we are talking about, where knowledge and encounters with Jews and Judaism are usually scarce.”According to Levin, the curriculum also features quotes from the Constitution and the president regarding the importance of maintaining interreligious tolerance and resisting extremist frameworks, mainly Islamic ones.“The Holocaust is mentioned Iranian briefly, and the murder of six million Jews is also discussed,” Levin added. “Surely one can always call to expand on antisemitism and how it differs from ordinary xenophobia, and this is very relevant in light of the exposure of locals to media originating in Turkey and Iran, which is disturbing in and of itself.”As for the Middle East, Levin lauded the mentions of Israel as a country with developed agriculture and the highlighting of cooperation between the countries.“The textbooks do mention the conflict but in a shallow manner with mainly headlines, and this is true for mentions of other conflicts as well. Interestingly, the peace agreements and collaborations between Israel and Arab countries are not mentioned, so one may still believe that much of the conflict is still ongoing and that there are no further developments in this issue.”“Tel Aviv is defined as the capital of Israel, a Soviet legacy which has obviously never been true,” he continued. “Generally speaking, it was refreshing to see these mentions of Judaism, Jews, and Israel. The subject of religions was taboo during the Soviet era, and so was Israel, which was presented only from the Palestinian perspective, so this was a pleasant surprise.”

ZEEV LEVIN, an expert on Central Asia from the Ben-Zvi Institute and the author of the current report, commented to The Jerusalem Post: “Uzbekistan boasts an education system that is separated from religion, meaning that there are no religious studies per se, but rather chapters within a framework of a “World Religions” theme, taught in a cultural approach.”Levin continued: “In this context, classes about Judaism are quite significant in terms of the material they teach, which is a pleasant surprise. The local communities of Bukhara and Samarkand are mentioned, and this is not at all obvious in the environment we are talking about, where knowledge and encounters with Jews and Judaism are usually scarce.”According to Levin, the curriculum also features quotes from the Constitution and the president regarding the importance of maintaining interreligious tolerance and resisting extremist frameworks, mainly Islamic ones.“The Holocaust is mentioned Iranian briefly, and the murder of six million Jews is also discussed,” Levin added. “Surely one can always call to expand on antisemitism and how it differs from ordinary xenophobia, and this is very relevant in light of the exposure of locals to media originating in Turkey and Iran, which is disturbing in and of itself.”As for the Middle East, Levin lauded the mentions of Israel as a country with developed agriculture and the highlighting of cooperation between the countries.“The textbooks do mention the conflict but in a shallow manner with mainly headlines, and this is true for mentions of other conflicts as well. Interestingly, the peace agreements and collaborations between Israel and Arab countries are not mentioned, so one may still believe that much of the conflict is still ongoing and that there are no further developments in this issue.”“Tel Aviv is defined as the capital of Israel, a Soviet legacy which has obviously never been true,” he continued. “Generally speaking, it was refreshing to see these mentions of Judaism, Jews, and Israel. The subject of religions was taboo during the Soviet era, and so was Israel, which was presented only from the Palestinian perspective, so this was a pleasant surprise.”
				



The report also identified areas for improvement. These include some historical inaccuracies, such as using “Palestine” instead of “Canaan” or “Land of Israel” when referencing the historic Jewish homeland and recognizing Tel Aviv rather than Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Additionally, while the Holocaust is addressed, the curriculum could benefit from a more comprehensive treatment of antisemitism and Jewish persecution throughout history. ‘Report shows Uzbekistan's commitment to coexistence'The IMPACT-se report concludes that Uzbekistan's educational materials reflect a genuine commitment to fostering harmonious coexistence among diverse communities while maintaining a distinctly Uzbek cultural identity. As the country continues to develop its educational system, these foundations of tolerance and mutual respect provide promising groundwork for future generations. “This study is a very encouraging insight into children's education in Uzbekistan. It demonstrates that the precious values of tolerance and respect are deeply ingrained in the Uzbekistani curriculum.

NUUK, Greenland (AP) — Greenland's likely new prime minister on Wednesday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's effort to take control of the island, saying Greenlanders must be allowed to decide their own future as it moves toward independence from Denmark.

Jens-Frederik Nielsen's Demokraatit, a pro-business party that favors a slow path to independence, won a surprise victory in Tuesday's parliamentary election, outpacing the two left-leaning parties that formed the last government. With most Greenlanders opposing Trump's overtures, the campaign focused more on issues like healthcare and education than on geopolitics.

But on Wednesday Nielsen was quick to push back against Trump, who last week told a joint session of Congress that the U.S. needed Greenland to protect its own national security interests and he expected to get it “one way or the other.”

“We don't want to be Americans. No, we don't want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders, and we want our own independence in the future,” Nielsen, 33, told Britain's Sky News. “And we want to build our own country by ourselves.”

That didn't stop Trump from suggesting during a Thursday Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte that Greenland's election that it was “very good” for “us” and “the person who did the best is a very good person, as far as we're concerned.”

Greenland, a self-governing region of Denmark, has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009, when the government in Copenhagen recognized its right to self-determination under international law. Four of the five main parties in the election supported independence, though they disagreed on when and how to achieve it.

The island of 56,000 people, most from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds, has attracted international attention since Trump announced his designs on it soon after returning to the White House in January. 

Trump is focused on Greenland because it straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and is home to the U.S.'s Pituffik Space Base, which supports missile warning and space surveillance operations. Greenland also has large deposits of the rare-earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology. 

Trump said during the meeting with Rutte that “Denmark's very far away” from Greenland and questioned whether that country still had a right to claim the world's largest island as part of its kingdom. 

“A boat landed there 200 years ago or something. And they say they have rights to it,” Trump said. “I don't know if that's true. I don't think it is, actually.”

Trump said U.S. control of Greenland could be important for national security reasons and even suggested NATO should be involved, but Rutte demurred. Trump nonetheless noted that the U.S. already has a considerable military presence in Greenland and added, “Maybe you'll see more and more soldiers going there. I don't know.”

Despite that, Trump's overtures weren't on the ballot. 

The 31 men and women elected to parliament on Tuesday will have to set priorities for issues such as diversifying Greenland's economy, building infrastructure and improving health care, as well as shaping the country's strategy for countering the president's America First agenda.

Demokraatit won 29.9% of the vote by campaigning to improve housing and educational standards while delaying independence until Greenland is self-sufficient. Four years ago, the party finished in fourth place with 9.1%.

Nuuk resident Anthon Nielsen said the party's victory would be good for the country.

“Most politicians want Greenland to be independent,” he said. “But this party who won, they don't want to hurry things so everything must be done right.”

Carina Ren, head of the Arctic program at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, said the results show that Greenlanders tried to ignore Trump and focus on issues that were important to them.

“The voters have been able to drag down all the drama, all the alarmist talk from the outside to say, ‘Well, this is about our everyday lives, our everyday concerns as citizens. Where are we going, how are we going to develop our society from the inside.'”

Now Demokraatit will have to turn its attention to forming a governing coalition. 

Naleraq, the most aggressively pro-independence party, finished in second place, with 24.5% of the vote. It was followed by Inuit Ataqatigiit, which led the last government, at 21.4%.

“What approach to independence will win the day will ultimately depend on if Demokraatit decides to form a coalition government, and if so, with which party,” said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative.

Nielsen appeared to be surprised by Demokraatit's gains as the results came it, with photos showing him sporting a huge grin and applauding at a post-election party.

He later said Demokraatit would reach out to all the other parties to negotiate Greenland's future political course.

Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen congratulated Demokraatit and warned that Greenland's new government would likely have to “deal with massive pressure” from Trump.

“It's not the case that you can just take part of the Danish Realm,” Danish broadcaster DR quoted him as saying. “The future of Greenland is based on what the Greenlandic people and government want.”

Greenland Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede last month called early elections, saying the country needed to be united during a “serious time” unlike anything Greenland has ever experienced.

On Wednesday, after the results were known, Egede used a Facebook post to thank voters for turning out and said the parties were ready to turn to negotiations to form a government.

Mahmoud Khalil described by former colleague at UK office for Syria as well liked and extensively vetted

A detained Columbia University graduate threatened with deportation after the Trump administration claimed he poses a risk to US foreign policy is a former employee of the British government who was extensively vetted before working at the embassy in Beirut.

Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate from a Columbia University master's programme, was arrested at home on 9 March as he returned with his wife from a dinner to break their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

“My husband was kidnapped from our home, and it's shameful that the US government continues to hold him because he stood for the rights and lives of his people,” his wife, Noor Abdalla, who is eight months pregnant, said in a statement read by her lawyer outside a New York court this week.

“His disappearance has devastated our lives.”

Khalil, a Palestinian born in Syria, had become a prominent face in protests on the Columbia campus over the last year. Following his arrest, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused him of leading “activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation”.

The White House has not specified publicly or in court that Khalil has committed any crime, or how this invalidates his status as a US legal permanent resident. The Trump administration has instead sought to use a provision within immigration law specifying that the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, “has reasonable grounds to believe that your presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”, according to a charging document provided to Khalil.

Andrew Waller, a former British diplomat who worked with Khalil at the UK office for Syria, a diplomatic mission housed inside the British embassy in Beirut, described Khalil as a thoughtful individual and highly valued colleague during his government service.

“This is a naked example of the US administration arresting someone for their political opinions, and I think the British government should be exercised about this,” he said.

“He is a former British government employee who was vetted and well liked.”

Waller added that the British government was entirely dependent on non-British nationals working at embassies worldwide to provide the language skills and local knowledge needed to operate. Khalil worked for years on the British government's flagship grant programme that brings foreign students to study at UK universities, as well as in a support role for which he helped to inform and shape British foreign policy on Syria through his knowledge and Arabic skills.

“The British government relies on people like Mahmoud all over the world,” he said. “Without them the UK could not operate overseas. It could not conduct diplomatic activity without this raft of employees who do this kind of work.”

Waller said he was “disappointed” that Khalil's loyalty to the government he served for years has not been publicly recognised by the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office. The Foreign Office declined to comment, saying it did not discuss former employees.

“There is an element of loyalty here that is really important: If there is one thing Mahmoud showed while working for the British government, it is loyalty,” said Waller.

Columbia University did not respond to questions about how the campus administration intends to protect other students like Khalil, after it emerged that he emailed the university begging for legal protection in the days before his arrest.

The White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this week that DHS was “using intelligence” to find other students who took part in campus protests over the Israeli assault on Gaza.

A spokesperson for Columbia University referred instead to a statement by the interim president, Katrina Armstrong, earlier this week pledging to “follow the law”, and underlining a “commitment to freedom of speech”.

International students at the Columbia journalism school were warned about angering the Trump administration by its dean, Jelani Cobb, and a professor of media law, Stuart Karle, according to the New York Times.

“Nobody can protect you,” said Cobb, advising them to avoid filling their social media with commentary on the Middle East. Karle reportedly warned the students to avoid coverage of protests of Khalil's arrest.

Both Waller and Khalil's lawyer, Samah Sisay, pointed to the extensive background checks and screening, including about his political views and those held by his family, that Khalil had been through in order to work for the British government, and then later to obtain a US green card.

“It's completely absurd that US government is saying Mahmoud presents a threat to its foreign policy interests,” said Sisay.

“They don't even say national security interests ... they are not accusing him of specific terrorist or criminal activity, they are just saying a discretionary belief by the secretary of state is enough to deport him.”

Khalil was subject to extensive background checks to obtain a green card last year, said Sisay, which granted him legal permanent residency as the spouse of an American citizen.

“He would not have been granted it if they truly believed he was a threat. The only difference is a change in the executive, which is incredibly concerning,” she said.

Waller described the “rigorous security clearance”, that Khalil was subject to before he began work for the British government at the embassy in Beirut. He oversaw applicants for the prestigious Chevening scholarship, an academic fund for students coming to the UK.

Khalil rose up the ranks at the UK office for Syria before deciding to study for a masters degree at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs. Before starting work for the British government, Khalil would have been questioned about his political beliefs, said Waller.

“I would say, and I am sure the vetting officers would disagree, that if you're going to work in a place like Beirut, they take that process a lot more seriously than some other countries,” he said. “Lebanon is a difficult place to work, and they take the security of the embassy there really quite seriously for obvious reasons. So it's not a box-ticking exercise, it's a considered process.”

Waller added that his friend and former colleague was motivated by a desire to help others after his family fled Syria in 2012.

“He is a political exile from Syria, who fled the oppressive regime and civil war there. Everything he has done has been driven by a sense of basic humanitarian mission and a sense of justice, to try and help people less fortunate,” he said.

The former diplomat also pointed to JD Vance's comments during a visit by Keir Starmer, when the US vice-president described “infringements to free speech in the UK”.

“Given that the US has just reprimanded the UK on freedom of speech extremely publicly, the least the British government could do is to say they are concerned about Mahmoud's case and the free speech violation it so clearly represents,” said Waller.

Parts of Los Angeles hit by January blazes under evacuation warnings as west coast braces for heavy rain and snow

The US west coast is facing an atmospheric river event threatening flooding and power outages due to heavy rain and snow, with more than 20 million people in southern California under flood watches.

Evacuation warnings were issued by fire officials in the Pacific Palisades, Altadena and Pasadena areas, which were affected by the Palisades and Eaton fires in January.

“While we prepare for another storm headed towards LA, I want to urge Angelenos to stay vigilant, especially in burn scar areas,” the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, said in a statement. “My number one job is to keep Angelenos safe, so please heed all evacuation warnings, stay vigilant and stay informed.”

Los Angeles mountain ranges are under a wind advisory until Thursday night. A flood advisory is in effect in Los Angeles until 6am PT, while a level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles.

A special weather advisory was in effect for Los Angeles, Long Beach and east Los Angeles until 3.45am PT. In Orange county, a flash flood warning is in effect until 7.30am PT.

The National Weather Service said a tornado had moved through the Pico Rivera area on Thursday morning.

State agencies have deployed more than 400 personnel to prepare to respond to the storm at the direction of the California governor, Gavin Newsom. “In Altadena and the Palisades, we're continuing our months-long efforts to protect against potential debris flows,” Newsom stated on social media.

The California governor's office of emergency services explained in areas burned by intense wildfires, the soil can develop a layer that repels water rather than absorb water, resulting in significantly less rain to produce a flash flood. The lack of vegetation and plants that hold soil in place also increases the risk of mudslides and debris flow, especially on and around steep terrain.

“Those living near recent brush fires should be aware of the extreme danger possible from debris flows,” a Los Angeles fire department spokesperson said in a statement.

“When rainstorms impact the Los Angeles area, storm drains, canyons, arroyos and other sloped or low-lying areas can quickly fill with fast-moving water and debris, creating a life-threatening danger.”

        Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz wants to alter Germany's strict fiscal rules to massively boost defence spending, the Greens are standing in his way.
    

Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz on Thursday made concessions to the Green Party in the hopes it would lend critically important votes to his multi-billion-euro spending spree.

Merz and the CDU, alongside would-be coalition partners, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), unveiled their plans last week to lift Germany's "debt brake", which was written into Germany's constitution in 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis. It tightly restricts the government's ability to borrow new money. 

Over the years, the country's strict fiscal rules have created headaches for successive governments as they tried to raise funds to respond to crises. It was suspended in 2020 as the state tried to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, and in 2024, a spat over its reform led to the breakdown of the country's three-party ruling coalition. 

Last week, the CDU and the SPD proposed exempting defence spending that exceeds 1% of Germany's GDP from the debt brake, which currently sets the structural deficit at a maximum of 0.35% of the country's GDP. 

The proposal would also set up a €500 billion fund to invest in Germany's creaking infrastructure over the next decade, as well as loosen borrowing rules for Germany's sixteen states. 

But the Greens, who have long argued for reform of the debt brake, are now standing in Merz's way. Although the party supports changing the debt brake, it argues the proposals on the table do not address the need to invest in Germany's clean energy transition. 

The Greens have offered their own draft law, one which expands the definition of "defence" and draws more on funds from within the government's current budget. 

On Thursday, Merz and the SPD attempted to appease the Greens by offering to divert €50 billion of the special funds into the Climate Transformation Fund, a multi-year federal budget set up to finance climate and energy transition policy measures. 

Merz also conceded that the scope of defence spending would be expanded to include civil defence and intelligence spending. 

“What more do you want from us in so short a time?” Merz demanded. 

The Greens, however, stuck to their criticism, with party parliamentary group leader Katharina Dröge arguing on Thursday that "shifting of billions" from one fund to another should not be the purpose of the draft law, arguing that the word "additional" be added to the proposal.

The party say they fear that without safeguards such as the word "additional" added, the money kicked up through the proposal will simply be used to fulfil the campaign promises of the CDU and the SPD.

Merz and the SPD are deeply dependent on votes from the Greens to pass the proposal through the country's old parliament as adjusting the debt brake requires a majority vote of two-thirds of the parliament. 

The new makeup of the Bundestag — which is set to convene 25 March — would mean that without the Greens on board, Merz would need votes from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and The Left to push forward the measure.

But both of these parties were so opposed to the debt brake proposal that they filed urgent lawsuits to the country's Constitutional Court to prevent the debate from taking place. 

Adjusting the debt brake has general approval from the country's economists, with disagreement primarily lying in the wording of the government's proposals. 

Jens Südekum, who alongside three other economists brainstormed the proposal upon which the CDU and SPD's plans are based, said that the word "additionality" is missing to make the proposals more robust. 

"We really need to make sure if we have this debt break reform that the additional money only flows to military and infrastructure," Südekum told Euronews. "We need to make a very strong commitment to say: OK, all of the money goes additionally into infrastructure, investment and military."

Influential economist Veronika Grimm of the German Council of Economic Experts has also expressed concern over the proposals, telling domestic media that the problem with the measures is in their "design".

"There is a risk that their negative effects will outweigh the positive ones, thus counteracting the intended effect," Grimm wrote in an open letter to the Bundestag budget committee. 

Südekum told Euronews that while the Greens are making trouble for Merz and the SPD, the biggest catastrophe would still be if no package and adjustment is agreed at all. 

"We (Germany) have been stagnating for five years. We are entering dirty tariff wars with the US, geopolitical tensions, and Donald Trump doesn't negotiate with losers. So, we only can basically push through our interest if we bargain from a position of economic strength," Südekum said. 

Merz himself has framed the multi-million-euro package as vital "in light of the threats to our freedom and peace on the continent."

"The world is watching," Merz said on Thursday, as the clock ticked down and the Greens showed no sign of falling in line with the bill. 

He faces several days of negotiating with the Greens in order to get the party on board with his proposals ahead of a vote on the 18 March. 

The bill must also pass through the Bundesrat, or Germany's upper house, which represents the governments of the country's 16 states. There, the CDU, SPD and Greens would need the backing of one more party for the bill to pass.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that his country agrees with the US proposals for a ceasefire in Ukraine. However, any ceasefire would have to deal with the root causes of the conflict, he added.

Putin said many details need to be sorted out before advancing further in talks.

"We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities," Putin told reporters at a news conference in the Kremlin.

He, however, said the ceasefire should eliminate the original cause of the crisis.

"But we proceed from the fact that this cessation should be such that it would lead to long-term peace and would eliminate the original causes of this crisis," he was quoted as saying by Reuters.

Ukraine and Russia have been fighting a protracted war since 2022 when Putin sent tens of thousands of troops inside the country, triggering the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.

Russian forces have been advancing since mid-2024 and control nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory, three years into a war that US President Donald Trump has said he will stop.

Trump had said in the White House on Wednesday that he hoped the Kremlin would agree to the U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine said it would support.

Putin thanked Trump for his efforts to end the war.

"The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it," Putin said. "But there are issues that we need to discuss. And I think we need to talk to our American colleagues as well."

Putin said he might call Trump to discuss the issue. "We support the idea of ending this conflict by peaceful means."

President Donald Trump threatened Thursday to impose 200% tariffs on alcohol from the European Union in response to the region's retaliatory 50% tariff on U.S. whiskey, further escalating tensions between two longtime trading partners. 

Trump also sharpened his rhetoric toward the E.U., which has for decades been one of the closest U.S. allies.

"The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S."

A spokesperson for the European Commission said the region's trade minister has already contacted his American counterparts  and that “calls are being prepared.”

Later Thursday morning, Trump posted: "The U.S. doesn't have Free Trade. We have 'Stupid Trade.' The Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!"

After some early gyrations Thursday morning, the major U.S. stock indexes settled firmly in the red, with the S&P 500 approaching correction territory, almost 10% down from its all-time high in February. The tech-focused Nasdaq index was down 1.4%, now down more than 14% from is February high.

The U.S. remains the world's largest importer of both wine and champagne, with the former comprising $4.9 billion in annual sales and the latter more than $1.7 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. exports of wine rank fifth among all nations at about $1 billion, while its exports of champagne and sparkling wine total just $67 million, 12th in the world.

The impact of the tit-for-tat tariffs could weigh heavily on U.S. consumers, who depend on import of the goods, than manufacturers of them. 

In a statement, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which represents alcohol makers here, called on the president to come to an agreement with the EU over the impasse, noting that neither region's liquors have been subjected to tariffs for multiple decades.

"We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector. We want toasts not tariffs,” said Chris Swonger, Distilled Spirits Council President and CEO.  

Trump has made wielding tariff threats against stalwart U.S. partners a core practice of his early second administration. The latest volley shows he has no plans to halt doing so despite protests from economists and businesses groups alike about the repercussions of such policy. On Wednesday, Trump's largest tariffs regime — targeting all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. — came into effect. In response, the E.U. and Canada announced they would impose retaliatory duties on U.S.-made products. 

The president has repeatedly suggested the U.S.'s large trade deficit with the rest of the world is a sign of weakness. Trump has acknowledged that his tariffs strategy may lead to a period of "transition" for the U.S. economy, which has shown signs of wobbling in recent weeks, but that it will ultimately emerge stronger.  

Thursday morning, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added additional context to Trump's latest barb and the EU specifically targeting products from states with strong Trump support.  

"The President was totally annoyed that the Europeans did this, and so you're going to hear back from someone who emotionally cares about America," he said on Bloomberg Television. "He cares about America, and he wants to take care of Americans. And why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon secretary, Harley Davidson motorcycle? It's disrespectful."

Lutnick added Trump was looking to "balance" trade relations with the E.U.

"We are your largest, most important trading partner. Treat us with respect, and let's get a little balance," he said. 

Ernst Büscher, spokesperson for the German Wine Institute, said in an interview that a 200% would be a "catastrophe," noting that the United States is the most important export market for German winemakers, accounting for about one sixth of exports. 

He added that when a tariff of 25 percent was placed on German wines during the first Trump administration, importers and winemakers shared that cost to shield U.S/ consumers from the price increase — but that would likely not be possible with a 200-percent tariff.

French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said in a statement Thursday that Trump was "escalating the trade war he chose to launch."

"France remains determined to fight back with the European Commission and our partners," he said. "We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries.”

So far, market reaction to Trump's approach has been broadly negative. Major stock indexes have now erased their post-electoral gains, as investors rebel against the prospect of higher costs. On Thursday, stock futures immediately fell in response to Trump's latest announcement, though pared losses somewhat after a favorable inflation report.

Most academics say that the ability of U.S. consumers and businesses alike to import goods cheaply mostly leads to higher living standards and more efficient output for companies.

        The latest medical bulletins from the Vatican on the 88-year-old's condition have said he is improving and is no longer in immediate danger of death.
    

Pope Francis marked his 12th anniversary as pontiff on Thursday with positive medical updates nearly a month after he was hospitalised with double pneumonia. 

In the Vatican's latest medical bulletin on Tuesday, it said a chest X-ray had confirmed improvements just two days after doctors declared that the pope was no longer at imminent risk of death. However, the "general picture remains complex", the bulletin read.

The Holy See has not said how the anniversary of Pope Francis' election as the 266th pontiff might be commemorated. It is a public holiday at the Vatican and masses are planned in his honour at churches in Rome. No medical bulletins will be issued.

Pope Francis on Wednesday remotely followed a Lenten spiritual retreat that has been a mainstay of his papacy. He continues to receive high flows of oxygen through nasal tubes during the day and a non-invasive mechanical mask to aid his rest at night.

Leading papal and political figures in Italy have praised the pontiff this week to mark the anniversary. 

"I would like to address a thought of gratitude to the Holy Father for his tireless commitment to peace, dialogue and human dignity," Italian Senate speaker Ignazio La Russa wrote on Facebook.

"His magisterium is a point of reference for millions of people," he added.

Cardinal Michael Czerny, a senior Vatican official, said the pope's anniversary was a "reason for gratitude". 

"This year, his illness makes us especially aware (of the anniversary), especially grateful to God, and redoubling our prayers for his full recovery," he said.

Pope Francis has been carrying out some of his duties while in hospital, continuing with ecclesiastical appointments and delivering messages of gratitude to his well-wishers.

The former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected on the fifth ballot of the 2013 conclave, which was called after Pope Benedict XVI resigned.

While Pope Francis has praised his predecessor's humility in stepping down and said he might follow in his footsteps, more recently he has said the papacy is a job for life.

However, concerns remain over the pontiff's physical frailty, and there has been discussion about the prospect of his resignation even if his health improves further.

Resignation is "a possibility, but it is totally entrusted to the conscience of the Pope," Archbishop Giuseppe Baturi, secretary general of the Italian Bishops' Conference (CEI), told Italian media.

The earthquake was the most powerful recorded in the Phlegraean Fields volcanic region and had the same intensity as a tremor that struck the area in May last year.

A powerful earthquake struck the Campi Flegrei area in Italy at 1:25 am local time, sending hundreds of residents into the streets. 

The 4.4 magnitude quake, the strongest in 40 years, had its epicenter 3 km deep near Via Napoli in Pozzuoli and was preceded by a loud roar.

The quake triggered a seismic swarm, with seven smaller tremors recorded by 9 am. 

Experts link the event to accelerating ground uplift caused by worsening bradyseism.

Moscow is in favor of a ceasefire in the Ukraine conflict, but questions will need to be ironed out in future talks with the US, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said.

US President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived for high-end talks in Moscow on Thursday. According to Putin's top foreign policy aide, the US diplomat will meet with the president later this evening.

Witkoff's arrival in the Russian capital comes after representatives from the US and Ukraine held talks on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, where they issued a joint statement proposing a 30-day ceasefire with Moscow.





13 March 2025

Washington has been discussing land concessions with Ukraine in the ceasefire talks, Trump has said.

“We've been discussing land with Ukraine, pieces of land that would be kept and lost,” he said, adding that the ownership of “a very big power plant” was part of the negotiations.

The proposed ceasefire is just the first phase of the negotiations, Trump stated.

Putin's comment about Russia's readiness to discuss a ceasefire was promising but “it wasn't complete,” US President Donald Trump said on Thursday during a bilateral press conference with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

Witkoff and other US representatives are in Russia to discuss the proposed truce, among other things, he said.

“They're in very serious discussions,” Trump stressed.

The Ukraine conflict is a big financial burden for the US and others, he said.

“We want it to stop. It's also a tremendous cost to the United States and to other countries,” Trump said.

Russia supports the idea of ending the hostilities in the Ukraine conflict, but needs any potential ceasefire to facilitate a long-term peace, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said.

Speaking during a bilateral meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko Putin noted “We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities. But… this cessation must be such that it would lead to long-term peace and eliminate the initial causes of this crisis.”

Moscow has a number of questions about the US ceasefire proposal that will need to be raised in upcoming talks, Putin explained.

“I think that we need to discuss this with our American colleagues and partners,” he said.

“Maybe we could discuss this with President Trump over the telephone,” the Russian leader added.

Notwithstanding, Russia supports the idea of diplomatically ending the conflict, he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow is in favor of a ceasefire, but has numerous questions about its practical implementation.

The Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk Region are cut off, and it would be unclear what is to be done with them in the event of a truce, he said.

”Are we supposed to let them out, after they committed mass war crimes against civilians? The Ukrainian leadership could tell them to lay down their arms, and just surrender,” the Russian president said.

It is also unclear how the ceasefire would be monitored and enforced, he added.

It is unclear how amenable the US is to Russian demands about demilitarizing and denazifying Ukraine, Yevgeny Primakov, the head of the Russian agency for international cooperation, Rossotrudnichestvo, has said.

”Under any circumstances, Ukraine must not pose a threat to Russia,” he said.

”This means we must prevent any risks of revanchism, which logically entails that Ukraine should not maintain offensive military capabilities or embrace an aggressive Nazi ideology aimed against Russia,” Primakov stressed. This would entail dismantling several social and political institutions active in Ukraine, as well as reforming its education system, he added.

It is unclear how willing the US is to consider these issues, Primakov said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is not expected to hold a telephone conversation with Trump on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has told reporters.



Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet with Witkoff behind closed doors this evening, presidential aide Yury Ushakov has told Izvestia.

Russian political analyst Sergey Markov has warned that any ceasefire in Ukraine will be exploited by the West to rearm Kiev's “political regime,” ramp up its conscription drive, as well as strengthen its repressive and anti-Russian nature.

Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin has said Trump is not ready to “unilaterally” withdraw from the Ukraine conflict, and “risks getting increasingly bogged down,” despite the US president's apparent eagerness to wind down hostilities.



Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky may have had success in manipulating the previous US administration of President Joe Biden, but he has apparently not managed the same with President Donald Trump, according to the vice speaker of Russia's Federation Council, Konstantin Kosachev.

“The outcome of the US-Ukraine talks in Jeddah reveals a clear truth: Zelensky's attempts to make ‘the tail wag the dog' may have worked with Biden, but not with Trump,” Kosachev said, stressing that the ceasefire deal terms have so far been set by the US alone.Given Russian troops' advances on the battlefield, “dealings with Russia will be different,” Kosachev said.

“Any agreements – and we recognize the need for compromises – will come on our terms, not America's,” he stated, adding that “real agreements are still being forged on the front lines.”

Washington is unlikely to “trick” Moscow with a ceasefire proposal, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told Russia 1 TV journalist Olga Skabeeva on Thursday.

“It will not be a trick… because we know what we need and they know what we want,” he said, adding that in the event of a ceasefire, there will no “movement” in the Ukraine conflict.

Despite this, the Ukrainian “economy will still work, the military-industrial complex will work, they'll produce weapons,” and receive “weapons from abroad,” Lukashenko said.

Nevertheless, “Ukrainians will most likely not agree to this,” the Belarusian leader said, adding that Kiev expects Russia to refuse.

Thousands of jobs to be cut after Keir Starmer announces NHS England will be abolished to "cut bureaucracy" and bring management of the health service "back into democratic control"

Speaking in Hull, the prime minister says the state is "overstretched" and "unfocused"

The move partially reverses a Conservative-led reorganisation of the health service in 2012, which created NHS England, which to handle its day-to-day running

But the government says NHS England has "burdensome layers of bureaucracy without any clear lines of accountability"

Shadow Health Minister Caroline Johnson has asked if Labour is up to the task of finding NHS savings given its "failure" to run the health service in Wales

It's hardly surprising ministers want more direct control of the NHS, given its importance to voters, our political correspondent Henry Zeffman writes

Chris Mason on why scrapping NHS England matters

Nick TriggleHealth correspondent

Naomi contacted us to ask has this come out of the blue? 

Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.

Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they weren't in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service. 

NHS England was set up as part of the Andrew Lansley reforms in 2012. As the years have passed, there has been a frustration in government.

When Labour came in, it was clear Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS - he saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy roles that existed in the Department of Health and NHS England.

In recent weeks we've seen NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard saying she was stepping down at the end of the March - and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit. 

So bit by bit we did start to see there was going to be a significant change. This, however, is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.

The first question we're getting from you is on NHS England - asking what the body does and who works there. 

NHS England leads the NHS in England. 

It takes the money provided by the government and funnels it into the different parts of the health service. 

It has therefore been NHS England's job to translate minister's priorities into the services people get on the frontline. 

The body is also responsible for things like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services. 

About 18,000 people work for NHS England and the Department of Health, but we expect this workforce to get cut by 50% after today's announcement. 

We're answering your questions on Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement, with health correspondent Nick Triggle and political correspondent Helen Catt.

Ahead
of his speech this morning, Starmer said in a Daily Telegraph article that “no person's substantive time should be spent on a task
where digital or AI can do it better, quicker and to the same high quality and
standard.”

Big question marks still hang over the risk presented by a
wide variety of AI technologies, while many can speed up certain tasks, note
taking and transcribing interviews or meetings for instance, they still require
human oversight to ensure accuracy.

With many jobs - especially when it comes to running the
country - the devil is often in the detail and the jury is most certainly still
out when it comes to the risks posed by relying on or leaning heavily into AI.

The PM talks about AI in very broad strokes and there's very
little detail about how it will specifically be used.

As we've been hearing, the government has announced NHS England will be scrapped – but what does this mean for patients and the wider NHS?

Our experts will be answering your questions shortly - get in touch:

In some cases a selection of your comments and questions will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it unless you state otherwise. But don't worry, your contact details will never be published. 

Health Secretary Wes Streeting continues to answer questions from MPs in the House of Commons after this morning's announcement that NHS England is set to be scrapped. 

Streeting is touting the benefits of this decision, saying it will lead to “hundreds of millions” in savings and adding that each pound not “wasted” on bureaucracy can be spent on patient care.

Shadow Health Secretary Caroline Johnson, though, asked whether Labour is up to the task given its “failure” to successfully run the NHS in Wales. 

And, Lib Dem MP Alison Bennett emphasised the need to reform social care too, as well as questioning whether legislation would be needed to deliver the plans for change - Streeting suggested it wouldn't. 

We'll continue to bring you analysis of what the decision means for the NHS here, so stick with us.

Helen CattPolitical correspondent

The prime minister says he wants to get rid of over regulation and quangos.

He was scathing about what he calls Westminster's knee-jerk reaction of farming things out to reviews.

Of course one of the criticisms of his government so far has been the number of reviews and quangos it has created - around 20 quangos so far, including Great British Energy.

As a reminder, when we say quangos we are referring to Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisations.

These are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government, and include regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies. 

NHS England leads the NHS in England - which means the PM's announcement only affects this area.

After devolution, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland became responsible for a number of policy areas, one of which was health.

The UK has had devolved governments since the late 1990s, which work alongside the Westminster Parliament.

Former Tory chancellor and health secretary Jeremy Hunt now commends the "boldness" of the plan announced today. 

He warns that if this only serves to replace bureaucratic over-centralisation with political over-centralisation "it will fail". 

He asks Streeting about getting rid of central targets, and also whether he agrees the care regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), retains a "vital" role to call out poor care. 

The health secretary responds that "democratic accountability matters". 

He underlines that over-centralisation "has got to stop", calling this the "biggest decentralisation of power" in the history of the NHS.

Back in the Commons, Liberal Democrats MP Alison Bennett asks Streeting if new legislation is needed to scrap NHS England and if so, when it will be brought forward.

Bennett also emphasises the need to reform social care as part of attempts to fix the NHS and asks where the urgency for this is.

Streeting says much of the change needed to deliver plans can be done without the need for primary legislation - but some new legislation will be needed down the line to enact the government's plan.

"We will work immediately to move forward," he says.

On social care, Streeting says the urgency was found with the immediate steps the chancellor took to stabilise the finances of the Department of Health and Social Care, by releasing funding.

Let's briefly dip away from the House of Commons to bring you remarks from the incoming NHS England chair, Dr Penny Dash. 

As a reminder, NHS England is separate to the NHS itself - it's a public body with statutory functions enabling it to oversee the health service. 

Last month, Amanda Pritchard announced she would be stepping down as the head of NHS England after taking up the role in 2021. She called it a "hugely difficult decision".

Amanda Pritchard quit as head of NHS England last month

Today, incoming chair Dr Dash says she is "committed" to working with colleagues across NHS England to ensure the body begins 2025/26 "in the strongest possible position to support the wider NHS".

She adds that she will help lead the work "to bring together NHSE and DHSC (the Department of Health and Social Care) to reduce duplication and streamline functions."

Shadow Health Minister Caroline Johnson is now asking questions in the Commons.

She asks how many people will be moved into different roles and lose jobs, and what lessons Labour has learned from its "failure" running the NHS in Wales.

Streeting, back on his feet, says there are currently 15,300 staff at NHS England, and 3,300 in the Department of Health and Social Care.

Across both, Streeting says his teams are looking to reduce the overall headcount "by 50%". He adds this will mean "hundreds of millions of pounds worth of savings". 

"Today we're abolishing the biggest quango in the world," Streeting tells the House of Commons. 

He adds that he is "delighted" with the "capable" leadership team he will be working with to lead NHS England through the transformation.

"Change is hard," he adds, but says the Labour government will "never duck the hard yards of reform". 

He says there have been a "number" of Conservatives who have told him in private they regret the "2012 reorganisation". "None of them acted," he said. 

Reforms in 2012 saw the creation of NHS England to run the health service as well as the scrapping of primary care trusts in favour of GP-led clinical commissioning groups to organise local services.

We're still hearing from Streeting in the House of Commons who says that over the next two years NHS England will be brought into the Department of Health entirely.

The reforms set out by the prime minister earlier today will make significant savings of hundreds of millions of pounds a year, he says - money that will go to the frontline of the NHS.

By slashing through layers of red tape and ending the infantilisation of frontline NHS leaders, we will set local NHS providers free to innovate, develop new productive ways of working and deliver better care for patients, Streeting adds.

More from Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who's speaking in the House of Commons off the back of Keir Starmer's Q&A in Hull. 

Streeting says that the decision to scrap NHS England would have been taken even if the Conservatives hadn't left a "black hole" in the government's finances. 

"Every pound that is wasted on inefficient bureaucracy in good times or bad is a pound that can't be spent on treating patients faster," he says.

"There is always a duty on ministers to get as much value for taxpayers money as is possible. I cannot honestly say that is achievable with the way my department and NHS England are set up today."

A reminder: You can watch what Streeting has to say by pushing watch live at the top of the page.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting starts by praising the Labour government's actions to "fix our broken NHS".

He lists several accomplishments, including delivering two million extra appointments, and "turning the tide" on rising waiting lists. 

"There should be no doubt of the scale of the challenge ahead," he says, adding there is no time or money to waste.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting is speaking in the House of Commons now, after the PM announced NHS England is being abolished and brought "back into democratic control".

Press watch live above to follow along.

In his last remarks before wrapping up this morning's Q&A session, Starmer talks again about the decision to scrap NHS England. 

As a reminder, this is a separate body from the NHS - as our health correspondent Nick Triggle explains. 

Starmer stresses that employees of NHS England are hugely qualified and says the government will not be abandoning anybody as it moves to scrap the body.

But, the PM says, we can't look people who want quicker appointments in the eye and say that we're fearful of taking big decisions.

GB News asks Starmer if it's time to do away with "woke" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes.

DEI programmes aim to boost workers from diverse backgrounds.

In the US, President Donald Trump has ordered the shutdown of all federal DEI initiatives, urging the private sector to follow suit.

Starmer says we must use taxpayer money "wisely" but says the government will not be "slashing its commitment to equality".

He says he's focused on "stripping away what's unnecessary".

By Ben Chu, Policy & Analysis Correspondent

The prime minister said one in eight young people are not in education or work.

This is borne out by the latest Office for National Statistics data which found that between October and December 2024 around 987,000 people, external aged 16 to 24 years in the UK were not in education, employment or training, around 13.4% of the total

This was an increase of 110,000 on the same period in 2023.

However, the ONS said that the Labour Force Survey, on which that estimate was based, has been unreliable due to a falling response rate and should be treated with “caution”.

The Russian military has dislodged remaining Ukrainian forces from the town of Sudzha, the largest settlement taken by Kiev's troops in their incursion into Russia's Kursk Region, the Defense Ministry in Moscow has announced.

The nearby settlements of Melovoy and Podol have also been liberated, the ministry said in a short statement on Thursday.

In the last 24 hours the Ukrainian forces fighting in Kursk Region have lost more than 340 servicemen, two infantry fighting vehicles, three armored personnel carriers and dozens of pieces of other hardware, the ministry said.

Ukraine launched an incursion into the Kursk Region on August 6 last year, in the largest attack on internationally recognized Russian territory since the escalation of hostilities between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022. The Ukrainian advance, involving some 35,000 troops according to Moscow's estimates, was swiftly halted, and the territory under Kiev's control has steadily shrunk since then.

Over the last week the Russian military has made rapid gains near Sudzha, located 9km from the border with Ukraine and had a population of some 5,000 before the incursion. On Tuesday, the Defense Ministry in Moscow announced the liberation of 12 villages in the Kursk Region to the north, east and southeast of the town.



Multiple reports of intense fighting, a dramatic raid through a disused pipeline and a Ukrainian retreat emerged from the town earlier this week. On Wednesday, videos were also published by Telegram channels purporting to show troops unfolding a Russian flag in the town's main square.

According the latest data from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Kiev's losses in the eight months since the launch of its incursion total over 67,100 servicemen killed or injured, 392 tanks, 316 infantry fighting vehicles, 278 armored personnel carriers, and hundreds of other pieces of equipment, including 13 US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers.

Donald Trump has said Vladimir Putin's comments on the US ceasefire plan are "promising" but incomplete - after the Russian president suggested there were "questions" about the proposals.

After hearing Vladimir Putin's layered response to the ceasefire this afternoon, we have now had reaction from Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In his evening statement, the Ukrainian president describes Putin's words as "very predictable" and "very manipulative" and says Russia's president is preparing a rejection of the ceasefire proposal.

"Putin, of course, is afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, he wants to kill Ukrainians," Zelenskyy says.

"That's why they in Moscow are framing the idea of silence with such preconditions that nothing will happen at all or that it will not happen for as long as possible."

He labels Putin's words as "just another Russian manipulation".

Zelenskyy continues by saying Ukraine does not "set conditions that complicate anything" while stating that Russia does.

"As we have always said, the only one who will drag things out, the only one who will be unconstructive, is Russia," he says. 

"They want a war. Putin has stolen years of peace and continues this war - day after day."

Zelenskyy ends by calling for allies to ramp up the pressure on Putin and impose further sanctions.

We can bring you more from Vladimir Putin's news conference earlier, and while much of the attention was on his comments around the ceasefire, he did also address the situation in Kursk.

It follows his visit to the region yesterday while dressed in camouflage after Russia's military continued its advances on the front.

In his news conference, Putin said Russia had trapped the remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the western Kursk region, where they had clung on for more than seven months in one of the war's key battles.

He said the troops were cut off inside the invasion zone, and issued a warning to the Ukrainian forces still in the area. 

"If a physical blockade occurs in the coming days, then no one will be able to leave at all, there will only be two ways - to surrender or die," he said.

Ukraine's incursion into the region last August came as a major surprise, and aimed to divert Russian forces from elsewhere on the frontlines while also taking land to trade for its own captured territory.

But with the support of troops from its ally North Korea, Russian forces have gradually been clawing back the lost ground, heightening the pressure on Ukraine.

You can watch the footage of Putin visiting Kursk in the video below...

Donald Trump has been hosting NATO's secretary general at the White House - but with the world's media assembled in the Oval Office, he took the opportunity to also discuss the ceasefire.

Trump has been increasing the pressure on Vladimir Putin to agree to the proposals, with his envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow for talks right now.

Watch what the US president had to say in the video below....

Vladimir Putin does not expect to give up regions of Ukraine as part of a peace deal, nor does he expect Volodymyr Zelenskyy to remain as Ukraine's president, an expert has told Sky News.

Baroness Catherine Ashton, the former EU high representative for foreign affairs, said this afternoon's news conference with Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, was "really interesting".

She told our presenter Kamali Melbourne that Putin "says he supports the idea of a ceasefire".

What follows, though, is a "whole series of details".

These include: "Who monitors the ceasefire, how will we know when it's being violated, what happens if it is, does it lead on to talks for peace, what does that look like, and who's in the room?"

There is also the issue of Russia "making sure it's in the best possible position".

Such matters will lead to "very difficult conversations, I think, for the American envoy to have this evening", Ashton commented.

The negotiation is being set up as "Russia and America decides", she said.

Putin "expects that Zelenskyy won't be there" afterwards.

"He expects that he will not be returning parts of Ukraine to Ukraine." 

Our security and defence analyst Michael Clarke says Vladimir Putin's response to the ceasefire comes as no surprise.

"This is the way the Russians always do things and they think they are doing very well in the war and are actually now in control of the diplomacy of this," he said.

Clarke explained that the main question is over how far Russia can push Donald Trump.

"The danger for Europe is that Trump will be so anxious for a deal that he will press the Ukrainians on all sorts of really important things," he said.

"The Americans have now demonstrated through the use of intelligence, turning it off and back on again, they know they have got a tap, they could turn up the pressure or turn down the pressure," Clarke said.

He added that this left Ukraine in a "very difficult" situation.

As we've been reporting, Vladimir Putin has given his first response to the ceasefire, but his answer wasn't exactly definitive.

While he said Russia agrees with the proposal, he indicated its position is based on the assumption that it would lead to "long-term peace" and "something that would remove the initial reasons for the crisis".

Watch what he had to say when asked about the ceasefire in the video below...

While it is perhaps more tangentially related to the war in Ukraine, Trump has given some new remarks on another recurring topic of his presidency - expressing confidence that the United States will annex Greenland.

"I think that will happen," he told reporters during the meeting in the Oval Office.

"I didn't give it much thought before, but I'm sitting with a man that could be very instrumental [NATO chief Mark Rutte].

"You know, Mark, you need that for international security, not just security.

"It's really a very appropriate question, thank you."

Greenland's pro-business opposition Demokraatit party, which wants a slow approach to independence from Denmark, won Tuesday's parliamentary election. Trump said that election was good for the US - although his latest comments are unlikely to go down well in Denmark, which has repeatedly said Greenland is not for sale. 

By Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent

Vladimir Putin was never going to flat out reject the US proposal for a ceasefire, but he also wasn't going to fully endorse it either. Russia's agreement, as expected, comes with several strings attached.

The Kremlin leader didn't specify Moscow's demands but he did allude to them by saying that any peace deal had to eliminate the "root causes" of the conflict. 

It's become a frequent refrain of his, and shows that Moscow's maximalist position hasn't changed. By "root causes", the Russian president is referring to NATO's eastward expansion, which he blames as the catalyst for the war in Ukraine.

It's a very clear indication that his agreement to a ceasefire relies on getting some kind of security guarantees of his own, eg a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO, or that there'll never be any European peacekeeping forces from NATO members based in the country in the future.

He also articulated why Moscow is reluctant to agree to an immediate truce, talking at length about his forces' advances in the Kursk region. 

Ukraine's incursion there has been humiliating for the Kremlin, but their expulsion is finally within reach. Vladimir Putin doesn't want that opportunity to slip away. By pausing Russia's offensive, he fears they'll lose the advantage and give the enemy time to regroup.

Vladimir Putin was, however, careful to thank Donald Trump for his efforts in trying to reach a peace agreement, perhaps wary of any backlash from the White House. But despite that, he still doesn't appear to be showing any sign of compromise.

So in many ways, it feels like nothing has changed.

We are now seeing some comments from Donald Trump in his news conference with Mark Rutte that indicate a potentially significant change of tone on NATO.

As mentioned in our previous post, the US president has praised NATO's secretary general for doing "some really good work", and has also told reporters NATO "is stepping up".

Both before and since his election, Trump has repeatedly criticised NATO countries for not meeting the current member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defence - and said they should pay even more.

He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts a burden on the US.

While his recent public pronouncements on the alliance have been heavily critical, leaders of fellow member countries will be hopeful his remarks today represent a shift in the White House's stance.

Trump also told reporters that he noticed "very few people were paying" when he first went to NATO, adding that if they were, they were not paying their "fair share".

He says he was able to raise "hundreds of billions of dollars... the money started pouring in" and claims the alliance became much stronger because of his actions.

Meanwhile, Rutte has urged NATO to produce more weapons, stating the alliance is not doing enough and is lagging behind Russia and China.

Donald Trump has taken his seat in the Oval Office alongside NATO's secretary general Mark Rutte - with the US president using the opportunity to update the media on the ceasefire proposal.

He tells reporters that his envoy Steve Witkoff is in serious discussions in Russia - Witkoff is expected to meet Vladimir Putin shortly.

"Hopefully Russia will do the right thing," he says, repeating that he would like to see a ceasefire from Russia.

He tells reporters that a peace deal "shouldn't be very complicated" and urges all parties to get the process over with quickly.

Trump: Putin's statement 'wasn't complete'

Trump also addressed Putin's news conference with ally and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

He says the Russian president put out a promising statement, but insists it was not complete, and reiterated he is willing to talk to Putin about the ceasefire proposal.

The US president has also broken away from his high-profile criticism of NATO and praised Rutte for his role, saying he has been doing "some really good work".

The administration of US president Donald Trump continues to introduce polices that strip the government's support of US science, as Peter Gwynne reports

Two months into Donald Trump's second presidency and many parts of US science – across government, academia, and industry – continue to be hit hard by the new administration's policies. Science-related government agencies are seeing budgets and staff cut, especially in programmes linked to climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is also causing havoc as it seeks to slash spending.

In mid-February, DOGE fired more than 300 employees at the National Nuclear Safety Administration, which is part of the US Department of Energy, many of whom were responsible for reassembling nuclear warheads at the Pantex plant in Texas. A day later, the agency was forced to rescind all but 28 of the sackings amid concerns that their absence could jeopardise national security. 

A judge has also reinstated workers who were laid off at the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The judge said the government's Office of Personnel Management, which sacked the staff, did not have the authority to do so. However, the NSF rehiring applies mainly to military veterans and staff with disabilities, with the overall workforce down by about 140 people – or roughly 10%.

The NSF has also announced a reduction, the size of which is unknown, in its Research Experiences for Undergraduates programme. Over the last 38 years, the initiative has given thousands of college students – many with backgrounds that are underrepresented in science – the opportunity to carry out original research at  institutions during the summer holidays. NSF staff are also reviewing thousands of grants containing such words as “women” and “diversity”.

NASA, meanwhile, is to shut its office of technology, policy and strategy, along with its chief-scientist office, and the DEI and accessibility branch of its diversity and equal opportunity office. “I know this news is difficult and may affect us all differently,” admitted acting administrator Janet Petro in an all-staff e-mail. Affecting about 20 staff, the move is on top of plans to reduce NASA's overall workforce. Reports also suggest that NASA's science budget could be slashed by as much as 50%.

Hundreds of “probationary employees” have also been sacked by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which provides weather forecasts that are vital for farmers and people in areas threatened by tornadoes and hurricanes. “If there were to be large staffing reductions at NOAA there will be people who die in extreme weather events and weather-related disasters who would not have otherwise,” warns climate scientist Daniel Swain from the University of California, Los Angeles.

In his first cabinet meeting on 26 February, Trump suggested that officials “use scalpels” when trimming their departments' spending and personnel – rather than Musk's figurative chainsaw. But bosses at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) still plan to cut its budget by about two-thirds. “[W]e fear that such cuts would render the agency incapable of protecting Americans from grave threats in our air, water, and land,” wrote former EPA administrators William Reilly, Christine Todd Whitman and Gina McCarthy in the New York Times.

The White House's attack on climate science goes beyond just the EPA. In January, the US Department of Agriculture removed almost all data on climate change from its website. The action resulted in a lawsuit in March from the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York and two non-profit organizations – the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group. They say that the removal hinders research and “agricultural decisions”.

The Trump administration has also barred NASA's now former chief scientist Katherine Calvin and members of the State Department from travelling to China for a planning meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Meanwhile, in a speech to African energy ministers in Washington on 7 March, US energy secretary Chris Wright claimed that coal has “transformed our world and made it better”, adding that climate change, while real, is not on his list of the world's top 10 problems. “We've had years of Western countries shamelessly saying ‘don't develop coal',” he said. “That's just nonsense.”

US science in chaos as impact of Trump's executive orders sinks in




US science in chaos as impact of Trump's executive orders sinks in

At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), staff are being told to cancel hundreds of research grants that involve DEI and transgender issues. The Trump administration also wants to cut the allowance for indirect costs of NIH's and other agencies' research grants to 15% of research contracts, although a district court judge has put that move on hold pending further legal arguments. On 8 March, the Trump administration also threatened to cancel $400m in funding to Columbia purportedly due to its failure to tackle anti-semitism on the campus.

A Trump policy of removing “undocumented aliens” continues to alarm universities that have overseas students. Some institutions have already advised overseas students against travelling abroad during holidays, in case immigration officers do not let them back in when they return. Others warn that their international students should carry their immigration documents with them at all times. Universities have also started to rein in spending with Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, implementing a hiring freeze.

Amid the turmoil, the US scientific community is beginning to fight back. Individual scientists have supported court cases that have overturned sackings at government agencies, while a letter to Congress signed by the Union of Concerned Scientists and 48 scientific societies asserts that the administration has “already caused significant harm to American science”. On 7 March, more than 30 US cities also hosted “Stand Up for Science” rallies attended by thousands of demonstrators.

Elsewhere, a group of government, academic and industry leaders – known collectively as Vision for American Science and Technology – has released a report warning that the US could fall behind China and other competitors in science and technology. Entitled Unleashing American Potential, it calls for increased public and private investment in science to maintain US leadership. “The more dollars we put in from the feds, the more investment comes in from industry, and we get job growth, we get economic success, and we get national security out of it,” notes Sudip Parikh, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, who was involved in the report.

Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, meanwhile, has called on the community to continue to highlight the benefit of science. “We need to underscore the fact that stable federal funding of research is the main mode by which radical new discoveries have come to light – discoveries that have enabled the age of quantum computing and AI and new materials science,” she said. “These are areas that I am sure are very important to this administration as well.”

Weldon marks at least the third speed bump the Trump administration hit in its confirmation process after two nominees, former Rep. Matt Gaetz and Chad Chronister, withdrew.

Trump Pulls CDC Nominee: What to Know

Brendan Farrington|AP-File

Former Congressman Dr. David Weldon, May 31, 2012, in The Villages, Fla.




The Trump administration pulled its nomination of Dave Weldon to lead the CDC shortly before his confirmation hearing. 
Weldon, a close ally of RFK Jr., would have faced questioning over his past stances on vaccines. 
Weldon's withdrawal comes as the agency faces growing criticism over its response to a measles outbreak in New Mexico and West Texas.


























The Trump administration did an about-face on Thursday, pulling its nomination of Dave Weldon to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shortly before his confirmation hearing.

The White House reportedly concluded that Weldon, a former member of Congress from Florida and a vaccine critic, did not have the votes to gain confirmation.

Weldon marks at least the third speed bump the Trump administration hit during a confirmation process for its nominees that has otherwise gone relatively smoothly. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew himself for the role of attorney general, and Chad Chronister withdrew his nomination to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Despite holding a very narrow 53-47 margin in the upper chamber, Republicans have maintained enough unity to successfully approve President Donald Trump's slate of picks so far.

Aneeta Mathur-Ashton March 13, 2025



Trump announced his pick of Weldon in November, saying he would “proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!”

Weldon has been a close ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his mission to “Make America Healthy Again.” Kennedy, who was one of Trump's most controversial nominees, faced some hurdles during the confirmation process but ultimately squeaked through his confirmation vote.

Weldon said in a statement obtained by CBS News that a White House official told him “there were not enough votes to get me confirmed.” Axios first reported the decision to withdraw the nomination.

Weldon said that Kennedy was “very upset” about the decision and said he was the “perfect person” for the job.

"Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers,” Weldon said.

Weldon was sure to face tough questions about his previous support for anti-vaccine theories during his confirmation hearing. Some Republicans, including Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, gave Trump's picks to lead other health-related agencies a shakedown during their hearings, and Weldon was likely to be put in a similar situation.

OPINION: 



Two Republicans, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, reportedly expressed reservations about Weldon's nomination.

The concerns likely stemmed from some of Weldon's past stances on vaccines. While serving in Congress for 14 years, Weldon, who was also an internal medicine doctor, supported a bill to ban mercury from vaccines. He was targeting a mercury-based preservative the CDC says has “no evidence of harm” in low doses and was also removed from childhood vaccines years prior to the introduction of his bill.

He argued in 2007 that “parents should not be forced to choose between the risk of the mercury containing preservative thimerosal – whether real or perceived and the risk of contracting influenza.”

Like Kennedy, Weldon has also promoted the debunked link between vaccines and autism, which the CDC is preparing to study at the request of Trump administration officials.

Weldon's withdrawal comes as the agency faces growing criticism over its response to a measles outbreak in New Mexico and West Texas that has killed two people and resulted in more than 250 cases as of March 11.

Nationwide, measles cases have been reported in 10 other states, including Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington as of March 6, according to the CDC.

Kennedy, a longtime critic of vaccines, has expressed the importance of measles vaccinations in light of the outbreak but has said the decision to get vaccinated is a personal choice.

Kennedy has also taken a number of actions that have raised concern among some public health experts, including announcing plans for the CDC to reopen research into long debunked claims of a link between vaccines and autism, the canceling or postponing of scheduled meetings of vaccine advisory groups, as well as promoting the use of vitamin A as a treatment for measles – something the CDC recently added to its guidance for management of the virus.

Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director for the American Public Health Association, says Kennedy's actions are helping to sow confusion and mistrust of vaccines.

Steven Ross JohnsonFeb. 19, 2025



“He gives the public a confusing message,” says Benjamin. “I think he does not believe in vaccines and he's trying to find ways to articulate his anti-vaccine views.”

Benjamin says he believes the current measles outbreak probably played a part in the White House decision to withdraw Weldon's nomination, adding that his past anti-vaccine views would have likely made it difficult for lawmakers to vote for his confirmation.

“I don't know how members of Congress would have voted, but I believe it would have been very difficult for the Republican members of Congress – who, in my mind, held their breath and voted for Kennedy – to do it again,” Benjamin says.

For the CDC, the withdrawal of Weldon's nomination means the agency will continue to operate for now under the leadership of Principal Deputy Director Susan Monarez, who has served as acting director since late January.

The role of CDC director had been until recently one that did not need Senate confirmation. But the position took on the new requirement in 2025 after the passage of a 2023 omnibus bill that included a GOP-backed provision stating that the CDC director “shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.”

Benjamin says whoever the White House picks next to lead the CDC will not only face a number of public health challenges but also internal ones. The agency is contending with the aftermath of mass layoffs in February that saw more than 700 of its 13,000 employees lose their jobs as part of the Trump administration's initiative to streamline the federal workforce. Recent reports indicate about 180 CDC staffers who were previously laid off were recently offered their jobs back.

Benjamin says the lack of a permanent head of the CDC only adds to the overall disruption the agency is experiencing, which he feels has led to disruptions in how it functions and hindered its ability to rapidly respond to health emergencies, like the measles outbreak.

“We are behind on this outbreak, we are chasing this outbreak, and I believe the federal engagement was later than it should have been,” Benjamin says. “So, we really do need to have someone in that job. But I do think, in light of all that's going on, it is most important to get the right person in that job.”

Administrator Lee Zeldin promised ‘historic' deregulation at the EPA with sweeping changes to rules governing power plants, the oil and gas industry and more.

EPA Rollbacks: What to Know

Andrew Harnik|Getty Images

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin attends a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Feb. 26, 2025 in Washington, DC.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it would take “31 historic actions in the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.” The actions include loosening regulations on power plants and the oil and gas industry, reducing restrictions on emissions reporting and reconsidering wastewater regulations for coal plants.

The deregulation is an effort to fulfill President Donald Trump's promise to roll back environmental regulations, which he believes will lower the cost of living for Americans. In a video posted to social media announcing the actions, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin focused on the auto industry and the economy, but said nothing about protecting the environment or human health – the EPA's main mission.

“EPA will be reconsidering many suffocating rules that restrict nearly every sector of our economy and cost Americans trillions of dollars,” he said. “Our actions will lower the cost of living by making it more affordable to purchase a car, heat your home and operate a small business.”



Associated PressMarch 12, 2025



Here's a look at what to know, so far, about the EPA's plans:

The agency's mission is to protect human health and the environment by regulating pollution, ensuring clean air and water, and managing hazardous waste. Established in 1970, the EPA also researches climate change, oversees chemical safety, and cleans up contaminated sites.

The EPA does not make laws, rather, it enforces environmental laws passed by Congress. The agency creates regulations based on these laws, sets specific rules and standards for businesses, industries and the public to follow.

Some of the most notable laws that the EPA enforces include the Clean Air Act, which regulates air pollution to improve air quality and limit harmful emissions from industries and vehicles, the Clean Water Act, which protects the nation's water by regulating pollution in rivers, lakes and streams, and the Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures clean and safe drinking water by setting water quality standards.

The announcement did not include specific changes, but instead listed regulations that will receive “reconsideration.” The rules getting a closer look include regulations on power plants, the oil and gas industry, mercury and air toxin standards, wastewater regulations for coal power plants, among others. The EPA will also redirect its enforcement resources “to relieve the economy of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens that drive up costs for American consumers.”

“Critics may claim that these changes signal a retreat from environmental protection. Nothing could be further from the truth,” Zeldin wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. “Under the Trump administration, the EPA's core mission remains safeguarding human health and the environment. The difference lies in how we achieve these goals – through partnership rather than prescriptive bureaucracy, through collaboration rather than regulation.”

READ: 



Generally, Republican legislators are in support of deregulation at the EPA, while Democrats are opposed.

Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, or West Virginia, chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, applauded the EPA's moves toward deregulation.

“The action taken by the Trump EPA today is exactly what needs to be done to secure American energy dominance and restore the communities who have been negatively impacted by regulations and overreach from the Biden administration,” she said. “Today's action begins the process of rolling back the most harmful, anti-energy regulations of the past four years that have impaired our electric reliability.”

Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the announcement was a victory for the biggest polluters at the expense of public health and climate science.

“Today is the day Trump's Big Oil megadonors paid for,” he said. “EPA's attacks today on clean air, clean water, and affordable energy are done for the planet's biggest polluters. Americans will pay dearly—with their health and with their wallets.”

Apprehensions between ports of entry along the southern border have fallen sharply since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.

Tracking Illegal Border Crossings

John Moore|Getty Images

A child's shoe hangs on razor wire along the Rio Grande on Jan. 9, 2024, in Eagle Pass, Texas. 

The 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border has become the center of a political quagmire in recent years, with immigration regularly tracking as one of the most polarizing subjects in American discourse.

President Donald Trump and his policies sit squarely at the center of these tensions: Illegal immigration has been one of the president's favorite subjects to talk about since the start of his first successful White House campaign in 2015, and has become entwined with his approach to areas including crime, trade and foreign policy. Upon his return to the Oval Office in January, Trump took a number of actions aimed at stopping what he's often called an “invasion” at the southern border, after attempted crossings rose to very high levels under former President Joe Biden.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection describes these crossing attempts as “encounters,” essentially meaning recorded events involving migrants and agency officials. Within that broad designation are two currently applicable categories:



Elliott Davis Jr.March 12, 2025



Apprehensions don't always lead to an arrest, as noted by USAFacts, and could involve an asylum claim where migrants have the right to ask for protection due to fear of persecution or harm in their home country. Trump, however, effectively halted asylum access on Day One of his second term.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection typically releases encounters data around the middle of each month, and the publication covers the previous month's worth of figures. U.S. News is tracking monthly apprehensions by the Border Patrol at the southwest border to provide context behind the numbers and the rhetoric that usually surrounds them.



Border Patrol apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border fell by 71% from January to February.

Trump's first full month in office featured a precipitously steep decline in illegal crossings, with only about 8,000 apprehensions logged between ports of entry. Pete Flores, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement that his team “achieved historic lows” that month.

“The Invasion of our Country is OVER,” the president wrote in a social media post referencing the February numbers prior to their official release. As of March 13, his proclamation declaring a border invasion and barring “aliens engaged in the invasion” from entry remained in effect.

READ: 



Border Patrol apprehensions at the southwest border fell by 39% from December to January.

The Trump administration was quick to highlight and take credit for the decrease, though activity at the southern border had been much quieter for several months, starting after Biden issued an executive order last summer that severely limited asylum access. Trump was also only in office for the last third of January.

Still, the number of illegal crossings did fall more sharply after he returned to the Oval Office, and experts told U.S. News that Trump's moves to restrict asylum access certainly contributed to the decline.

BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) — Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guard member who caused an international uproar when he leaked highly classified documents about the war in Ukraine, pleaded guilty to military charges of obstructing justice at his court-martial Thursday and called himself a “proud patriot.” 

In a 10-minute address, Teixeira said he was “exposing and correcting the lies that were perpetrated by President Biden and force-fed to the American people” about the war in Ukraine. 

“I believe the Department of Justice was politicized against President Trump and myself,” added Teixeira, who said he acted alone when he shared the documents in a geopolitical chatroom on Discord, a social media platform popular with online gamers. He called on Trump and members of his administration to reverse his convictions.

“If I saved one American, Russian or Ukrainian life in this money-grabbing war, my punishment was worth it,” he said.

The judge agreed to the plea deal, which calls for dishonorable discharge and no jail time.

Teixeira was already sentenced last year to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty in federal court to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act, following his arrest in the most consequential national security breach in years.

Military prosecutors said before the court-martial at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts that charges of disobeying orders and obstructing justice were appropriate given that obeying orders is the “absolute core” of the military. 




Teixeira's lawyer, Lt. Col. Bradley Poronsky, argued Monday that the obstructing justice charge should either be dismissed or go unpunished, saying it amounts to double jeopardy because it already factored into Teixeira's November sentencing. 

A plea agreement was accepted by both sides that drops the disobeying orders charge. Teixeira pleaded guilty to the obstruction charge, admitting that he used a hammer to destroy a cellphone, a computer hard drive and an iPad after seeing some news reports of the leaked documents. He also admitted to telling his friend to destroy messages exchanged on a communication app. 

“I was scared about a potential law enforcement investigation into me and my friends,” he said in court Thursday. 

As the sentencing phase began, Teixeira's parents said he took an early interest in the military as a child. His father, also named Jack Teixeira, described him as “a good kid, energetic, intelligent, and quirky.” 

When his son decided to join the military, “I was excited about it,” the elder Teixeira said. ”It was a good option for Jack.” He said it gave him direction and the chance to see the world. 

“He made a mistake,” his mother, Dawn Dufault, said. “Everyone makes mistakes. He's my son, I love him. He deserves a second chance.” 

The leaks exposed to the world unvarnished secret assessments of Russia's war in Ukraine, including information about troop movements in Ukraine, and the provision of supplies and equipment to Ukrainian troops. The leaked documents also revealed assessments of the defense capabilities of Taiwan and internal arguments in Britain, Egypt, Israel, South Korea and Japan. Teixeira also admitted to posting information about a U.S. adversary's plans to harm U.S. forces serving overseas.

Teixeira worked as an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks. His lawyers described Teixeira as an autistic, isolated individual who spent most of his time online, especially with his Discord community, and never meant to harm the U.S.

U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee for ambassador to Canada on Thursday reaffirmed the importance of the U.S.-Canada relationship and Canadian sovereignty, despite escalating attacks from the White House.

Pete Hoekstra said during his confirmation hearing in front of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Canada remains an important ally on intelligence and national security issues, which can be maintained and strengthened while addressing matters around trade.

Yet senators voiced concern about Trump's repeated calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state, which the president has said he will use “economic force” to achieve.

“Canada is a sovereign state,” Hoekstra said.

He appeared to attribute Trump's rhetoric to the frosty relationship he has with outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who marked his final day in office on Thursday. Liberal Leader Mark Carney will be sworn in as prime minister on Friday.

Hoekstra agreed with Democrat Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who suggested the arrival of a new prime minister offered an opportunity for a “reset” of the relationship.

Trump has antagonized Canadians by repeatedly suggesting the country would be “better off” as a U.S state, pointing to grievances in trade and military spending.

He repeated his annexation threat Thursday in the Oval Office alongside NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, calling the Canada-U.S. border an “artificial line” and mused about the “visual” appeal of combining the two nations.

Escalating rounds of tariffs on Canadian goods that began early this month sparked a trade war that has further damaged relations. Carney has said Trump's actions have broken Canada's “trust” in its top trading partner, and the government has sought to diversify its trade away from the U.S. in response.

The relationship was due to be addressed during a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers in Quebec on Thursday. Ontario Premier Doug Ford and federal officials were also in Washington to meet with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about the path forward on tariffs and trade.

Hoekstra, a former Michigan congressman and state Republican official who previously served as U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands during Trump's first term, said he expects to be the “tip of the spear” for the new Trump administration in Canada.

He equated the situation to his experience pushing the Dutch government to meet its NATO obligations and help the U.S. confront Russia on energy.

“There was a lot of hostility or concern about some of the objectives of the first Trump administration, which were really about fairness,” he said. “What we really spent a tremendous amount of time on was focusing on the strength of the relationship between our two countries.

“We have a great history of working together (with Canada). We know how to make this work. We now have to take that and say, ‘We know how to make this work, now let's do it and apply our experience to the priorities the president has outlined: freer, fairer trade so we can actually grow the business relationship between Canada and the U.S.”

Trump and Lutnick have said their tariff policies are intended to drive investment and manufacturing back to the U.S., with little regard for their impact on Canadian industries like the auto sector.

Nearly all of the questions to Hoekstra, who appeared alongside Trump's nominees for ambassadors to Mexico and Japan, were posed by Democrats on the committee who highlighted the fraying relations with Canada.

Some of those senators vowed to work with Hoekstra to push Canada to increase its defence spending and fulfill its NATO commitments, a longstanding irritant for U.S. lawmakers in both parties.

“We have a great alliance with Canada on national security issues,” Hoekstra said. “It would help if Canada met its NATO commitment. They're one of eight or nine countries that fall short, significantly short, with no real plan to get there anytime soon.”

The federal government has said it has a “clear and credible” path to reach the NATO target of spending at least two per cent of GDP on defence by 2032 or earlier, but has not released details on how that will be achieved.

Republicans focused on the other two nominees, pressing them on border security with Mexico and the importance of countering China in the Indo-Pacific.

Republicans in Congress have largely either ignored Trump's comments about annexing Canada or have sometimes openly supported them. The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee in January posted a New York Post cover that called Trump's “vision for the hemisphere” — including making Canada the 51st state — “The Trump Doctrine,” and celebrated Trump's “big dreams” for America.

Hoesktra said the U.S. wants to see the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship expanded to include law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, in order to not just crack down on fentanyl smuggling but other cross-border threats.

“It's not a huge amount (of fentanyl) that goes across our border from Canada, but … tomorrow it could be something else,” he said.

“If confirmed I will do everything I can to strengthen that relationship on Five Eyes, law enforcement cooperation, trade — those are all opportunities to make Canada and America safer, secure, and more prosperous. Closer cooperation.”

Trump has justified the 25 per cent tariffs he imposed on Canada and Mexico on March 4 as a way to pressure both countries to increase efforts to stop fentanyl flowing into the U.S.

Less than one per cent of fentanyl that enters the U.S. comes from Canada, with less than 20 kilograms seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection last year. January saw agents encounter just 13 grams of the deadly opioid, the lowest level in two years and down from a record high in monthly seizures last summer.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the committee, pointed out more drugs are encountered flowing north from the U.S. to Canada than what American border agents seize coming from Canada.

“Let's be honest about what's happening here,” she said.

Hoekstra also acknowledged concerns raised by Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland that tariffs on Canadian goods like lumber will make homebuilding in the U.S., which is facing a housing shortage in several cities, more expensive.

“It's not brain surgery,” he said with a chuckle.

President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia was excluded from high-level talks on ending the war after the Kremlin said it didn't want him there, a U.S. administration official and a Russian official tell NBC News.  

Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg was conspicuously absent from two recent summits in Saudi Arabia — one with Russian officials and the other with Ukrainians — even though the talks come under his remit. 

“Together,” Trump said when announcing Kellogg's nomination in November, “we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.” 

But Kellogg did not attend U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, on Feb. 18. Russian President Vladimir Putin thought he was too pro-Ukraine, a senior Russian official with direct knowledge of the Kremlin's thinking told NBC News.   

“Kellogg is a former American general, too close to Ukraine. Not our kind of person, not of the caliber we are looking for,” according to the official, who is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.  

A U.S. official  in the Trump administration, who is also not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed to NBC News that Russia didn't want Kellogg involved. The official did not know when this was communicated to the White House. 

Where this leaves Kellogg is unclear. 

Kellogg's office did not respond to requests for comment on why he has not been involved in the negotiations and whether Russia had requested that he not attend. 

National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt said that Trump had “utilized the talents of multiple senior administration officials to assist in the bringing the war in Ukraine to a peaceful resolution.” He added that Kellogg remained “a valued part of the team, especially as it relates to talks with our European allies.”

Kellogg, 80, is a staunch Trump loyalist who served in various roles in the president's first term, including a stint as then-Vice President Mike Pence's national security adviser.  

Before being confirmed Trump's envoy for Russia-Ukraine peace in January, he wrote about what he called the Biden administration's “incompetent” foreign policies. 

In a paper for the America First Policy Institute, which was founded to promote Trump's policies, he suggested that to end the war the U.S. should arm Ukraine and strengthen its defenses, thus ensuring that “Russia will make no further advances and will not attack again after a cease-fire or peace agreement.” 

“Future American military aid, however, will require Ukraine to participate in peace talks with Russia,” Kellogg and his co-author, Fred Fleit, wrote. 

During his presidential campaign, Trump said it was a top priority to end the war, which started in February 2022 when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbor, and that he would halt hostilities “24 hours” after taking office.  

The war has raged on after Trump became president for a second time, with Russia making slow progress on the battlefield in Ukraine and pressing Ukrainian forces that had taken a sliver of Russian territory across the border in Kursk. 

On Feb. 11, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, went to Moscow and spent three-and-a-half hours with Putin.  

There is no official account of their meeting. Witkoff had traveled to Russia to help secure the release of Marc Fogel, an American teacher held for three and a half years for a minor medical cannabis infraction.  

In a CBS News interview, Witkoff, a New York real estate developer and a friend of Trump's, called his hours-long meeting with Putin a “trust building” assignment from the American president. He said he was the only U.S. official present at the meeting and carried a message for Putin from Trump. Witkoff also said the Russian leader “had something for me to transmit back to the president,” but did not say what that was.  

The following day, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had spoken with Putin and they had “agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.”  

“We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other's Nations,” he added.  

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later said that during the 90-minute call Putin had “expressed readiness to receive American officials in Russia regarding areas of mutual interest, including, of course, the topic of Ukrainian settlement.” 

On Feb. 13, Trump announced a list of diplomats who would attend the talks with Russia. Witkoff, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and national security adviser Michael Waltz were on the team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio 

Kellogg was not on the list. A second U.S. official told NBC News  at the time that the decision stung him.  

A representative for Witkoff would not comment when NBC News asked whether his boss discussed Kellogg's exclusion with Putin.

When asked last week whether Russian officials had requested Kellogg not be included in the high-level talks, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it was up to American leaders to “fix their delegation” and her country's diplomats had “great experience of dealing with different envoys.” 

Andrei Fedorov, Russia's former deputy foreign minister who maintains close ties with the Kremlin, went further, telling NBC News that Kellogg was “not the person with whom Russia will negotiate with” because his position on the talks was to freeze the front line in Ukraine.  

Russia wants Kyiv's forces to withdraw from Ukrainian regions where there is still fighting, including the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia administrative regions known as oblasts, Fedorov, said.  

Russia illegally annexed the regions, along with Donetsk and Luhansk, in September 2022. 

Little was said about the war in Ukraine after Rubio and his team met with Russian officials in Riyadh, on Feb. 18, although the secretary of state did announce that the countries had agreed to restore embassy staffing.  

Trump has since played hardball with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with relations reaching a low point after their extraordinary Oval Office spat on Feb. 28. The U.S. subsequently put a pause on intelligence sharing and providing security assistance to Ukraine. 

This was lifted on Tuesday after a Ukrainian delegation agreed to a proposal for a 30-day interim ceasefire at a meeting in Saudi Arabia with Rubio and his team 

Kellogg was not present.    

On Thursday, Trump dispatched Witkoff to Russia again. 

Shortly after his arrival, Putin told a news conference that he agreed “with the proposals to stop the hostilities,” but there were issues that needed to be discussed. He added that he may need to “have a phone call with Trump.”

WASHINGTON — The White House has directed the U.S. military to draw up options for increasing the American troop presence in Panama to achieve President Trump's goal of “reclaiming” the Panama Canal, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.

During a joint address to Congress last week, Trump said, "to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal.” Since then, administration officials have not said what "reclaiming" means.

U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans that vary from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the U.S. 

The Trump administration's goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China's influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. 

Both Panama and China deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama's Constitution. Chinese officials have accused the U.S. of using "coercion" to pressure Panamanian officials to block Chinese aid projects.

The U.S. officials told NBC News that the commander of U.S. Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey, presented draft strategies to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week. Hegseth is expected to visit Panama next month.

The officials cautioned that a U.S. invasion of Panama is unlikely and would only come under serious consideration if a larger American military presence in Panama does not achieve President Donald Trump's goal of reclaiming the waterway, the officials said.

Neither the Pentagon nor the Panamanian Embassy in Washington  immediately responded to a request for comment. 

Trump has said he intends to return ownership of the canal to the U.S. after Panama gained control of the area more than a quarter century ago under a treaty signed by the Carter administration. 

Privately, Trump has told his advisers that he sees a U.S. military presence in Panama and on the canal itself as critical to that effort, the U.S. officials said. Trump has also made it clear that he wants U.S. service members to be visible in the canal zone as a show of force.

Trump administration officials have argued that China has too large a presence near the canal. In the event of a conflict, they say, Beijing could shut down the canal to American shipping, including military ships. 

During a visit to Panama last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio  told Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino that “the status quo is unacceptable” regarding China's presence in Panama. Mulino said the Panamanian government alone administers the canal and denied ceding operation of the canal to China in any way. 

After Panama declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with China, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said the projects were part of Beijing's Belt and Road development initiative and that China “firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.”

Last year, now retired Gen. Laura Richardson, then the commander of United States Southern Command, said in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee that China is "playing the long game." Richardson warned that Chinese government-backed economic development projects are "dual-use sites and facilities" that can be quickly flipped and used for military purposes. 

"The PRC messages its investments as peaceful, but in fact, many serve as points of future multi-domain access for the PLA and strategic naval chokepoints," she said, referring to the People's Republic of China and the People's Liberation Army. "In Panama, PRC-controlled State-Owned Enterprises, SOEs, continue to bid on projects related to the Panama Canal — a global strategic chokepoint.”

The U.S. military currently has more than 200 troops in Panama but the number fluctuates as troops rotate in and out, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Some of those troops include Special Forces units working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats, insurgencies or unrest. 

Potential administration strategies include simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal, to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of the passageway, officials said. Other options under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, to build new ports in Panama or using the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal's locks, officials said. 

There are also discussions about opening Army Jungle Schools, or training camps, in Panama, like the ones U.S. troops trained in jungle warfare until the canal was formally handed over to Panama in 1999.

One other focus of the ongoing planning is potentially positioning U.S. military forces near Panama in the event of a regional war or a threat to the U.S. In that scenario, the U.S. military would aim to secure the Panama Canal and eliminate China's access to the critical waterway. American officials cautioned that the U.S. would only block Chinese transit through the canal in the event of war.

The Panama Canal is one of the world's busiest waterways, with the majority of the cargo that passes through it originating in the U.S. or heading to the U.S. If the Panama Canal were blocked, ships would have to transit around South America, sharply increasing the cost and time of each voyage. 

The U.S. constructed the canal from 1904 to 1914 after a failed French effort. In 1977, after long-running protests by Panamanians, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty that turned control of the canal over to Panama. In 1989, during the George H.W. Bush administration, U.S. forces invaded Panama and ousted the country's leader, Manuel Noriega, who was later convicted of drug trafficking. 

In his joint address to Congress last week, Trump said that the U.S. was already moving to limit Chinese presence in the canal. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.”

The U.S. investment company BlackRock is part of a group buying a 90% stake in the Panama Ports Company, which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal. The stake is being purchased from a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchinson, for $22.8 billion.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland

As Democrats in Congress seek to counter President Donald Trump and Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk's agenda, a familiar face is reemerging: Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland.

Raskin, a former lawyer turned politician, played a vital role in the Democratic response to Trump during his first term and rose to national prominence when he served as a floor manager for Trump's second impeachment after the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol.

As the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Raskin is pushing back against the Republican agenda in Washington.

Whether he's protesting in front of the Supreme Court or federal agencies or finding ways to slow the presidential agenda in the courts with the newly-formed rapid response and litigation working group, Raskin is leaning on his political and legal expertise as he faces a rapidly changing landscape.

U.S. News & World Report sat down with Raskin to discuss the ongoing fight in Congress to fund the government, the playbook Democrats are using to combat Trump and what he's leaning on to help guide him.

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.

“It's a horrible choice that the Republicans have presented us with.

“Our position has been that they have majorities, albeit narrow ones, across the government. They have proven that they don't need our votes and don't care about our votes. But in the event that they can't pull together a majority to make it happen, then the way the system works is that they need to sit down with us and have a serious negotiation.

“Speaking for myself, I'm very open to a continuing resolution to keep the government open. But it cannot be based on billions of dollars of more cuts to the domestic budget and it cannot be based on their lawless actions in not living up to congressional enactments and appropriations decisions.”

“Well, you'd have to ask the Republicans who control the House, the Senate and the White House.

“It essentially sends the message that they are acting in extremist and irresponsible ways in Congress, the way that they are acting in extremist and irresponsible ways in the executive branch. Everybody can see the slash and burn tactics that have been adopted by Musk and Trump.”

“I've been a strong champion of D.C. statehood. I was the floor leader for it with [Democratic D.C. Del.] Eleanor Holmes Norton in the 116th and 117th congresses. I believe that tax-paying draftable U.S. citizens have the right to equal representation through statehood. But right now, Republicans want to move in the opposite direction and dismantle even the limited home rule that people in Washington have right now.

“This is clearly up to the people of D.C. and I will support them in whatever they want to do. But they should consider one of their options – coming back to Maryland – because they will find a lot more safety and a lot more equality in the Free State than they will find being directly under the thumb of MAGA tyrants.”

Aneeta Mathur-Ashton March 3, 2025



“Trump and the MAGA movement have been waging a war for the richest Americans against the vast majority of working and middle class people in the country. So part of that kind of top-down class warfare was perfectly predictable. Musk and DOGE have been the wild card factor here.”

“Every new historical epic requires new political strategies. That's just a truism about politics.

“I think that the values that the Democratic Party promotes and that more than 75 million people voted for are as relevant as ever. But we do need to figure out the best strategies of dealing with the new media ecosystem that we are in.

“The legacy media are no longer the mainstream media and most Americans are getting their political information in radically novel ways. So we need to figure out the best way of actually connecting with America through the new media ecosystem.”

“I was a professor of constitutional law for a quarter of a century (at American University's Washington College of Law). I was also a state senator in Maryland but I've always been on the Judiciary Committees.

“My ruling intellectual passion is for constitutional law and the mechanisms of democracy. My ticket has come up in this period because we are in the constitutional fight of our lives.

“I was at the Supreme Court Wednesday addressing the judicial conference. I told all of the judges who were there that the nation is looking to the judicial branch for its muscular defense of our constitutional system against all of the assaults that we are under right now.”

READ: 



“I've definitely learned to make good friends across the aisle. I've had a bunch of good friends from the other side of the aisle including (former Texas Republican Rep.) Lamar Smith and (Colorado Republican Rep.) Lauren Boebert. I'm making friends with (Ohio Republican Rep.) Jim Jordan, who's my counterpart on the Judiciary Committee.

“We should never allow the partisan discord and ideological extremism to interfere with those underlying bonds of affection that Abraham Lincoln talked about.”

“I've learned not to be too shy about making procedural motions in the Senate in a presidential impeachment trial.

“When I was leading the impeachment managers in the second trial of Trump, I wanted to make a motion to have the senators not be seated according to political party, because who had ever heard of a jury that is seated according to party designation.

“I was told by both the Democrats and Republicans that it was not a good idea because the senators were shaken up by Jan. 6, and they all wanted to stay in their individual desks and seats.

“I've always regretted not introducing that motion. I think it might have helped them focus on the fact that they shouldn't be thinking in party terms but simply as jurors rendering impartial justice on behalf of the Constitution.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to "return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives."

The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities. 

"USDA can confirm it has provided notice to States, Territories and Tribes that the FY 2025 funding previously announced for the pandemic-era Local Food for Schools and Child Care Cooperative Agreement and pandemic-era Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement program is no longer available and those agreements will be terminated following 60-day notification," a spokesperson with the agency said in an email to CBS News.

The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.

"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact," a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. 

In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said. 

One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals. 

"It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables," said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. "It wasn't just about keeping food costs low — it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state."

While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs. 

The Local Food for Schools program "was a godsend to us," Bilbrey said. "It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals."

One farmer in Massachusetts told CBS News Boston that she was concerned the funding cut could hurt her business. Katie Carlson, president of Carlson Orchards in Harvard, Massachusetts, said the Worcester Regional Food Hub, which connects school districts with food from local farmers through the USDA program, had been a reliable customer. 

"We know that this time of year we can count on the Worcester Food Hub," Carlson said. "They may not be huge orders every week, but we know that they're coming to take something every week, so if that were to all of a sudden drop off [...] It's just not, not good."

On its current trajectory, the U.S. national debt could soon reach its highest level in 80 years.

What Is the U.S. National Debt?

Bringing the national debt under control or slowing its growth involves various factors.




The U.S. national debt is the accumulation of money borrowed to cover the national deficit over time. 
The highest level of national debt in the last century was right after World War II, while the lowest was in 1974.
Increased spending during the financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and changing demographics have driven national debt higher. 
If unchecked, national debt will reach historic highs by 2029, and continue to balloon thereafter.












































Between Congress working on the budget and discussing changes to the tax code and job cuts taking place across the federal government by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Elon Musk, it's hard to go even one news cycle without hearing about the U.S. national debt.

But what exactly is it? And is the debt really higher than ever? If you're not entirely sure, you're not alone. 

“It's completely understandable that people are confused by it, and there's no reason why they should understand it. It's something the government is supposed to be taking care of,” says Karl Maschino, distinguished service professor of public policy and management at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College.

Here's a crash course on what the national debt is, where it stands now, how it has fluctuated in the last century and what it means for our economy – and your wallet – moving forward.

Maschino says the national debt is often confused with the annual deficit. 

“On an annual basis, the U.S. government spends a certain amount and collects a number of taxes, and ideally, those two numbers would be the same,” he explains. “But we spend more every year than what we collect. The accumulation of that deficit on an annual basis is our national debt," he says.

It becomes debt because when the government spends more than it brings in, it has to borrow money. It does this by issuing bonds and Treasury securities, which other countries buy to give us cash inflow, Maschino says.

The challenge is that the U.S. has to pay interest on its debt, which is increasing yearly. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports that the U.S. paid out $881 billion in interest in 2024 and is projected to pay around $952 billion in interest in 2025. That is more than we spend on our nation's defense.

Sponsored Bank Accounts

Unless changes are made to address the situation, that number is expected to increase significantly, says Maschino, whose previous experience includes roles within the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Justice Department.

Although there is buzz about the national debt being at historic highs, we're not quite there yet. Economists' most common data point for comparison purposes is our debt as a percentage of economic activity or gross domestic product (GDP).

“The federal government's publicly held debt reached its high point – when compared to the size of the economy – right after World War II, and then declined,” says Jeff Arkin, director of strategic issues at the GAO. For context, the debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at 106% in 1945.

Following that high, the debt decreased over time to about one-third the size of the U.S. economy, reaching a low of 23% in 1974. However, major events like the financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the percentage.

“Today, it's about the same size as the economy,” Arkin says, with a projected percentage for 2025 of about 99.9%. according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.

“We're getting close to the historic high in our history,” Maschino says. “People think that's a big deal, but some economists would say it isn't.”

The real issue is what will happen if we stay on our current trajectory, says Arkin. “What is more concerning is that the national debt is projected to increase indefinitely, reaching twice the size of the economy within 25 years,” he says.

Currently, the CBO projects the national debt will reach 118.5% of GDP by 2035.

The question many Americans might have is how all of this affects them at the individual level. ”An increasing national debt could theoretically put pressure on businesses and individuals,” Maschino says. “It could translate to higher interest rates for borrowing. Some say that can result in lower wages.”

The federal government has several strategies for reducing the national debt. It can generate more income (by raising taxes, charging tariffs, etc.) to pay down its debt. It can also try to reduce its annual spending.

While no amount of cutting can wipe out the entire national debt, the administration is trying to get the ball rolling by lowering the deficit – that's where DOGE comes in. 

Right now, the annual budget is roughly $6.75 trillion a year but only $1.75 trillion is discretionary, and that's the portion of the budget we think about all the time, says Maschino. This includes things like defense, transportation, education, government operations, etc. 

“What DOGE is trying to do is reduce our operating costs [in those areas] on an annual basis,” Maschino says.

The other two-thirds of the budget covers mandatory programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and interest on the national debt.

While the administration has promised not to touch entitlement programs (other than identifying fraud, waste and abuse), it is the elephant in the room regarding our long-term ability to reduce the national debt.

 “A big part of that annual deficit is the increasing cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security because of the demographics of our society, and those costs are formulaically driven higher every year,” Maschino says. “So, dealing with the discretionary piece of it is just one part of the problem – but not the larger problem.”

Getting the national debt under control or slowing its growth involves many moving parts. Most economists agree that it's an important issue to address, even if they have different ideas on the best ways to do so.

Regardless of how it plays out, Maschino encourages Americans not to spend too much time stressing over the national debt – at least not yet. 

“We're the world's strongest economy. As long as we're the place where people want to put their money by buying treasuries, which finances our debt, it's not an immediate emergency,” he says. “However, our current fiscal path is unsustainable over time.”

Trump Administration

Follow the latest news about the Trump administration. 

Shutdown threat: The federal government edged closer to a shutdown after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said the stopgap bill to fund the government for six months did not have enough support for a vote in the Senate. He said Democrats in the chamber instead wanted a 30-day bill to negotiate a bipartisan solution. The government's funding is set to run out on Friday, and there is little time to find another path: House Republicans left town after passing the six-month funding bill. Read more ›

New York migrant shelters: The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into the funding and management of New York City hotels operating as shelters for migrants, according to a copy of a federal subpoena sent to a Manhattan hotel. Federal prosecutors sent a subpoena to the Hotel Chandler in Midtown, requesting information related to the migrant shelter program and “a list of full names of aliens currently residing at Hotel Chandler,” including nationality, dates of birth and identification numbers.

Humanities chair resigns: The chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which provides grants to cultural and educational institutions, stepped down at the “direction” of President Trump, an agency spokesman said. The resignation comes as Mr. Trump has sought to put his stamp on federal cultural agencies, most prominently the Kennedy Center. Read more ›

Reporting from the Capitol

Senate Democrats said on Wednesday that they would refuse to back a Republican-written stopgap bill to fund the government through Sept. 30, significantly raising the chances of a government shutdown at the end of the week.

After two days of intense closed-door party meetings, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, emerged to say that members of his party could not support the bill approved by the House on Tuesday to keep most federal funding flowing at current levels for the next six months. He instead urged Republicans to pass a monthlong extension to allow time for Congress to consider individual spending bills and reach a compromise that both parties could accept.

“Our caucus is unified” on such a measure to “keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,” Mr. Schumer said in a brief statement from the floor.

The announcement left congressional leaders without a clear path to avert a shutdown that would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday should Congress fail to act by then to extend federal funding. Senate Republicans would need the support of at least eight Democrats to overcome procedural hurdles and bring a spending measure to a final vote. Just one, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has so far declared he would vote to break any filibuster.

The standoff puts Senate Democrats at risk of being blamed for any shutdown even as they complain about Trump administration disruptions to federal agencies. But they are under pressure from House Democrats and activists to stand against Mr. Trump and Elon Musk as they lead an effort to dismantle broad swaths of the federal bureaucracy, in some cases in direct defiance of Congress, which holds the power of the purse.

With two days left before the shutdown deadline, there is still time for a reversal by Democrats. But most of them have heaped criticism on Republicans' stopgap spending measure, arguing that it would give Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk too much leeway to continue their unilateral efforts to slash government employees and programs.

Republicans, who control both chambers, have shown no willingness to compromise with Democrats on the spending measure. And even if they agreed to, changing the House bill or approving a different one would require the House to return and vote again, which is highly unlikely. Republican leaders deliberately adjourned the chamber on Tuesday night and left town after passing the spending legislation, known as a continuing resolution, to effectively force the Senate to accept it.

The private meetings this week have laid bare a major dilemma for Democrats as they wrestle with how to respond to the Republican legislation. Senators said they had two unappealing alternatives. They could oppose the G.O.P. plan and potentially take the blame for a damaging federal shutdown or surrender to Mr. Trump and incite the wrath of Democrats demanding that their representatives thwart the White House at every turn.

“There are really only two options,” said Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. “One is to vote for a pretty bad C.R., or the other is to vote for a potentially even worse shutdown. It is a very tough choice.”

Even as Mr. Schumer declared his party's opposition, Democrats privately continued to deliberate over a way to avoid a shutdown without appearing to capitulate to Mr. Trump. Some suggested allowing the stopgap spending bill to move forward as long as Republicans agreed to give them a chance to revise it on the Senate floor. That would afford Democrats the chance to make their political case against the measure and show that they were fighting it, even if their proposals for changes ultimately failed.

But as House Democratic leaders gathered for a retreat in Virginia on Wednesday, they pleaded with their Senate counterparts to follow their lead and oppose the government funding bill outright.

Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called the measure “a power grab that further unleashes and entrenches Elon Musk's efforts.” He applauded his caucus for sticking together on Tuesday in voting against it and sending a clear message of repudiation for its policies on the House floor. All but one Democrat opposed the measure in the House.

In the Senate, virtually all Democrats are opposed to the stopgap bill, which cleared the House largely along party lines on Tuesday. They view it as an abdication of congressional power and a woefully inefficient way of funding the government while providing Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk more opportunity to slice into federal agencies. They also noted that it broke from an earlier bipartisan deal on both domestic and military spending.

“Instead of writing a bill that gives our communities what they need, they wrote a bill that turns many of our accounts into slush funds,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. The bill, she added, “gives the final say over what gets funding to two billionaires who don't know the first thing about the needs of our working families.”

She and her fellow Senate Democrats would much prefer to pass the individual spending bills that have been negotiated between the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Appropriations Committees. But House Republicans pulled back from those talks in favor of the decision to freeze most funding through Sept. 30, leaving only two remaining possibilities: blocking the spending bill or approving it.

Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said Democrats should not give in “just because the House decided to leave town on a Tuesday night.”

“That doesn't mean the Senate shouldn't be a deliberative body,” he added.

Despite their opposition to the spending plan, top Democrats are leery of forcing the government into a shutdown, fearing the political blowback after years of castigating Republicans for shutdowns.

In addition, Democrats worried that a shutdown would play into the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk, empowering them to keep hollowing out federal agencies. Democrats also argued that it remained unclear how any shutdown would end once it began. And they conceded that it could undercut their criticism of the Department of Government Efficiency as an out-of-control buzz saw shredding the government, if they were the ones refusing to extend funding for federal agencies.

Republicans were already trying to take advantage of their predicament.

“If I listen to our colleagues across the aisle, they claim to have a lot of concern for the federal workers that depend on government funding,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. “So I find interesting that so many of them in the House cast a vote that would put thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of federal workers out of work.”

Relenting to Republicans was certain to inflame House Democrats and advocacy groups who were demanding that Senate Democrats remain united against the legislation.

More than 150 progressive and environmental groups on Wednesday sent Senate Democratic leaders a letter urging them to “stand strong until Musk and Trump stop their illegal actions to dismantle key federal programs.”

At least one Democrat said causing a shutdown would clear the way for additional harm.

“If any of those groups want to shut the government down, I would disagree with them,” Mr. Fetterman said. “It wasn't that long ago that we were lecturing Republicans who were threatening to shut the government down. Now I think we are in the same situation.”

Democrats have excoriated Republicans, saying they acted irresponsibly in shuttering federal agencies in past funding fights.

Mr. Schumer and his fellow Democrats did prompt a shutdown in 2018 as they sought to win protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. But they capitulated after a brief weekend closure, when lawmakers concluded that the strategy was backfiring and angering the public.

They have sought to make certain they were not blamed in any government funding lapses since then.

A federal judge in Washington reinstated Susan Tsui Grundmann, a Biden appointee, to the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the agency that adjudicates labor disputes between federal employees and management, after President Trump moved to fire her last month. The ruling is the latest setback to President Trump's efforts to purge the federal bureaucracy, and his administration's legal stance that the president may fire almost any official in the executive branch at will.

Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan excoriated the government's legal arguments in her 35-page ruling that they “paint with a broad brush and threaten to upend fundamental protections in our Constitution.” She continued, “But ours is not an autocracy; it is a system of checks and balances.”

Reporting from Washington

The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it had stopped using the largest U.S. operator of shelters for migrant children over allegations of sexual abuse and harassment of minors at the facilities, and moved to dismiss a Biden-era lawsuit that sought to hold the nonprofit accountable for enabling that abuse.

A joint statement issued by the Health and Human Services and Justice Departments on Wednesday cited concerns over allegations detailed in the lawsuit filed last year, namely that employees for the provider, Southwest Key Programs, subjected children to abuse and harassment.

The suit accused employees of Southwest Key, which has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, of exploiting “children's vulnerabilities, language barriers and distance from family and loved ones” from 2015 through at least 2023, including President Trump's first term.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, in the statement, blamed the Biden administration's immigration policies for enabling the abuses.

“Under the border policies of the previous administration, bad actors were incentivized to exploit children and break our laws: this ends now,” Ms. Bondi said, adding, “securing our border and protecting children from abuse are among the most critical missions of the Department of Justice and the Trump administration.”

Anais Biera Miracle, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key, maintained the nonprofit denied the claims of abuse. She said it was “pleased” that the Justice Department had dropped the case in its entirety, and that charges cannot be refiled.

“There is no settlement or payment required,” Ms. Miracle said in an email. “We are glad this matter is now concluded.”

Abuse and harassment were also alleged to have taken place during President Trump's first term, including during his policy of family separation, which forced thousands of additional minors into federal custody. In a complaint filed in July, federal prosecutors reported that Southwest Key employees subjected minors to threats of violence to prevent them from reporting rape, solicitations of sex and entreaties for nude photographs, among other inappropriate conduct and abuse for at least eight years, across three presidential administrations.

At the time the complaint was filed, the H.H.S., which assumes responsibility for housing children who arrive at the southern border unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians, continued to place minors at shelters run by Southwest Key even as prosecutors asked that the nonprofit face penalties and that it pay damages to the victims.

The decision appears to conclude a gradual reversal of fortune for Southwest Key, which has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, operating more than 25 shelters across Texas, Arizona and California. It has been awarded more than $6 billion in federal funds since 2007. After the H.H.S. announced that it would review its grants to Southwest Key, Ms. Miracle, the spokeswoman, said that the government had frozen funding and put in place a stop placement order on Southwest Key shelters, forcing the nonprofit to furlough about 5,000 employees.

Housing underage migrants for the federal government has been a financial boon for contractors like Southwest Key, whose award money more than doubled during the family separation policy overseen by Mr. Trump in 2017 and 2018. It was one of several providers that cashed in as the administration scrambled to find shelter for more than 5,000 children forced into federal custody, turning the care of migrant children into a billion-dollar business with little transparency.

The New York Times revealed in 2018 that Southwest Key had funneled government money through a web of for-profit companies to convert public funds into private money for the organization and pay top executives millions of dollars. Shortly after, the Justice Department opened an investigation into possible financial improprieties. Southwest Key also began an internal inquiry, and high-level executives, including its founder and chief financial officer, eventually resigned.

The complaint filed by the Justice Department last year disclosed that Southwest Key had documented dozens of cases of abuse reported by children, the majority of whom were 13 to 17 and came from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. But Southwest Key's employees did not report abuse they had observed or knew of, or any violations of policies intended to protect minors.

By one account, a worker who sexually abused three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 threatened to kill their families if they told. In another case documented by Southwest Key, a supervisor deliberately changed shifts to be alone with a teenage girl he repeatedly raped, abused and threatened. At night, he would enter her bedroom and those of others in violation of Southwest Key's policies. The girl was transferred to a different shelter after she reported the abuse.

At the time, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key said that the complaint did not “present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children,” and that the company remained focused on “the safety, health and well-being” of the children at its shelters.

The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into the funding and management of New York City hotels operating as shelters for migrants, according to a copy of a federal subpoena sent to a Manhattan hotel.

Federal prosecutors sent a subpoena to the Hotel Chandler in Midtown on Wednesday, requesting information related to the migrant shelter program and “a list of full names of aliens currently residing at Hotel Chandler,” including nationality, dates of birth and identification numbers.

The subpoena requested testimony and evidence from the hotel related to “an alleged violation” of federal immigration law. It asked the hotel for the names of entities and individuals responsible for the “funding and management of the illegal immigrant/migrant shelter program,” as well as any contracts or agreements related to it.

It was unclear why prosecutors sent a subpoena to the Chandler, a hotel on East 31st Street that was converted into a homeless shelter years ago but does not operate as a shelter for migrants.

The investigation appears focused at least in part on the management and funding of hotels acting as shelters, but its full scope was unclear as of Wednesday, as was whether other hotels had received subpoenas.

The grand jury subpoena was issued by the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. A spokesman for the office, Nicholas Biase, referred questions to the Department of Justice in Washington. A spokesman there declined to comment on what he said was “an ongoing criminal investigation,” adding that he could not discuss the scope or contours of the inquiry.

New York City, which is housing about 43,000 migrants in shelters across the city, including dozens of converted hotels, had not received a subpoena as of Wednesday, according to an official briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.

Liz Garcia, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams, declined to comment, saying, “We cannot comment on any type of federal investigation.”

The Guardian first reported on Wednesday that a Manhattan hotel, which they did not name, had received a subpoena.

The city's migrant shelters have been criticized and scrutinized by the Trump administration, which has made New York City, the country's largest sanctuary jurisdiction, a target of its immigration crackdown.

The city entered into multimillion-dollar contracts with more than 100 hotels as it struggled to house the more than 230,000 migrants who have arrived in the city seeking shelter since early 2022. Republicans have long decried the use of hotels as shelters to house migrants as wasteful spending of taxpayer funding.

Last month, the Trump administration abruptly clawed back $80 million in federal funds from the city's bank accounts that was meant to cover some expenses associated with paying hotels to shelter migrants.

In doing so, the federal government singled out the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown, which the city had converted into its main processing center for migrants. The Trump administration depicted it as a safe haven for migrant gangs. Shortly after, the city announced it would shut down the Roosevelt Hotel by June, citing a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in the city.

President Trump has formally nominated Dan Caine, a retired Air Force lieutenant general, for promotion to four-star rank and to serve as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which would make him Mr. Trump's top uniformed military official. The president fired his previous Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Charles Q. Brown, in a late-night political purge of senior military officers on Feb. 21.

The same day the Office of Personnel Management informed hundreds of employees, including about 20 involved in the communications division, that they were being laid off, the department's top spokeswoman posted an Instagram video she filmed in her office showing off her outfit with the caption: “a moment for mixed patterns.”

On the day O.P.M. sent a memo to all federal department and agency heads asking for lists of underperforming employees to terminate, she flaunted a “work look” that included a purple skirt that her followers could also purchase, retailing at $475. She would get a commission if they used her link.

The spokeswoman, McLaurine Pinover, is not the only member of the Trump administration to have used her federal office to promote outside business interests, but former agency officials and ethics watchdogs say that the timing and content of the videos were both unlawful and especially tone-deaf.

Government watchdogs say the videos, coming from the spokeswoman of the agency driving the layoffs of thousands of federal workers, exemplify a widespread disregard for government ethics across the Trump administration.

“It's illegal for a public employee to promote a private company in their government office,” said Donald Sherman, the executive director and chief counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group.

“On its own, maybe it would qualify as small potatoes, but context matters,” Mr. Sherman added. “In the context of a president and an administration that are routinely engaged in profiteering and using the office of the presidency for financial gain, in the context of someone who owns a private company, Elon Musk, coming into the administration and dismantling the government as he has, and in the context of O.P.M. being central to the administration's attack on civil servants who actually want to be there to work for the American public, an O.P.M. political appointee engaging in this conduct is egregious.”

Though presidents are legally exempt from certain conflict of interest laws, President Trump has not divested from many business interests, some of which involve real estate deals with foreign governments that could influence his diplomatic decisions. Mr. Musk, the tech billionaire whom Mr. Trump deputized to slash the federal government, continues to pursue federal contracts for his private businesses.

And on Tuesday, the day news of Ms. Pinover's Instagram account broke, Mr. Trump made a show of purchasing a red Model S from Tesla, of which Mr. Musk is chief executive, on the White House grounds, just a day after the company's stock crashed.

Ms. Pinover's short videos, each four to nine seconds, featured her in her office, lightheartedly modeling her clothes, applying makeup, working at her desk and occasionally blowing a kiss to the camera. They also included links to the clothes that would give her a commission from fans' purchases.

The existence of Ms. Pinover's accounts was first reported by CNN. The Instagram account has since been deleted, while the account that would supply commissions, ShopMy, has been wiped clean, save for Ms. Pinover's name and picture and an invitation to “Shop my looks!” 

In a statement, Ms. Pinover said she never made any money from the fashion videos.

“While I was battling breast cancer as a new mom, I felt so unlike myself. I turned to social media shortly after as a personal outlet,” she wrote. “I never made any income and with only about 800 followers, I'm surprised the so-called ‘newspaper of record' finds this newsworthy. My focus remains on serving the American people at O.P.M.”

Whether she actually profited off the enterprise is irrelevant, Mr. Sherman said. The purpose of the account was to promote the clothing.

Ms. Pinover took on her role in the Trump administration in January, but her Instagram account — and the start of her fashion influencer videos — predated that job. Before she joined the Trump administration, she worked as a senior director for the Herald Group, a communications and advocacy firm, starting in August 2023. Before that, Ms. Pinover was a spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Former O.P.M. employees said that Ms. Pinover should have been warned against pursuing supplementary income streams, particularly on government property, as part of a standard ethics briefing employees receive when joining the agency.

It was not immediately clear if Ms. Pinover had been explicitly warned against such activity when she started the job. White House representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Use of public property to film one's ‘fashion influencer' videos should raise lots of ethical questions about how seriously the Trump administration is taking their oaths,” said Viet Tran, the deputy communications director of O.P.M. during the Biden administration, a political appointment. “Whether it's Trump hawking Teslas on the South Lawn, SpaceX employees meddling in competitor contracts at F.A.A., or using your government offices for personal enrichment, it looks awful all around.”

President Trump hosted Micheál Martin, Ireland's leader, and hundreds of Irish Americans at the White House on Wednesday evening for a St. Patrick's Day celebration.

“We have come together to this beautiful White House this evening for the annual Shamrock Ceremony, a living symbol of the long and unique friendship between Americans and the Irish,” he said.

Several members of Trump's cabinet attended the celebration, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services. At the same event last year, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. invited many of Kennedy's siblings and their children in a pointed rebuke of Kennedy's independent presidential bid.

In a barrage of pronouncements on Wednesday the Trump administration said it would repeal dozens of the nation's most significant environmental regulations, including limits on pollution from tailpipes and smokestacks, protections for wetlands, and the legal basis that allows it to regulate the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

But beyond that, Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reframed the purpose of the E.P.A. In a two-minute-and-18-second video posted to X, Mr. Zeldin boasted about the changes and said his agency's mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”

“From the campaign trail to Day 1 and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,” Mr. Zeldin said. “We at E.P.A. will do our part to power the great American comeback.”

Nowhere in the video did he refer to protecting the environment or public health, twin tenets that have guided the agency since its founding in 1970.

The E.P.A. has “no obligation to promote agriculture or commerce; only the critical obligation to protect and enhance the environment,” the first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, said as he explained its mission to the country weeks after the E.P.A. was created by President Richard M. Nixon. He said the agency would be focused on research, standards and enforcement in five areas: air pollution, water pollution, waste disposal, radiation and pesticides.

Mr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would unwind more than two dozen protections against air and water pollution. It would overturn limits on soot from smokestacks that have been linked to respiratory problems in humans and premature deaths as well as restrictions on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. It would get rid of the “good neighbor rule” that requires states to address their own pollution when it's carried by winds into neighboring states. And it would eliminate enforcement efforts that prioritize the protection of poor and minority communities.

In addition, when the agency creates environmental policy, it would no longer consider the costs to society from wildfires, droughts, storms and other disasters that might be made worse by pollution connected to that policy, Mr. Zeldin said.

In perhaps its most consequential act, the agency said it would work to erase the E.P.A.'s legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that show global warming is endangering humanity. In his video, Mr. Zeldin derisively referred to that legal underpinning as “the holy grail of the climate change religion.”

Mr. Zeldin called Wednesday's actions “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.” He added, “today the green new scam ends, as the E.P.A. does its part to usher in a golden age of American success.”

The announcements do not carry the force of law. In almost every case, the E.P.A. would have to undergo a lengthy process of public comment and develop environmental and economic justifications for the change.

President Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, campaigned on a promise to “drill, baby, drill” and ease regulations on fossil fuel companies. Since returning to the White House, he has degraded the government's capacity to fight global warming by freezing funds for climate programs authorized by Congress, firing scientists working on weather and climate forecasts, and cutting federal support for the transition away from fossil fuels.

The United States is the world's largest historic emitter of carbon dioxide, a planet-warming greenhouse gas that scientists agree is driving climate change and intensifying hurricanes, floods, wildfires and droughts, as well as species extinction. Last year was the hottest in recorded history, and the United States experienced 27 disasters that each cost at least $1 billion, compared to three in 1980, adjusted for inflation.

Democrats and environmental activists decried Mr. Zeldin's moves and accused him of abandoning the E.P.A.'s responsibility to protect human health and the environment.

“Today is the day Trump's Big Oil megadonors paid for,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. He called the E.P.A. moves a series of attacks on clean air, clean water and affordable energy. “Administrator Zeldin clearly lied when he told us that he would respect the science and listen to the experts,” Mr. Whitehouse said, referring to Mr. Zeldin's confirmation hearing. 

Gina McCarthy, who served as E.P.A. administrator in the Obama administration, said it was “the most disastrous day in EPA history. Rolling these rules back is not just a disgrace, it's a threat to all of us. The agency has fully abdicated its mission to protect Americans' health and well being.”

Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate change and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said repealing or weakening regulations on automobiles, power plants and more would lead to increases in asthma, heart attacks and other health problems. “At a time when millions of Americans are trying to rebuild after horrific wildfires and climate-fueled hurricanes, it's nonsensical to try to deny that climate change harms our health and welfare,” said Ms. Wong, whose organization successfully sued the first Trump administration repeatedly over environmental rollbacks.

The Trump administration had been signaling for months that it would reverse many of the climate regulations enacted during the Biden administration. But the cascade of announcements, timed with an op-ed by Mr. Zeldin in The Wall Street Journal and the online video, was designed to attract attention before he is expected to address oil, gas and other energy providers at an annual gathering in Houston.

 By midafternoon, the agency had counted 31 pronouncements that were designed, Mr. Zeldin said, to “unleash American energy.”

The top lobbying groups for the automobile, oil, gas and chemical industries, among others, applauded Mr. Zeldin's plans.

Anne Bradbury, the chief executive of the American Exploration & Production Council, a lobbying group representing oil and gas companies, called the announcements “common sense.” John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto lobby, said the changes would keep the industry “globally competitive.”

Marty Durbin, a senior vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said, “American businesses were crippled with an unprecedented regulatory onslaught during the previous Administration that contributed to higher costs felt by families around the country.” He said “The Chamber supports a more balanced regulatory approach that will protect the environment and support greater economic growth.”

Groups that deny the established science of climate change also cheered Mr. Zeldin's actions.

“The Biden E.P.A. ignored the will of Congress, infringed on individual freedom, trampled on property rights and tried to force the country to use unreliable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar,” said a statement from Daren Bakst, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank allied with the fossil fuel industry that believes global warming has been minimal and is good for humanity and the biosphere.

Some of the most significant policy changes Mr. Zeldin said he planned include:

Rolling back restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Currently the E.P.A. requires existing coal-burning power plants and new gas plants built in the United States to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by 90 percent by 2039.

Rewriting tailpipe pollution standards that were designed to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the United States are all-electric or hybrids by 2032.

Easing limits on mercury emissions from power plants, as well as restrictions on soot and haze from burning coal. A Biden-era rule had aimed to slash by 70 percent emissions from coal-burning power plants of mercury, which has been linked to developmental damage in children.

Greatly reducing the “social cost” of carbon, an economic estimate of the damage caused by each additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. That figure plays a significant role in weighing the costs and benefits of regulating industries. 

Perhaps the most significant move, though, is an effort to revise a 2009 legal opinion known as the E.P.A. “endangerment finding” which concluded that rising greenhouse gas emissions are a danger to public health. The finding gives the agency the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Eliminating it would make it virtually impossible for the E.P.A. to curb climate pollution from automobiles, factories, power plants or oil and gas wells.

Reversing the rule has long been the white whale for climate deniers. But doing so would require Mr. Trump's E.P.A. to make and substantiate the argument that greenhouse gas emissions pose no foreseeable threats to public health, when decades of science says otherwise.

Jonathan H. Adler, a conservative legal expert and professor of environmental law at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said he did not believe the Trump administration would succeed. “You've got to explain away decades of statements by every administration that there are negative consequences of climate change that can be reasonably anticipated,” Mr. Adler said.

He called the effort to unravel the endangerment finding “a good way to waste years of time and effort and accomplish nothing.”

An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the views of the Climate Enterprise Institute. The group believes global warming has been minimal and good for humanity and the biosphere; it does not promote “climate denial.”

Reporting from Washington

The acting head of the government's human resources arm, Charles Ezell, will no longer testify on Thursday in a case challenging the legality of the recent mass firings of federal workers, lawyers for the Trump administration said.

The move could pave the way for a federal judge to order the government to pause the firings.

Mr. Ezell had been ordered to appear before a San Francisco judge as part of a lawsuit brought against the Office of Personnel Management by unions representing some of the fired workers.

As the office's acting chief, Mr. Ezell began issuing guidance in January that agencies interpreted as orders to fire federal employees, particularly those with probationary status. That guidance is at the heart of multiple legal challenges, with the once-obscure agency assuming a lead role in President Trump's government-gutting initiative.

According to a legal complaint from the employee unions, Mr. Ezell held a meeting on Feb. 13 with the heads of many federal agencies in which he ordered them to fire tens of thousands of employees. The next day, O.P.M. provided a template to agencies to use for the termination letters, stating that employees were being fired for performance reasons, according to the plaintiffs.

The unions argued that O.P.M. does not have the authority to make such personnel decisions and asked the court to rule that the office's orders were illegal and force the government to stop firing people at their direction.

Mr. Ezell filed a declaration on Feb. 26 asserting that he did not order the agencies to fire anyone, and that the memos from his office were intended only as “guidance.” The same day, lawyers for the unions filed examples of correspondence from O.P.M. that they argue show that the memos were indeed orders.

A day later, the judge presiding over the case, William Alsup of the Northern District of California, heard arguments from both sides about O.P.M.'s role in the mass firings at the agencies involved in the lawsuit, including the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Judge Alsup concluded that O.P.M. has no legal authority to order the agencies to fire anyone, ordered that the government retract the memos and said the government should put a stop to unlawful personnel moves. He also scheduled a hearing for Thursday, March 13, making clear he wanted Mr. Ezell to appear.

O.P.M. responded to his order by retracting the original memos, but the government disputed the need for Mr. Ezell's testimony. Judge Alsup disagreed, ordering on Monday that Mr. Ezell come before the court.

“The problem here is that Acting Director Ezell submitted a sworn declaration in support of defendants' position, but now refuses to appear to be cross-examined, or to be deposed,” Judge Alsup wrote Monday.

On Tuesday, the government confirmed that Mr. Ezell would not comply. Government lawyers said his testimony is not necessary “because existing documentary evidence and briefing demonstrates that O.P.M. is not directing agencies to terminate probationary employees.”

Since the lawsuit was filed, the unions have drastically expanded its scope, including fired employees from 28 agencies, up from the five in the initial complaint.

The broader scope reflects the extraordinary personnel actions that have been taken since Mr. Trump's return to office and the opacity surrounding who is responsible for orchestrating the wholesale changes that have been ordered by O.P.M. — Mr. Trump or his government downsizing guru, the tech billionaire Elon Musk.

During his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, Mr. Trump said Mr. Musk is the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which is overseeing the culling of the federal government. Two days later, Mr. Trump told members of his cabinet that they are the ones in charge of reducing the number of employees at their agencies, not Mr. Musk.

Yet members of Mr. Musk's team continue to show up at federal agencies demanding data and documents and operating with outsized importance.

Mr. Ezell's testimony on Thursday would have given lawyers representing the unions the opportunity to press him on O.P.M.'s role in how Mr. Trump's government overhaul is being carried out. According to a court filing after the government's notice informing the judge that Mr. Ezell would not testify, the court clerk said Thursday's hearing would go on as planned.

Mr. Ezell took over as leader of O.P.M. on Inauguration Day. Before that, he was a lower-level official at the agency, overseeing data analytics. He also previously served as a consultant to the agency, according to his LinkedIn page.

news analysis

President Trump's retribution campaign against law firms, legal experts and analysts say, is undermining a central tenet of the American legal system — the right to a lawyer to argue vigorously on one's behalf.

With the stroke of a pen last week, Mr. Trump sought to cripple Perkins Coie, a firm that worked with Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, by stripping its lawyers of security clearances needed to represent some clients and limiting the firm's access to government buildings and officials.

That action came after he revoked security clearances held by any lawyers at the firm Covington & Burling who were helping provide legal advice to Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought two federal indictments against Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump's actions, and open threats of more to come, have shaken law firms across Washington and beyond, leaving them looking at their client lists and wondering whether their representation could put them in the president's cross hairs and endanger their business. Perkins Coie has acknowledged that in just the few days since Mr. Trump signed the executive order it “has already lost significant revenue” because of clients who have severed their relationship with the firm.

“This is certainly the biggest affront to the legal profession in my lifetime,” said Samuel W. Buell, who is a longtime professor of law at Duke University and a former federal prosecutor.

A federal judge on Wednesday sided with Perkins Coie in an initial courtroom skirmish with the White House, temporarily barring a major portion of Mr. Trump's executive order against the firm from taking effect.

“I am sure that many in the profession are watching in horror at what Perkins Coie is going through,” said Judge Beryl A. Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington. She added, “It sends little chills down my spine” to hear arguments that a president can punish individuals and companies like this.

Her reaction mirrored those of other legal experts who said the issues at stake go far beyond whether or not Mr. Trump will make life difficult for elite law firms and well-paid lawyers.

The experts say Mr. Trump's actions could create a trickle-down effect in which those who find themselves under scrutiny from Mr. Trump and his administration struggle to find lawyers who are willing to defend them in the face of the vast powers of the federal government. Those facing scrutiny could be forced to turn to less skilled lawyers or firms that enjoy access or good ties to the White House, the experts say.

“If you're a political enemy, you really need the best representation when the government comes after you for who you are,” said Daniel C. Richman, a professor of law at Columbia University and former federal prosecutor. “Chilling the lawyers who represent those people hurts the rule of law because when the government can't be legally opposed, the law provides no protections to anyone and you start to live in an autocracy.”

Mr. Trump's attack on Big Law comes as his administration has also gone after law schools, the American Bar Association and even lawyers inside the government itself who might question or hinder his agenda.

Last week, the top federal prosecutor in Washington threatened to stop hiring graduates from Georgetown Law School if its dean, William Treanor, failed to abolish the school's diversity programs. Mr. Treanor all but dared the prosecutor, Ed Martin, to make good on his threats, saying that the First Amendment would forbid them.

Mr. Trump has often relied on pliant lawyers to do his bidding, and last month he fired the three top lawyers in the armed forces who are supposed to advise military leaders on the legality of various policies and operations. The lawyers, known as judge advocates general, were fired without reference to their professional performance, raising concerns that the administration wanted replacements who would be more amenable to Mr. Trump's orders.

One of the first big tests of this new era arose late last week, setting off maneuvering that shows how big firms in Washington are rushing to adapt to the new challenges they face, according to interviews with people involved in or briefed on those discussions.

In his executive order targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump was going after a firm that represented Mrs. Clinton's campaign and repeatedly won election law cases in 2020 against Mr. Trump's campaign. Mr. Trump singled out Perkins Coie's involvement in a dossier complied during the 2016 campaign by a former British spy about Mr. Trump's potential ties to Russia.

Amid concerns in the legal community about a chilling effect, few, if any, major firms issued statements condemning Mr. Trump's action. And amid that silence there was a question about whether any firm would take the even bigger step of agreeing to represent Perkins Coie in its effort to challenge Mr. Trump's executive order in court.

Perkins Coie reached out to Derek L. Shaffer, a lawyer at the firm Quinn Emanuel. Mr. Shaffer had a long history of bringing civil actions against federal and state governments, and had argued before the Supreme Court three times. Perkins Coie wanted to see if he could take on the firm as a client and quickly go to court to file a suit against the Trump administration to stop the executive order.

Convincing Mr. Shaffer to take the case would come with a major potential bonus: close links to Mr. Trump and his allies.

Lawyers at Quinn Emanuel represent Elon Musk and provide ethics advice to the Trump Organization. The firm has also represented Mayor Eric Adams of New York as the Trump Justice Department has moved swiftly to drop corruption charges against Mr. Adams, a Democrat.

But Perkins Coie was rebuffed. Quinn Emanuel decided against taking the case. Its top leaders concluded that this was not an issue they wanted to jump into at this stage as they continue to build themselves into a power center in Mr. Trump's Washington.

Other major law firms expressed concerns that if they represented Perkins Coie, they, too, could face Mr. Trump's ire. Leaders of top firms asked: How would their own clients react if Mr. Trump cut off their access to the government?

In response, the elite Washington firm Williams and Connolly decided it would take on Perkins Coie as a client.

It's unclear why Williams and Connolly was willing to take a risk that other firms were not. But lawyers at Williams and Connolly have long taken pride in their role as an adversary and check against the government, including by highlighting the firm's role in protecting high-profile defendants against prosecutorial misconduct. The firm was founded by the well-known defense lawyer Edward Bennett Williams, who built his career on vigorously representing an array of clients before the government, including those out of political favor.

On Tuesday, Williams and Connolly, on behalf of Perkins Coie, filed suit against the Trump administration in Washington. That suit led to Judge Howell's ruling on Wednesday imposing a temporary restraining order to block for now the section of Mr. Trump's executive order that essentially barred Perkins Coie from dealing with federal officials and prevented it from entering government buildings. She said the executive order was most likely unconstitutional.

Other law firms have been discussing whether to file a joint amicus brief on behalf of Perkins Coie. While some major firms have signaled they are willing to sign onto it, others have said they are reluctant. On Wednesday, 21 state attorneys general filed their own amicus brief supporting Perkins Coie.

Covington & Burling, which had the security clearance stripped from a lawyer at the firm who was assisting Mr. Smith, has taken a different approach from that of Perkins Coie.

Covington has declined to fight Mr. Trump in court. Instead, the firm, concerned about a perception among its clients that it was falling out of favor with Mr. Trump, has begun discussions with other prominent law firms with fewer ties to Mr. Trump's perceived enemies about becoming the face of some of their most important cases before the Justice Department.

But beyond what Mr. Trump has done to law firms, the political appointees he has placed at departments, agencies and commissions are taking on the legal profession in other ways.

One of Mr. Trump's political appointees has ordered government officials under him to not renew their memberships to the American Bar Association, hold a position with the association or attend its events.

At the Justice Department, the attorney general has sent a letter to the American Bar Association questioning its diversity practices.

And last week, at an annual conference on white-collar crime for the association, a slew of top officials from the Justice Department — who regularly attend the event — canceled at the last minute. That meant that a conference designed to bring together the industry about an important topic was devoid of senior department officials in charge of enforcing the law.

Abbie VanSickle and Alan Feuer contributed reporting.

An earlier version of this story referred imprecisely to an element of the executive order President Trump issued about the law firm Covington & Burling. The order stripped security clearances from any lawyers at the firm who assisted the former special counsel Jack Smith. It did not strip security clearances from the firm.

Reporting from Washington

Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, opted not to name a critic of Israel's war in Gaza to a top post managing briefings for the president, after the proposed appointment upset some members of President Trump's coalition, according to officials familiar with the deliberations.

Daniel Davis, a senior fellow at a Washington think tank who is skeptical of American intervention overseas, was undergoing a background check to become the deputy director for mission integration, the officials said. The post is a powerful job that oversees the compiling of the President's Daily Brief, a compendium of intelligence assessments that goes to the White House and top policymakers.

But news of the proposed appointment generated blowback on the right. A senior administration official said Ms. Gabbard reconsidered her choice given the criticism, and other officials confirmed the decision.

Mr. Davis is a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, a think tank with funding from Charles Koch that has a number of alumni in key positions in the Trump administration. Defense Priorities has taken a skeptical view of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East and has supported Mr. Trump's efforts to reach an immediate cease-fire in the war in Ukraine.

The abandoned appointment has highlighted an emerging foreign policy fault line in the new administration. The Trump administration has appointed both more hawkish Republicans, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and officials far more skeptical of American intervention, including Ms. Gabbard.

The tug of war over Mr. Davis's appointment also highlighted the strain among supporters of Mr. Trump's over U.S. support of Israel.

Before Mr. Davis's appointment was pulled, the Anti-Defamation League said on Wednesday that the appointment would be “extremely dangerous.” In a social media post, the group accused Mr. Davis of minimizing Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack and undermining American support for Israel.

Consideration of Mr. Davis had also upset some hawkish conservatives in Congress who began quietly trying to get the administration to rethink it. These officials believed Mr. Davis's skepticism of the war in Gaza could weaken the Trump administration's support for Israel.

Former intelligence officials were also critical of the pick. Marc Polymeropoulos, a former C.I.A. operations officer and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said Mr. Davis's positions were outside the ideological mainstream of the Republican Party.

“His overt criticism of Israel and total opposition to any military action against Iran seems to run counter to current administration policy,” Mr. Polymeropoulos said.

Allies of Mr. Davis had defended him and said there was no hint of antisemitism or opposition to Israel in his work. He is skeptical of military action when it does not directly align with American interests, they say, and troubled by the use of proxies when the United States is unwilling to put its own troops in harm's way.

While some of Mr. Davis's criticisms of Israel are well outside the mainstream of the Republican Party, they are similar to certain critiques by liberal Democrats. He has spoken frequently about the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.

While Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for Palestinians to be removed from Gaza to allow it to be redeveloped into a beach resort, Mr. Davis has said the removal of people from the territory would be “ethnic cleansing.”

In January, he wrote on social media that U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza was a “stain on our character as a nation, as a culture, that will not soon go away.”

Consideration of Mr. Davis for the intelligence post was reported earlier by Jewish Insider.

Ms. Gabbard has said little about the war in Gaza recently. But many of Mr. Davis's other positions, including a skepticism of American support for Ukraine's war effort and his worries about the consequences of the fall of the Syrian government, match her views. And Mr. Davis's social media feed has been supportive of Ms. Gabbard's foreign policy positions.

During the Biden administration, the head of mission integration conducted many intelligence briefings at the White House. Beth Sanner, who was deputy director of mission integration through much of the first Trump administration, was the primary presidential briefer. Another intelligence official has had that responsibility in the current Trump administration, according to former officials.

In recent years, senior C.I.A. analysts with decades of experience have had the briefing responsibility. Robert Cardillo, who was the first person ever to hold the job, had been a senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, Shelly C. Lowe, left her position on Wednesday “at the direction of President Trump,” the agency said.

Dr. Lowe, a scholar of higher education and the first Native American to lead the agency, was nominated by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in October 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in February 2022. Michael McDonald, the agency's general counsel, was named its acting chairman on Wednesday.

“I can confirm that, at the direction of President Trump, Shelly Lowe has departed her position as chair of N.E.H.,” a spokesman for the agency, Paula Wasley, said in a statement. She said Mr. McDonald would serve as acting chairman “until such time as the president nominates and the Senate confirms a new N.E.H. chairman.”

Agency chairs are appointed for four-year terms, though some have served across administrations. Maria Rosario Jackson, the chair of the endowment's sister agency, the National Endowment for the Arts, announced her resignation on Jan. 17, shortly before Mr. Trump's inauguration.

The National Endowment for the Humanities was founded in 1965 and has awarded more than $6 billion in grants to museums, historic sites, universities, libraries and other organizations, according to its website.

Dr. Lowe's departure comes as Mr. Trump has moved to put his stamp on federal cultural agencies, most prominently the Kennedy Center, where he purged Biden appointees from the bipartisan board, fired the center's president and had himself elected chairman.

The president has also issued sweeping executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government while calling for the promotion of “patriotic history.” In one order issued in January, Mr. Trump included the heads of both the art and humanities endowments as members of his newly created Task Force 250, which is charged with providing “a grand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion of the 250th anniversary of American independence.”

Last month, the arts endowment, which is led by an interim chair, Mary Anne Carter, announced that it was canceling this year's “Challenge America” grants, a relatively small program aimed at supporting projects serving underrepresented groups or communities.

Potential applicants were instead encouraged to apply for the agency's much larger main grant program, which according to its website encouraged projects that “celebrate and honor the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity” during the lead-up to the 250th commemoration in July 2026.

In his first term, Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate both agencies, which have an annual budget of roughly $200 million each. But they survived.

Information was not immediately available about any staff or budget cuts or shifts in its programs at the humanities endowment.

Michael S. Schmidt

A federal judge on Wednesday sided with the law firm Perkins Coie, temporarily barring Trump's executive order that crippled the firm's ability to do business with the government. Trump signed an executive order last Thursday that essentially barred the firm's lawyers from doing business with the federal government or entering federal buildings.

Michael S. Schmidt

Trump said that he was targeting the firm because of its role in representing Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Judge Beryl Howell said that the executive order had a chilling effect on the entire legal profession. “I am sure that many in the profession are watching in horror at what Perkins Coie is going through,” she said, adding, “It sends little chills down my spine” to hear arguments that a president can punish individuals and companies like this.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, says that Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to pass the bill the House approved on Tuesday to avert a shutdown and fund the government through Sept. 30.

Schumer says that Senate Democrats are united around a 30-day stopgap bill “that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass.”

At least eight Democrats would need to join Republicans in getting the House-passed bill over the finish line. Democrats instead would like to extend current funding through April 11. But any changes would require the House to return, which is highly unlikely. House Republicans purposefully left town after passing the legislation to prevent any Senate changes.

Carl Hulse

Democrats exiting a meeting over a looming government shutdown said they were not ready to provide the necessary votes to pass a Republican stopgap spending bill, increasing the chances for a shutdown at the end of the week. “At least for now, I don't see the votes,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland. The standoff puts Senate Democrats at risk of being blamed for any shutdown, but they are under pressure from House Democrats and activists to stand against President Trump and Elon Musk.

The Environmental Protection Agency said that it was canceling $20 billion in grants for climate and clean energy programs that have been frozen for weeks, a move that was labeled illegal by nonprofit groups that were supposed to receive the funds.

The money has been caught in an escalating controversy involving the E.P.A., the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Citibank, where the funds are being held and are now frozen, prompting lawsuits from three nonprofit groups.

The grants were issued to a total of eight nonprofit organizations through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which received $27 billion in funding from Congress through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But since taking office, Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A.'s administrator, has tried to claw back the money, saying they were part of a “scheme” and citing as evidence a hidden-camera video from Project Veritas, a conservative group known for using covert recordings to embarrass its political opponents.

The E.P.A. can cancel the grant contracts if it can document examples of waste, fraud, and abuse by the grantees. But that hasn't happened at this point.

Yesterday, Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched an investigation into the E.P.A,'s freezing of the funds and what they said were Mr. Zeldin's “false and misleading statements.”

Two of the nonprofit grant recipients, Climate United and the Coalition for Green Capital, said they will fight the cancellation. A court hearing on a related case is scheduled for Wednesday.

Here is what we know about the $20 billion in funding and how it became a target of the E.P.A.

In February, Mr. Zeldin announced that he had found billions of dollars of “gold bars” of grant funding at Citibank, calling the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (or “green bank”) grant program a “scheme” and a “rush job with no oversight.”

Mr. Zeldin has embraced the Trump administration's emphasis on spending cuts, touting his work with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has canceled scores of other E.P.A. contracts, totaling what the agency said is around $2 billion across more than 400 initiatives.

The “gold bars” comment was a reference to a video released in December by Project Veritas in which Brent Efron, then an E.P.A. employee, likened his agency's efforts to spend federal funds on climate programs before leaving office to throwing “gold bars” off the Titanic.

Mr. Efron's lawyer has denied his client was referring to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

After Mr. Zeldin's statement, Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C., asked Denise Cheung, a top federal prosecutor, to freeze the $20 billion held by Citibank. But she abruptly resigned after determining there was not enough evidence to order the funds frozen. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department continued their investigations.

Last week, Mr. Zeldin also referred the matter to his agency's acting inspector general for a third, concurrent investigation.

The nonprofit grant recipients began executing their legal defense this past weekend, when Climate United sued E.P.A. and Citibank, claiming they were illegally withholding the money. Two other recipients filed suits against Citibank in the following days.

A hearing on Climate United's request for a temporary restraining order to release the funds was scheduled for Wednesday in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

The cancellations surprised Climate United, a nonprofit organization that was awarded nearly $7 billion, said Beth Bafford, the group's chief executive officer. She said she received an official termination letter a half-hour before the agency issued a public statement.

The nonprofits have been unable to access the funds in their Citibank accounts since mid-February. The funds have been held there under an agreement between the E.P.A. and the bank.

Without the promised funds, some groups said they are struggling to pay staff.

In a termination letter viewed by The New York Times, the E.P.A. said it had identified “material deficiencies” in the program, including the absence of adequate oversight and improper or speculative allocation of funds. It did not provide any evidence.

The Coalition for Green Capital, one of the largest recipients, called the E.P.A.'s decision “unauthorized and unlawful,” and said it was considering legal options.

The $20 billion program was designed to offer low-cost loans to businesses and developers for climate initiatives, which include things like installing solar panels and retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient.

The E.P.A. distributed the money to eight nonprofits, which planned to distribute the money as loans as well as grants to local “green banks'” or credit unions, which would in turn make their own loans.

The idea was that the commitment of federal dollars would attract private investments to green projects.

Mr. Zeldin has made much of the fact that $20 billion in grant money was held at Citibank, portraying the E.P.A.'s decision to use an outside financial institution as an intermediary as an attempt to subvert oversight.

Grant recipients and former E.P.A. officials have disputed this characterization, and said that the agency has full visibility into transactions through the Citibank accounts for the nonprofit organizations and their sub-recipients

It's not clear how much of the $20 billion was spent before the freeze was put in place.

A spokeswoman for the E.P.A. said it could not answer how much of the money has been loaned out by the nonprofits because the funds were spent under the Biden administration.

Citibank did not respond to request for comment.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, confirmed Trump will meet Thursday with the NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte.

Parents in the District of Columbia, whose budget would be slashed by more than $1 billion under the stopgap spending bill the House passed last night, are planning to stage a “Recess at the Capitol” protest on Thursday. A flier describing the protest says they plan to bring schoolchildren to the Hart Building near the Capitol to show lawmakers “exactly who they're impacting.”

Annie Karni

Persuading Senate Democrats to block the bill, however, will be a heavy lift. The plight of Washington residents is not top of mind for lawmakers who fear being blamed for a government shutdown if the bill is blocked.

Miguel A. Cardona, the education secretary in the Biden administration, said in an open letter that the Trump administration's move to gut the Education Department was “deeply disturbing” and would “undoubtedly hurt students.”

Tim Balk

Cardona wrote that the cuts would sap resources for students with disabilities and that “vulnerable students in our country will feel the impacts the greatest.” He urged educators to stay “focused on your students and the great work you are doing, and know you are not alone.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he hoped a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine could take place within “days” if Russian leaders agreed, and that he planned to get diplomats from the Group of 7 allied nations to focus on ending the war in a meeting this week in Canada.

“Here's what we'd like the world to look like in a few days: Neither side is shooting at each other — not rockets, not missiles, not bullets, nothing, not artillery,” he told reporters during a refueling stop in Ireland as he flew from Saudi Arabia to Canada. “The shooting stops, the fighting stops, and the talking starts.”

Mr. Rubio also downplayed any notion that he would encounter hostility from American allies because of President Trump's recent tariffs. And he said he expected to have cordial talks with Canadian officials, despite Mr. Trump's threat to annex Canada and make it the 51st state. The president has also imposed coercive tariffs on Canada.

“That's not what we're going to discuss at the G7, and that's not what we're going to be discussing in our trip here,” he said. “They're the host nation, and I mean, we have a lot of other things we work on together.”

“It is not a meeting about how we're going to take over Canada,” he added. He landed in Quebec City on Wednesday afternoon, as other foreign ministers were also flying in.

Mr. Rubio and Michael Waltz, the White House national security adviser, met for hours on Tuesday with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to work out how to start a negotiation process with Russia to end the war. Hostilities began in 2014 when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, and then launched a full-scale invasion in 2022.

After the meeting on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said they had agreed to an American proposal for a 30-day interim cease-fire. After berating the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in the White House, Mr. Trump withheld U.S. weapons and intelligence aid to the Ukrainians to try to force them into negotiations. U.S. officials said after the Jeddah meeting that aid had restarted.

Mr. Rubio said U.S. officials planned to “have contact” with Russian officials on Wednesday to discuss the proposed cease-fire.

“If their response is no, it would be highly unfortunate, and it'd make their intentions clear,” he added.

Mr. Rubio said that when he, Mr. Waltz and Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, met with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia last month, the Russians appeared open to the idea of a settlement to the war. “They expressed a willingness under the right circumstances, which they did not define, to bring an end to this conflict,” he said.

Mr. Rubio said one of his main goals at the Group of 7 meeting was corralling the other countries — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, all supporters of Ukraine — to have a united front on encouraging peace talks. The meeting begins with a reception in Quebec City on Wednesday night.

He said a “perfect statement” to be issued from the meeting “would be that the United States has done a good thing for the world in bringing this process forward, and now we all eagerly await the Russian response and urge them strongly to consider ending all hostilities, so people will stop dying, so bullets will stop flying and so a process can begin to find a permanent peace.”

Ukrainian officials want to ensure several issues are addressed in any talks, he said, including exchanges of prisoners of war, the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia and humanitarian assistance.

When asked what was the American position on Ukraine's request for security guarantees to help deter any future Russian assaults, Mr. Rubio simply said deterrence would be part of peace talks.

“There's no way to have an enduring peace without the deterrence piece being a part of it,” he said, adding that any commercial minerals agreement between the United States and Ukraine would help enrich Ukraine, but was not a deterrent against Russian aggression.

Mr. Trump has insisted that the United States and Ukraine sign such an agreement, suggesting that investment by American companies in Ukraine would help stave off a hostile Russia.

Mr. Rubio said European promises to provide security to Ukraine would be part of peace talks as well. He said it was unclear when those nations would become more involved in negotiations, though European countries have insisted they would be central players in a settlement, if one were to happen.

“I would imagine that in any negotiation, if we get there hopefully with the Russians, that they will raise the European sanctions that have been imposed upon them,” Mr. Rubio said. “So I think that the issue of European sanctions are going to be on the table, not to mention what happens with the frozen assets and the like.”

The foreign ministers gathered in Quebec City expect to discuss the war, but Mr. Trump's hostility to U.S. alliances, his alignment with Russia and his unpredictable tariff actions have created a host of issues that the diplomats intend to raise.

Mr. Rubio said Mr. Trump was imposing tariffs not to punish other nations but “to develop a domestic capability” for manufacturing, especially in defense industries.

Canadian officials, including the incoming prime minister, Mark Carney, are taking reciprocal actions on the tariffs and grappling with Mr. Trump's other threats. Mr. Rubio said Mr. Trump's statements on annexation were based on both economic and security concerns.

“What he said is they should become the 51st state from an economic standpoint,” Mr. Rubio said. “He says if they became the 51st state, we wouldn't have to worry about the border and fentanyl coming across because now we would be able to manage that. He's made an argument that it's their interest to do so. Obviously, the Canadians don't agree, apparently.”

Oops, something went wrong

Some of the biggest bosses on Wall Street aren't hitting the panic button on President Trump's policies this week despite the recent gyration in markets, even as they acknowledge some new concerns from the business world.

Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman said earlier this week that US tariffs will produce more manufacturing in the United States “at the end of the day," and "given the size of the US, that tends to be a good thing for the world.”

Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said Wednesday, "I think the business community understands what the president is trying to do with tariffs," even if executives do want "lower tariffs everywhere."

BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said Wednesday that while he does hear from CEOs that "the economy is weakening as we speak," he predicts that "if we are able to unlock private capital ... that will restart and rekindle the next wave of a bull market."

Wall Street certainly has a lot riding on Trump 2.0. At the beginning of the year, bankers were wildly optimistic that the Trump administration's pro-growth agenda and deregulatory stance would unleash the market's animal spirits and spur a flurry of US deals.

But the uncertainty surrounding the administration's trade policies is roiling markets and raising new concerns about the direction of the US economy and inflation.

That is making it more challenging for bankers and executives to know how trade changes could affect their supply chains or if they should pull the trigger on a public listing or a merger.

At the beginning of this week, Goldman Sachs (GS) became the first major Wall Street firm to lower its year-end price target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), after the major index tumbled into near-correction territory and the firm reduced its outlook for GDP.

Though less bullish than the major bank initially expected, the new forecast is still optimistic — it's 11% higher than the index's all-time high set in February.

Solomon said Wednesday on Fox Business Network's "Mornings with Maria" that he still expects a pickup in certain deals this year.

"The level of uncertainty is a little bit higher, and that has kept some possible transactions on the sidelines, but the overall level of dialogue, as people are thinking strategically about where they want to drive their businesses, is certainly increasing."

"There is potential, especially if we got more specific actions on the regulatory front, to unleash more animal spirits," he added.

Trump did make an effort this week to speak directly to Solomon and some of the other top CEOs at a meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, D.C.

"There's a renewed spirit," the president told the executives, adding that "the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country."

During a portion of the meeting closed to the press, Trump laid out other parts of his agenda — including extending the corporate tax cuts, speeding up approvals on environmental projects, and bringing more jobs and plants back to the US, according to a person familiar with the remarks.

The next day, one attendee, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, downplayed the effect tariffs thus far may be having on consumer sentiment.

"I don't think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work, which there are like 175 million of them, changes what they're going to do because they read about tariffs," Dimon said in an interview with a Semafor reporter at a Washington, D.C., event hosted by BlackRock and the Bipartisan Policy Center.

"But," he added, in a nod to some unease in the business world, "I do think companies might. Uncertainty is not a good thing."

Since Trump took office, Dimon has, in some measure, applauded the Trump administration's efforts to cut down on Washington, D.C.'s bureaucracy and publicly rebuked tariff worries without delivering an outright judgment on whether the cost-cutting efforts or trade policies have gone too far.

Days into Trump's second term, Dimon said of tariffs, "If it's a little inflationary, but it's good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it," while speaking with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

He made similar points on March 7 during a talk at Stanford University, calling the current impact of tariffs "very modestly inflationary" and said the effect on that part of the economic picture was being "blown out of proportion."

However, he acknowledged scenarios where the impact could be bigger. "Now, if you put 25% tariffs on all imports, okay, that's a lot more. That could be, in my viewpoint, recessionary and inflationary," Dimon added.

Fink, who runs the world's largest money manager, has already shown that his company's moves can align with the priorities of the Trump administration.

It came last week when a BlackRock-led coalition struck a $22.8 billion deal with Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison that included taking control of two ports located on either end of the Panama Canal.

The move gave Trump what he asked for on his first day in office — a larger American presence in a crucial shipping lane where he had alleged Chinese interference.

Fink himself cleared the deal with Trump and other White House officials, according to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.

This week, Fink offered optimism even amid some uncertainty. "The world economies, over a long cycle, are going to be fine," Fink said Monday at an event in Houston.

On Tuesday he told CNN: "Could we have one quarter or two quarters of a flattening of our economy as we try to reset the economy? Absolutely."

But, he added, Trump's policies, including tariffs, "can be very productive for the United States" in the long run. As for market losses this week, he said "there's nothing wrong with a market pullback."

"I look at that as a buying opportunity because I'm very bullish on America."

Laura and Francisco Gonzalez and two of their children stand in front of their third Javi's Chicken and Churros restaurant at 1520 N. Fourth Ave. in Pasco. It is their first restaurant in Tri-Cities. They have two other locations in Grandview and Sunnyside and a food truck coming soon in Yakima.

The building once home to Pasco's longest continuously operating restaurant is now serving up cuisine from another continent.

The Chinese food once dished up at 1520 N. Fourth Ave. has given way to south of the border and Southern California favorites, such as loaded carne asada (lime-marinated steak) fries, birria (goat or beef cooked in broth), pollo loco (fire-grilled chicken) and, of course, deep-fried cinnamon encrusted churros with a variety of sauces and sweet toppings.

Javi's Chicken and Churros opened in November 2024. The owners, Francisco and Laura Gonzalez of Sunnyside, operate two other restaurants under the same name in Grandview and Sunnyside.

They named the business after their first son, Javi, who was about 4 years old when it opened.

The couple say they are excited that the Pasco Javi's provides an opportunity to offer a bigger food and drink menu.

At its heart, Francisco Gonzalez said Javi's menu is a coming-together of many unique regional Mexican cuisines, but with a focus on the border town food his family enjoyed living in Southern California.

“In a border town, you get people who migrate there from all corners of Mexico, so you find everything there,” he said.

Francisco Gonzalez recalled that when his family moved to Washington eight years ago, he noticed that a lot of foods they were used to seeing – like birria and flame-broiled chicken – weren't often on local menus.

He said there is a heavy focus among area Mexican restaurants on carnitas, chicharrones and other styles from other regions.

His parents are from Jalisco where birria is said to derive from, so with his mom's help finetuning the recipes, he made that the center of several headlining dishes.

“Our signature dish would be our birria tacos: doraditas,” he said. Doraditas, per Javi's menu, are crunchy tacos with birria meat topped with melted cheese, onion, cilantro and guacamole.

“We also sell a lot of our fajitas, molcajetes, as well as (seafood) and prime cuts of meat like steaks, rib eye and New York cuts,” he said.

Everything is cooked fresh daily. “Rice, beans, all our meats … a lot is cooked to order. We notice from a lot of restaurants that they'll cook off certain items for the whole week and have them frozen to reheat as they go, but we don't do that here.”

Like many businesses that started in the last several years, a defining moment for Javi's was the Covid-19 pandemic, which occurred a little over a year after it opened.

“After Covid hit, we started doing even better (business). People were staying local and we were just doing to-go orders,” Francisco Gonzalez said, adding that the uptick enabled him and his wife to pursue their second location in Sunnyside, which is similar in size to the Pasco restaurant and caters more toward nightlife as it features a bar, lounge, pool tables, darts and more, as well as regular live music offerings.

“It kind of came at a perfect time because when we were a month away from opening, they had massive layoffs at my job. Then, a week after we opened the (second) restaurant it ended up getting busy enough that my wife had to quit her job, too, as a schoolteacher,” he said.

His wife is now a stay-at-home mom and ongoing partner in the business along with several of their family members, including both of his parents, his brother, who manages the Pasco location, his sister and several cousins.

Riding on the success and revenue from their first two businesses, Tri-Cities was the next place to go given the large Latino community.

The previous restaurant building owners prided themselves on maintaining the retro restaurant appearance, but beneath the decor there was a lot in need of updating.

In April 2022, the Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business announced the retirement of Chinese Gardens' longtime owners, Ted and Amy Wong.

The Wongs put the building up for sale shortly thereafter and sold it to the Gonzalezes for $700,000 in 2023, according to the property records.

Francisco Gonzalez said they have invested more than $200,000 in renovations, including replacing the HVAC system, fumigation, new hard floors throughout the 8,052-square-foot facility, new bar and kitchen equipment, reupholstering seating, new lighting, repainting inside and out and all new decor, among others.

“We're still not done,” he noted.

One novelty diners may recognize from the restaurant's former life is the collection of 325 vintage Jim Beam whiskey decanters. However, Francisco Gonzalez said they probably won't stay in favor of decor that celebrates the culture of the restaurant and its cuisine.

Francisco Gonzalez said he looks forward to being able to host more events such as DJ nights, live music, karaoke, a “speakeasy” themed night and more at the new Pasco location like the Sunnyside Javi's is able to.

However, he's run up against code roadblocks with the city of Pasco as other downtown businesses occupying older buildings have likewise encountered.

He said the biggest is “they want older buildings to retrofit sprinkler systems ... which would cost us $60,000,” Francisco Gonzalez said.

He described Pasco's building code as very stringent to the point “of thinking about just selling the place” and relocating elsewhere in Tri-Cities.

For now, he's sticking it out.

“We're here to serve the community,” he said. “We're grateful for all our customers and the community that's been supporting us and keeping us busy.”

In just a few weeks, they will be opening a Javi's Chicken and Churros food truck, which will be permanently parked at Single Hill Brewery in Yakima.

“We're going to do birria, tacos, a more basic menu but also some really good vegetarian options over there,” Francisco Gonzalez said.

Javi's also offers catering and online ordering.

Reflecting on the busy past seven years, he and Laura are proud to have a Javi's location to pass down to each of their children, which was one of their business aspirations from the onset.

With three restaurants and a food truck under their belt, one might wonder where they plan to go next, but Francisco Gonzalez said, “This is kind of where I want to stop. I want to be able to dedicate more time to my kids right now while they're little.”

Hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday to Thursday, 10 a.m. to 1 a.m. Friday to Sunday, closed Mondays.

Javi's Chicken and Churros: 1520 N. Fourth Ave., Pasco, 626-716-0813, javischickenchurros.com.

Oops, something went wrong

As gold races to new records, Wall Street analysts have rushed to raise their price targets, with the latest call from Macquarie Group predicting the precious metal will touch $3,500 in the third quarter.

On Thursday, gold futures (GC=F) climbed above $2,990 per ounce as a trade war intensified and the release of modest inflation data raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve may be more inclined to cut rates this year.

"Year-to-date, gold has been running ahead of our expectations," Marcus Garvey, head of commodities strategy at Macquarie, wrote on Thursday.

"We are raising our gold price forecast to a 3Q25 quarter average peak of $3,150 per ounce and our single point price high to $3,500 per ounce," Garvey wrote.

"President Trump's rapid move to announce, if not always to enact, import tariffs has contributed to geopolitical uncertainty and boosted inflation expectations, helping push down front-end real rates and supporting gold in the face of periodic USD strength and initially reduced expectations for Fed rate cuts," the strategist wrote.

The target raise comes after strategists at BNP Paribas called for prices to push above $3,100 per ounce in the second quarter.

"The Trump administration issuing a slew of tariff threats and the realigning of international relationships have added a new layer of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, providing a significant boost to gold," BNP's David Wilson wrote in a note on Wednesday.

Gold futures have rallied more than 11% year to date, hitting multiple record highs since January.

Wall Street has attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared.

Institutional investors have shipped elevated amounts of physical gold bars to vaults in New York in a move to front-run tariffs and take advantage of a price disparity between London and New York.

Last month, Goldman Sachs analysts raised their year-end gold price forecast to $3,100 per ounce, up from their prior projection of $2,890.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets closed lower Thursday as further threats from U.S. President Donald Trump pressured global trading relationships.

Wine and spirits firms Pernod Ricard, Rémy Cointreau and Davide Campari were all more than 3% lower after Trump threatened on social media to place a 200% tariff on wines, champagnes and alcoholic products coming out of France and other countries in the European Union. Trump said he was responding to the EU's own new 50% tariff on whiskey out on the U.S.

Drinks giant Diageo, owner of brands including Johnnie Walker and Guinness, was just 0.2% lower, while luxury conglomerate LVMH — parent firm of Moët & Chandon and Hennessy — closed 1.1% lower.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 ended the session 0.15% lower with sectors diverging. Autos were the biggest laggards down 1.7%, as traders continued to assess the impact of the latest U.S. tariffs as well as counter-tariffs from the European Union, Canada and beyond on the industry.

Pharma giant Novo Nordisk was among the top performers, rebounding from Tuesday losses tied to disappointing weight loss drug trial results, to trade 4% higher. Analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux on Thursday upgraded the stock to buy from hold, citing priced-in risks and expected higher sales of its Wegovy treatment.

The Stoxx 600 snapped a four-session losing streak on Wednesday amid optimism about a ceasefire in the Ukraine-Russia war and lower-than-expected U.S. inflation.

The inflation figures bolstered optimism about the direction of the economy — amid growing concerns about a U.S. recession — although economists warn that tariffs are likely to quickly lead to higher prices for consumers.

However, U.S. stocks opened lower Thursday amid the latest trade volatility.

Thursday marks the second and final day of CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore, where business leaders, investors and policymakers are discussing the brewing global trade war. Follow CNBC's live coverage from event here.

Shares of LVMH, which trade in France, shed 1% on Thursday.

The luxury stock, which owns brands such as Hennessy and Moet & Chandon, slipped on more trade war fears after President Donald Trump threatened to levy a 200% tariff on wine and champagne exported from the European Union. LVMH is now on pace for its ninth straight negative day, which would mark its longest losing streak since August 2021.

Gold's April-dated futures were last trading near 2,963.3, near their highs of the session. They were closing in on their record high of 2,974 from Feb. 24.

Gold has gained 1.6% week to date, pacing for their second weekly gain. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX), which encompasses both gold and silver miners, rose 2% and was on pace for its third straight day of gains.

The S&P 500 opened lower on Thursday, giving up some of its Wednesday gains

The market benchmark shed 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 85 points, or 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4%.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he plans to put a 200% tariff on alcohol from France and other European nations in the latest escalation of global trade tensions.

The U.S. tariff comes after the European Union moved to reinstate an import tax on American whiskey.

"The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky. If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.," Trump said on Truth Social.

The producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation, was flat in February — another potential sign that inflation pressures may be ebbing. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a month-over-month increase of 0.3%.

Shares of British food delivery firm Deliveroo were down 6.9% on Thursday morning after the company said it expected slower growth this year.

The company reported net profit of £2.9 million ($3.7 million) in 2024, compared with a £31.8 million loss incurred during the previous year, marking the food company's first time making a profit since it was founded in 2013.

Its gross transaction value per order was £25.1 million in 2024, up 3% from 2023, and its orders increased 2% year-on-year to 296 million in 2024. Revenue also rose 2% to £2.07 billion.

The company cited reduced cost of living pressures during the year in some of its major markets and increased demand for its grocery business, for its growth.

Will Shu, Deliveroo's founder and CEO, said the company's first full-year profit and positive free cash flows indicate that its strategy is working.

For 2025, the company expects GTV to be in the high-single digits percentage growth while adjusted is forecast to come in lower than in 2024 as the company makes "focused investments to drive further growth opportunities."

Deliveroo now also sees its margin growth to hit 4% from 2026, compared with a previous forecast of reaching that objective by the timeline.

Deutsche Bank flagged autos as a "growing risk" for its portfolio that is being "monitored closely given the challenging economic environment in Europe, Electric Vehicles (EV) transition and competition in China," Germany's largest lender said in its annual report out Thursday. 

Europe's auto sector now faces further pressures from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and separate duties on goods from countries in which several carmakers have production lines. 

Deutsche Bank noted the industry outlook "remains subdued," while also warning of the impact of "U.S. import tariffs affecting sales in the key market U.S., competition from China and persistent excess capacities around the globe."

— Ruxandra Iordache

Hugo Boss on Thursday posted fourth-quarter sales in line with expectations, but provided a tepid growth forecast for the year, citing "macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility" and continued weakness in China.

The German fashion house recorded revenues of 1.25 billion euros [$1.35 billion] in the three-month period, just marginally ahead of the 1.2 billion euros forecast by LSEG analysts. Net income came in at 126 million euros, just shy of the 128 million euros anticipated.

Full year sales increased 3% to total 4.3 billion euros, also in line with forecast. Operating income fell 12% over the period to 361 million euros, after the company lowered its full-year outlook in July on challenging macroeconomic factors.

The company said it expected those challenges to persist into 2025, forecasting group sales to increase or decline by up to 2% over the year. Asia-Pacific sales were cited as a particular laggard amid "ongoing uncertainties regarding the further recovery of industry development in China."

"Subdued consumer sentiment and muted store traffic have been weighing on business performance since the beginning of the year, with the overall market environment remaining uncertain also going forward," the company said in a statement.

The chief executive of Ferrari on Thursday said the company was prepared for potential U.S. tariffs on European automakers.

"We are ready with some countermeasures," Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna told CNBC's Robert Frank at CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore on Thursday.

"We are watching what's going to happen in the next month, next weeks ... we are on the same boat in terms of tariffs," he added.

European automakers have been grappling with trade policy uncertainty in recent months, with the threat of U.S. import tariffs raising alarm bells among many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

Prospects for a broad deal between the U.S. and China have improved following Donald Trump's election as president, two former diplomats said during a panel discussion at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE.

David Adelman, former U.S. ambassador to Singapore, said Trump's tough stance on trade put him in a stronger position to overcome domestic opposition when negotiating with Beijing, much like when former U.S. President Richard Nixon reestablished ties with China in the 1970s.

"No one can accuse Trump of being soft on China," he said.

Kishore Mahbubani, a prominent former Singapore diplomat, said both the U.S. and China know there will be no winners in a conflict between the two giants.

The private equity market is likely to experience a shake-up, with some fund managers unable to raise cash amid difficulty in monetizing current investments.

Serena Tan, CEO of Gaia Investment Partners, a Malaysian fund of funds manager, said exits from existing private equity funds are still challenging because of lackluster activity in the initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions markets. This meant there was less cash to recycle into new private equity investments, she said.

Many private equity funds may have raised their last funds, Tan added.

European markets are expected to open in mixed territory Thursday.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index is expected to open 8 points higher at 8,537, Germany's DAX down 47 points at 22,611, France's CAC 2 points lower at 7,983 and Italy's FTSE MIB 32 points lower at 38,230, according to data from IG. 

Investors in Europe will be keeping an eye on earnings from Hugo Boss, Hannover Re and Deliveroo. There are no major data releases taking place today.

Spirit Airlines is out of bankruptcy, hitting its target to emerge in the first quarter, after a crippling few years. CEO Ted Christie says the carrier is leaner and ready to take on competitors, including rival Southwest Airlines.

Earlier this week, Southwest shocked customers by announcing it will start charging for checked bags for the first time in its half-century of flying, a huge strategy move for the largest domestic U.S. carrier. (There are some exceptions to Southwest new bag rules, which take effect in late May.)

"I think it's going to be painful for a little bit as they find their footing, and we're going to take advantage of that," Spirit's Christie said in an interview Thursday.

Southwest had been a standout in the U.S. by offering all customers two free checked bags, a perk that has endured recessions, spikes in fuel prices and other crises while most rivals introduced bag fees and raised them every few years.

Spirit Airlines, on the other hand, made a la carte pricing common in the U.S., with fees for seat assignments, checked bags and other add-ons. It's a strategy most large airlines, except for Southwest, have copied in one form or another.

As Southwest starts charging for bags and introduces its first basic economy class, which doesn't include a seat assignment or allow free changes, Spirit could possibly win over customers, Christie said.

Southwest said it would get rid of its single-class open seating model last year.

"There at least was an audience of people who were intentionally selecting and flying Southwest because they felt that it was easy. They knew they were going to get two bags," Christie said. "Now that that's no longer the case, it's easy to say that they're going to widen their aperture and they're now going to look around."

Spirit is far smaller than Southwest and even smaller than it was last year, but it competes with the airline in cities like Kansas City, Missouri; Nashville, Columbus, Ohio; and Milwaukee. If customers look on travel sites like Expedia, where Southwest is a new entrant, Spirit's tickets could be cheaper and appear higher in results, Christie said.

Other airline executives have also said they expect to win over some Southwest customers.

Delta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein said at a JPMorgan industry conference Tuesday that there are consumers who choose Southwest based on its free-bag perk "and now those customers are up for grabs."

Spirit, for its part, has recently been offering more ticket bundles that include things like seat assignments and luggage.

The carrier is now focused on returning to profitability. It posted a net loss of more than $1.2 billion last year, more than double its loss in 2023 as it grappled with grounded jets because of a Pratt & Whitney engine recall, higher costs, more domestic competition and a failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways.

Spirit has rejected multiple recent merger attempts by fellow budget carrier Frontier Airlines. Christie said Thursday that nothing is "off the table" and that a fifth-largest airline as a low cost carrier in the U.S. makes sense, but that the airline is focused on stabilizing itself after bankruptcy.

Through its restructuring process, which started in November, Spirit said it reduced its debt by about $795 million. The transaction converted debt into equity for major creditors. The carrier also received a $350 million equity infusion. 

Spirit plans to relist its shares on a stock exchange but hasn't set a date yet.

Oops, something went wrong

The federal government could be in for a shutdown in less than two days after Senate Democrats offered up a plan to play hardball and oppose a House bill that would keep the government open until September alongside spending cuts.

The counteroffer from Democrats — with the votes of at least a few of them required for any bill to pass — would keep the government open for a month but it faces little chance of final passage in time with Senate Republicans likely to block it and House lawmakers having already departed Washington anyway.

Sen. Chuck Schumer and his colleagues tried to plot a strategy Wednesday — with reporters stationed outside able to hear audible shouting at one point — with the Democratic leader then emerging to say, "Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to invoke cloture on the House CR."

But Republican leaders are confident they have Schumer and his colleagues cornered with Senate GOP leader John Thune saying of Democratic shutdown threats Thursday morning: "It's time for Democrats to fish or cut bait."

Thune also told reporters he was open to an amendment vote on the Democrat's one-month plan.

The standoff appears likely to lead to multiple votes in the coming days with economic and political prognosticators reacting with a mix of increased odds in the chances of a shutdown — alongside a jaundiced but unsettled view of what the effect might be on the economy either way.

"Historically, government shutdowns have had limited market reaction," analysts at Raymond James wrote in a note to clients this week. "That is likely to remain the case, but adding to the significant amount of uncertainty coming out of DC is unwelcome in the current market climate."

That climate is one of economic unease following recent sell-offs that put markets in correction territory, cuts to S&P 500 year-end targets, and a trade war breaking out on multiple fronts with President Trump seemingly unconcerned about the impact of it all on markets.

It isn't helping that Wall Street is also increasingly worried about stagflation and that Trump, in recent days, has also refused to rule out a recession.

"Taking a shutdown off the table could slightly improve sentiment amid a tough week for markets," Tobin Marcus of Wolfe Research wrote in his own note.

Overall, plenty of observers have raised the odds of a shutdown in recent days with additional reminders that the uncertainty is unlikely to dissipate anytime soon.

As of Monday midday, prediction market Polymarket put the odds of a shutdown this weekend at 45% and competing site Kalshi assessed the chances of one before the end of the calendar year just above 50/50.

The coming brinksmanship is set to cap a week of standoffs on Capitol Hill that began with 1-in-3 odds of a shutdown as House Republicans announced a plan to muscle through their plan with slim margins and plenty of initial skepticism that they could succeed.

But succeed they did, with a 217 to 213 vote that advanced the stopgap measure.

In the end, House Speaker Mike Johnson only saw one member of his own party, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, oppose the bill and one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, move to support the GOP plan.

But the path to passage in the Senate, which requires the consent of 60 of the chamber's 100 senators, was always more complicated. Schumer weighed in Wednesday to say Democrats would be opposed.

"Our caucus is unified," he said, pushing instead the one-month plan "that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass."

The situation is further heightened by budget cuts in the House GOP plan that could affect an array of programs — mostly notably a proposed $1 billion cut to the budget of Washington, D.C.

That move has led to unease in the nation's Capitol in recent days on fears it could lead to things like cuts in government services and forced teacher layoffs or furloughs.

A "recess at the Capitol" protest focused on this school issue even took place Thursday morning focused on the school issue.

There is also ample fear among Democrats that Trump and Elon Musk and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought, who would have outsized power in the event of a shutdown, could use the shutdown as a pretext for further or laying off even more federal workers.

As for next steps, Senate Democrats appear to be pushing for a standalone or amendment vote on their monthlong plan (without things like D.C. cuts) before any final passage vote, but Republicans are able and likely willing to block such an approach.

Assuming that initial vote fails, a vote on the seven-month funding bill is then likely to be considered with the question being whether enough Senate Democrats — approximately eight are expected to be needed to avert a shutdown — would be willing to vote for the package to keep the government open.

In any case, the drama is set to continue for Washington and economic observers up until almost the literal last minute after Senator Thune filed cloture on the House plan on Wednesday night — but Senate rules will likely mean a final vote isn't possible until Friday.

Oops, something went wrong

If tariffs on French macarons and Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano weren't enough, Europhiles and the country club set are poised to take another big hit — with French bubbly.

“If this Tariff [on US whiskey] is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,” President Trump declared on Truth Social Thursday morning, following a move by the EU with reciprocal tariffs.

Sacrebleu.

Though duties imposed on Italian cheeses and French champagne are causing some dismay, most big European exports to the US are more industrial — think finished manufactured goods like pharmaceutical products, machinery, and autos.

Just this morning, another maker of luxury goods — Ferrari (RACE) — said it will have to respond to the tariff threat. After all, the wealthy don't like to waste money either.

“We are ready with some countermeasures,” Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said at CNBC's Converge Live event in Singapore on Thursday morning. “We are in a scenario planning phase to manage as best whatever will happen,” Vigna said, without adding any details.

Ferrari, which only produces its cars from its factory in Maranello, Italy, is facing a potential 25% tariff on European autos imported to the US. It will most likely raise prices on its vehicles or absorb some (or all) of the tariff cost.

Yesterday, German luxury rival Porsche (P911.DE) gave a clue as to who might be paying tariffs for its highly desirable sports cars and SUVs.

"When the subject [of tariffs] becomes concrete, we will assess which price options there are to pass on to consumers," Porsche CFO Jochen Breckner said Wednesday, indicating its customers will be paying for Trump's tariffs, not the company.

"We have a very, very strong brand, a great customer base, a loyal customer base, and great product. So in the first place, we would look into additional pricing," Breckner added.

But it isn't just tariffs on EU-made goods that are a threat to European automakers, many assemble vehicles in Mexico as well. The Trump White House is poised to enact 25% tariffs on Mexican-made goods starting April 2.

Germany's BWW (BMW.DE), which has a major plant in Mexico, where the 3-series sedan and high-performance M2 sports car are made, is taking a different tack with tariff costs.

Per the Wall Street Journal, BMW is telling dealers it will absorb the costs of new tariffs on imports from Mexico and “price protect” those vehicles until May 1.

But if the tariff situation remains for longer, the company may need to “reassess” that policy.

Finally, German behemoth Volkswagen (VWAGY), the world's No. 2 automaker by sales, is a big tariff target as it makes a number of vehicles at its plant in Puebla, Mexico.

Countermeasures like increasing production at its US plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., would need “a bit more time,” Volkswagen Brand CEO Thomas Schäfer said on Thursday, according to Reuters.

And shifting production from Mexico, where the popular Tiguan SUV is made, to the US is “not realistic” in the short term, Schäfer said.

"For now, we are watching the situation and doing back-up plans for long-term solutions," Schäfer said.

With increasing production of current US-made vehicles or adding production of other cars at its US plant off the cards, VW has two options — raise prices or absorb them.

Both options are unappealing for VW, as higher prices would make its vehicles less competitive while eating the tariff costs would hit margins.

With no new clarity on the tariff threat emanating from the White House and EU negotiators, European automakers face a stressful and, as Porsche execs indicated, “sleepless” time in limbo.

Bottom line: The Moët & Chandon champagne and Whispering Angel French rosé will remain on ice, for now.

Turmoil on Wall Street is keeping financial planners' phones ringing as 401(k) holders watch their retirement account balances fall with the stock markets they're tied to. For the most part, they're being told to sit tight and breathe through it.

“I've seen more concern and fear with clients that I've talked to over the last month or so than I have since the financial crisis,” said Jude Boudreaux, a senior financial planner at the Planning Center, a New Orleans-based firm. He added that this week has been especially hectic. “People are really concerned.”

Vanese Pitts said she watched her husband's 401(k) shed $8,000 on Monday, when a wide-ranging market selloff pushed the S&P 500 to its lowest close since September. The sharp downturn in recent days followed several weeks of losses on Wall Street that have left the stock index about 4.8% lower than where it started the year. Many 401(k)s follow the broad-based S&P closely.

“It was just insane,” said the 41-year-old, who's raising two kids alongside her husband, a software engineer, in Birmingham, Alabama.

Pitts was among those who took to social media platforms to crowdsource advice and commiserate this week, as President Donald Trump's trade war with America's closest allies sends tremors through millions of savers' retirement investments. His chaotic rollout of new tariffs, the retaliatory levies they've triggered, and an ongoing purge of federal workers have stoked fears of rebounding inflation and a potential economic downturn.

Lee Baker, founder and president of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta, said he'd been fielding anxious calls from clients — most of them in or near retirement — for the past week or so. He was surprised to hear so much concern “from people who, mathematically, really don't have a problem in terms of making it through whatever this might be,” he said.

I've seen more concern and fear with clients that I've talked to over the last month or so than I have since the financial crisis.

Jude Boudreaux, The Planning Center, New Orleans

“Clients, particularly in times like these, don't want to hear, ‘Essentially, do nothing. It's going to be all right,'” Baker said.

That was the gist of Katie Szykman's mother's advice when the 23-year-old Philadelphian called in a panic. She had been contributing 6% of her paycheck to her employer's 403(b) — a type of retirement account offered by public schools and charities — for barely two years and watched more than $1,000 vanished in a matter of days, she said.

“My mom was like, ‘Don't even touch it,'” said Szykman, who works in marketing at a local nonprofit. “Everyone was always saying make sure you invest in your retirement, so [that was] the first thing I did once I got my first job outside of college. I can't say that I'm surprised. It just feels disheartening a little bit.”

Szykman said she found some comfort knowing that downturns have occurred in recent decades and that “people have gotten out of it.” Still, she feels frustrated having another economy-related issue to worry about — especially when “it didn't have to be this way,” she said.

“Having that money just kind of diminish a little bit when groceries are so expensive, it just takes a little bit of an extra toll,” she added.

Plenty of retirement savers have forgone the advice of Szykman's mother. Empower, a financial firm that administers retirement plans for some 19 million investors, told CNBC Wednesday that some account holders are increasingly shifting money toward safer investments. though the company emphasized that it's “not seeing widespread capitulation despite the downturn.”

While the activity accounts for only a sliver of overall balances, trading in 401(k)s has doubled over the past three weeks as savers yank money out of funds calibrated toward a target retirement date and those linked to big companies' stocks, according to the Alight Solutions 401(k) index. Lower-risk investments including government bonds, money market accounts and so-called stable value funds have swelled over the same period.

Financial planners generally urge clients to think carefully before adjusting their 401(k)s, though changing the makeup of an account's portfolio is far different than withdrawing funds early, which entails paying a penalty.

In terms of investments, Baker said those looking to build some cushion into their portfolios could look to TIPS, or Treasury inflation-protected securities, which are indexed to inflation to guard investors from a decline in purchasing power. TIPS funds have returned an average 3.4% so far this year, according to Morningstar, making it a top-performing bond fund category.

He also pointed to a recent uptake in “buffered products” like S&P 500-tracked exchange-traded funds, where high-performing assets are locked and evenly proportioned for a period of time. But investors who move in that direction should be comfortable missing out on potential gains, Baker warned. If markets reverse and bound higher, “remember we had this conversation, because in this moment you were afraid,” he said.

Some planners also advised having a good mix of international funds in their portfolios.

Previously, “international [stocks were] something that you kind of had to apologize for” as an adviser, said Samuel Deane, founder and president of Rora Wealth in Atlanta. But some ETFs that exclude U.S. stocks have been performing remarkably well, he said.

Boudreaux agreed but pointed out that many international companies' revenues are heavily linked to the U.S. market, limiting the potential appeal of foreign stocks.

“It's a very globally connected world, and that applies to our investments also,” he said.

Clients, particularly in times like these, don't want to hear, ‘Essentially, do nothing. It's going to be all right.'

Planners also said it's OK to take a more conservative approach with future retirement contributions rather than touching what's already there.

“People are tightening up,” said Kevin Mahoney, founder of Illumint, a Washington, D.C.-based firm. “So there's some uncertainty about spending or investing savings now. It's less about existing investments and more focus on potential investments that they might have planned.”

And for investors nearer to retirement than others, now is also a good time to focus on cash flow, said Boudreaux.

“I like clients to have a good cash reserve heading into retirement,” he said. “It allows them to be more selective when they sell from their portfolio, and to not have to sell every month if we are heading into a downturn.”

“The goal with any of these things is to respond — and not react,” he added.

As difficult as it's been for Pitts to “just let it stay and hope for the best,” she said she and her husband aren't touching their retirement funds. Instead, they're thinking about getting a financial adviser to help them protect their savings.

“Every day it's something different,” Pitts said. “Something that's not good.”

A composite decking company is looking to open a $70 million manufacturing plant in Lackawanna.

Michigan-based group Deckorators has submitted an application to the Erie County Industrial Development Agency to lease property on Commerce Drive. The application states that Deckorators is also planning to make improvements to the existing property and construct a new facility.

The company will have a public hearing on Friday with the ECIDA, during which anyone will be able to express their opinions either in favor of or opposed to the project. The hearing will also address potential tax breaks.

The hearing will take place at 9 a.m. at Lackawanna City Hall. A live stream will be made available on the ECIDA website.

Belgian federal prosecutors say they've arrested several people as part of a corruption probe linked to the European Parliament and Huawei

Belgian Prosecutors Arrest Suspects in Huawei Bribery Probe Targeting EU Parliament

BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgian federal prosecutors on Thursday announced the arrests of several people in a corruption probe linked to the European Parliament and the Chinese company Huawei, which is suspected of bribing EU lawmakers.

The arrests came as an investigation by Le Soir newspaper and other media said lobbyists working for the Chinese telecoms giant were suspected of bribing current or former European Parliament members to promote the company's commercial policies in Europe.

The prosecutor's office confirmed in a statement that the alleged bribery “is said to have benefited Huawei.” 

About 100 federal police officers carried out 21 searches in Brussels, the Flanders and Wallonia regions, and Portugal. The investigating magistrate in charge of the case also asked for seals to be placed on offices inside the EU Parliament allocated to two parliamentary assistants allegedly involved.

Prosecutors said one person was arrested in France.

The suspects would be questioned over “alleged involvement in active corruption within the European Parliament, as well as for forgery and use of forgeries,” prosecutors said. “The offences were allegedly committed by a criminal organization.”

The company said in a statement that “Huawei takes these allegations seriously and will urgently communicate with the investigation to further understand the situation.”

“Huawei has a zero tolerance policy towards corruption or other wrongdoing, and we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations at all times,” it added.

The European Parliament said only that the assembly “takes note of the information" and "always cooperates fully with the judicial authorities.”

Huawei, which makes cellphones and is the biggest maker of networking gear for phone and internet carriers, has been caught in tensions between the United States and China over technology and trade. 

READ:  

Some European nations have followed Washington's lead and banned Huawei's equipment from next-generation mobile networks over allegations that it poses a security risk that could help facilitate Chinese spying. The company has repeatedly denied this.

European Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said the EU's executive branch had no comment regarding the investigation but underlined the commission's security concerns about Huawei and Europe's fifth-generation mobile phone networks.

“The security of our 5G networks is obviously crucial for our economy,” Regnier told reporters. “Huawei represents materially higher risks than other 5G suppliers.”

EU member states should swiftly "adopt decisions to restrict or to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks,” Regnier said. “A lack of swift action would expose the EU as a whole to a clear risk.”

The prosecutor's office said it believes there was corruption “from 2021 to the present day" in various forms, "such as remuneration for taking political positions or excessive gifts such as food and travel expenses or regular invitations to football matches."

Prosecutors also believe payments might have been disguised as business expenses and in some cases may have been directed to third parties. They said they would also look to "detect any evidence of money laundering.”

Police seized several documents and objects during the searches. Staff at Huawei's offices in Brussels declined to comment and turned the lights off inside to avoid photographs taken through the window.

This is the second corruption case targeting the EU Parliament in less than three years. 

In December 2022, the legislature was shaken by a corruption scandal in which Qatari officials were accused of bribing EU officials to play down labor rights concerns ahead of the soccer World Cup.

The scandal scarred the reputation of the EU's only institution comprised of officials elected directly in the 27 member countries. It undermined the assembly's claim to the moral high ground in its own investigations, such as into allegations of corruption in member country Hungary.

EU Greens lawmaker Daniel Freund — who supervised the work of the assembly's ethics body during the scandal, dubbed Qatargate — said Thursday the parliament's reputation is again under threat.

“The risk of corruption in Brussels is high because the EU is so influential," he said. "We need a complete investigation quickly, and finally reforms that will make the Parliament more resistant to corruption.”

According to Follow The Money, an investigative journalism platform, one of the main suspects in the probe is 41-year-old Valerio Ottati, a Belgian-Italian lobbyist who joined Huawei in 2019. 

Before becoming Huawei's EU public affairs director, Ottati was an assistant to two Italian MEPs who were both members of a European Parliament group dealing with China policy, Follow the Money reported.

Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard has reiterated its determination to acquire Seven & i Holdings, although the operator of Japan's top convenience store chain has rejected its offer

Canada's Couche-Tard's Chief Stresses 'Friendly' Interest in Japan's 7-Eleven Chain

TOKYO (AP) — Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard reaffirmed Thursday that it is determined to acquire Seven & i Holdings, although the operator of Japan's top convenience store chain has rejected its offer.

“We are continuing to pursue a friendly, mutually agreeable transaction,” the chairman and founder of Alimentation Couche-Tard, Alain Bouchard, told reporters in Tokyo. 

Bouchard stressed that his company was pursuing a “friendly” transaction, not a hostile takeover. He reiterated his promise to retain local management, saying the merger would be good for 7-Eleven's business.

The chain has more than 20,000 stores nationwide and more than 80,000 outlets around the world, serving an estimated 63 million customers a day, according to Tokyo-based Seven & i Holdings Co. 

In rejecting the Canadian company's offer, Seven & i Holdings said it intends to boost its own corporate value. It also has raised antitrust concerns that it says will come up in the U.S. 

Seven & i appointed a new chief executive this month and announced a share buyback and said it will sell its supermarket subsidiary to U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, to help boost its value and fend off the acquisition.

Last year, Couche-Tard, which operates Circle K stores, proposed acquiring all of Seven & i Holdings shares for $14.86 per share in cash. Media reports now say the offer is for $18.19 per share, or about 7 trillion yen ($47 billion).

Seven & i has made public a letter that Stephen Dacus, its new chief executive, sent to Bouchard in September, explaining why it was rejecting the Canadian company's offer. 

“The proposal is not in the best interest of 7&i shareholders and other stakeholders. We are open to engaging in sincere discussions should you put forth a proposal that fully recognizes our standalone intrinsic value,” Dacus wrote.

Convenience stores, known as “conbini” in Japan, are popular, offering various services such as paying utility bills and selling concert tickets, while selling various everyday goods. 

Seven & i announced a restructuring plan last year to strengthen its U.S. business and streamline operations, closing some Ito-Yokado supermarkets in Japan. In 2023, Seven & i sold its Sogo & Seibu department stores in Japan to Fortress Investment Group, a U.S. fund, for $1.5 billion.

Couche-Tard, founded in 1980 in Quebec, offers coffee, beer, snacks, fuel and lottery tickets. It runs more than 16,800 stores worldwide, including in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

There are now eight businesses near George Floyd Square who've filed lawsuits against the city of Minneapolis, claiming their businesses have suffered because the city failed to open the intersection and 38th and Chicago in a timely and safe manner.

Attorney Michael Healey represents all of the business owners in the suit. He told 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS why his clients are seeking financial compensation.

“The complaint represents both Cup Foods and seven other business owners at the intersection essentially that their businesses were destroyed by the conduct of the city,” said Healey.

The plaintiffs are seeking $49 million, according to court records.

In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs claim they've lost income, employees and their property values have dropped significantly.

A city spokesperson issued a statement which said, in part, “As with all areas of the city, MPD provides 24/7 emergency response to the 38th and Chicago area. Chief O'Hara has assigned two officers to a dedicated beat in this area, focusing on community engagement, relationship-building, and collaborating with local businesses and residents.”

The next court hearing is later this month.

McALLEN, Texas (AP) — The Trump administration moved to drop a civil lawsuit Wednesday against the largest provider of housing for migrant children over allegations of sexual abuse and harassment of unaccompanied minors, saying it also would no longer use the provider.

The motion to dismiss the suit against Southwest Key Programs was filed after the federal government announced it had moved all unaccompanied children to other shelters.

The complaint, filed last year during the Biden administration, alleged a litany of offenses between 2015 and 2023 as Southwest Key Programs, which operates migrant shelters in Texas, Arizona and California, amassed nearly $3 billion in contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services. 

The agency said it stopped sending unaccompanied children to the provider's facilities “out of continuing concerns relating to these placements,” and said it would review grants going to the contractor. In view of the agency's action, the Department of Justice has dismissed its lawsuit against Southwest Key, HHS said in a statement. 

The shelter provider said they were pleased with the decision to dismiss the case. “Southwest Key strongly denied the claims relating to child sexual abuse in our shelters, and there is no settlement or payment required,” the statement Wednesday evening said. 

“We always believed the facts would prove the allegations to be without merit. We thank the Government for its commitment to reviewing the whole record and dropping the case with prejudice,” they added.




This week, Southwest Key Programs furloughed employees across the country. “Due to the unforeseen federal funding freeze and the stop placement order on our unaccompanied minor shelters and Home Study Post Release programs by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, we have made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 5,000 Southwest Key Programs' employees,” the company said in a statement shared Tuesday.

According to allegations in the 2024 lawsuit, Southwest Key employees, including supervisors, raped, inappropriately touched or solicited sex and nude images of children beginning at least in 2015.

Among the accusations: One employee “repeatedly sexually abused” three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas, with the 8-year-old telling investigators the worker “entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their ‘private area.'”

The lawsuit also alleged that another employee, at a shelter in Mesa, Arizona, took a 15-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.

Children were warned not to report the alleged abuse and threatened with violence against themselves or their families if they did, according to the lawsuit. Victims testified that in some instances, other workers knew about the abuse but failed to report or concealed it, the complaint said.

“DOJ's lawsuit revealed horrific sexual abuse and inhumane treatment of children detained in Southwest Key shelters,” said Leecia Welch, an attorney who represents unaccompanied children in a separate case. “It's shocking to me that the government now turns a blind eye to their own contractor's actions. I hope the impacted children will have other legal recourse and support in healing from their abuse.”

The lawsuit may not be over. On Wednesday, the National Center for Youth Law asked the court not to dismiss the case and grant them an opportunity to formally intervene on behalf of those affected by the alleged abuse. If granted, they would have 30 days to file a motion in the lawsuit.

At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020. 

The civil lawsuit had sought a jury trial and monetary damages for the victims.

Bitcoin maximalists like Strategy's Michael Saylor often tout the cryptocurrency as a form of digital gold, a safe haven asset that can protect holders from financial storms. 

Donald Trump's White House has echoed the argument that Bitcoin's scarcity makes it ideal as a store of value.

That narrative has now been challenged — again — after the digital asset's price nosedived alongside tech stocks like Meta, Nvidia, and Elon Musk's Tesla. By contrast, gold has surged to record heights.

In short, Bitcoin is behaving less like digital gold and more like a glorified tech stock, market watchers say.

“If Bitcoin equals ‘digital gold,' then time to act like it. Otherwise, it will reinforce the narrative that it's simply a high beta asset,” said ETF Store President Nate Geraci on X. “Most of crypto equals tech play [in my opinion]. So it currently is and will be caught up in a broader tech sell-off.”

The debate about Bitcoin's role as a safe haven asset comes as it shed 15% of its value over the past month. 

It now trades at roughly $82,000. Some experts even suggest it will plunge as low as its previous March 2024 high of $74,000.

The overall crypto market's value dropped 18% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has dropped 11% in the same period. 

Trump triggered the plunge after instating, retracting, then reinstating, re-retracting, and re-reinstating tariffs against the US' closest trading partners Mexico and Canada. 

The back and forth prompted Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly to describe US trade policy as a “psychodrama.”

This is not the first time Bitcoin has failed to live up to its reputation as a safe haven. During the March 2020 Covid-induced crash, the asset plunged more than 50% in a two-day period.

Still, the digital gold narrative has picked up speed of late. 

The White House referred to Bitcoin's safe haven potential in Trump's executive order to create a national stockpile of the asset. 

“Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve,” it said. 

The argument is that the country will be able to hedge against financial instability by storing up the cryptocurrency. It holds gold and petroleum for the same reason. 

Other top officials, like Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hum a similar tune. 

In December, Powell said, “it's just like gold, only digital.”

Industry heavyweights like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Euro Pacific chief economist Peter Schiff have echoed that sentiment over the years.

Others adopt a more measured approach. 

In May, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas described Bitcoin as investment hot sauce, something to add to a traditional portfolio made out of stocks and bonds. 

What made it interesting to him, compared with other spicy alternatives, “is this underlying story about hedging the devaluation of the dollar.” 

“To me, Bitcoin is like gold, but as a teenager,” Balchunas told The Block.

However, its recent price action says otherwise — and supporters are getting antsy. 

“Can't act like a high beta asset with every sell-off,” Geraci said.

Bitcoin's (BTC) role in decentralized finance (DeFi) is growing as the world's largest cryptocurrency evolves from more than just a store of value, Binance Research said in a report Thursday.

The Bitcoin network is "evolving into a broader decentralized finance ecosystem with the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi," analyst Moulik Nagesh wrote.

This is a sector that "unlocks bitcoin's capital efficiency" with the use of financial applications focused on lending, staking, stablecoins and decentralized exchanges (DEX's), the report said.

DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without the need for traditional intermediaries.

Binance noted that only ~0.8% of the bitcoin supply is currently being used in DeFi, and this presents a large "untapped opportunity." In fact, last year, Julian Love, a deal analyst at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, said the opportunity could be as much as $1 trillion.

Binance Research report said that Bitcoin needs layer 2s as the network lacks "native programmability," unlike smart contract-based layer 1s. A layer 1 network is the base layer or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.

While there has been some progress on the development of Bitcoin layer-2 networks, these platforms need greater adoption and liquidity incentives to be able to scale up effectively, Binance Research said.

The network's security model is faced with "long-term sustainability challenges" as block rewards will continue to halve, the report said, thereby reducing miner incentives.

The long-term viability of Bitcoin DeFi is dependent on execution, the further development of layer-2s, and the "ability to align with bitcoin's unique value proposition," the report added.

United States President Donald Trump recently announced the U.S. would establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve of Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, Solana and Cardano. This move, he said, would make the U.S. "the crypto capital of the world."

Once a vocal crypto-skeptic, Trump now frames his support as an embrace of technologies that champion freedom and innovation.

However, the problem with Trump's view is that it assumes crypto will lead to the elimination of financial intermediaries. By replacing trust with transparency, cryptocurrency promises to put individuals in charge of their monetary transactions.

Our research demonstrates that this is only a partial view. In reality, crypto is dependent on social practices behind the technology.

Crypto-believers often blame greedy financiers as the cause of the Great Recession in 2008. But we argue that crypto is not immune to these same risks.

Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital money that trades on a blockchain. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that allows users to trade pseudo-anonymously.

Public blockchains operate on a distributed peer-to-peer network. This network provides each user a complete record of transactions that is updated in real time. Users can send digital cash between themselves without relying on a centralized authority.

Since each user has a full record of transactions, the system promises full transparency. But our research demonstrates that public blockchains, and the cryptocurrencies that run on them, do not actually replace trust with transparency.

Speculation, manipulation and market crashes remain very real dangers, regardless of whether the financial system is centralized or decentralized.

We studied the communications between the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the early Bitcoin community. We found the development and implementation of cryptocurrencies relies on negotiations between individuals. Who has a final say on which line of code will prevail depends on a social hierarchy dominated by insiders.

Centralization of power in the hands of insiders is still a major issue in the cryptocurrency space. This is particularly an issue for emerging cryptocurrencies like memecoins. Memecoins are a type of cryptocurrency named after internet memes or similar jokes. They draw their value entirely from speculation.

The Trump Organization recently launched memecoins $TRUMP and $MELANIA. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has concluded that memecoins do not qualify as securities, and therefore are outside its regulatory purview. Not only are memecoins risky, but they come with a significant risk of insider trading.

A recent case study on the memecoin $LIBRA shows how influencers, anonymous developers and centralized exchanges facilitate market distortions, often at the expense of retail investors.

When cryptocurrencies are outside the scope of regulation, individuals behind the technology can profit from insider information. This is less of a risk with widely traded cryptocurrencies like Ether and Bitcoin, but investors should be aware that any technology is reliant on the people who design the code and regulate its changes.

Personal views towards privacy, for instance, can impact governance decisions. These beliefs can have important implications for the value and usability of any technology, cryptocurrencies included.

Our research suggests cryptocurrency insiders can artificially inflate the value of their coins by talking them up, effectively creating value out of nothing.

By using economic and accounting language to describe Bitcoin, the early Bitcoin community effectively turned a string of zeroes and ones into something that could be measured, valued and recognized. Economists argue that even fiat currency is backed by a type of belief—trust in institutions.

Bitcoin, too, relies on belief, but a different kind. Its value is based users' collective confidence in the technology and security of the network, a phenomenon known as the network effect. As more people adopt Bitcoin, its perceived value rises, creating a self-sustaining cycle of belief and value based on market demand.

Recently, American stockbroker and anti-crypto advocate Peter Schiff accused Trump of manipulating the cryptocurrency market following the announcement of the strategic crypto reserve. Schiff has called for a congressional investigation into Trump and his team to determine who may have profited from the announcement, which triggered a massive increase in crypto prices.

Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, their values are highly susceptible to herd behavior, and public sentiment has a significant effect on cryptocurrency returns.

Our research and other studies like it have shown that cryptocurrency is subject to important value changes based on announcements by a small group of influential individuals.

We caution anyone interested in investing in crypto to do their homework by examining the underlying economics of a coin, getting to know the team behind it and evaluating their risk tolerance before moving forward.

With thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, distinguishing between a promising investment, a speculative gamble or even scams is crucial.

Despite the uncertain and unpredictable nature of digital assets, one thing is certain: the conversation around crypto is far from over.

A federal jury in the Northern District of California on Wednesday convicted cryptocurrency entrepreneur Rowland Marcus Andrade of wire fraud and money laundering connected to the sale of a token called AML Bitcoin.



The charges stemmed from an initial coin offering Andrade conducted for AML Bitcoin in 2017 and 2018. Early court filings covered by CoinDesk alleged Andrade, a Texas resident, falsely told investors that AML Bitcoin tokens would ultimately be converted into a tradeable AML Bitcoin currency — a cryptocurrency that never launched and was named to resemble the popular Bitcoin token.



The conviction marks the conclusion of one of the first and longest-running crypto "pump-and-dump" cases to involve U.S. federal prosecutors.



The Department of Justice named famed D.C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff a co-conspirator and he pleaded guilty in 2020, paying more than $50,000 in disgorgement and interest. Abramoff is better known for his involvement in a federal corruption scandal that resulted in his imprisonment and was depicted in the film "Casino Jack."



A statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice accused Andrade of diverting "more than $2 million in proceeds from the sale of AML Bitcoin" and using it on "personal expenses, including the purchase of two properties in Texas and two luxury automobiles."



According to the statement, Andrade also falsely claimed that the Panama Canal Authority was close to permitting AML Bitcoin to be used for ships passing through the Panama Canal when no such agreement existed.



"Fraudsters often tout new and innovative technology in order to raise money from investors. But raising money through lies and misrepresentations is neither new nor innovative. It's unlawful, plain and simple," said Acting United States Attorney Patrick D. Robbins. "If you deceive investors to enrich yourself and spend their money on personal expenses, homes, and property, you will be held to account."



Andrade is scheduled to be sentenced in July. According to the DOJ press release, "he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the wire fraud count and 10 years in prison for the money laundering count, and forfeiture of all property that is traceable to his wire fraud and money laundering violations including property that Andrade bought in Texas."

            At a White House summit last week, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick spoke passionately about the Trump administration's plans to embrace cryptocurrencies, a largely unregulated industry that has historically operated on the fringes of finance.
    


            “Technology is at the foundation of the Trump presidency,” Lutnick said, addressing two dozen crypto CEOs. “We're using the blockchain. We're using bitcoin. We are going to use digital assets to pound forward, and Donald Trump is leading the way.”
    


            The summit was remarkable in part because of the shift in tone from the White House, which under previous administrations, including Trump 1.0, largely kept crypto companies and their volatile digital tokens sidelined. Suddenly, with President Donald Trump's re-election, the government is not only open to the industry — it's actively cheering for it.
    


            But Lutnick's longtime industry ties have come under scrutiny as he pushes the Trump administration's pro-crypto priorities, many of which have questionable benefits for anyone besides existing crypto holders.
    


            Among those existing holders is Cantor Fitzgerald, the family-run Wall Street firm Lutnick headed for decades before handing the reins this year to his 27-year-old son, Brandon.
    


            Cantor Fitzgerald is the primary banking partner for Tether, a controversial stablecoin issuer whose token of the same name is by far the most heavily traded digital asset.

            And the firm is expanding its crypto holdings. On Tuesday, Cantor Fitzgerald announced it was setting up a new bitcoin financing business to provide leverage to institutional investors holding the asset.
    


            The firm also recently acquired a stake — now valued at more than $1.58 billion — in MicroStrategy, the biggest corporate holder of bitcoin on the planet, according to a new report from Accountable.US, a progressive government watchdog group, that was shared exclusively with CNN. Cantor's crypto holdings also include more than $87 million in iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.
    


            It's not clear whether Lutnick personally holds crypto assets.
    


            His 92-page financial disclosure listed holdings in more than 800 entities — all of which he pledged to sell within 90 days of being confirmed, in compliance with conflict-of-interest laws.
    


            It's not clear what the status of that process is.
    


            The Commerce Department didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. Cantor Fitzgerald also didn't respond to a request for comment.
    


            Lutnick's crypto promotion while in office falls into an ethical gray area, according to experts who spoke with CNN.
    


            “He ought to stay out of anything that Cantor Fitzgerald is doing and let other people handle that at the Commerce Department,” said Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush. “Now, I'm going to tell you: There's no law that requires him to do that.”
    


            By putting Cantor Fitzgerald in his adult son's control, Lutnick complied with conflict-of-interest laws that compel Cabinet members to divest certain holdings. Under the law, “divest” could include selling the assets, putting them in a trust or gifting them to a family member — excluding spouses or children under 18.
    


            “The law only requires you to disclose and to divest,” said Hui Chen, an anti-corruption expert and former federal prosecutor who resigned from the Justice Department under Trump's first administration. “But that doesn't mean you can't shape things for the long run that ultimately will benefit you.”
    


            That issue is hardly unique to the Trump administration, Chen notes. “But this administration has certainly posed a lot of conflict questions.”
    


            Despite Trump's populist messaging on the campaign trail, his administration is one of the wealthiest in US history, with more than a dozen billionaires and mega-millionaires on staff.
    


            “Having a lot of billionaires who are closely tied to what they'll be regulating raises a lot of questions,” said Jordan Libowitz, the vice president for communications at the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington or CREW. “And they have been, for the most part, unclear on exactly what they'll be doing in terms of divestment and recusal.”
    


            Cantor Fitzgerald's $1.5 billion stake in MicroStrategy, which last month renamed itself Strategy, is a bitcoin proxy holding — a popular way for mainstream investors to ride the crypto wave without the logistical and security headaches of actually holding digital assets.
    


            Strategy's founder, Michael Saylor, was one of about two dozen crypto leaders to attend the White House summit, and he is one of bitcoin's most vocal evangelists. For the past five years, Saylor's software company has amassed a roughly $40 billion stockpile of bitcoin — an estimated 2% of all bitcoin in circulation.

            Strategy's stock trades in lock step with bitcoin. In announcing the company's new name and sharpened focus on the asset, Saylor declared: “We are a bitcoin treasury company.”
    


            Shares shot up more than 10% earlier this month after President Trump announced plans on March 2 for a “crypto reserve” that would include bitcoin and other tokens.
    


            But that initial burst in value quickly faded amid industry hand-wringing over the makeup of the planned reserve.
    


            As prices slumped, Lutnick spoke to the media to clarify that bitcoin would have a unique status in the reserve once it was formally announced. It would be a bitcoin reserve, not a grab bag of crypto tokens — an important distinction for investors who view bitcoin as a kind of digital gold.
    


            “A bitcoin strategic reserve is something the President's interested in … and I think you're going to see it executed (at the summit)” Lutnick told Pavlovic Today on March 5, two days before the crypto summit. “So bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently — positively, but differently.”
    


            Sure enough, the following day, Trump signed an executive order establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” along with a stockpile of other digital assets. Bitcoin, which is prone to volatile trading, went up slightly in response.
    


            The digital asset, in step with financial markets, soared to record highs after Trump's re-election but has in recent weeks struggled to shake off anxieties about the president's ever-shifting trade policy — for which Lutnick is also a top spokesman.
    


            Under Trump's executive order, the United States would essentially consolidate all the bitcoin it has seized through criminal and civil forfeitures and hold it as a reserve asset, similar to the way gold and petroleum are stockpiled, as a hedge against future financial instability.
    


            This is a controversial idea among economists, lawmakers and even some pro-crypto analysts.
    


            Critics question the wisdom of linking the full faith and credit of the US government to a purely speculative, highly volatile asset. They argue that the reserve is little more than a scheme to backstop the value of bitcoin, thereby juicing the portfolios of early investors.
    


            “Who does having a strategic crypto reserve benefit? It's not your everyday Americans, right? It benefits these guys,” Libowitz said, referring to current bitcoin holders.
    


            Of course, with any innovation, early investors are poised to profit, Chen notes. But the question around bitcoin is more nuanced, given its lack of regulation and unproven benefits.
    


            “I think the question is: How robust is the evaluation about the risk to the government when it puts its weight around this form of currency? … Who is doing that analysis? Are the people doing that analysis unbiased?” she said.
    


            A White House official didn't respond to specific questions about a risk assessment, telling CNN in an email that the bitcoin reserve is the best way to protect the digital assets already in the government's possession.
    


            The Accountable.US report found that at least four senior Trump officials disclosed total ownership of up to $7.7 million in cryptos including bitcoin, ether and solana, all of which spiked when Trump announced a crypto reserve plan on March 2. That surge would have boosted these officials' investments by as much as $800,000, according to the report.
    


            Two senior Trump officials, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, have pledged to divest up to $1 million in crypto investments, but, according to the report, they have yet to file certifications showing that they have unloaded these currencies. (Both of their ethics pledges state they will divest by early to mid-April).
    


            A Treasury spokesperson told CNN in an email Wednesday that “the secretary has already divested of this Bitcoin Trust” and that “he will file his certificate of compliance with the Office of Government Ethics by the required deadline.”

            A spokesperson for Gabbard's office told CNN the director is committed to her pledge to divest before her April 15 deadline.
    


            President Trump himself is a recent convert to the crypto world.
    


            The first family are direct beneficiaries of World Liberty Financial and at least two memecoins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA, that have raised concerns across the political spectrum about the potential for corruption. By its nature, crypto offers a particularly easy way to, anonymously or otherwise, funnel money into entities that could potentially enrich the president and his family.
    


            Those concerns escalated late last month when the Securities and Exchange Commission, America's top financial regulator, said it would no longer pursue its civil fraud case against crypto mogul Justin Sun.
    


            Before the SEC put its case on hold, Sun had boasted on social media that he'd dropped $75 million on World Liberty tokens — an investment that could set the Trump family up to eventually collect tens of millions of dollars. (The SEC has declined to comment on the case.)
    


            “This is, I guess, going to be the new approach — hands off crypto, not enforcing fraud … and I don't think it's going to end well,” Painter, the law professor, told CNN at the time. “The SEC is going to back off — because that's what the Trump administration wants — on whatever enforcement they are able to do. I think it's a very worrisome situation.”

Oops, something went wrong

Some cryptocurrency investors worry about data security in the future. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) owners often tout the largest coin's unchanging qualities as a major selling point. But if Bitcoin's technical platform never changes, how can it meet unexpected challenges and adapt to new security threats? In particular, won't Bitcoin's encryption soon crumble under an assault from quantum computing systems?

So there's something you should know before you write off Bitcoin entirely, or dive into it head first. Bitcoin can have the system stability cake and eat incoming threats too.

Bitcoin is indeed changing over time, and should be safe from quantum computing attacks in the long run. It's just very unlikely to make sudden turns into dangerous or economically unsound moves, such as changing its inflation-proof coin-minting process.

Quantum computers should eventually disrupt many industries. A powerful system of this type is perfect for finding patterns in seemingly random data. They will crack the genetic code of genetic diseases, provide the most accurate weather forecasts ever, and bring clarity to the chaos of financial markets.

And of course, they will be able to crack the encryption algorithms at the heart of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

If and when that happens, that must be the end of Bitcoin as you know it. Scoundrels and miscreants will be able to change, delete, or insert data into Bitcoin's blockchain ledger, moving billion-dollar fortunes with the click of a quantum-powered mouse.

This wouldn't be such a scary situation if Bitcoin's technology wasn't so unchangeable. You often hear crypto bulls touting the firm cap of 21 million Bitcoins as an immovable guard against inflation. Once the last fraction of the 21-millionth digital coin has been minted, there simply won't be any more production. With 19.83 million Bitcoin already created, that's 94.4% of all Bitcoin that ever will exist.

So Bitcoin isn't changing. When the bad actors finally get their hands on game-changing quantum computers, Bitcoin's data security must fall.

The end.

Hold your horses, dear investor.

The computing platform behind Bitcoin can indeed change over time. The Bitcoin Core software that manages the blockchain ledger and the Bitcoin mining procedure is up to version 28.1 these days. The latest update fixed a few bugs and added some developer-friendly features. It was released on October 2, 2024, to be followed by a more substantial "major version" in the spring of 2025.

These changes could indeed involve very important features and software bits, including the limit of 21 million coins and the encryptions methods in use.

And there are already encryption methods that are hard to crack with quantum computing systems. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the first federal standards for quantum-hardened encryption in 2022. Development efforts toward this goal started in 2016. IBM (NYSE: IBM) included these quantum-resistant algorithms in the z16 mainframe systems the same year, and will make these encryption solutions mandatory over time. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is quietly rolling out data security with quantum-safe algorithms, too.

There's absolutely no reason to believe that the Bitcoin developer community will let the whole system run into quantum-based hacking issues. Long before quantum computers grow powerful enough to pose a real threat, the old-school SHA-256 hash function will be replaced by a quantum-safe alternative.

The key thing to remember is that updates only happen with a proper majority approval. More than half of the systems running the Bitcoin blockchain need to install the new version in order to achieve consensus on approving each transaction on the public ledger. A so-called 51% attack is possible, but only if you control more than half of the world's Bitcoin mining power -- a tall order even for trillion-dollar tech giants or governments. And before that, every software update goes through a meticulous process of planning, development, testing, and installation.

And it would not be in the community's best interest to adopt software versions with unwanted features. The 21-million coin cap is safe, because upping that limit would immediately lower the value of the Bitcoin holdings and mining systems that made it possible to change that particular number.

So Bitcoin developers have the freedom to tackle technical challenges, including the future threat of hackers with quantum computers. The system is also sophisticated enough to resist unwanted software changes. No project, system, or organization is ever 100% safe against every threat, and that's only more true in the unfamiliar cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin investors shouldn't lose sleep over this particular issue, though.

Quantum computers won't break the Bitcoin platform any time soon, and they're still many years away from posing a serious threat. That's more than enough time to dodge the entire problem with the appropriate software tweaks.

The Central Bank of Russia has proposed restricting cryptocurrency transactions to "particularly qualified investors" who possess over RUB 100 million (US$1.1 million) in securities or have earned more than RUB 50 million (US$560,000) per year.

Source: The Moscow Times

Details: For other citizens, cryptocurrency transactions may be prohibited, with penalties introduced for violations. 

The regulator reaffirmed that "the Central Bank of Russia still does not consider cryptocurrency as a means of payment". It also plans to ban crypto transactions between Russian residents and impose regulatory requirements on financial institutions seeking to invest in digital assets.

Since 1 September 2024, Russia has allowed international settlements in cryptocurrency under an experimental legal framework. However, in late November, Vladimir Putin signed a law recognising digital currencies as taxable property.

Additionally, Russia legalised cryptocurrency mining on 1 November 2024, with new tax regulations for miners taking effect in 2025. However, the government has banned mining in the North Caucasus republics and occupied territories of Ukraine.

Background: Stablecoin issuer Tether recently froze RUB 2.5 billion (US$28 million) worth of USDT on the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, forcing the platform to suspend operations.

For Michael Saylor, piling into Bitcoin worked. 

The chair and co-founder of Strategy got in early, buying up the asset since 2020 and sitting on about $9 billion in gains.

Others that piled into Bitcoin years ago, such as Tesla, Jack Dorsey's Block and Japan's Nexon, are also sitting on healthy returns.

But newcomers trying to mimic Saylor's tactic — which he says helps protect from currency debasement and acts as a hedge against inflation — haven't been so lucky.

Bitcoin has seen wild price swings this month as investors fret about US President Donald Trump's flip-flopping policies and the broader US economy. 

The price is down about 25% from its all-time high.

Strategy employs a somewhat complex debt and equity toggling mechanism to protect against price fluctuations — something some other firms holding Bitcoin aren't replicating. 

Here are five companies that are losing money on their Bitcoin investments.

Video-sharing platform Rumble is the most recent firm to snag some Bitcoin, announcing the acquisition of more than $17 million worth of the asset on March 12.

Yet the firm's purchase price of $91,000 per Bitcoin means that its investment is already down around 9%. 

Rumble's Bitcoin holdings are relatively minor, at just 0.6% of its $2.3 billion market capitalisation. 

The firm says it is diversifying its treasury with Bitcoin to protect against “dilution through endless money-printing.”

And Rumble's Bitcoin buying may not be over. The firm's board of directors approved purchases up to $20 million in November.

Rumble did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Hong Kong-based Ming Shing Group is an unlikely firm to be buying up Bitcoin. 

It's a small investment holding company engaged in the provision of trades services like plastering, tile laying, and brick laying.

Yet in recent months the firm has scooped up $69 million worth of Bitcoin through a subsidiary — that's almost as much as the firm's $74 million market capitalisation.

Director Wenjin Li said the firm bought Bitcoin to boost its asset growth and create additional value for shareholders.

However, the firm's Bitcoin buys came at an average cost of $89,250, meaning its position is currently around 7% underwater. 

Ming Shing Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Semler Scientific started off as a firm engaged in the early detection and treatment of chronic diseases.

In May 2024, it started funnelling its cash reserves into Bitcoin.

Like Saylor's Strategy, the firm has issued more shares in order to buy up more Bitcoin, a move it says is “highly accretive” to stockholders.

However, recent large purchases have pushed up costs. 

Semler Scientific's average purchase price now sits at $87,850, about 5% higher than Bitcoin's current price. 

The $265 million worth of Bitcoin on the firm's books comes in at a whopping 82% of its market capitalisation. 

Semler Scientific did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Chinese chip designer Nano Labs is another firm going all in on crypto. 

It has acquired $30 million worth of Bitcoin through a subsidiary, and in February sold $5.9 million worth of shares satisfied in Bitcoin and Tether stablecoin USDT, per a press release. 

It's not just Bitcoin Nano Labs has been buying. On January 21, the firm announced that it had bought 47 of President Donald Trump's memecoin. 

Nano Labs said the symbolic purchase, which cost it a little over $1,100, celebrates Trump's election and reflects the firm's appreciation for his supportive stance toward the cryptocurrency industry.

Nano Labs' Bitcoin buys aren't doing so well, however. Its average purchase price of $99,700 puts its holdings 16% above current prices, the widest negative return on the list. 

The firm's Bitcoin holdings come in at 35% of its market capitalisation. 

Nano Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Singapore-based Genius Group calls itself a Bitcoin Treasury Company, with the goal of accumulating 1,000 Bitcoin by the end of the year.

Genius Group says it wants to replicate the success of firms like Strategy and Metaplanet by buying Bitcoin and potentially issuing debt and shares to buy even more.

So far, the firm holds 440 Bitcoin, worth a little more than $36 million. 

However, the firm's average purchase price of $95,455 puts its holdings 13% underwater. 

Still, Genius Group boasts that the value of its held Bitcoin is higher than its market capitalisation on a per-share basis.

The firm Bitcoin holdings are worth 158% of its $23 million market capitalisation.

Genius Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The "Wall Street Journal" reports this, citing sources familiar with the negotiations.

Representatives of the family of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, have begun talks to acquire a stake in the U.S. arm of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the negotiations. The move could tie Trump to the company, which pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations in 2023.

According to the newspaper, the founder of Binance Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty in court, is reportedly seeking a pardon from the Trump administration. Zhao, who remains Binance's largest shareholder, is said to have pushed the deal as part of a strategy to re-enter the U.S. market. It's unclear what form the Trump family's eventual participation might take, or whether the deal is contingent on Zhao being pardoned. One possibility is that the investment could be made through World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed cryptocurrency firm launched last September.

The talks reportedly began after Trump's election victory and involved a working group within Binance led by current CEO Richard Teng. The company's officials reportedly sought to develop a plan to overcome legal hurdles related to Zhao's conviction, which could impede operations in the United States and other regulated markets, such as the European Union. Sources cited by the “Wall Street Journal” indicate that Steve Witkoff, a longtime friend of Trump and the US administration's negotiator for the Middle East and the conflict in Ukraine, would have participated in the talks for a deal with Binance. A White House official, however, denied Witkoff's involvement, specifying that the latter is proceeding with the sale of his business interests. In 2023, Binance agreed to pay $4,3 billion in fines to settle a dispute with U.S. authorities, who accused the platform of facilitating transactions with sanctioned groups, including Hamas and the Islamic State, and of circumventing U.S. anti-money laundering regulations.

As part of the deal, Zhao stepped down as CEO, but retained controlling interest in the company. After his release from prison last September, Zhao moved to Abu Dhabi. The talks between Binance and Trump's family are part of a broader push by the U.S. president to embrace the cryptocurrency industry. Since taking office, Trump has signed a series of industry-friendly executive orders and promoted initiatives such as the White House Crypto Summit, aimed at strengthening the role of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. economy.

Cabinet members' Bitcoin holdings spark debate over ethics and influence in Trump's pro-crypto governance approach.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Several members of Donald Trump's cabinet have significant Bitcoin holdings, with their combined investments valued in the millions, according to their financial disclosure reports.

These disclosures show that cabinet members have gained exposure to Bitcoin through direct purchases on crypto exchanges and investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The presence of crypto-friendly figures in the administration aligns with Trump's goal of positioning the US as a dominant force in the digital asset industry.

During this short term of his presidency, Trump has introduced several policies, including plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, to strengthen America's foothold in the sector.

Kennedy holds the largest Bitcoin investment among cabinet officials, reporting a Fidelity crypto account valued between $1 million and $5 million.

He has been vocal about his support for Bitcoin, previously stating that a significant portion of his personal wealth is in the asset.

Kennedy previously advocated for the US Treasury to acquire Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, proposing a strategy to accumulate 550 BTC daily until the nation holds 4 million BTC in reserve.

Bessent's financial report lists BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF investment worth between $250,001 and $500,000 in his portfolio.

However, as outlined in his ethics agreement, he has agreed to divest from these holdings within 90 days of his confirmation.

In past statements, Bessent described Bitcoin as an investment option for younger, disillusioned investors in the traditional financial system.

Duffy disclosed multiple Bitcoin investments, including direct holdings valued between $250,001 and $500,000. He also stated that he has Bitcoin stored in a Gemini wallet within the same value range.

Additionally, he has a $50,001 and $100,000 stake in the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund.

These government officials' substantial Bitcoin holdings raise ethics concerns, considering the Trump administration's pro-crypto approach to governance.

US lawmaker Elizabeth Warren recently warned that the Trump administration's “actions have the potential to benefit billionaire investors, Trump Administration insiders, and speculators at the expense of middle-class families.”

Oops, something went wrong

Warren Buffett is famous for his patience, as well as his sharp focus on finding investments that are priced at the right valuation, and equipped to continue gaining in value for years and years. Something he isn't as famous for is that he detests all forms of cryptocurrency, even Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).

But that doesn't mean you can't apply some of his investment principles to evaluating cryptocurrency investments. In fact, it's probably a smart idea to take his perspective, at least with some assets. Here's what you'll need to do to get a more Buffett-esque twist when you're looking at crypto.

Many of Buffett's best investments have been a feature of his portfolio for many years. Take Coca-Cola, for example, which he bought in 1998, or American Express, which he first purchased in 1991. There aren't any cryptocurrencies with that kind of vintage of being in existence. The closest would be Bitcoin, which was launched in 2009.

The point of Buffett holding investments for so long is that it allows the company's competitive advantages to play out and increase the stock's value as it inevitably wins against its competitors over time. That way, he gets the benefit of compounding growth, and someone else is doing the work each day to make it happen.

You can use this same idea very easily: Which cryptocurrencies, if any, have drivers that'll sustain their growth for years to come? As mentioned before, the only coin that's been proven to do that over any period of time that's sufficiently long to be Buffett-approved is Bitcoin. Others might achieve this eventually, but for now, it's the only one with enough of a history, and it's the only one with supply dynamics that are likely to continue forcing its price upward over the long term.

Buffett is a stickler for buying stocks at an appropriate valuation.

In crypto, this equates to not buying assets when everyone is talking about them and sentiment is high. There is minimal focus on the underlying investment thesis and more focus on price action. It's rarely a good deal to buy coins that are actively being bid up.

Instead, take Buffett's approach. You don't need to try to time the market. You just need to make sure that you're not buying at the points of a coin's life when there's a baked-in hype tax. If there's a real mechanism by which the coin can generate value over the long term, and not just hype, it'll recover from any lows that its price hits anyway.

So be patient and invest slowly, preferably while prices are nowhere near their recent highs. For Bitcoin, a perfect example would be buying in early 2023, right after the bear market.

Take a look at this chart:

It's fine to buy as prices are rising, as long as you're diligent about dollar-cost averaging (DCAing) when prices are falling too. It's more important to be invested for the long haul than it is to nail the perfect dirt-cheap valuation entry that Buffett tries to do with stocks. The science of crypto valuation isn't nearly as mature as stock valuation, so aim for being in the right ballpark rather than hitting the bullseye.

Buffett has a lot of different holdings. But he doesn't buy stocks every day. He screens annual reports, calculates valuations, determines if there's an asset worth owning, and then patiently waits for the opportunity to purchase it at his preferred price. That means doing nothing most of the time. And it means not buying something that looks juicy until he sees signs that the fruit is actually ripe.

You should be taking a similar approach with cryptocurrencies. There is no rush to buy anything that is worth holding for more than a few years. Today may not be the right day to invest in something, given your capital, your portfolio's positioning, and your current level of risk exposure. The more deliberate you can be, the better your results will be.

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you'll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you're worried you've already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it's too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you'd have $282,016!*

Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you'd have $41,869!*

Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you'd have $482,720!*

Right now, we're issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

03/13 update below. This post was originally published on March 11

Bitcoin and crypto prices have moved sharply lower, following stock markets, as fears swirl the bitcoin price could be teetering on the verge of a major crash.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has dropped under $80,000 per bitcoin, dragging down the wider crypto market that's now erased $1 trillion of value in just a month (even as bullish traders bet on a U.S. president Donald Trump “game-changer”).

Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, the chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock has warned Trump's trade policies will stoke inflation—pouring cold water on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025.

"I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic—and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me—that it's going to have elevated inflation," BlackRock's Larry Fink told CeraWeek conference attendees, it was reported by Reuters.

03/13 update: U.S. inflation has slowed to 2.8% in February from a year earlier, boosting the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates but failing to offset fears that U.S. president Donald Trump's global tariff trade war will push up prices through 2025. 

The latest consumer price index (CPI) reading came in below January's 3% and the 2.9% expected by economists, according to a Reuters poll.

“Today's lower-than-expected CPI should be bullish, signaling faster rate cuts, but crypto hasn't reacted strongly," Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, said in emailed comments. 

"Weeks of market fear require more than a single good print to regain confidence. The real issue is Trump's aggressive tariffs, which risk making inflation stickier while also crashing markets and triggering layoffs, particularly by the Doge department of government efficiency. This puts the Fed in a bind: High inflation from tariffs makes rate cuts harder. Market crashes and job losses pressure the Fed to cut rates sooner. Cutting too early could reignite inflation, making future policy tougher. Stocks are bouncing back, but crypto remains sluggish. Investors want stronger support from the White House or Fed, especially after last week's crypto summit failed to reassure markets. Until clearer signals emerge, fear and uncertainty will weigh on crypto market sentiment."

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs economists have upped their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15% to 20%, pointing to Trump's economic policies as the “key risk." Yardeni Research economists have also raised their recession odds, increasing them from 20% to 35% due to "Trump 2.0's head-spinning barrage of executives orders, firings, and tariffs."

Last week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is in no rush to cut rates, with the labor market still strong and inflation on a bumpy path toward its 2% goal.

The CME FedWatch Tool shows the market is heavily betting the Fed leaves rates on hold at its March meeting next week but is split over whether rates will be cut in May.

On Wednesday, the latest U.S. inflation data in the form of the consumer price index (CPI) will drop, with consumer prices expected to have ticked up in February, according to Bloomberg, highlighting the Fed's slow progress on battling inflation and potentially raising the specter of stagflation—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises.

"This market downturn is largely driven by broader economic concerns, including fears of a U.S. recession and persistent inflation," Sean Dawson, head of research at decentralized options trading platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments.

“The market is facing significant challenges as the macroeconomic environment worsens, and crypto assets are no exception. With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming weeks will be critical for assessing how the broader economic situation impacts digital asset prices and trading behavior."

CONVERGE LIVE - Singapore, March 12-13 2025 - Request invitation

The CEO of crypto exchange Binance said he expects U.S. President Trump's "pro-crypto" legislation in the U.S. to spur regulators in other parts of the world to follow suit.

"We have moved from a period where there's big regulatory uncertainty and in many sense, some regulatory hostility towards the industry, to one where the largest economy of the world said 'we want to embrace crypto,'" Binance CEO Richard Teng told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore on Thursday. 

Under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, regulators cracked down on the industry in an effort to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering.

"[If] you ask anybody in the crypto industry, people prefer the current administration compared to the last one," Teng said.

Chao Deng, CEO of crypto fund manager HashKey Capital, who spoke alongside Teng at the CONVERGE event, shared that view, saying that under Trump, "the momentum is building, institutional [and] retail adoption [of crypto assets] is immense." 

The comments came after Trump pressed ahead with an executive order to establish a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies for the U.S. using digital assets seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases. 

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that in addition to Bitcoin, the strategic reserve would include ether, XRP, Solana's SOL token, and Cardano's ADA coin.

The Binance CEO described the U.S. crypto reserve as a "landmark" issue. "The messaging is the largest government … the biggest capital market in the world is now holding Bitcoin as part of the reserve, [that'll] cause many other governments to think through the issue, to sit up to say, should we start doing allocation into crypto and bitcoin?"

Bitcoin prices have fallen since Trump's announcement of a strategic crypto reserve as details of the plan fell short of expectations. Investor enthusiasm toward assets perceived to be risky has also softened more broadly due to concerns over the impact of Trump's tariff plans.

Teng downplayed the recent pullback in crypto markets as a "tactical retreat," as — like any other asset class — it is not "immune" to macroeconomic situations. Nonetheless, Washington's embrace of the digital assets and Trump's nomination of several crypto-friendly legislators will provide "strong" long-term drivers, he said.  

Since his victory in November, Trump has focused on appointing government leaders who support the cryptocurrency sector. Venture capitalist David Sacks was tapped by Trump to be the White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar.

According to Teng, during the last administration, you had "Operation Choke Point 2.0" in progress — an alleged effort by regulators during the Biden presidency to pressure banks into severing ties with crypto. CNBC was unable to verify these claims.

Teng also said the industry faced "regulation via enforcement," which made it extremely tough for it to grow. 

Hashkey Capital's Deng agreed that a return of banking services for crypto companies in the U.S. is one of the most important changes to come from the election. 

"They encourage and they allow banks to be involved with crypto. This is a very huge step for the crypto and Web3 industry," he said, adding that banks will now feel more comfortable working with crypto-related clients.

Authorities in India have arrested a cryptocurrency exchange administrator wanted by the US for allegedly helping cybercriminals launder money and violate sanctions. 

Aleksej Besciokov, a Lithuanian citizen and Russian resident, was arrested in the southern state of Kerala on Tuesday, India's top investigative agency said.

According to the US Justice Department (DOJ), he was one of the administrators of Garantex, a Russian cryptocurrency exchange, and was responsible for reviewing and approving its transactions.

Besciokov is in custody and has not yet made a statement. Garantex could not immediately be reached for comment. 

Besciokov was "residing in Russia", according to DOJ's recently-released indictment, and it is unclear when and why he came to India. 

India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said in a statement that it issued a provisional arrest warrant against him at Washington's request. 

Besciokov will now be produced in a court in Delhi, it said. It is not clear when he will be extradited to the US. 

The United States, in coordination with Germany and Finland, had taken down the online infrastructure used by Garantex, the DOJ said last week. 

It added that Garantex processed at least $96bn (£74.10bn) in cryptocurrency transactions since 2019 and that it allegedly received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds, which were then used to "facilitate several crimes", including hacking, ransomware, terrorism and drug trafficking. 

The DOJ also accused the Lithuanian national of violating sanctions and operating an "unlicensed money transmitting business". 

Last week, US officials charged Besciokov along with the exchange's Russian co-founder Aleksandr Mira Serda with money laundering.

Garantex was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in 2022. 

But soon after, Besciokov and other administrators "redesigned" its operations to "evade sanctions" and induce American businesses into working with them, DOJ said.

US authorities have alleged that the Garantex cryptocurrency exchange had been used to process at least $152.5 billion in funds since 2019, which also allowed international criminal organisations to launder money. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic)

Indian intelligence authorities have arrested a Russian resident the US Justice Department has accused of money laundering.

US law enforcement says Aleksej Besciokov and another Russian national operated a $152.5 billion cryptocurrency exchange that helped criminal entities like terrorist organisations to launder funds.

After Mr Besciokov 's arrest in the Indian state of Kerala, Washington is expected to pursue his extradition to the US.

India's top crime fighting bureau says its authorities have arrested a cryptocurrency exchange administrator accused by the United States of money laundering conspiracy and violating sanctions.

The US, Germany and Finland took down the online infrastructure used by the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, the US Justice Department said in a statement last week, adding that two administrators of the exchange were charged.

One of those administrators was 46-year-old Aleksej Besciokov, a Russian resident and Lithuanian national who was charged with money laundering and also faced accusations of violating sanctions and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, the Justice Department said on Friday.

The US agency also said that another 40-year-old Russian national and United Arab Emirates resident, Aleksandr Mira Serda, was also charged with money laundering and conspiracy.

"According to court documents, between 2019 and 2025, Besciokov and Mira Serda controlled and operated Garantex," the US Justice Department said in the statement last week.

"Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to US victims.

"According to the indictment, Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that criminal proceeds were being laundered through Garantex and took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities on its platform.

Mr Besciokov was arrested in the southern Indian state of Kerala on Wednesday, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said, adding that he was wanted by US authorities. 

The CBI said that at Washington's request, India's foreign ministry had a provisional arrest warrant issued.

It also said that Mr Besciokov was planning to flee India, but it was not immediately clear why he was in the country. Washington is expected to pursue Mr Besciokov's extradition.

The ACCC will increase its scrutiny of Australia's supermarkets, retailers, airlines and essential services, and its chair has voiced concerns there could be an uptick in financial scams as US President Donald Trump relaxes cryptocurrency regulations.

"I can confirm Aleksej Besciokov, one of the administrators of Garantex, was arrested in India at the request of the United States," a US Justice Department spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday local time.

The department also said last week that on March 6, US law enforcement including the country's Secret Service seized three website domains that were being used to support Garantex's operations.

"The seizure of these domains will prevent these sites from being used for money laundering and additional crimes," the department's statement said.

"Individuals visiting those sites now will see a message indicating that the site has been seized by law enforcement.

"US law authorities have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex's servers, including customer and accounting databases. In addition, US law enforcement has also frozen over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex's money laundering activities."

The US Justice Department says charges of conspiracy and money laundering carry maximum jail term penalties of 20 years, while the charge of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business carries a maximum five-year jail term.

Ethereum (ETH) traded around $1,860 in the Asian session on Thursday as its price remained largely subdued by bearish sentiment weighing on the general crypto market. However, expectations surrounding the potential approval of staking within US spot Ethereum ETFs could lift the top altcoin out of its recent weak performance.

The SEC acknowledged it has received Fidelity's proposal to allow staking within its spot Ethereum ETF (FETH). However, it's unlikely the agency will decide on the proposal soon, considering it recently postponed deciding on several crypto ETF applications.

The SEC postponed making decisions on Dogecoin, Solana and XRP ETF applications on Tuesday. The ETF Store president Nate Geraci suggested it is due process considering Paul Atkins, Trump's pick to chair the agency, has yet to get Senate approval.

Grayscale and 21Shares have also filed to allow staking within their spot Ethereum ETFs.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's next technical upgrade, Pectra, which will bring several UX improvement features to its blockchain, is getting closer after finalizing on testnets Holesky and Sepolia. Users now await the mainnet upgrade, and many anticipate it could mark a turnaround in ETH's price trajectory, which has severely underperformed Bitcoin and Solana.

"Improved tech does not distract from the overarching theme over the last two years – ETH's underperformance," noted K33 Research analysts in a Wednesday report.

"There are, however, potential bullish catalysts such as the incorporation of staking rewards into US spot ETH ETFs [...] This, more than technical upgrades, could be the necessary trigger for some ETH momentum and enable it to regain favor with market participants," they added.

Standard Chartered analysts have predicted that staking within Ethereum ETFs could drive ETH's price above $14,000 by year-end.

Ethereum saw $60.98 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations was $34.10 million and $26.88 million, respectively.

ETH appears to lack directional bias as bulls and bears struggle to gain hold of prices since it bounced off the $1,750 support. The top altcoin has to overcome the emerging resistance near $1,960 and surpass a key descending trendline resistance to strengthen the quest to recover $2,200.

However, a sustained consolidation around $1,900 and $2,000 could establish the range as a key resistance.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) are close to their oversold region, indicating dominant bearish momentum.

A daily candlestick close below $1,500 will invalidate the consolidation thesis and send ETH toward $1,000.

After the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, Ethereum users are looking towards the Pectra upgrade slated for early 2025. The upgrade will come in two phases, featuring improved wallet experience, an upgrade to the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), PeerDAS for scaling L2s, improvement of blob capacity, etc.

Forks are upgrades or changes to the codebase/architecture of a blockchain network. Considering blockchain networks have no central governance, forks are only carried out after developers and validators reach a consensus. Hard forks are substantial permanent changes in a blockchain protocol that create two parallel chains – one with the old rules and the new with the implemented changes. Developers can either upgrade their software to build on the new chain or remain on the old chain as a separate network. During a hard fork, users receive an equivalent amount of their tokens on the new blockchain network 1:1. Soft forks, on the other hand, are subtle changes on a blockchain network that are backwards-compatible, meaning the network still operates as a single entity even when some developers don't implement the new changes.

Famously scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 22 minutes, Ethereum improvement proposal EIP-7702 is an advanced way of marrying EIP-3074 and ERC-4337 to unlock massive adoption for Ethereum's smart wallet functionality. Slated to go live in the upcoming Pectra upgrade, EIP-7702 will implement an advanced version of account abstraction enabling features like batching that allows users to pay a one-off transaction fee for multiple actions, sponsorship to enable an account pay gas fees for other users and wallet recovery options if users misplace their seed phrase.

Layer 2 is a collective term for protocols that aim to scale Ethereum by processing batches of transactions off the Mainnet. After performing a series of mathematical computations to ensure their validity, these L2s send a compressed version of the transactions back to the Mainnet for final processing. As a result, Layer 2 networks reduce transaction fees and enhance the Mainnet's speed while reaping its security. Think of them like several personal assistants that help their boss to process a series of paperworks. These assistants send a summarised version of the paperworks to the boss who confirms and signs on them.

Layer 3 solutions are application-specific blockchains built upon existing Layer 2 networks to offer high scalability and interoperability. For example, an L3 can focus on tackling privacy, increased scalability, gaming, or some complex functionality while still ultimately deriving security from the Layer 1.

Updated  - March 13, 2025 12:37 pm IST - WASHINGTON


                    A Lithuanian national Aleksej Besciokov, wanted by the U.S., arrested in a coordinated operation between the CBI and Kerala Police.

Indian authorities arrested at Washington's request a cryptocurrency exchange administrator accused of money laundering conspiracy and violating sanctions, India's top crime fighting bureau said on Wednesday (March 12, 2025).

The United States, Germany and Finland took down the online infrastructure used by the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, the U.S. Justice Department said last week, adding that two administrators of the exchange were charged.

One of those administrators was Aleksej Besciokov, a Russian resident and Lithuanian national who was charged with money laundering and also faced accusations of violating sanctions and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, the Justice Department said on Friday.

Besciokov was arrested in Kerala, India's Central Bureau of Investigation said, adding he was wanted by U.S. authorities. The CBI said that at Washington's request, India's Foreign Ministry had a provisional arrest warrant issued.

It added Besciokov was planning to flee India. It was not immediately clear why he was in India. Washington is expected to pursue Besciokov's extradition. His representative could not immediately be reached.

"I can confirm Aleksej Besciokov, one of the administrators of Garantex, was arrested in India at the request of the United States," a U.S. Justice Department spokesperson told CNN.

The exchange has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since April 2019, the U.S. Justice Department said last week.

Garantex was sanctioned by the U.S. in April 2022.

Blockchain research company TRM Labs said in a blog post last week that the takedown of Garantex "marks a major milestone in the fight against illicit finance" but cautioned that sanctioned exchanges often attempt to evade restrictions by creating new entities.

A Lithuanian man, who was wanted in the US for a massive cryptocurrency fraud, has been arrested in Kerala, officials said on Wednesday. The accused, Aleksej Besciokov, had set up a cryptocurrency exchange 'Garantex', allegedly to launder the proceeds of criminal activities such as ransomware, computer hacking, and narcotics transactions.

Besciokov was arrested when he was planning to flee the country, officials said.

According to the US Secret Service documents, Besciokov, over the period of nearly six years, allegedly controlled and operated Garantex, which facilitated money laundering to the tune of at least $96 billion (over Rs 8 lakh crore) in cryptocurrency transactions by transnational criminal organisations (including terrorist organisations) and violated sanctions.

"Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to US victims," it said.

Officials said that Besciokov was Garantex's primary technical administrator and was responsible for obtaining and maintaining the critical infrastructure of the platform as well as reviewing and approving transactions. He was wanted by the US on many charges, including conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of Title 18 of the US Code, conspiracy to violate the US International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and Conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money services business.

He was sanctioned by the US in April 2022.

Earlier this week, the Ministry of External Affairs received a provisional arrest warrant at the request of US officials. Following this, a joint effort of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Kerala police arrested Besciokov from Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram.

He will be produced before the Patiala House Court soon, officials said.

CONVERGE LIVE - Singapore, March 12-13 2025 - Request invitation

Emirati state-owned investment firm MGX announced a $2 billion investment into Binance, in what marks the cryptocurrency exchange's first institutional investment and the "single largest investment" ever paird in crypto.

In a joint press release, the firms said the minority stake would be paid for in stablecoins, making it the "largest investment ever" paid in cryptocurrency. Stablecoins are a type of digital asset designed to hold a constant value, typically with a peg to a fiat currency. 

Abu Dhabi launched the MGX investment firm last year with a focus on AI technology. In September, MGX partnered with the likes of BlackRock and Microsoft to launch a more than $30 billion AI fund, but it had yet to invest in the cryptocurrency industry and blockchain sectors. 

"MGX's investment in Binance reflects our commitment to advancing blockchain's transformative potential for digital finance," Ahmed Yahia, managing director and CEO at MGX, said in a statement.

The press release added that "by partnering with the leading industry player, MGX aims to enable innovation at the intersection of AI, blockchain technology and finance."

Binance and MGX did not immediately comment on the size of the stake or what stablecoin would be used for the payment. Binance has not responded to an inquiry on whether the deal had been completed.

As part of the UAE's broader ambitions to become a global technology leader, it has been growing into a regional crypto hub. 

Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, has grown its Middle East footprint as it faced regulatory hurdles and enforcement measures in other jurisdictions in recent years, 

According to the press release, Binance employs approximately 1,000 of its roughly 5,000 global workforce in the UAE. It adds that it now boasts over 260 million registered users and has surpassed $100 trillion in cumulative trading volume. 

Binance CEO Richard Teng is scheduled to take part in a panel session at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore at 2:40 p.m. local time (2:40 a.m. ET) on Thursday.

	The spots and stripes familiar to us today didn't arise until later in mammalian evolution

Small mammals during the Mesozoic Era (some illustrated) may have had uniformly dark coloring, allowing them to blend into nocturnal environments.

Zebra stripes? Leopard print? Neither were in vogue among the earliest mammals during the Age of Dinosaurs.

Early mammals and their close relatives probably sported dark, drab coats from snout to tail, researchers report in the March 14 Science. The monochrome ensembles may have helped ancient mammals blend into their nighttime surroundings and evade predators.

Many dinosaurs — especially birds — showcase a vibrant array of colorful feathers. But the diversity of fur color among modern mammals is underappreciated, says Matthew Shawkey, an evolutionary biologist at Ghent University in Belgium. “There's obviously lots of patterns, stripes, spots, blotches, all those types of things,” he says. “But also fairly diverse colors: grays, yellows, oranges.”

Yet very little is known about the evolution of mammals' colors or their presence in the fossil record, Shawkey says. Though pigment-containing structures called melanosomes have yielded details about the bright feathers of extinct birds, details about fossilized mammals' coat colors remain scarce, save for recent evidence of reddish fur in a 3-million-year-old mouse fossil. 

Shawkey and his colleagues used a scanning electron microscope to analyze melanosomes in the hairs of 116 modern mammals, linking their shapes and sizes to the colors they produce. After organizing the known melanosomes by various physical features, the team used statistics to test their ability to predict which colors others would produce. Melanosomes responsible for brighter colors, such as reds and oranges, are rounder, the researchers found, while blacks and browns generally come from elongated melanosomes.

Working with colleagues in China, the team applied this predictive power to melanosomes in preserved hairs from six early mammals and close relatives that lived in China 120 million to 167 million years ago, mostly during the Jurassic Period — the middle phase of the Mesozoic Era. While modern mammals exhibit an extensive range of these pigment-bearing structures, those from the six protomammals fell within a narrow range associated with dark grays and browns across their bodies, suggesting the ancient beasts had the same dark shade throughout. 

The early mammals in this study — like many during the Mesozoic Era — were small creatures much like rodents, shrews or moles. They also appear to have had similarly gray and brown coats. It's not unexpected given the world they evolved in, Shawkey says.

“They were basically dinosaur food,” he says. “They're going to be hiding in the shadows. So it makes sense that they were dark.”

Despite being a mix of gliders, burrowers and scamperers, all the mammals in the study had dull, dark fur. This suggests a nocturnal existence was ubiquitous for Mesozoic mammals and their relatives, regardless of their ecological role.

“I think this is the first good evidence that we have of an antipredation strategy among early mammals,” says Luke Weaver, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved with the research.

Dark, melanin-rich fur may have been useful in other ways. It heats up easily, and potentially helped early mammals stay warm. The dark hairs may have also been particularly tough and wear-resistant, protecting the mammals' skin.

Shawkey notes that the study was limited to six extinct species, leaving the possibility that some early mammals exhibited patterns or bright colors. The team's monochrome hypothesis could be upended, he says, if paleontologists “find a [fossil] rat with a giant orange mohawk.”

Determining when those kinds of fashion statements first arose is a natural next step, Shawkey says. “When do we start seeing spots and these patterns? When do we start seeing light browns and oranges and things like that?”

It's possible the extinction of nonavian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago played a key role. Mammalian diversity exploded in response, and the movement to a wide range of finally-safe daytime habitats may have triggered a broader spectrum of colors, too.

However, Weaver notes, some studies suggest that this diversification might have begun earlier. “There's emerging evidence to suggest that [mammals] might have been diversifying ecologically — and potentially inhabiting more daylight habitats — prior to the extinction of dinosaurs,” he says. Sampling melanosomes from mammals that lived during the late Cretaceous Period, at the twilight of the Age of the Dinosaurs, would be particularly informative. 

Maria McNamara, a paleontologist at University College Cork in Ireland, would like to know if mammals that lived in different biomes or latitudes during the Jurassic Period were similarly dark.

“We need more papers like this to be published,” McNamara says. “It's really important to demonstrate that modern paleontology is much more than describing dusty old bones. It's a thriving analytical science.”

The mummy of a first-century-B.C. individual found in Egypt was not pregnant and did not have cancer, according to a new CT study.

An ancient Egyptian woman thought to have been pregnant and dying of cancer was actually just embalmed with a technique that mimicked these diagnoses, researchers have concluded, settling a four-year scientific debate.

Nicknamed the "Mysterious Lady," the first-century-B.C. mummy was found in the Egyptian city of Luxor (ancient Thebes) but was brought to the University of Warsaw in Poland in 1826. The mummy was not scientifically studied for over a century.

In 2021, experts with the Warsaw Mummy Project concluded that, contrary to their assumption that the mummy was a male priest based on the sarcophagus, it was actually the remains of a woman in her 20s who was 6.5 to 7.5 months pregnant.

In the first published study of the mummy, researchers used X-ray imaging and CT scans to identify several bundles of mummified organs in her abdomen. They also suggested that a poorly preserved fetus, around 28 weeks in gestational age, could be seen on the scans.

In a second study, the research team proposed that the reason no fetal bones could be clearly identified was that the mother's uterus lacked oxygen and had become acidic over time, essentially "pickling" the fetus. And finally, the team suggested that they had found evidence of potentially fatal nasopharyngeal cancer in the mummy's skull.

These interpretations were controversial, however. Radiologist and mummy expert Sahar Saleem told Live Science in 2022 that the Warsaw team failed to "identify any evidence of anatomical structures to justify their claim of a fetus." Instead, Saleem was convinced the mysterious structures in the mummy's abdomen were embalming packs.

To settle the debate, a team of 14 researchers with varied expertise led by archaeologist Kamila Braulińska of the University of Warsaw studied the Mysterious Lady and published their findings in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences last month.

Members of the research team each examined more than 1,300 raw CT image slices of the mummy produced in 2015 to determine whether there was any radiological evidence of a pregnancy or of cancer.

Every expert who reanalyzed the CT scans concluded that there was no fetus and that the material assumed to be a fetus was actually part of the embalming process. Further, the suggestion that the fetus' skeleton and soft tissue did not show up on the scans because the body was "pickled" is impossible, the researchers noted in the study, because acids within the human body are insufficient to dissolve bone, especially after a body is embalmed.

Similarly, none of the experts on the new study could identify clear evidence of cancer in the mummy. Some suggested instead that the damage to the woman's skull most likely occurred when her brain was removed during the embalming process.

Given the diagnostic consensus of the international panel of experts, the researchers concluded in the study that "this should resolve once and for all the discussion of the first alleged case of pregnancy identified inside an ancient Egyptian mummy, as well as the dispute about the presence of nasopharyngeal cancer."

But given the public's intense interest in the "case of the pregnant mummy" over the past four years, the researchers suggested that, going forward, additional focus should be given to questions of maternal and pediatric health in ancient Egypt.

	Helium atoms filled gaps in iron crystals under high pressure and temperature

Under high temperature and pressure, helium atoms (red circles) move into the spaces between iron atoms (red circles with black centers) in a piece of iron metal, as show in this map called an electron localization function.

Scientists have coaxed one of the universe's most stubborn elements into a new compound.

Formed under intense pressures, the newly discovered compound packs helium atoms into crystalline iron, researchers report February 25 in Physical Review Letters. The compound joins a short list of materials that incorporate the normally unreactive element and suggests that helium from the early solar system could be stored in the iron that makes up Earth's core.

Helium is one of the least reactive elements on the periodic table. Like the other noble gases, helium doesn't gain or lose electrons easily and so does not normally form chemical compounds. But under extremely high pressures, helium can interact with a few other elements, including nitrogen and sodium — and now iron, research shows.

To make the new iron compound, physicist Kei Hirose of the University of Tokyo and his colleagues squeezed iron and helium together in a diamond anvil cell, a high-pressure device that subjected the elements to pressures greater than 50,000 Earth atmospheres and temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. This compression formed crystals containing both iron and helium.

The volume of the crystal formed was larger than that of a crystal of pure iron at the same pressure, the team found. The researchers attributed this increase to helium ions packing into interstitial sites, the tiny spaces between iron atoms in the crystal. But the helium atoms don't bond directly to iron — they're too unreactive, even at extreme conditions.

“Helium is very happy as it is. It doesn't want to share an electron,” says Stefano Racioppi, a chemist at The State University of New York at Buffalo. But it can still participate in “chemistry without chemical bonds” to form these ordered, crystalline compounds.

The new compound could help explain observations of helium in Earth's interior, Hirose says. Most of Earth's helium atoms have two neutrons and form from the radioactive decay of elements like uranium. But some ocean volcanic eruptions release helium atoms with just one neutron. These atoms first formed shortly after the Big Bang. Earth picked up this “primordial” helium as the planet formed.

Its loss from magma suggests that the planet has a deep reservoir of primordial helium, and the new compounds suggest that Earth's iron-rich core could hold some of that helium. But the team will need additional experiments to determine whether helium is more likely to reside in Earth's core or higher in its mantle.

“The partitioning of helium between magma, silicate melt and metallic iron is really the key,” Hirose says. If helium is more stable in iron than in the silicates found in the mantle, that would suggest that the helium is more likely to reside in the core — and vice versa.

Computational physicist Ronald Cohen agrees. “I wouldn't say that it's a proof that there's helium in Earth's core, but it suggests that it's possible,” says Cohen, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.

Aside from the geophysical implications, the findings could further expand noble gas chemistry. “I would like to see whether this is unique for iron or if it could also happen to other transition metals,” says Maosheng Miao, a chemist at California State University, Northridge. Forming other helium metal compounds, he says, could lead to “chemistry that we never thought of.”

Rowing machines and treadmills do not challenge your cardiovascular system in the same way, so what is the science behind it?

Rowing and running are undoubtedly some of the most popular forms of cardiovascular exercise. Both activities can send your heart rate through the roof and get your blood pumping, and both have been shown to decrease the risk of developing heart disease and high blood pressure. When it comes to cardiovascular benefits, rowing and running seem to be on equal footing, according to a 2023 study published in the European Heart Journal.

However, there is an interesting twist — evidence suggests that elite rowers tend to have notably bigger hearts compared to elite runners.

Take the landmark 1994 study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, for example. One of the biggest of its kind, it investigated structural and functional changes within the heart of 947 elite athletes representing 27 sports disciplines. Scientists used echocardiography — images of the heart obtained with an ultrasound scan — and found that, of all study participants, rowers had the thickest left ventricular wall.

This is the layer of muscle and connecting tissue surrounding the largest chamber of the heart. Rowers also had some of the largest left ventricles during the resting phase between heartbeats, when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. On the other hand, runners did not seem to display such far-reaching changes to their hearts, the study authors noted.



So how does rowing affect your heart, and is it different from running?

While both of these activities challenge your cardiovascular system, they do not do so in the same way, Dr. Bhaskar Semitha, a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon at Fortis Hospital Vashi in Mumbai, India, told Live Science by email. "[This is why] elite rowers tend to have bigger, stronger hearts compared to elite runners, even when they have similar levels of cardiovascular fitness," Semitha said.

The reason lies in the movement itself. Running predominantly targets your legs. Rowing, on the other hand, is a low-impact exercise that simultaneously engages muscles in your legs, core and upper body.

"Rowing is a full-body workout that demands a high oxygen supply, so the heart has to pump more blood per beat," Semitha said. As such, exercising on one of the best rowing machines may force your heart to pump blood more efficiently than if you opted for a jog on a treadmill.

"Over time, this leads to a lower resting heart rate and a higher stroke volume [the volume of blood pumped from the ventricle per beat.] The heart is working less while delivering more oxygen," Semitha said.

This also leads to a significant increase in VO2 max, the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during exercise, which is one of the key markers of performance in cardiovascular exercise. "That's why you will often see rowers with some of the lowest resting heart rates of any athletes," Semitha said.



Rowing and running elicit different heart rate responses even if these activities are performed at the same intensity, according to a 2002 study published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology. Scientists measured the blood lactate concentration — a biochemical marker of fatigue within exercising muscle — in 55 young, healthy men rowing on a rowing machine and running on a treadmill, and found that their heart rate was consistently lower during rowing even when both these exercises were performed with maximum effort.

Why? Again, it is all about the movement. The seated position during rowing makes it easier for blood to flow from the body's lower extremities back to the heart, scientists concluded.

There is a slight twist to the tale, though. Running, even at moderate intensity, is still more effective than rowing for increasing VO2 max, Sergii Putsov, PhD, a professional weightlifter, researcher and head of sports science at coaching service Torokhtiy Weightlifting, told Live Science. "Running forces your body to work against gravity, amplifying oxygen consumption and utilization. Since rowing is less weight-bearing than running, its overall ability to increase VO2 max is slightly lower for people who do not push themselves to high intensity," Putsov said.



Running also tends to cause more dramatic spikes in heart rate, particularly during high-intensity sprints. "[This is why] running puts more demand on arterial flexibility than rowing," Semitha said. "The repeated impact and fluctuations in intensity force the blood vessels to expand and contract rapidly, which can make arteries more elastic over time and therefore help prevent high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease."

So in the rowing vs running debate, which activity wins for cardiovascular benefits? Neither. Both rowing and running are good exercises for boosting stamina and strengthening the heart muscle, according to Putsov.

"However, their effectiveness may depend on your fitness level, specific goals and physical condition," Putsov said. "The full-body nature of rowing helps improve oxygen utilization efficiently without the harsh repetitive impact associated with running. Running, on the other hand, generates repetitive pounding on your joints and requires relatively high initial energy which can be overwhelming for beginners and people with poor cardiovascular fitness."

                           the Caribbean since 2011 is being attributed to changes in currents and suitable growing

By: Carlyn Scott, Science Communications Manager

A brown alga called Sargassum has inundated beaches in the Caribbean since 2011, impacting tourism, harming the
                     health of humans and marine life, and costing local governments millions of dollars
                     per year to clean up.

Scientists have been divided on the causes of the phenomenon known as the Great Atlantic
                     Sargassum Belt (GASB). But a new study published in Nature Communications may have identified what drove a tipping point that established this alga in the
                     tropical Atlantic Ocean.

The key drivers were wind, ocean currents, and nutrients, according to the international
                     team of researchers who published the recent study. Specifically, two consecutive
                     years of a strong negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a shift in atmospheric
                     pressure over the Atlantic that changes circulation and wind patterns, pushed Sargassum
                     into the tropics. There it found warm, nutrient-rich waters, and lots of sunlight,
                     all year-round.

“At first, the evidence is that just a few patches of Sargassum were being pushed
                     south by winds and currents during this NAO period of 2009-2010,” said co-author Frank Muller-Karger, Distinguished University Professor and biological oceanographer at the USF College
                     of Marine Science (CMS). “But these algae patches met the right conditions to grow
                     and perpetuate blooms when they reached the area close to the equator.”

Every year, patches of Sargassum come together in the tropical Atlantic, pushed by
                     the Trade Winds into an area where the ocean is rich in nutrients brought up from
                     deeper waters below, explains Muller-Karger. These Sargassum patches form a new, large
                     population in the region that spans from Africa to the Americas.

Authors of the recent paper in Nature Communications use a computer model that helped them to go into more details and test new scenarios
                     than was possible in a prior study published in Progress in Oceanography. That study first identified the possible influence of the NAO on the dispersal of
                     Sargassum. In both papers, researchers used models to simulate the transport of Sargassum from
                     the northern to the southern part of the North Atlantic, testing if the NAO was the
                     root cause of the first bloom that occurred in the tropical Atlantic in 2011.

“Both models showed that some patches of the Sargassum were swept up by the wind and currents from the Sargasso Sea toward Europe, then moved
                     southward, and from there were injected into the tropical Atlantic. There, this population
                     of algae, now separated from the Sargasso Sea, forms new blooms every year thanks
                     to having enough light, nutrients, and warmer temperatures,” said Muller-Karger.

                           Sargassum coverage and chlorophyll distribution after 2011. Sargassum was moved from
                           the Sargasso Sea to the tropics via currents depicted by arrows. Figure from Jouanno
                           et al. (2025).

These patches enriched with nutrients were identified as a driver of the GASB in a
                     2023 paper published in Nature Communications and co-authored by Chuanmin Hu, professor of physical oceanography at CMS.

Still, the question remained: What provided the nutrients to promote the growth of
                     Sargassum in the tropical Atlantic?   

Popular hypotheses included rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco, Niger, Congo, the
                     Mississippi, or even iron-rich dust from the Sahara Desert. But researchers lacked
                     sufficient data to support any of these theories.

To determine nutrient sources, the group of international researchers again turned
                     to computer models to analyze decades-worth of wind, currents, and three-dimensional
                     nutrient measurements collected in the Atlantic Ocean. These models successfully reproduced
                     the annual blooms.

The model showed that nutrients were supplied via an ocean process known as vertical
                     mixing, in which water masses mix on a seasonal basis due to shifting winds, bringing
                     deeper water that has higher nutrient concentrations to the surface. In this sunlit
                     surface layer photosynthesis occurs and Sargassum grows. This vertical mixing of waters in the tropical Atlantic fuels the massive blooms
                     that eventually ends up on the beaches of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf Coast.

                        today, through a series of currents.  Video from Jouanno et al. (2025). 

“This was a surprising result,” said Muller-Karger. “We had posed the hypothesis before
                     that it is not the rivers that feed the formation of the Sargassum blooms in the tropical
                     Atlantic. This model supports that nutrients from slightly deeper layers in the ocean
                     feed the blooms.”  

Despite the recent and largely negative press Sargassum has received, the seaweed is not new to the Atlantic. Sailors in the 15th century
                     first recorded this Sargassum in the western North Atlantic, which they named the Sargasso Sea. However, the large-scale
                     recurring blooms of Sargassum that flow into the Caribbean every year are a new phenomenon.
                      

Julien Jouanno, lead author of the study and physical oceanographer at the University
                     of Toulouse, emphasized the complex changes in the circulation of the atmosphere and
                     the ocean that led to the transport of Sargassum from the Sargasso Sea to the tropical Atlantic.  

“At this stage, we cannot say for certain whether this abnormal event is a direct
                     result of climate change,” said Jouanno. “There are many moving parts in a computer
                     simulation, and we may still not have good representation of the factors that control
                     Sargassum growth and mortality.”  

Indeed, there are unanswered questions regarding the biology and ecology of Sargassum, and the species present within the GASB remains a mystery. Researchers hope that
                     by investigating the physiology and biology of Sargassum in the Sargasso Sea, they can understand how it might react to environmental changes.

Still, the authors remain hopeful that collaborative efforts can help advance the
                     study of Sargassum.  

“This analysis and the publication highlight the importance of international cooperation
                     in studying and dealing with the ‘Sargassum problem' in the Atlantic,” said Julio Sheinbaum, a physical oceanographer from Center
                     for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CICESE) at Ensenada, Mexico.

Researchers in China have developed a quantum processing unit (QPU) that is 1 quadrillion (10¹⁵) times faster than the best supercomputers on the planet.

The new prototype 105-qubit chip, dubbed "Zuchongzhi 3.0," which uses superconducting qubits, represents a significant step forward for quantum computing, scientists at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei said. 

It rivals the benchmarking results set by Google's latest Willow QPU in December 2024 that allowed scientists to stake a claim for quantum supremacy — where quantum computers are more capable than the fastest supercomputers — in lab-based benchmarking.

The scientists used the processor to complete a task on the widely used quantum computing random circuit sampling (RSC) benchmark in just a few hundred seconds, they said in a new study published March 3 in the journal Physical Review Letters.

This test, 83-qubit, 32-layer random circuit sampling task, was also completed 1 million times faster than the result set by Google's previous generation Sycamore chip, published in October 2024. Frontier, the second-fastest supercomputer in the world, would only be able to complete the same task in 5.9 billion years, by contrast

Although the results suggest QPUs are capable of achieving quantum supremacy, the specific RCS benchmarking used favors quantum methods. Also, improvements in classical algorithms that drive classical computing may close the gap, as happened in 2019 when Google scientists first announced a quantum computer had outperformed a classical computer — in the first use of the RSC benchmark.

"Our work not only advances the frontiers of quantum computing, but also lays the groundwork for a new era where quantum processors play an essential role in tackling sophisticated real-world challenges," the scientists said in the study.

The latest iteration of Zuchongzhi includes 105 transmon qubits — devices made from metals like tantalum, niobium, and aluminum that have reduced sensitivity to noise — in a 15-by-7 rectangular lattice. This builds on the previous chip, which included 66 qubits.

One of the most important areas critical to the viability of quantum computing in real-world settings is coherence time, a measure of how long a qubit can maintain its superposition and tap into the laws of quantum mechanics to perform calculations in parallel. Longer coherence times mean more complicated operations and calculations are possible.

Another major improvement was in gate fidelity and quantum error correction, which has been an obstacle to building useful quantum computers. Gate fidelity measures how accurately a quantum gate performs its intended operation, where a quantum gate is analogous to a classical logic gate, performing a specific operation on one or more qubits, manipulating their quantum state. Higher fidelity qubits mean fewer errors and more accurate computations.

—Breakthrough quantum chip that harnesses new state of matter could set us on the path to quantum supremacy

—Scientists create world's 1st chip that can protect data in the age of quantum computing attacks

Zuchongzhi 3.0 performed with an impressive parallel single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.90%, and a parallel two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.62%. Google's Willow QPU edged it slightly, with results of 99.97% and 99.86% respectively.

These improvements were largely possible due to engineering improvements, including enhancements in fabrication methods and better optimized qubits design, the scientists said in the study. For instance, the latest iteration lithographically defines qubit components using tantalum and aluminum, bonded through an indium bump flip-chip process. This improves accuracy and minimizes contamination.

In a story of collaboration and community, researchers identified intergenerational epigenetic changes caused by war and trauma in Syrian refugees.

There are markers that sit on top of DNA and change over the course of one's lifetime, and they can even be passed down to future generations. These "epigenetic" markers alter how genes are expressed — without changing their codes — and they can change based on a person's experiences and environment.

Research suggests that stressful events can tweak a person's epigenetics — but what happens on a larger scale? How do people's epigenetics change, for example, in a population exposed to upheaval or violence multiple times over generations?

A new study, published Feb. 27 in the journal Scientific Reports, sought to answer that question.

An international collaboration of researchers convened by Rana Dajani, a molecular biologist at Hashemite University in Jordan, published first-of-their-kind results: they found that epigenetic signatures of trauma can be passed down through generations of people. The study was conducted with three generations of Syrian families that experienced the Hama massacre in 1982 and the Syrian uprising that began in 2011.

"This is an interesting and fascinating study that emphasizes the importance of considering how traumatic experience can have an impact across multiple generations," Michael Pluess, a developmental psychology researcher at the University of Surrey in the U.K. who was not involved in the work, told Live Science in an email.

Dajani mainly studies the genetics of ethnic populations in Jordan but always had an interest in stress and epigenetic inheritance. There were several studies in lab animals that suggested epigenetic changes can pass from one generation to the next.

However, the question of whether epigenetic signatures of trauma and displacement can pass between generations of people had yet to be answered.

As a daughter of a Syrian refugee, Dajani realized she was in a unique position to probe the question.

"It clicked in my mind, 'Wait a minute; we can actually answer this question because of the unique characteristics and the unique history that the Syrian community has gone through,'" Dajani told Live Science.

Dajani brought the idea to Catherine Panter-Brick, an anthropologist at Yale University with expertise on stress biomarkers and global health, and Connie Mulligan, an epigeneticist at the University of Florida who focuses on childhood adversity. The three scientists spent the next decade partnering on the study.

Dajani and Dima Hamadmad, a co-author of the study and a daughter of Syrian refugees, contacted families all over the world mainly through word of mouth. The researchers sat down with the families and listened to their stories; they also explained the science of epigenetics, what they could expect from the study's results, and how these results could bring awareness to their stories.

"They [the families] felt gratified because, first, they understood the science, and second, they felt agency — that they were doing something in response to what happened to them," Dajani said.

"This could have only happened because … I'm a scientist and I'm Syrian. So it's somebody from the community center."

The Hama massacre was an assault by the government on the west-central city of Hama, during which an estimated 10,000 to 40,000 people were either killed or disappeared. The Syrian uprising that began in 2011 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians protesting the Assad government regime.

It took seven years to find families with three generations of women willing to participate in the study and gather enough samples to meet its criteria. The researchers collected blood samples from grandmothers who had been pregnant during the 1982 attack, as well as from their daughters and granddaughters.

They also collected samples from mothers who had been pregnant during the 2011 uprising and from their mothers and daughters.

Additionally, the research team found families with daughters where one was a child during the 2011 uprising, and thus had direct exposure to trauma, while the other daughter was still in the womb at the time.

Finally, they took samples from Syrian families that had left the country before either incident, to use as a point of comparison.

"You cannot find three generations of humans who have been subjected to the brutality of war in such a discrete way with grandmothers versus mothers versus children being exposed or non-exposed to war. So that's a very unique design," Panter-Brick said.

An analysis of the samples revealed 21 distinct epigenetic changes in the genome that were unique to those who had direct exposure to trauma. An additional 14 changes seemed to be unique to the grandchildren of grandmothers who were exposed to trauma while pregnant.

Together, these changes occurred at 35 sites along the genome. And the data hinted that, at the majority of those sites, the same pattern of epigenetic changes unfolded regardless of the type of exposure — direct, prenatal or from a prior generation.

Specifically, one common type of epigenetic change is the addition or subtraction of a compound — called a methyl group — from DNA. So across the different trauma types, most of the sites showed methylation in the "same direction," either adding or subtracting.

However, that finding wasn't statistically significant, likely due to the relatively small sample sizes in each group, the authors noted. So the findings bear confirming in larger samples.

"What it seems to say is that there might be a common epigenetic signature of violence across generations, exposures and developmental stages," Mulligan told Live Science.

The analysis also found that children who were exposed to trauma in the womb appeared epigenetically "older" than their chronological ages; this was not seen in other modes of exposure. So-called accelerated epigenetic aging has been linked to a number of health issues, but it's unclear whether the epigenetic changes drive the health problems or simply reflect them.

Mulligan suggested that this aging effect could be the result of trauma exposure during a highly active stage of fetal development, which could explain why it was only seen in the context of prenatal exposure.

The scientists don't yet know what differences these epigenetic signatures might mean for human health.

Mulligan suggested that the marks "might have allowed humans to adapt to environmental stressors, particularly psychosocial stress and violence." The theory would need to be confirmed in future research.

Looking ahead, the researchers plan to continue investigating what these epigenetic changes mean biologically, as well as study other groups of people and see if the same sites are changed.

Dajani previously published work about how studies like these can shift our perspective on traumatic events.

"We can use this framing to go from victimhood and vulnerability to agency and adaptability," she said. "We can propose that our discovery is proof that humans inherit this adaptability so that they can cope with future unpredictable environments.”

Dajani also recently became a grandmother and reflected on what she would say to her granddaughter about the discovery.

—Epigenetics linked to the maximum life spans of mammals — including us

—IVF may raise risk of certain disorders in babies — and epigenetic 'signatures' in the placenta could explain why

—Pregnancy may speed up 'biological aging,' study suggests

"Even though your grandparents or great-grandparents went through something, you have the tenacity, the 'sumud' [an Arabic word meaning "steadfastness"], to go forward and thrive and flourish," she said.

For Panter-Brick, "it's just pure joy to see the actual results come to fruition at this point.

"And it just means a lot for the population themselves, for our team of women scientists, and for the results of science," she added. "But this is [also] an example of how we can work together for the benefit of humanity by understanding more about the challenges that humans repeatedly find themselves in when they face different kinds of violence."

POLG-related diseases disrupt the function of the mitochondria, or "powerhouses" of the cell — starving them of energy.

Disease name: Polymerase gamma-related diseases, called POLG-related diseases for short

Affected populations: POLG-related diseases are a group of rare, incurable conditions caused by inherited gene mutations. These disease-causing mutations are carried by up to 2% of people of Northern European descent. However, not everyone who carries the mutations ultimately develops a POLG-related disorder.

Estimates suggest that these diseases affect approximately 1 in 10,000 people worldwide.

Causes: POLG-related diseases are caused by several hundred different mutations in the POLG gene. This gene encodes a protein in mitochondria, called DNA polymerase gamma (pol γ), which is needed to replicate and repair the unique DNA found only inside mitochondria, rather than in the cell nucleus.

People develop POLG-related diseases by inheriting either one or two copies of the mutated POLG gene from one or both of their parents.

Mitochondria are the cellular powerhouses responsible for breaking down the carbohydrates and fatty acids in food to produce molecules called ATP, which the body then uses as energy.

In people with POLG-related diseases, issues with polymerase gamma can either end up decreasing the amount of DNA in mitochondria or introducing mutations into that DNA. And in some cases, both these events can occur.

Ultimately, cells become energy-depleted, and this can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

POLG mutations are the most common cause of inherited mitochondrial disorders, with around 300 mutations in POLG known to cause disease. Examples of POLG-related diseases include Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, ataxia neuropathy spectrum and childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum.



Symptoms: POLG-related diseases can be tricky to diagnose, in part, because they can cause an array of symptoms that vary in severity. These symptoms can also emerge at different times in a person's life, from early childhood to adulthood, depending on which disease they have.

The timing of symptoms partly varies depending on the specific POLG mutation a person carries and the number of copies, as well as the underlying driver of their condition — whether it's mostly related to the loss of DNA or accumulation of mutations.

Once they manifest, the symptoms mostly affect parts of the body that require a lot of energy, such as the central nervous system, muscles and liver.

Common symptoms of POLG-related diseases include progressive weakness of the eye muscles and the muscles that are closest to the center of the body, such as those located in the shoulders or upper arms. People with these diseases may also have droopy eyelids and develop epilepsy and liver failure.

Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is one of the most severe forms of POLG-related disease. In addition to the previously listed symptoms, people with this condition also usually experience seizures, a reduced ability to move and liver disease.

People with ataxia neuropathy spectrum, meanwhile experience issues with coordination and balance, as well as reduced nerve function.

Treatments: There is no cure for POLG-related diseases; current treatments instead focus on reducing a patient's symptoms. For instance, doctors can prescribe drugs to help manage seizures or movement difficulties. Transplantation is also an option for patients who experience liver failure.

People with a POLG-related disease typically live for between three months and 12 years after symptoms first begin.

Recent cases: In March 2025, Prince Frederik of Luxembourg, who was second cousin of the heir to the throne, reportedly died of a POLG-related disease at the age of 22. Frederik was the founder and creative director of The POLG Foundation, an organization that supports research into treatments for POLG-related diseases.

                    Researchers use the world's most powerful supercomputers to simulate the inner workings of cellular machinery that restores DNA and prevents deadly diseases

Sunburns and aging skin are obvious effects of exposure to harmful UV rays, tobacco smoke and other carcinogens. But the effects aren't just skin deep. Inside the body, DNA is literally being torn apart.

Understanding how the body heals and protects itself from DNA damage is vital for treating genetic disorders and life-threatening diseases such as cancer. But despite numerous studies and medical advances, much about the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair remains a mystery.

For the past several years, researchers at Georgia State University tapped into the Summit supercomputer at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to study an elaborate molecular pathway called nucleotide excision repair, or NER. NER relies on an array of highly dynamic protein complexes to cut out, or excise, damaged DNA with surgical precision.

In their latest study, published in Nature Communications, the team built a computer model of a critical NER component called the pre-incision complex, or PInC. PInC plays a key role in regulating DNA repair processes in the latter stages of the NER pathway. Decoding NER's sophisticated sequence of events and the role of PInC in the pathway could provide key insights into developing novel treatments and preventing conditions that lead to premature aging and certain types of cancer.

“We're interested in the way cells repair their genetic material,” said lead investigator Ivaylo Ivanov, a chemistry professor at Georgia State University. “NER is a versatile pathway that repairs all kinds of different DNA damage using a three-stage process that relies on delicately balanced molecular machinery. Unfortunately, harmful mutations can develop that interfere with this machinery and cause severe human diseases.”

“Yet, the effects of genetic mutations can be strikingly different depending on their positions within the repair complexes. In some cases, mutations result in patients having UV light sensitivity and an extreme cancer predisposition. In other cases, they cause abnormal development and premature aging,” he said. “Why that happens is not completely understood at the molecular level. That's the mystery our computer modeling efforts aim to unravel.”

The three acts of repair

NER unfolds in three distinct stages: recognition, verification and repair. Each stage requires different groups of proteins to perform specific functions, much like a trauma team has different specialists needed to treat injured patients in the emergency room. In that way, the NER machinery can adapt and change its shape depending on the task at hand.

In the first stage, the NER protein XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum group C) acts like a first responder that locates the site of the damaged DNA, or lesion, and then twists the DNA helix to make the damage accessible. XPC then calls in other repair proteins to help initiate the second stage, called damage verification, or lesion scanning.

Here, the NER protein machinery shifts into its next shape. As XPC steps back, the protein complex called transcription factor IIH, or TFIIH (pronounced T-F-2-H), moves into position. TFIIH further unwinds the section of DNA and scans the newly exposed strand for lesions.

After that, it's in the hands of the surgeon — the PInC — in the third and final stage of repair.

With the “patient” stabilized and prepped for surgery, the operation to remove the damaged DNA strand can begin. Two enzymes, XPF and XPG (xeroderma pigmentosum groups F and G), position themselves precisely on each side of the lesion and act as molecular scissors to cut out the damaged segment of DNA.

Once the lesion is removed, new DNA is synthesized to fill in the gap left behind. Finally, the DNA backbone is sealed, and the damaged DNA is restored back to health.

“What we want to know is how the PInC forms after the lesion scanning phase,” Ivanov said. “How does it control the positioning of the two enzyme subunits that perform the dual incision of the damaged DNA strand? And importantly, is there any cross talk between the two enzymes? Do they sense each other?”

“That matters because once the damaged DNA strand is cleaved, it's vital that the repair process is completed by filling in that gap,” he added. “Otherwise, it will lead to cell death or to the introduction of double-stranded breaks, which are extremely harmful to the cell.”

Answering those questions required the researchers to solve the structure of the PInC. In biology, understanding protein structure is essential for understanding the behavior or function of protein assemblies. The shapes, sizes and interactions of proteins determine how they fit together to form large biomolecular assemblies.

“We integrated the structural model of PInC using data from a variety of biophysical techniques, notably cryo-electron microscopy,” Ivanov said. “But in the end, the computation is what puts everything together.”

Much like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the PInC model had to be assembled from known structures of constituent proteins, and all the individual pieces had to be put together in 3D. However, many of the PInC components had no known experimental structures.

To overcome this challenge, the researchers used a neural network-based model called AlphaFold2 to predict the unknown structures and the interfaces between the proteins that hold PInC together.

Summit's final simulations

“Computationally, once you assemble the PInC, molecular dynamics simulations of the complex become relatively straightforward, especially on large supercomputers like Summit,” Ivanov said.

Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics, or NAMD, is a molecular dynamics code specifically designed for supercomputers and is used to simulate the movements and interactions of large biomolecular systems that contain millions of atoms. Using NAMD, the research team ran extensive simulations. The number-crunching power of the 200-petaflop Summit supercomputer — capable of performing 200,000 trillion calculations per second — was essential in unraveling the functional dynamics of the PInC complex on a timescale of microseconds.

“The simulations showed us a lot about the complex nature of the PInC machinery. It showed us how these different components move together as modules and the subdivision of this complex into dynamic communities, which form the moving parts of this machine,” Ivanov said.

The findings are significant in that mutations in XPF and XPG can lead to severe human genetic disorders. They include xeroderma pigmentosum, which is a condition that makes people more susceptible to skin cancer, and Cockayne syndrome, which can affect human growth and development, lead to impaired hearing and vision, and speed up the aging process.

“Simulations allow us to zero in on these important regions because mutations that interfere with the function of the NER complex often occur at community interfaces, which are the most dynamic regions of the machine,” Ivanov said. “Now we have a much better understanding of how and from where these disorders manifest.”

Most of the molecular dynamics simulations were performed on Summit. However, after 6 years of production, Summit was retired at the end of 2024.

Looking ahead, Ivanov and his team plan to use Summit's successor, Frontier, the exascale-class supercomputer that debuted as the world's most powerful supercomputer when it came online in 2022.

Their work on Frontier will involve examining transcription-coupled NER, which is a DNA repair process that fixes damage in actively transcribed genes to ensure that essential proteins can continue being made.

In addition to Ivanov, the research team includes Jina Yu, Chunli Yan, Tanmoy Paul and Lucas Brewer at Georgia State University; Susan E. Tsutakawa and John A. Tainer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chi-Lin Tsai at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; and Samir M. Hamdan at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.

NATIONAL REPORT — Whether a single store or a large chain, operating expenses are something every convenience store retailer must deal with. Finding ways to streamline operations and increase efficiency can have a huge impact on an operator's bottom line and so, many c-store retailers are turning to technology to accomplish this goal.

"Operating expenses are expensive and one of the biggest is labor, which has become much more expensive since the pandemic," said Kay Segal, founding partner at Business Accelerator Team, a convenience retailing consultancy based in Phoenix. "We need to rethink processes and use technology that can take repetitive actions away, and enhance the guest interaction."

Technology, both in-store and at the headquarters level, is helping convenience retailers save on labor, monitor equipment, speed up training and onboarding of new employees, and improve customer satisfaction. In many cases, a company's operations and technology departments are coming together to execute plans.

"More and more, I'm hearing about solutions that provide retailers with the ability to take a proactive approach to their operations," said Ed Collupy, owner of Collupy System Solutions LLC, which offers consulting services to the industry. "IoT [Internet of Things] and remote management systems where devices are monitored, such as temperatures and equipment status, or accessed from headquarters, allow retailers to take corrective action sooner rather than later."

Adding new technology also can remove tasks from staff that are better handled with data, giving store employees and managers more time to interact with customers onsite, according to Ed Burcher, a partner at Business Accelerator Team. One example is automated ordering and replenishment, which he said is more accurate with real-time inventory and sales data.

"This applies to all product lines, including foodservice and ingredients," Burcher said. "IoT, and now AI [artificial intelligence], may seem like overused terms, but they are areas where convenience stores can apply technology, connectivity and data to improve their operations."

Atlantis Management Group, which has 300 stores, 100 of which are company owned, is focused on giving its store managers more time to interact with shoppers.

"We are looking to get the manager out of the back office and more in the front of the store and forecourt," said Rick Rigby, chief technology officer for the Mount Vernon, N.Y.-based company. "We are using tablets and mobile tools to free them up."

Customer interaction and satisfaction can be improved by increasing transaction speed as well, using mobile apps for ordering and payment, and self-checkout, according to Burcher.

Additionally, he pointed out that using data "to gain more insight into shopping behaviors to improve the store and digital experience for the guest" can improve operations in real-time and provide ongoing feedback to the operator that can be acted upon at the store level.

"Whether you call it improved data analytics or AI, technology can be applied at many touchpoints for the guest and staff to improve the experience," Burcher said.

Atlantis Management uses InStore.ai's artificial intelligence audio tool to gather information from customers shopping in its stores and provide feedback to its operations team for areas of improvement, according to Rigby.

"Technology can help with customer service by tracking guest interactions and reviewing transactions for opportunities," Burcher noted. "This involves reviewing actual transactions and providing feedback and dashboards to the staff and store. These reviews can be used not only in a call center environment, but also at the point of purchase in-store."

With foodservice becoming such an integral part of many convenience store's offering, finding ways to streamline and improve operations in this high-margin category is crucial. C-store retailers still struggle to compete with the integrated technology available to quick-service restaurants that links customer ordering, food preparation, supply chain and more.

"Some retailers are investing in developing their own solutions or starting up integration projects that will unite kitchen management systems with back-office and POS [point-of-sale] systems," Collupy explained. "There is still a lot of work to be done."

Many c-stores today have automated food ordering through in-store kiosks, screens at the fuel pumps, mobile apps and online ordering. This data, which can be used with other systems, is helping operators forecast demand, create a detailed plan for food prep and get a better handle on inventory replenishment, according to Burcher.

"These systems can not only lead to having the right products available when needed, but also avoid waste by not overproducing," he said, noting that companies such as Supplyit offer an integrated solution that takes "staff preferences out of the equation" to create a detailed production plan for foodservice team members. "This helps all facets of preparation and is probably most critical for hot items like breakfast and roller grill where is there is a very short shelf-life."

Automating reordering and the monitoring of temperatures and equipment for food safety are other ways retailers are utilizing technology to streamline foodservice operations at the store level. Atlantis Management is in the early days of meeting with vendors to leverage foodservice technology such as temperature probes, Rigby shared.

At Kansas City, Mo.-based Fav Trip, which operates five stores, the retailer offers Caribou Coffee and is monitoring the machines to know how much coffee is being sold at what time, as well as for reordering purposes, according to President and CEO Babir Sultan.

"In the world of IoT, every piece of equipment can be connected to analyze usage, cleaning, stock levels, temperature and 'up time,' and report these metrics," Burcher said. "This is being applied to programmable equipment to ensure proper time and temps for heating items and downloading the most up-to-date programs."

Whether it's automating label printers for hundreds of stores or uploading a new recipe with cook times and temperatures for a new menu item or limited-time offer, automation in foodservice operations is aiding convenience retailers, he added.

Technology is playing a role in other facets of c-store operations, including labor optimization. For instance, Fav Trip streamlined its training process from a 20-page booklet down to three pages, and then eventually shifted to a technology-based approach.

"Now, we have them watch a video with a quiz at the end online, and it has reduced our training time. The feedback on it has been amazing," said Sultan, adding that the company tries to connect everything back to data, even its labor decisions. "We use our internal data to see how many people we should have working at what times."

Accounting processes are getting a technology overhaul as well. At both the store manager and headquarters level, Atlantis Management is working with its operations team and accounting department to consolidate and optimize forms, and take processes including invoicing and accounts payable from manual to automated, Rigby reported.

"Tools like Microsoft Power Automate and AI-powered Copilot are what we are using," he said, adding that these tools are being used also for notetaking, meeting summation, email automation and report writing for both managers and headquarters employees.

IRIS, the global provider of mobile F&B and guest experience platforms for the hospitality sector, today announces it has partnered with Coury Hospitality, the leading hospitality management company, to extend F&B mobile ordering across its portfolio following a 44% year-on-year increase in in-room dining sales.

Currently live in 12 Coury Hospitality-managed hotels, the new partnership agreement will see IRIS deliver the brand standard for F&B mobile dining to all the group's properties worldwide. Built to enable operators to deliver swifter, more efficient order processing, it is a seamless way for guests to order F&B items via their own device, without the need for an additional app.

The agreement follows the successful implementation of the IRIS mobile ordering solution at several Coury Hospitality hotels which has delivered an impressive 44% growth in in-room dining sales over the past year, demonstrating the platform's popularity and adoption.

Mobile ordering has enabled the hotels to capture more guest orders and boost guest spend, mainly driven by the ease of ordering and visibility of additional items and upsells which encourages guests to order more per transaction.

Commenting on the partnership, Nicole Haarklau, Director of F&B Operations, Coury Hospitality said, “The response from both guests and staff since we first introduced the IRIS F&B Ordering solution has been overwhelmingly positive. Delivery times have been reduced, and the growth in order volumes, revenue and guest satisfaction is testament to its accessibility and performance.

“Indeed, the number of orders made via mobile now significantly exceeds those made over the phone as guests have been swift to engage at an encouraging rate. The added convenience and time saved have really added to its appeal.

“As guests increasingly turn to mobile ordering it is vital that we partner with a provider that has the knowledge and capability to deliver a solution that enables us to meet this demand and critically, grow with us as we look to expand our portfolio in the future. The IRIS team have proven to be a valuable, dynamic ally with integrations across both our PMS and POS systems which has meant deployment and adoption by staff has been straightforward. We look forward to extending the partnership as they deliver the brand standard for mobile ordering across our portfolio in the future. “

Graham Rushin, VP Sales and Marketing at IRIS added, “Guest demand for mobile dining is accelerating at an unprecedented rate and the growth in digital order volumes and revenue speak for themselves. Across our portfolio we are continuing to invest in the development of solutions that enhance both the guest and staff experience so that ordering is seamless and hoteliers are equipped to realise their full revenue potential.

“Coury Hospitality has undergone an incredible period of growth and we look forward to continuing to work with the team to support and drive forward their plans for the future, delivering a brand standard for mobile ordering that will continue to exceed expectations across its portfolio.”

In Coury Hospitality-managed hotels, IRIS mobile in-room dining is accessible to guests via a QR code situated in strategic locations within guest rooms. The direct integration to the hotel's POS enables orders to be digitally delivered directly to the kitchens, reducing guest wait times and eliminating errors. Likewise, guests benefit from a more readily available menu to view, order and pay at their convenience.

TURIN, Italy--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Adtran today announced that the Turin and Piedmont Internet Exchange (TOP-IX) has launched Italy's first time-as-a-service (TaaS) solution using Adtran Oscilloquartz technology. Delivered in collaboration with Italy's National Institute of Metrological Research and other strategic partners, the service leverages Oscilloquartz edge grandmaster devices deployed across TOP-IX's dedicated fiber network. This solution provides precise timing and synchronization to organizations across Italy and beyond, supporting sectors such as finance, healthcare and logistics.





“Today, mission-critical industries require uninterrupted access to precise timing and synchronization,” said Andrea Casalegno, managing director at TOP-IX. “But developing and providing dedicated timing infrastructure can be expensive and resource-intensive, putting it out of reach for many organizations. That's why we introduced our new TaaS offering, which is a secure and reliable alternative to GNSS systems. As the first service of its kind in Italy, it provides our customers with a highly cost-effective and accessible way to achieve the precision synchronization required for even the most demanding applications. Built on Adtran's scalable and flexible Oscilloquartz technology and underpinned by national metrological standards, this solution ensures unmatched accuracy and reliability.”



Adtran's OSA 5410XG and OSA 5412 grandmaster clocks provide the backbone of TOP-IX's TaaS platform. The OSA 5410XG's compact design and high-speed capabilities, including multiple 10Gbit/s ports, enable TOP-IX to meet the increasing demands of high-bandwidth applications while ensuring rapid scalability. Both devices feature Syncjack™ technology, which gives TOP-IX and its customers real-time performance monitoring, ensuring uninterrupted synchronization even in the face of external threats. With low-touch provisioning, the devices can be easily deployed, empowering TOP-IX to offer a secure and affordable alternative to building private timing infrastructures.



“This is a major milestone for Italy's digital infrastructure, enabling organizations to access precise and secure timing without the need for costly dedicated systems,” commented Stuart Broome, GM of EMEA sales at Adtran. “Our technology offers features like jamming and spoofing detection, multi-band GNSS receivers and timing assurance to ensure highly accurate and secure synchronization. With their compact, cost-effective design and low-touch provisioning, our devices enable TOP-IX to quickly deploy services across its network and meet the growing demand for ultra-reliable timing. What's more, by supporting compliance with evolving PNT standards, our solutions help TOP-IX future-proof its offerings and strengthen Italy's national timing infrastructure.”

Speaking about the process, CEO & President John Gillard stated, “Over the past year we have focused on proving the technological and market feasibility of building a large scale, innovative global CGM business. Our strong pre-pivotal clinical trial data and the keen market interest for our more affordable, user-focused and sustainable CGM solution gives us confidence that this is a vast and compelling opportunity for Trinity Biotech and our investors. At the same time, our strong execution of the Company's ambitious comprehensive transformation plan is poised to provide us with a portfolio of operating businesses with significantly improved financial prospects. Given this progress, now is the right time to explore how we can strategically allocate capital, optimize our balance sheet, and sharpen our focus on CGM growth.”

Police have issued a warning to all phone users over a simple text that could put you in danger - no matter how legitimate it might look. 

Another day, another scam warning. It seems like determined criminals always have a new trick up their sleeve to trick innocent victims, so authorities took to Facebook this week to urge members of the public to remain vigilant.

This particular warning came from Hampden County Sheriff's Office in Massachusetts, though similar scams have been reported elsewhere in the US.

Advert

It all starts with a simple text from a number that's not in your phone contacts, and it explains that you're being contacted in relation to an ongoing investigation.

The text claims that the sender has repeatedly attempted to make contact, reading: "This call is to notify [you] that this is our second attempt to be made to serve you a notice of action pertaining to an investigation being finalized against you."

The text then goes on to encourage the recipient to call back for 'further details on the case or to change its active service status'.

Advert

"Please reference case number 1112525814," one example of the text reads, adding: "Failure to contact them immediately will result in further legal action against you."

Sheriff Nick Cocchi, of the Hampden County Sheriff's Office, issued a warning alongside a screenshot of the text on Facebook, telling the public that if they receive a similar text, they shouldn't trust it.

The post explained: "Criminals are sending alarming messages, claiming the recipient is under investigation and demanding a call back to avoid "legal action." These scammers may also include fake case numbers and links that could install malware."

Cocchi said the alarming nature of the text was all part of the scam, as he continued: "These scammers want to scare people into acting before thinking. Law enforcement will never call, text, or email to demand money, resolve a warrant, or conduct official business. If you receive a message like this, do not engage—delete it and report it."

Advert

The post added that even if the ID attached to the text might appear to be from a 'legitimate agency', it's likely that the scammer actually faked the ID using online services.

"The Hampden County Sheriff's Office will never request payment or personal information over the phone, via text, or online," the post added. "Please share this warning with your family and friends, especially those who may be more vulnerable to scams. Stay safe!"

The warning from Cocchi comes as residents in North Carolina have been experiencing scam texts which claim recipients owe money on an outstanding toll.

Advert

The scam texts claim to be from E-ZPass, EZDriveMA, and FasTrak, ABC 11 reports, with some warning that if you don't pay the toll within 12 hours, the charges will increase and you'll be turned into The Registry of Motor Vehicles.

Steve Grobman, of the security company McAfee, told the outlet: "We need to recognize that what scammers do is they focus on things that scare people and create a sense of urgency."

Experts have warned that you should never click links sent in messages that could be from a scammer, and instead do your own research into whether the claims could be legitimate.

An explosion on the Texas Tech University campus in Lubbock set off fires and power outages Wednesday, leading school officials to issue evacuation orders for several buildings and cancel classes for the rest of the week.

An alert sent to the campus community around 8:45 p.m. described the explosion as occurring at a substation but a later update said it was at a manhole.

No injuries were reported, Lubbock Fire Rescue Capt. Jon Tunnell said.

Videos circulating on social media and local TV stations showed a heavy presence of firefighters on campus and fire and smoke coming out of at least one manhole cover.

It wasn't clear what might have caused the explosion.

Power will be shut down to the entire campus in Lubbock, Texas, while repairs are underway, said Caitlynn Jeffries, a spokesperson for the university's police department.

“You can go ahead and go home for Spring break. We are closing school down for the next couple days,” Jeffries said.

The school also instructed faculty and staff to work remotely if possible until further notice.

Tata Technologies Ltd, a subsidiary of Tata Motors encountered a ransomware attack earlier this year that affected the company's network and forced it to suspend some of its services. Now, TechCrunch has reported that a ransomware group that goes by the name Hunters International has published what it claims to be data stolen from the Pune headquartered company.

According to TechCrunch, who claims to have seen the data published on the gang's dark web leak site said it includes personal details about current and former employees along with some confidential information like purchase orders and some contracts with customers in India and the United States.

The leaked data, which amounts to about 1.4TB in size includes more than 7,30,000 documents like Excel spreadsheets, PDF files and PowerPoint presentations. However, it is still unclear if the data shared by the Hunters International group is in any way related to the recent ransomware attack.

In a filing with the Indian stock exchanges, Tata Technologies had said that an investigation was underway “in consultation with experts to assess the root cause and take remedial action as necessary.”

For those unfamiliar, Hunters International is a relatively new ransomware-as-a-service group that offers its infrastructure to hackers and takes a cut of the ransom payments. It is also affiliated with the Hive gang, which may have previously leaked stolen data from Tata Power back in 2022.

Founded in 1989 as an automotive unit of Tata Motors, Tata Technologies focuses on automotive design, aerospace engineering and research and development and has an annual revenue of $600 million, operating in more than 18 locations in India, Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America.

The topic of nuclear energy continues to be a hot-button item in Eagle Mountain.

The city is exploring the idea of integrating small modular reactors, or SMRs, among other forms of advanced power generation facilities within the city.

In January, the Eagle Mountain City Council halted on voting in favor or against a code amendment to the city's Regional Technology and Industry overlay zone.

The code change, according to city officials, could open the door in facilitating the use of a variety of energy options in the city, including battery energy storage systems, solar energy projects, electrical substations, power lines and small modular reactors.

However, Eagle Mountain city leaders wanted to allow more time to gather information about nuclear technology.

On Monday, the city hosted an energy town hall at Cedar Valley High School, featuring a panel of energy experts with an abundance of experience in the field.

Expertise among the six panelists include coal, renewable and battery storage, biofuels, oil shale, nuclear power, hydrogen and advanced combustion.

Mayor Tom Westmoreland moderated the discussion and presented a slew of questions from community members to the panel.

“We're not going to solve any problems tonight, but we're going to begin the discussion,” Westmoreland said during the town hall. “Definitely the place to start is by informing and educating ourselves and learning all that we can about energy so that we can make good decisions going forward.”

City leaders note the exploration of SMRs comes as Eagle Mountain examines sustainable and long-term energy solutions to meet the growing needs of its population and business landscape.

Matthew Memmott, an associate professor in chemical engineering at Brigham Young University, said nuclear technology such as SMRs are making headway but often face opposition from the public due to the perception regarding radiation.

“In reality, the world is awash with radiation, and if we can't handle even the slightest bit of radiation, we should not be living on the planet,” Memmott said.

Panelists noted the need for a modernized power grid with a capacity to meet the future energy demands that Eagle Mountain anticipates.

With safety being top of mind for many who are skeptical of allowing such technology to enter the area, due to the smaller footprint of modern SMRs, only the boundaries of the nuclear site would be required to evacuate.

“So for large (nuclear) plants, they actually plan the escape for how traffic has to move; that is done out to 10 miles,” said Jess Gehin, associate laboratory director at Idaho National Laboratory. “For modern SMRs, that is reduced down to the site boundary.”

Panelists also discussed regulatory frameworks, economic considerations associated with these energy solutions and potential health risks.

Eagle Mountain officials say nuclear energy, particularly through the deployment of nonwater cooled SMRs, is being considered for its potential to provide a stable and low-carbon power supply.

Currently, the city has not authorized any nuclear energy projects, but they aren't ruling it out for the future.

As Eagle Mountain continues to weigh the option, leaders encourage citizens to get involved in the decision-making process by attending public meetings and connecting with elected officials.

The City Council's next meeting will be held Tuesday at Eagle Mountain city hall, located at 1650 Stagecoach Run.

The full video from Monday's nearly two-hour long town hall can be viewed online at eaglemountain.gov.

Las Vegas (KSNV) — Nevada State Senator Melanie Scheible has introduced Senate Bill 352, a significant legislative effort aimed at ensuring equal access to quality health care for all Nevadans, including LGBTQ+ individuals. 

The bill seeks to prohibit discrimination by both public and private health insurance carriers and providers based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability.

The proposed legislation would apply to health insurance policies, including Medicaid and the Nevada ACA Exchange, and would also prevent healthcare providers from engaging in discriminatory practices. 

Additionally, it empowers state regulatory boards and agencies to adopt regulations and discipline providers who violate these prohibitions.

André C. Wade, State Director for Silver State Equality, expressed strong support for the bill. "This bill makes a resolute stance against discriminatory practices that can hinder the delivery of healthcare service to a large portion of Nevada's population," Wade said. 

He emphasized the importance of enshrining these protections into state law, particularly for the LGBTQ+ community, and praised Senator Scheible's commitment to the health and well-being of every Nevadan.

"In Nevada, we believe in equality, and that includes equality in healthcare," said Scheible. "Senate Bill 352 will maintain our commitment to non-discrimination in health insurance and give Nevadans equal opportunities to access health plans."

Silver State Equality has endorsed the passage of SB 352, highlighting it as a critical step toward a fair healthcare system in Nevada.

Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: AVAH) is still working on executing its transformation strategy — which focuses on preferred payers and obtaining adequate rates from its government partners — while also navigating a tricky labor environment. 

For 2024, the company's goal was to increase the number of private-duty services preferred payer agreements from 14 to 22. The company achieved this goal with the addition of eight additional preferred pay agreements. 

“Our Q4, and full year 2024, results highlight that we continue to align our objectives with those of our preferred payers and government partners,” Aveanna Healthcare CEO Jeff Shaner, said Thursday during the company's fourth quarter earnings call. “By focusing our clinical capacity on our preferred payers, we achieved solid year over year growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA.” 

Atlanta-based Aveanna Healthcare offers a range of pediatric and adult health care services, including nursing, rehabilitation, occupational nursing in schools, therapy services, day treatment centers for medically fragile and chronically ill children and adults, and home health and hospice services. The company has 327 locations across 34 states. 

Though Shaner called out the current labor environment as a primary challenge, he also credited Aveanna Healthcare's preferred payer strategy for the company's improved retention and hiring rates. 

“We also experienced improvement in our caregiver hiring and retention trends by aligning our efforts with those payers willing to engage with us on enhanced reimbursement rates, and value-based agreements,” he said. “While we continue to operate in a challenging environment, our preferred payer strategy allows us to return to a more normalized growth rate in our business segments.” 

Aveanna Healthcare's preferred payer strategy has allowed the company to invest in caregiver wages and recruitment efforts.

Since Aveanna Healthcare's third quarter earnings call, the company has also made strides on a number of its rate improvement initiatives with both government and preferred payers. The company is also seeing signs of improvement in the caregiver labor market, according to Shaner.

The company's 2024 goal was to improve reimbursement rates in our various states, with a particular emphasis on Georgia, Massachusetts and California. Aveanna Healthcare secured double-digit rate improvements in both Georgia and Massachusetts.

“These states demonstrate our government affairs strategy, to partner with state legislatures and governors to identify shortfalls in private-duty nursing wages and to align reimbursement rates to improve access to care for patients with complex medical conditions,” Shaner said.

Overall, Aveanna Healthcare secured 12 private-duty services state rate increases for 2024.

Despite seeing success, Stephens identified this as a potential area of exposure.  

“[Aveanna Healthcare] generates a significant percentage of revenue (~90%) from government payers,” Stephens analysts wrote in the research brief. “[The company] could experience pressure on revenues/adjusted EBITDA from unanticipated changes in government reimbursement rates.”  

On the home health side, the company's 2024 goal was to maintain its episodic payer mix above 70%.

“In Q4 our episodic mix was 76%,” Shaner said. “However, our total episodic volume growth was slightly lower as compared to the prior year period. We ended 2024 with a total of 38 episodic agreements, and are well-positioned for growth in 2025. We are committed to growing our home health volumes, and I expect us to return to positive year-over-year growth trends in the first half of 2025. We will remain focused on aligning our home health caregiver capacity with those payers willing to reimburse us on an episodic basis, and focus on improved clinical and financial outcomes.” 

Shaner also outlines the five primary strategic initiatives that Aveanna Healthcare plans to focus on this year.

“First, enhancing partnerships with government partners and preferred payers to create additional capacity and growth,” he said. “Second, identifying cost efficiencies and synergies that allow us to leverage our growth. Third, modernizing our medical solutions business to achieve our top target operating model. Fourth, managing our capital structure and collecting our cash while producing positive free cash flow, and finally, engaging our leaders and employees and delivering our Aveanna mission.” 

For Q4, Aveanna Healthcare reported revenues of $519.9 million, a 8.6% increase compared to $478.8 million during the same period last year.

The company's private-duty services segment brought in $422 million, a 10.1% increase compared to $383 million in Q4 2023. Its home health and hospice segment checked in at $54.4million, a 0.6% increase compared to $54.1 million during the same period last year.

The company anticipates a 2025 revenue range of $2.10 to $2.12 billion.

“We believe this initial [2025] outlook provides a prudent view, considering the challenges we still face with the evolving environment,” Shaner said.

By Vatican News

The Holy See Press Office updated reporters on the Pope's condition on Thursday evening, as he marked the 12th anniversary of his election to the papacy.

In the afternoon, the medical staff brought a cake with candles to the Pope's room.

The Pope also followed the Spiritual Exercises for the Roman Curia via video link with the Paul VI Hall, and resumed respiratory therapy.

He continues to alternate between non-invasive mechanical ventilation at night and high-flow oxygenation with nasal cannulas during the day.

His clinical situation remains stable within a complex condition. A new medical bulletin is expected on Friday evening.

Pope Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital on February 14 to receive treatment for bilateral pneumonia.

Longtime Memphis television broadcaster Richard Ransom is leaving ABC24 to join Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare on March 24, the hospital system announced Thursday.

Ransom spent almost a decade at ABC24 but has been in the Memphis media landscape for 20 years.

At the end of February, Richard posted to his Facebook account that he would be leaving the news industry to embark on a "new chapter."

“I am excited to join the team at Methodist and continue to share the stories that matter to Mid-Southerners and support the expert healthcare professionals right here in the Bluff City,” Ransom said in a statement Thursday.

Ransom will join the healthcare system as the Director of Strategic Communication, where he will "provide guidance" on employee communications and media relations and support "community initiatives."

Methodist President and CEO Dr. Michael Ugwueke said in a statement that Ransom was "drawn" to the healthcare system's mission.

“I'm confident that his communications expertise and his familiarity with the health concerns impacting Mid-Southerners will be a benefit to our organization and the community at large,” Ugwueke said.

A graduate of the University of Missouri, Ransom started covering Memphis in 2001 with WMC where he stayed for seven years, according to his LinkedIn. He briefly moved away from Memphis before moving back to work with WREG.

Ransom joined ABC24 in 2017, where he served as an anchor for the station's evening broadcasts, anchor for "ABC24 This Week" and has been the managing editor for the station.

House Republicans proposed Medicaid cuts last month that would have disastrous financial consequences for hospitals, especially for those in rural areas. While the plan aims to reduce government spending, healthcare executives are pointing out that these cuts would actually exacerbate the financial instability of the overall U.S. healthcare system — as well worsen health outcomes for millions of people, many of whom are children.

As Congress deliberates what the future of Medicaid funding will look like, healthcare executives are worried.

House Republicans proposed Medicaid cuts last month that would have sweeping and disproportionate consequences — particularly for rural hospitals and underserved populations. The plan, which seeks to reduce Medicaid spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, lacks specifics but could be implemented through reduced federal funding, block grants or stricter eligibility requirements. Healthcare leaders warn that these cuts would cause uncompensated care costs to balloon, leading to hospital closures and diminished care access.

The experts interviewed for this article agreed that while the proposed Medicaid cuts aim to reduce government spending, the plan will actually end up exacerbating the financial instability of the overall U.S. healthcare system — as well worsen health outcomes for millions of Americans.


					Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.				

House Republicans introduced a budget plan last month ordering various congressional committees to find at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years. It directs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, to reduce its spending by $880 billion over that time period.

The GOP's budget blueprint doesn't outline how the committee would achieve this target, but it's clear that doing so would involve significant cuts to Medicaid. The nation's Medicaid program, which provides health coverage for about 72 million Americans, accounts for one-sixth of all healthcare expenditures and is one of the largest programs under the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction.

The day the plan was released, one federal budget expert — Bobby Kogan, senior director of Federal Budget Policy at Center for American Progress and former adviser to the director of the Office of Management and Budget under the previous presidential administration — wrote on X that this plan would undoubtedly require major cuts to Medicaid.


					Transitioning to PDPM models significantly shifted the healthcare industry. By replacing the RUG system, healthcare providers cut waste and more accurately reflect the care each patient received.				

“For Energy and Commerce, it's mathematically impossible to achieve $880 billion in savings if you don't cut Medicaid or Medicare. There's not enough money they have jurisdiction over. Republicans say they're not cutting Medicare, so that means they're cutting Medicaid,” he wrote.

A March 5 report from the Congressional Budget Office also found it is impossible to achieve $880 billion in savings without broad cuts to Medicaid.

The House passed the budget resolution on February 25, and the Senate is expected to vote on the plan this month. 

Healthcare leaders certainly don't have a sunny outlook about the budget resolution making its way through Congress, but it's presently difficult to quantify exactly how disastrous its effects would be because the plan lacks specifics, said Harold Miller, CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.

There are several ways Congress might go about reducing Medicaid funding, he noted. 

For example, lawmakers could lower the federal government's share of Medicaid funding, which would force states to either cover the difference or slash services. Alternatively, Congress could withdraw federal support for specific services, such as expensive GLP-1 drugs, which would shift financial responsibility to state governments, Miller explained.

Another tactic Congress may choose is cutting eligibility. With Medicaid eligibility reduced, fewer Americans would be insured, which would cause a surge in hospitals' uncompensated care, Miller remarked.

He also mentioned block grants as a possibility. Instead of covering a percentage of costs, the federal government could provide states with a fixed sum for Medicaid — which would limit funding growth and force states to make tough decisions about whether or not to make their own cuts.

“Many people have argued that [block grants] could give the state greater flexibility in terms of exactly what it covers and how it structures the program. The concern is, if Congress decides it's going to cut the overall amount, then the state might not have enough money to be able to provide the same level of benefits,” Miller remarked.

He pointed out that Medicaid cuts would likely lead to many difficult decisions for state-level leaders. Since Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, states would have to figure out how to respond to federal cuts — whether to reduce provider payments, get rid of services or maintain coverage by increasing state spending.

Medicaid cuts would affect many more Americans than just those covered by Medicaid, noted Megan Cundari, senior director of federal relations at American Hospital Association. This is because the financial ramifications would force hospitals to make cost-cutting adjustments like eliminating departments or laying off staff members — thereby affecting all patients.

Slashing Medicaid funding means hospitals would deliver more uncompensated care. Fewer people would have Medicaid coverage, leading to more uninsured patients unable to pay for their services. A report released this week predicted that Medicaid cuts would result in an $80 billion revenue loss for providers next year, due in large part to a spike in uncompensated care costs.

This would strain providers' finances, and many hospitals would be forced to eliminate certain service lines or reduce their staffing levels, Cundari pointed out.

“There may be, for example, longer wait times at the emergency department because there's just not as many staff to help serve all the people that need to be served in the community. I think it's important to understand that the Medicaid cuts are not just Medicaid cuts — and they will not just impact the people who are involved in the program. They're also going to impact entire communities,” she declared.

There are hundreds of rural and safety-net facilities across the nation that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursements to cover the cost of care — and for some of these organizations, a significant decline in Medicaid payments will be the straw that breaks the camel's back, forcing them to close their doors, added Ben Finder, the AHA's vice president of policy, research, analytics and strategy.

When a rural or safety-net hospital closes, its patients don't just disappear, he noted. These patients must seek care at the next nearest facility, which is often a regional hospital that is already operating at capacity. 

This surge in patient volume can overwhelm staff and decrease provider availability, further diminishing care quality and access for all patients in the area, Finder explained.

Medicaid cuts would hit rural hospitals, those who can least afford it, the hardest. For one, most of these hospitals operate on razor-thin margins — research from last month shows nearly half of the country's rural hospitals are operating at a loss.

Secondly, many rural Americans receive coverage through the Medicaid program. In rural communities, 18% of adults are covered by Medicaid. 

In six states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico and South Carolina — more than half of children in rural areas are covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP provides low-cost health coverage to children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance. While CHIP is technically a separate program from Medicaid, CHIP is typically managed and administered in conjunction with it.

Nick Olson, CFO of Sanford Health, called Medicaid “the bedrock” of rural healthcare. Sanford is a South Dakota-based system operating 56 hospitals and more than 270 clinics across several states. 

Most of the health system's patients live in rural communities, Olson said. He also pointed out that more than half of Sanford's skilled nursing facility residents are covered by Medicaid.

“Hospitals across the country are already struggling to break even, and this really puts pressure on their ability to reinvest back into the communities that they're serving — to reinvest back into increasing and expanding access,” Olson declared. “For us, in 2022 alone, and I believe more recent years are similar, we provided over $159 million in uncompensated care.”

Reducing Medicaid funding would cause that figure to rise to an even more unsustainable level, Olson said.

Another healthcare executive — Alan Morgan, CEO of National Rural Health Association — said there is no question that rural hospitals would close should the government cut Medicaid spending.

“Somewhere between 400 to 700 rural hospitals are at financial risk for closure right now, so any type of reduction in revenue is going to have a dramatic impact on these facilities,” he remarked.

Rural hospital closures would force many Americans to travel long distances for even basic treatments and emergency care. This would cause many rural residents to forgo routine care, leading to greater utilization of emergency departments — the most expensive place to get care — Morgan explained.

This problem would destroy the purported intent of the budget resolution, which is to save money, argued Effie Carlson, CEO of care coordination company Watershed Health.

In other words, the House Republicans' plan to cut Medicaid funding aims to save money, but it will likely increase overall healthcare spending. Higher utilization rates in expensive settings like ERs and long-term care facilities will lead to higher costs for taxpayers, Carlson said.

“In healthcare, you don't avoid paying for things — it just gets paid for somewhere else in a less controllable way,” she declared.

To paint an even bleaker economic picture, rural hospitals are often the largest employers in their area, which means that if they reduced staffing or closed, unemployment in those regions would increase, Carlson added.

This would also lead to greater unemployment and reduced tax revenue, thereby pushing rural communities deeper into economic distress, she remarked.

At first, slashing Medicaid funding may appear to save dollars on paper, but experts agree that the real costs are hidden beneath the surface. When hospitals close and care disappears, expenses don't just go away — they get passed to struggling communities and overwhelmed providers.

Drug-resistant infections are linked to over a million deaths a year in India. A health crisis compounded by the country's healthcare inequalities. Dr Gautham and her team are working with rural healthcare providers to better understand the challenges of tackling AMR in these settings – and co-develop innovative solutions.

India is home to the world's largest rural population — an estimated 900 million people.

Across this patchwork of towns, villages and farmlands, access to formal healthcare is extremely limited. Despite the country's extensive private medical system, most doctors and hospitals are found in cities.

“The moment you leave cities behind, there are no qualified doctors around. People have to travel to the nearest urban centre or government health centre if they want to access a qualified doctor," says Dr Meenakshi Gautham, Assistant Professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Project Leader of One Health Antimicrobial Stewardship for Informal Health Systems (OASIS).

In India, Gautham grew up away from rural life, in the capital city of New Delhi. She trained as a social scientist and then pursued a career in public health. As she began working more closely with rural communities, she was struck by the exceptional contrast in healthcare availability.

“In cities, within a radius of five kilometres, you can find about 50 different private doctors. You have so many options. But the private formal sector is unaffordable [and inaccessible] for the people who live in villages.”

This inequality can have significant impacts on the health of rural populations. For example, infant mortality rate is 46 per thousand live births for rural areas compared to 32 per thousand live births for urban areas.

With limited formal healthcare services, a vast and resourceful network of informal, rural healthcare providers exists to fill the gap.

“When you go into rural India, there are a lot of village doctors,” explains Gautham. “These are health care providers who have not received formal training in health, but they have been trained by doctors as their assistants or technicians.” After a few years working in the city, informally trained healthcare workers often return home to set up clinics in their villages. Once established, an intricate ecosystem of professional networks, teleconsultation services and training conferences exist to support the informal practices.

“The informal provider is just as trusted and knows just about enough to manage your problem,” says Gautham. “If they have a doubt, they will consult doctors they are connected to. They learn about new drugs and new therapies through pharmaceutical representatives. This mosaic is an amazing entrepreneurial way of managing a lot of people's health needs. We can't shut them down because the health system will collapse otherwise.”

Rather than fight against this informal system, Gautham's research hopes to work with it to tackle one of India's greatest health threats: drug-resistant infections. 

Drug-resistant infections are linked to over a million deaths a year in India. A health crisis compounded by the country's healthcare inequalities.

Since 2016, Gautham and her team at the OASIS project have been working closely with rural communities to better understand the drivers of antibiotic use and the challenges of tackling AMR in rural settings.

Their findings paint a complex picture. Antimicrobial resistance is poorly understood, antibiotic use is difficult to control and disease surveillance data in community settings is almost non-existent.

“It's a result of the ecosystem in which [the rural healthcare providers] function,” explains Gautham.

Due to a lack of formal medical training, many rural healthcare providers see antibiotics as a cure-all drug. And this misconception extends to the communities they serve. As a result, antibiotics are often dispensed when they are not the appropriate treatment.

“These are communities who need to get better quickly because many of them are daily wage labourers. They cannot take more than a day off work. And they think that giving an antibiotic is the best way of curing a person quickly,” says Gautham.

Another important aspect of Gautham's research has been to investigate how rural communities and healthcare providers understand the concept of antimicrobial resistance.

“We find that knowledge of what causes [ill] health is very mixed – biomedical concepts blend with traditional medicine,” says Gautham. “And so, their understanding of AMR is limited to some medicines not working because you have taken too many of them.”

Without an understanding of the dangers of AMR, rural healthcare providers aren't motivated to collect data or monitor antibiotic use. And without the data, it's difficult to demonstrate the dangers of AMR.

But Gautham and her team have been investigating this for a long time. As well as identifying the problems, they've also been working with communities and other important stakeholders in this ecosystem to find solutions.

We're ensuring research considers the needs and priorities of the most affected communities, so evidence and interventions are acceptable, affordable and accessible in the locations they are most needed.

The OASIS project identified two priority issues to address: there were no suitable antibiotic guidelines for rural healthcare providers and no one was collecting any data.

Gautham and her team knew that the only way to create effective solutions was to co-develop them with people across the informal and formal healthcare ecosystems.

The OASIS team collected years of data from in-depth interviews, surveys and stakeholder consultation groups. They wanted to understand the most common symptoms clinics were facing, how patients were being diagnosed and managed, and which antibiotics were being dispensed and why.

Their findings revealed a clear path forward.

“The [rural healthcare providers] wanted more information about antibiotics, but they wanted it in a flexible format, not where they would have to travel and attend some training program, but something which they could easily manage, like on a mobile phone.”

With support from the Wellcome-funded Trinity Challenge on Antimicrobial Resistance, Gautham and her team are developing the Antibiotic Bandhu App – which means, ‘friend of antibiotics'. This easy-to-use tool will guide users from identifying symptoms to providing first level management for six of the most common illnesses clinics face. Most of which do not require any treatment with antibiotics.

As well as helping reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, the clinics can use the app to record data about which infections they're treating and whether or not they are dispensing antibiotics in a responsible way.

The OASIS team were winners of the Trinity Challenge on Antimicrobial Resistance. A second funding opportunity focussed on antimicrobial resistance has now launched, supported by Wellcome.

The new challenge is a call for low-cost technology and data-driven solutions to improve access to effective antibiotics in community settings in low- and middle-income countries. A prize fund of up to £1 million is available.

Early feasibility assessments of the guidelines show promising results. “It's like a doctor present near us,” noted one participant.

The OASIS team will be training more rural clinics to use the app and guidelines.

But for the guidelines to be successful, the whole community needs to be on board. Gautham is optimistic that rural healthcare providers are the key:

“A really strong enabling factor is that the future of the community and its health is very important to the rural healthcare providers. If they were to counsel patients to not misuse antibiotics, people would listen to them.”

The OASIS team will also be able to collect and analyse larger sets of data through the app. It will help to inform the practices of the rural providers, and Gautham is hopeful it will be invaluable for local, district and national policymakers too.

“I think it can transform healthcare, the healthcare system, healthcare practices – it can transform our understanding of AMR because there isn't any data coming from the community level. So whatever data we collect it's going to be really, really valuable.”

Meenakshi Gautham leads the One Health Antibiotic Stewardship (OASIS) project. She is an interdisciplinary researcher interested in the dynamics of informal health systems, where both formal and informal health actors collaborate to shape healthcare practices. Focusing on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in community settings, her work uncovers the interactions within these systems, shedding light on health system and policy barriers that impact healthcare delivery and access in resource-constrained contexts.

‘Gutfeld!' panelists discuss reports claiming California Gov. Gavin Newsom secretly funded thousands of dollars for a monument of himself.

The California Department of Finance cleared a $3.44 billion loan to make up for a gap in Medi-Cal spending, which critics say is due to illegal immigrant healthcare costs, whereas the governor's office argues it's not out of the ordinary.

It was revealed a few weeks ago that the state had $6 billion in expected costs for Medi-Cal, but it is now roughly $9.5 billion. This comes after it became state law to allow people to qualify for the program regardless of their immigration status. Medi-Cal is the state's Medicaid system for certain Golden State residents, which takes both federal and state taxpayer dollars, according to a state government website. 

Critics of allowing the program's availability to those who are in the country illegally strongly believe it is cause for concern.

"Gov. Gavin Newsom lied and cooked the books to gift all illegal immigrants free healthcare and now has stuck California taxpayers with a multi-billion dollar bill," Rep. Carl DeMaio, R-San Diego, told Fox News Digital in a statement.

"This is so egregious that he needs to resign," he continued.

DeMaio was the lawmaker who, in a hearing last month, questioned a state budget official who ended up revealing the higher spending figure for MediCal. DeMaio was later removed from the California State Assembly budget committee.

However, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said that California is not the only state facing spending issues with their state-based healthcare programs, such as Pennsylvania, Colorado and Indiana.

"This isn't new — as the administration already outlined in the Governor's January budget proposal, additional funding is needed to support Medi-Cal," Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for the governor told Fox News Digital in a statement.

"Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike. This is not unique to California."

The border state continues to face scrutiny for its policies pertaining to people in the country illegally, whether it is for healthcare eligibility or "sanctuary" policies.

War-torn Sudan's healthcare system is approaching breaking point as three or four patients are sharing single beds, Islamic Relief revealed on Thursday. 

Overwhelmed healthcare workers in eastern Sudan described dire conditions, with patients either turned away or dying on the floor, the aid group said. 

The conflict-stricken country has seen countless displaced families seeking care, and the collapsing medical infrastructure has been unable to accommodate demand, with ongoing violence outstripping limited resources and two thirds of all main hospitals out of service. 

Dr Abdalbasit Alameen Mohamed Adallah, director of al-Gedaref Teaching Hospital, told Islamic Relief that the number of displaced people seeking treatment is increasingly at double or triple the rate that the hospital can find new beds.  

He said: “The health situation is very serious. The existing hospitals take all of the burden [from displacement as a result of the conflict]. 

“After recent displacements, the number of patients has increased many times,” he added. “Two or three patients can be treated in one bed, some treated on the couch, and some we just give them the treatment and let them go if they have a place to stay. People are begging for prescriptions.” 

Adallah went on to say there was a severe lack of medication available, including for vital emergency treatments such as infusions and laboratory testing. 

He continued: “There has been a systematic destruction of all health facilities across Sudan. Most of the medical staff have themselves been displaced and many hospitals destroyed completely, resulting in no medical services. 

“In Gedaref we took the biggest burden since the very start of the war from the displacement of Khartoum and Al Jazirah state, where half of the population was displaced to Gedaref including the elders, children, and people with chronic diseases. It's a huge number.”

Many doctors and medical staff have fled the country, after facing violence, attacks, decimated infrastructure and corruption, Islamic Relief said.

Since the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began fighting, there have been 542 attacks on healthcare facilities between April 2023 and December 2024, according to a report by Insecurity Insight. 

During these attacks, 122 health workers have been killed and 90 arrested, with medical facilities including clinics and hospitals damaged 136 times, and taken over 51 occasions for non-medical purposes, the report said.

Insecurity Insight has attributed almost two thirds of these attacks to the RSF. 

Since April 2023, Sudan has been embroiled in a brutal civil war between the SAF and the RSF militia.

The country has fallen into a humanitarian crisis, with 12.5 million Sudanese displaced from their homes, according to UNHCR.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (TNND)  — California is in need of a $3.44 billion loan to cover a shortfall in "Medi-Cal," which is the state's Medicaid program, according to reports. 



POLITICO said Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration informed lawmakers about the shortfall in a letter sent on Wednesday.

Citing Department of Finance Spokesman H.D. Palmer, the media outlet said the money is the maximum amount the state is allowed to borrow, adding that it "will only be enough to cover bills for Medi-Cal" through the end of March.

Paul Winfree, who is the president and CEO of the Economic Policy Innovation Center, or EPIC, told Fox News Digital the state is "exploiting an existing loophole" in an existing law.  

The news comes a year after the state expanded Medi-Cal to offer free healthcare to residents in need -- as well as undocumented migrants. 

The state previously described the initiative as a public health insurance program that provides "needed health care services for low-income individuals including families with children, seniors, persons with disabilities, foster care, pregnant women, and low income people with specific diseases such as tuberculosis, breast cancer, or HIV/AIDS.  Medi-Cal is financed equally by the state and federal government," according to a statement Newsom's team shared online.

This week, several health IT vendors announced new tools to apply advanced analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to help providers and payers spot potential gaps across care settings by embedding real-time insights into existing workflows.

Innovaccer is offering health plans a new platform integration that targets gap closure and streamlines risk adjustment with a proactive approach, the company announced Wednesday.

Health plans have historically relied on disconnected tools and resource-intensive manual processes that pose compliance risks and increased costs. 

Combining prospective, concurrent and retrospective reviews, payers can use the new platform, called 360-Degree Gap Closure, to leapfrog traditional data silos and close gaps across care provider offices, pharmacies and patients' at-home interventions.

The key to risk adjustment and quality improvement is seamless data exchange with provider EHRs, Innovaccer said. 

With the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services accelerating value-based care adoption, gap closure can improve coding accuracy with automation and enhance member outcomes with advanced analytics.

"We are bringing a much-needed shift in how payers approach risk and quality," Abhinav Shashank, Innovaccer's cofounder and CEO, said in a statement. 

"Instead of piecing together multiple vendors and solutions, health plans can now close gaps efficiently across the entire care journey, whether at a provider's office, in pharmacies or through at-home test kits."

Veradigm announced a gap closure workflow integration for its payer insights platform on Tuesday. 

The company said that more than 3,500 healthcare practices across the United States are now receiving gaps-in-care alerts from several national and regional health plans directly in their EHRs. 

With the alerts, providers can address risk and quality care gaps in their point-of-care workflows, which could enhance clinical decision-making for better patient outcomes. 

"By embedding risk and quality-driven insights into provider workflows, we are fostering a more interconnected healthcare ecosystem that enhances efficiency and improves patient outcomes," Jay Bhattacharyya, Veradigm senior vice president and general manager, said in a statement. 

The alerts could also improve claims acceptance rates. With streamlined access to payer incentive programs, providers can earn on average $100 in incentive payments per patient gap addressed in the platform, creating an additional revenue stream, Veradigm said.

For Medicare Advantage plans, improving risk adjustment accuracy and reducing avoidable hospitalizations by closing gaps could result in substantial savings each year. 

The insights have "made it incredibly easy for us to identify and close care gaps while unlocking significant financial incentives," Sneha Patel, chief operating officer of Metroplex Medical Centers in Texas, said in a statement. 

"The ability to take action directly within our EHR makes the entire process seamless."

MedeAnalytics, a healthcare enterprise data platform and analytics service, has formed a strategic partnership with Holon Solutions, a vendor of workflow integration technology, to develop an integrated patient insights platform that enhances care and reduces overall administrative burdens.

The partners said in their announcement earlier this month that providers will see significant improvements in their operations and patient care quality, including an 80% increase in gap closure rates and a 5% improvement in revenue capture.

Their proprietary artificial intelligence sensor technology powers an overlay located on top of EHRs that provides additional patient data without deviating from clinicians' existing workflows. The integration provides claims and social determinants of health data, which can lead to timely interventions for patients and improved efficiency for care teams, the companies said. 

The overlay also reduces the need for multiple log-ins, and data searches and alerts can be customized for organizational priorities.

"Our partnership with Holon represents a pivotal moment in healthcare data management and analytics," said Steve Grieco, MedeAnalytics' CEO, in a statement.

"This synergy not only leads to better patient outcomes and care quality but also optimizes value and increases revenue for both payers and providers."

"We break down data silos and bring critical information to the forefront of patient care," Jon Zimmerman, Holon Solutions' CEO, added.

The senator said removing financial conflicts of interest would build confidence in Oz's impartiality. His confirmation hearing is Friday.

Oz will appear before the Senate Finance Committee on Friday for his confirmation hearing.

“If confirmed, you will be expected to steward CMS's $1.5 trillion budget in the best interest of the over 140 million Americans on Medicare and Medicaid,” Warren wrote. “Entering this role with financial conflicts of interest would undermine your effectiveness and the effectiveness of the programs you are slated to administer.”

Oz works with or previously worked with numerous companies that the CMS could oversee, including Eko Health and SandboxAQ, which sell medical diagnostic technologies, and could require the CMS' approval for reimbursement requests.

The nominee also founded and still holds up to $5 million of stock in ShareCare, a digital health company that provides in-home supplement benefit programs used by approximately 1.5 million Medicare Advantage enrollees. 

“Your relationships with these and other entities will raise serious doubts about your impartiality if you participate in coverage decisions and other matters that impact them,” said Warren, urging the nominee to both divest his stake and recuse himself from matters concerning previous business interests.

The senator is also concerned about Oz's activity upon leaving Washington, if confirmed.

Warren said previous agency heads, including Biden appointees and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who was just confirmed to lead the HHS, had agreed to a “cooling-off period” for working in industry after leaving office. 

“By agreeing to a cooling off period, you can mitigate concerns about your potential conflicts of interest in this role,” Warren said.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April Health, a leader in integrating behavioral health into primary care, today announces a transformative merger with Wysa, the global leader in AI for mental health. Together, they address one of the most pressing issues in healthcare, ensuring patients receive timely, effective mental health support, by combining human-led care with Wysa's clinically proven therapeutic AI.





The collaboration will provide patients with continuous, personalized care, through a combination of behavioral health specialists, psychiatrists, and Wysa's AI-driven guidance, ensuring that no referral goes unanswered. This groundbreaking combination of AI and human resources in one model of care guarantees that patients receive support between clinician visits and eliminates the wait times that often plague mental health care.



Redefining Behavioral Health in Primary Care



Behavioral health care is often difficult to access, particularly in rural and underserved areas where mental health providers are scarce. Half of the US population lives in a mental health desert, leading to an average wait time of 3-4 months for psychiatric support. 80% of patients turn to their primary care providers (PCPs) for help, but without dedicated behavioral health support, providers face limited options for effective treatment.



Founded to change this reality, April Health embeds virtual behavioral health services into primary care practices to ensure patients receive the care they need. Now, with Wysa's Therapeutic AI Coach integrated into its model, April Health patients can access a hybrid of human and AI-guided care—expanding access without increasing the burden on providers and overcoming insurance barriers.



“Mental healthcare doesn't fit neatly into appointment slots. Patients need support between visits, and providers need solutions that don't add to their workload,” said Jesse Weinberg, CEO at April Health. “By integrating Wysa's AI, every patient referred to us receives ongoing care—whether through a behavioral health specialist, a psychiatrist, or AI-powered guidance tailored to their needs. This combined approach drives better outcomes in less time, helping to bridge America's mental health gap.”



No Referral Unfulfilled



More than 50% of behavioral health referrals in primary care settings are unsuccessful, leaving patients without critical support. April Health is addressing this by taking full responsibility for patient follow-through. Once a provider refers a patient, April Health ensures they receive the right level of care—whether that means direct engagement with a behavioral health care manager, psychiatric medication recommendations, or digital support from Wysa's Therapeutic AI Coach. Every patient, regardless of insurance coverage, will have access to Wysa's AI-powered support, making this a scalable solution for expanding mental health care without financial barriers.



“No one should have to wait for behavioral health care, yet the reality is most patients face long delays, assuming they ever get the support they need,” said Ramakant Vempati, Co-founder and President of Wysa. “By bringing Wysa's AI into April Health's care model, we're creating a seamless system where patients can engage with mental health support immediately, while still receiving expert-led care.”



A Model That Works for Patients and Providers



April Health's integration of AI reinforces Collaborative Care Management (CoCM), a proven model allowing primary care and specialty clinics to be reimbursed for behavioral health services. This approach not only improves patient outcomes but also makes behavioral health financially sustainable for healthcare practices.



By partnering with April Health, Primary care, pediatrics, women's health and more can now integrate behavioral health into their practice without hiring additional staff or disrupting existing workflows. Providers simply refer patients to an introductory call with April Health, where care managers assess needs and initiate a psychiatrist-led collaborative care plan. This ensures patients receive comprehensive behavioral health support within the time constraints of primary care.



The Future of Integrated Behavioral Health



With this integration, April Health and Wysa demonstrate that behavioral health care can be both accessible and scalable—offering human support where it's needed while ensuring every patient has continuous access to clinically validated mental health tools. The first providers to adopt this integrated model are April Health's existing primary care partners within LifePoint Healthcare and The Newton Clinic (affiliated with MercyOne).

For Eckerd College students interested in volunteering, interning or having a career in public health, this was an event not to miss. And they didn't.

More than 100 students gathered around tables inside Fox Hall on a recent Wednesday afternoon to learn about opportunities in the healthcare industry. Titled Careers in Public Health: An Informational Fair, the event was part of larger efforts by Eckerd's public health faculty to prepare students for future educational and career paths in the field of public health. The fair was co-sponsored by Eckerd's public health minor and the College's Pre-Health Club.

Among the presenters were representatives from the St. Petersburg Free Clinic, Feeding Tampa Bay, CAN Community Health, Metro Wellness, the Suncoast Center, the Peace Corps, the Florida Department of Health, Empath and the Master's of Public Health programs at Rollins College and at the University of South Florida.

“I was really pleased with the event,” says Lisa Miller, Ph.D., associate professor of sociology at Eckerd, who organized the fair along with Sarah Lyle, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychology. Miller adds that along with visiting with the various organizations, “a number of students stopped by to learn about Eckerd's public health minor, so they could be able to focus on coursework in that area.

Peace Corps recruiter Claudale Daniels drew a large crowd of students.

“We have a huge need for public and community health workers across the globe, especially in the area of illness prevention,” Miller says. “Public health professionals help stop disease and other poor health outcomes in their tracks before they even begin. The students also got to meet with people who work in the field and learn about internship opportunities, careers and master's programs. The fair went over so well that we're planning for a bigger one next spring.”

Eckerd's public health minor, coordinated by Miller, is designed to provide a pre-professional background for students interested in careers in public health, medicine, healthcare administration, health education, epidemiology and related fields. The minor requires five courses: Foundations of Public Health, a Statistics course and three approved electives.

Also represented at the fair was the student-run Pre-Health Club, which includes fields such as pre-vet, biomedical research, pre-nursing, pre–physician assistant and pre-med. There are approximately 200 student names in the club mailing list, and the aim is to network, guide and support pre-health students at Eckerd. Lisa Bonner, assistant professor of chemistry, and Denise Flaherty, associate professor of biology, are the faculty advisers.

Pre-Health Club Secretary Emma Rodriguez is a senior from Hillsborough, New Jersey, majoring in international relations and global affairs and minoring in Spanish and public health. She also volunteers at Metro Inclusive Health, a nonprofit organization that provides health and wellness services throughout the Tampa Bay area and had a table at the event.

“I think we got a ton of freshmen and sophomores at the fair,” Emma says. “And that's great because Metro and many other organizations are offering positions of employment as well as internships and volunteering. After COVID, I think people were exhausted hearing about public health issues. Now people have room to breathe and time to process the idea of not letting that happen again.”

Emma took a break to visit a crowded Peace Corps table and chat with Claudale Daniels, the Peace Corps' Central Florida recruiter. A member of the Eckerd College Peace Corps Prep program, Emma will travel to the Dominican Republic in August to spend two years teaching healthy living practices to middle school– and high school–aged students.

“I get goosebumps when I meet with the students and hear how interested they are,” Daniels says. “Not a lot of people think about it, but the Peace Corps is one of the most challenging things you'll ever do in your life. But living and teaching in an underserved community, there's nothing more rewarding.”

Deenah McFadden, a senior from Willoughby, Ohio, who is co-president of the Pre-Health Club, plans to take a gap year before she starts medical school. She intends to use that year to work in public health or medical research. “I want to see how much I like the public health field to see if I should pursue a dual-degree program,” she explains, “and talk with people already in the public health field about what they enjoy and what they don't.”

An anthropology and biology student who is minoring in public health, Deenah got a good start at the fair, visiting with representatives of all 10 organizations while also helping out at the Pre-Health table.

“I was surprised at first to see so many people at the fair,” she admits. “I know how much interest there is in the public health minor, but to see them follow through on it was exciting.”

Brian Pieninck started his career in a storage room, as an IT contractor without a college degree, learning his job as he went. It's been years since then, but the CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield president and CEO says the lessons from that time have remained.

Presenting to a packed room of more than 75 students, faculty and staff on March 12 as part of a UMD School of Public Health Dean's Lecture, Pieninck shared his journey from a first-generation college student to leading one of the nation's largest not-for-profit healthcare insurers. The event began with an introduction from UMD President Darryll J. Pines. 

“Brian has been pursuing a vision of advancing opportunities through both health and economic well-being,” Pines said, before handing the floor to Pieninck.

In a wide-ranging discussion, Pieninck shared several tips for audience members:

Pieninck's origin story, in many ways, began with his mother's “insatiable love of learning,” he said. “She knows a lot, she learns a lot, she's on a learning journey but she never went to college.” 

As his parents tracked every dollar, saving to help their sons have the opportunities they didn't, Pieninck learned that “environment and circumstances matter,” he said. At that IT job and other early positions, people believed in and invested in him – and those made the difference. 

“As much as I was willing to work, I could find success on the other side of the equation [but] circumstances have to be right for that to be true.” He now works to help create those circumstances for people who bring the talent but haven't had opportunities, understanding that “there's a myth of meritocracy that those opportunities exist equally … and it's not demonstrably true.”

 

Pieninck said his approach was to look at the big picture of what makes up a person's life – from public transportation to job opportunities to clean water to food security – and to understand how those factors contribute to the individual. Population health often involves public/private partnerships and groups working collaboratively to find solutions, he said.

CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield has been working deeply in West Baltimore, for example, to bring career opportunities in the organization to their neighborhood, so aspects like transportation become lesser factors, Pieninck said. 

“We benefit when our communities thrive,” says Pieninck as he discussed the importance for CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield to connect with communities and to better understand health needs. Last year CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield employees completed nearly 90,000 volunteer hours in the Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia area. “It's not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do.”

 

AI is the tool of the future. Learn to use it wisely.

Pieninck sees potential and pitfalls in AI to solve healthcare problems. For example, AI could give a patient their likely cost for care before the care happens, rather than waiting for a bill of an unknown amount. He recommended people learn about AI for themselves and be part of the conversation about how AI is used. 

“Have an opinion. Have a firsthand perspective,” he said. “How would you want other people to use it on your behalf? … We have to think about the confluence of what people can uniquely do and do well and what technology could potentially enable and determine the right balance between the two.” The technology, he said, will be a key factor on a global scale in the near future.

UN experts say Israel ‘intentionally attacked and destroyed' the Palestinian territory's main fertility centre.

Israel has carried out “genocidal acts” against Palestinians by systematically destroying women's healthcare facilities during its war on Gaza and using sexual violence as a war strategy, United Nations experts have said.

On Thursday, the Geneva-based Independent International Commission of Inquiry said in a new report that Israel “intentionally attacked and destroyed” Gaza's main fertility centre while simultaneously blocking medicine for pregnancies, deliveries and neonatal care from entering the enclave.

In its report, the commission found that Israeli authorities “have destroyed … the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group through the systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive healthcare”, it said in a statement.

It added that this amounted to “two categories of genocidal acts” during Israel's offensive in Gaza, launched after the attacks by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023.

For its part, “Israel categorically rejects the unfounded allegations”, its mission in Geneva said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the UN investigation for “false accusations, including absurd claims”.

“The anti-Israeli circus known as the UN Human Rights Council has long been exposed as an anti-Semitic, corrupt, terror-supporting, and irrelevant body,” Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office on Thursday.

 



 

The report said maternity hospitals and wards had been systematically destroyed in Gaza, along with the Al-Basma IVF Centre, the territory's main in-vitro fertility clinic.

It said Al-Basma was intentionally shelled in December 2023, destroying about 4,000 embryos at a clinic that served 2,000-3,000 patients a month.

The commission found no credible evidence that the building was used for military purposes.

It said the destruction “was a measure intended to prevent births among Palestinians in Gaza, which is a genocidal act”.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, the former UN Humanitarian Affairs Coordinator Martin Griffiths said “it's good that the UN is now talking about genocide, because up to now it's been very careful about that word”.

And while he said that the evidence for genocide was “incontrovertible” and that the findings were “long overdue”, he steered clear of saying that either the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or the International Criminal Court (ICC) would bring those accountable to justice.

“Will it be a legally enforced claim? I don't think so,” he said of the report's findings.

The report came after the commission conducted public hearings in Geneva on Tuesday and Wednesday, hearing from victims and witnesses of sexual violence.

It concluded that Israel had targeted civilian women and girls directly, “acts that constitute the crime against humanity of murder and the war crime of wilful killing”.

The commission added that forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, as well as sexual assault, comprise part of the Israeli forces' “standard operating procedures” towards Palestinians.

FALLS CHURCH, Va. (7News) — On a cold day, there's something so comforting about a large bowl of pho. But at Pho Golden Cow in Falls Church, that comfort is fleeting.

"Very sad. Very sad," described Tim Le, the owner.

He took over the business last year to fulfill a family friend's dying wish.

"He get sick and he ask me buy the place," remembered Le. "I say I will. So you know, I'm here."

Little did he know then, he wouldn't be here for long. Le said he had no idea VHC Health had bought the property.

Northern Virginia will soon be home to a new health care facility, but that move will also displace a group of small businesses that have called the Graham Center in Falls Church home for decades.



From a shoe repair store, dentist office, salon, to a handful of restaurants, all of these businesses are in the process of leaving this plaza along Route 50.

In mid August, Le, along with other tenants, received a letter from VHC Health letting them know their lease would be over by the end of March 2025, to allow for new construction for the new medical facility.

"It's very short notice," said Le.

Grass roots organization, A Viet Place Collective, has been helping them navigate the change.

"A lot of them don't understand that they're entitled to help," said Hoinam Nguyen.



He said these businesses, many minority owned, are being taken advantage of.

"During public board meetings for Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, they mentioned how this is a win win for everybody," said Nguyen. "But I noticed they left out the small businesses. They left out the businesses that got displaced.

He's pushing for a lease extension, rent relief, something to help these businesses stay afloat during this tough transition.

"I think it'll be really devastating for these businesses to close down," said Nguyen.

VHC sent 7News details about their efforts saying: 

"They put up some signs that were very small, like near the road," described Nguyen. "But there needs to be more outreach."

Viet Place Collective told 7News the small businesses "have provided integral community services, products, and food to the multicultural communities of Falls Church and the greater area for decades."

A core organizer for Viet Place Collective, Binh Ly, said in a statement:

“Fairfax County approved this development without consulting the impacted small businesses and without considering how this displacement of the businesses and their workers would affect the community. It's clear that the outreach that's legally required is neither sufficient nor considerate."

Supervisor Dalia Palchik told 7News in a statement:

“We facilitated a meeting between VHC, Viet Place Collective, and several business owners onsite last week. We brought several county agencies, including the Department of Economic Initiatives, One Fairfax, and Neighborhood and Community Services, to provide additional resources and help us learn from the entrepreneurs. I was encouraged by the dialogue and the additional concessions made by VHC to support the business owners, and their conversations are still ongoing. It was a productive meeting, and we thank all of those who attended. We also had helpful takeaways for similar circumstances in the future.”

"It's just important that these businesses get help," said Nguyen.

Many of these businesses can't make profits while also moving.

"I just want to be a business owner, and I love to be a business owner of the Pho Golden Cow," said Le. "It's part of my goal and part of my dream to own the restaurant."

A dream he'll have to fulfill elsewhere in just a few weeks.

A Viet Place Collective tells 7 News after the meeting facilitated by Fairfax County, VHC Health has offered tenants who have paid rent through February:

"We are pleased that VHC has agreed to the requests of the business owners. It will help ease the burden of having to close down their business and/or relocate," the organization said.

As for the new facility, VHC said it "will provide highly in-demand emergency, urgent care and imaging services to the community less than 15 minutes and 4.6 miles from the hospital campus."

  Philips' business strategy and long-standing commitment to developing and delivering innovative, energy-efficient and increasingly lightweight solutions, resulted in improving the lives of 1.96 billion people in 2024, putting the company well on track to achieve its aim to positively impact 2.5 billion lives per year by 2030.  

  In 2024, Philips increased its circular revenue to 24% of sales and achieved 100% EcoDesigned new product introductions (NPIs) for the first time, enabling better care for more people through sustainable innovation.   

  Philips was recognized by Forbes as one of the World's Best Employers for the sixth consecutive year, positively reflecting on the company's fair hiring, retention and promotion practices and creating equal opportunities for all employees.   

  With a long legacy of reporting responsible business efforts since 1999, including an ESG report since 2008, Philips has now increased its scope and depth to align to the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.  

 “We are proud of the progress we made in 2024, executing our focused strategy to improve people's health and well-being, creating sustainable long-term business value for all our stakeholders,” says Marnix van Ginneken, member of Royal Philips' Board of Management. “Our sustainability-led partnerships with customers and suppliers highlight the potential for significant cost savings, improvements in energy efficiency and expanding access to care in and outside the hospital, while the company continues to explore ways to provide consumers with greater choices to live sustainably.” 

   For the first time, 2024 saw Philips achieve 100% EcoDesigned new product introductions (NPIs). Meeting growing customer demand to support their environmental ambitions, Philips EcoDesigned products are designed to increase energy efficiency, avoid the use of hazardous substances, optimize the use of materials and improve packaging across the product life cycle. These measures are driving significant and systemic changes in healthcare, providing safe, efficient and effective methods of care, while often bringing down costs.  Philips is focused on delivering meaningful innovations and teaming up with partners to improve and expand healthcare delivery with lower carbon emissions. In 2024, Philips grew its portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient and, increasingly, compact and lightweight solutions, while scaling the adoption of circular practices to reduce material use and waste in the healthcare value chain.   Philips introduced helium-free operations in MRI, combining compact and lightweight design, for increased flexibility and ease of installation in difficult and remote locations, contributing to wider access to advanced MRI. Its PowerSave+ feature ensures additional energy savings by switching automatically to stand-by mode within 30 minutes of idle time. MRI scanners equipped with Philips' BlueSeal magnet technology have so far saved more than 2.75 million liters of helium since 2018, eliminating the need for helium refills – a scarce resource – even in the event of a shutdown. This ensures long-term reliability and reduced environmental impact.  In the Personal Health segment, the expansion of the Philips Refurb Edition and local takeback systems across select European markets gave toothbrushes and shavers a second life while supporting consumers in making sustainable choices.   CO₂ emissions across Philips' operations, its logistics and its full value chain were significantly reduced, thanks to low-carbon energy alternatives and optimized planning. Driven by the company's supplier sustainability program, 48% of all purchases (by spend) in 2024 came from suppliers with science-based climate targets – up from 46% in 2023. Collaboration with suppliers also resulted in better continuous improvement skills, with a positive knock-on effect on overall quality and cost management.  Philips continues to team up with customers across the world, to enable better health outcomes and address pressing challenges, including cost of care, staff shortages and growing health disparities and reduce their environmental impact at the same time.    A 2024 analysis confirmed that the collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation (Portugal) achieved a 24% emissions reduction per exam in its radiology and nuclear medicine department in the first year of the partnership.  County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust (UK) with support from Philips, identified key areas where sustainability could be enhanced in ICU care, everything from discharging patients sooner to reducing waste in the supply chain, training staff and refurbishing buildings. Critical care was strategically chosen as a focus area as, per patient, it is a high consumer of electricity and single use items and is one of the most expensive types of care. The recommendations will now serve as a blueprint for further change and targeted improvements to further enhance critical care. A cradle-to-grave analysis of hospital-based radiology services, together with the Department of Radiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (US), found the energy consumption from imaging equipment accounted for more than 50% of the greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis also shed light on areas of focus for future evidence-based decarbonization strategies.

On a calm day in one of Minnesota's busiest emergency rooms, Dr. John Hick stands next to a ventilator.

“During COVID, these things were getting an absolute workout because we had a lot of people in the emergency department on them,” Hick said. “We never ran out of such critical devices. I cringe thinking of potential future epidemics where that becomes an issue.”

In March 2020, while working at HCMC in Minneapolis, Hick, an emergency physician and medical director for emergency preparedness, began hearing reports of increasing COVID-19 cases in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in skilled nursing facilities. He realized it was only a matter of time before the virus reached his own hospital.

The emerging risk from exposure to COVID-19 led governors across the country to declare states of emergency. Gov. Tim Walz issued an order on March 13. Days later, he ordered schools, restaurants and bars to close.

At the same time, hospitals began to fill up with severely ill patients, many of whom were struggling to breathe.

When patients began arriving at HCMC, health care providers were ready. Hick said they also felt nervous due to the unpredictability surrounding a potential surge in cases.

“This was a disease that we did not have a lot of experience with. We did not have a vaccine for it or any antivirals at the time,” he said.

Hick led the state's health care response alongside the health department and the Minnesota Hospital Association during the first several months of the pandemic.

There are inherent risks associated with practicing medicine in an emergency department, such as exposure to infectious diseases and injury caused by patients. But Hick said the pandemic intensified everything.

He added that it was difficult at times to transfer critically ill patients to available medical facilities quickly, distressing health care providers, especially in greater Minnesota.

Small hospitals across the state were overwhelmed with patients. To address this issue, health officials formed the statewide Medical Operations Coordination Center, a bridge between private and public health care and state emergency management agencies.

“I see that as a big win, but it was a full-on effort, and I think we can do better in the future with that too,” Hick said.

Even with increased cooperation, the entire statewide health care system in the pandemic's early years came under unprecedented strain. Many patients were intubated, which is a serious and invasive medical procedure involving the insertion of a tube into the trachea through the mouth or nose to maintain an open airway. The staff at HCMC were unsure about when, or if, these patients would be able to breathe independently again.

“We were taking care of patients who were needing to be on ventilators and were challenged with some pretty significant volumes of COVID patients,” Hick said. “I felt like I was just walking from one cube into the next with identical patients.”

The COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on the mental and physical well-being of health care workers. Many reported increased levels of stress, anxiety, fatigue, and grief from constant exposure to patient deaths and the demands of the job.

A 2021 survey conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health explored how health care providers were affected by COVID-19. Many considered leaving their careers due to stressors associated with providing care during the pandemic. The data shows that “respiratory therapists were four times more likely to say they were leaving due to burnout or dissatisfaction in 2021 compared to 2019.” Physician assistants and registered nurses said they were three times as likely to leave their careers within five years for the same reasons.

Although Hick was accustomed to witnessing and treating trauma, this experience was exceptionally difficult. Family members and friends outside of the medical field did not grasp what he was dealing with at work.

Hennepin Healthcare provided peer support and encouraged people to take care of themselves, Hick said.

“I would get home from the Emergency Operations Center, usually after dark,” he said, his voice breaking. “But I would make it a point to go down to the lake and look across Bde Maka Ska, see the lights reflecting and just take a few minutes to know it's going to be okay.”

Hick is not the same person he was before the pandemic and is more aware of his vulnerability and mortality. However, he is not abandoning emergency medicine. Instead, he feels motivated to continue making health care safer for both the providers and the patients he serves.

“There is a lot of things that we became aware of post-pandemic about the fragility of ourselves and of our health care system,” Hick said. “But I think we also learned a lot about our resilience.”

Danielle Drainer recalled the hospital bill she received after her son, Charlie, spent a month in the intensive care unit due to unexplained blood clots. Even with private insurance through her job, the Dover mom said she faced a $200,000 bill.

"Medicaid picked that up," she said. Without it, she added, "we would still be in debt."

Now, Drainer and thousands of Delaware residents may lose that safety net. As Congress scrambles to prevent a partial government shutdown before Friday's deadline, a fight over a proposed $880 billion budget cut to Medicaid could strip coverage from 41,000 Delaware residents, putting critical health care out of reach for some of the state's most vulnerable people.

While this week's short-term funding bill does not impose these reductions, Democrats and advocates warn that it paves the way for them to happen later this year.

A separate Republican-led budget plan, expected to be debated this spring or summer, could bring sweeping changes to Delaware's health care system. While supporters argue the cuts are aimed at reducing unnecessary spending, critics warn they target Medicaid and would come at the cost of essential coverage and services, particularly for the state's most vulnerable residents.

For Drainer, the debate isn't just about budgets or politics; it's about keeping her son healthy. Medical specialists diagnosed Charlie with antiphospholipid syndrome. To treat his recurring blood clots, Charlie, now 11, "will be on blood thinners for the rest of his life," she said. "If it wasn't for Medicaid, we would not be able to afford them at all."

In February, House Republicans passed a budget resolution that includes $880 billion in cuts to programs overseen by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. These programs include Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP, and Medicare. If enacted, these cuts could have devastating consequences for thousands of Delaware families who rely on Medicaid for lifesaving care.

Although House Republicans deny targeting Medicaid, they also said reductions will address "fraud, waste and abuse" in the program. Health care advocates and Democratic lawmakers argue that such steep cuts would be impossible to implement without significantly slashing coverage and services, potentially leaving some of Delaware's most vulnerable residents without access to essential health care.

For Nancy Lemus, another Dover mother, Medicaid is a particularly critical lifeline. Her 19-year-old son, Christopher Garcia, has complex medical needs requiring a tracheostomy tube, ventilator, feeding pump, oxygen and 35 different medications administered every two hours. His formula alone costs $300 a day. All of it is covered through a Medicaid waiver program called the Children's Community Alternative Disability Program.

The program provides Medicaid coverage to severely disabled children who do not qualify for Supplemental Security Income or other Medicaid programs because of their parents' income. The program is designed for children whose disabilities would likely result in death without care, requiring a level of support equivalent to nursing facility care, but at a lower cost in a home setting.

Lemus works multiple jobs to structure her schedule around Christopher's care, filling in when skilled nurses aren't available. She said even if she could physically care for her son at home, the looming cuts would make it impossible to afford the medical equipment that keeps her son alive.

If the cuts to Medicaid were to happen, Lemus said they could keep her son home until they come and remove the rented medical equipment from her house. She would have to put him in a hospital.

"That's our backup plan, right now." Lemus said. She said other families she's talked to are planning to do the same.

While this week's continuing resolution to fund the government doesn't include Medicaid cuts, U.S. Rep. Sarah McBride warns of a separate reconciliation package expected this spring that could slash $880 billion from Medicaid nationwide.

Under House Republicans' proposed budget, the cuts will be made from programs overseen by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which includes Medicaid, CHIP and Medicare.

Medicaid operates through state and federal funding. In Delaware, the federal government provides $1.50 for every dollar Delaware spends on Medicaid, totaling over $2 billion annually, McBride said in an interview Tuesday. This includes those enrolled under Medicaid expansion, which covers low-income adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level, with the federal government covering 90% of the costs.

McBride warned the proposed cuts could result in Delaware's losing an estimated $200 million in federal Medicaid funding, forcing the state to either reallocate funds or reduce coverage. A study by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimates that, if enacted, these cuts could lead to 41,000 Delawareans losing coverage.

The ripple effects would extend far beyond individual families.

Hospitals that serve a high number of low-income patients, known as Disproportionate Share Hospitals, rely on Medicaid funding to cover uncompensated care costs. Reducing Medicaid reimbursement rates could push some hospitals to scale back services or even close.

With roughly 25% of Delaware residents on Medicaid, hospitals and clinics that serve lower-income communities would face severe financial strain.

Additionally, health care job losses could follow. Lemus pointed out that Garcia's Medicaid-funded care supports multiple full-time employees, including nurses and therapists. If coverage were cut, those jobs would also disappear.

While Medicaid cuts could leave thousands without coverage, McBride argued that reducing health care costs requires a comprehensive approach rather than funding cuts.

McBride emphasized the need to increase the number of health care providers in Delaware and nationwide to expand access to care. She also called for stronger protections for the uninsured and underinsured, ensuring that no one is forced to pay out of pocket for life-saving or medically necessary care due to a lack of coverage.

Additionally, she highlighted the need to curb high deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses and copayments, which can leave insured patients struggling with overwhelming medical bills.

On prescription drugs, McBride pointed to recent federal legislation under the Biden administration, which gave Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices for the first time. She said that expanding these cost-cutting measures could further reduce prescription drug prices for Medicaid recipients and the broader public.

According to McBride, Delaware's congressional delegation — Sen. Chris Coons, Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, along with McBride — have vowed to fight against the proposed Medicaid cuts. The congresswoman emphasized that Delaware lawmakers are working to “sound the alarm nationally” about the devastating effects these reductions could have on families, hospitals, and the state's economy.

"This isn't just about numbers," McBride said. "We're focused on protecting Medicaid from cuts by lifting the voices of Delawareans who've seen their lives improved or even saved because of this coverage."

As Congress moves closer to a final decision in the coming months, Delaware families and health care providers remain on edge.

To those who support these cuts, this decision is life or death, said Drainer, the mother whose son suffered unexplained blood clots. Cutting Medicaid won't solve the national debt, but it "could take my child's life,” she said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's Department of Finance on Wednesday notified state lawmakers that California will need a $3.44 billion loan to cover costs associated with the state's Medicaid program known as Medi-Cal.  

The letter did not specify why exactly the program fell short on funds. While experts note there are many factors that go into Medicaid costs, some are pointing to the money the state spends providing health insurance to undocumented people.

The letter comes weeks after Newsom's administration officials told lawmakers they had underestimated the cost. 

During a line of questioning in an Assembly budget hearing last month, Assemblyman Carl DeMaio, R-Riverside, asked about the expense. Newsom's Department of Finance said the state is estimated to spend $9.5 billion to provide Medi-Cal to undocumented people, with $8.4 billion coming from the state's general fund. The number had grown from the $6 billion that was initially projected. 

DeMaio criticized the expense, and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas eventually removed him from the committee weeks later. 

"Unbelievable!  The mismanagement continues.  Now they want a loan? We said it then and we'll say it again: we can't afford the failed leadership of @GavinNewsom and the Democratic supermajority," Assembly Republican Minority Leader James Gallagher posted on X Wednesday night.  

The loan would come from the state's general fund, specifically an account meant for economic uncertainties which California taxpayers provide.  

"This isn't new — as the administration outlined in the Governor's January budget proposal, additional funding is needed to support Medi-Cal," said Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom. "Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike. This is not unique to California."  

Other states grappling with the rising Medicaid costs include Pennsylvania, Colorado and Indiana.  

Newsom's Department of Finance submitted a similar letter last year to the legislature for a $1.75 billion loan. The department at the time said that the loan was specifically necessary primarily because of an issue with timing related to a tax on health insurance plans.

ORLANDO - The No. 17 UCF women's tennis team is looking to maintain its five-match win streak as it faces off against No. 52 Iowa State and No. 40 Kansas this weekend. 

The squad will have the home-court advantage, looking to continue their flawless performance at the USTA National Campus. The Knights (12-1, 4-0)  have gone 8-0 in home matches thus far and are looking to continue this record when they face Iowa State (8-4, 2-2) Friday at 6 p.m. and Kansas (8-6, 2-2) Sunday at noon.

LAST TIME OUT

Last weekend solidified the Black and Gold as a force to be reckoned with in conference play. On Friday, the team faced No. 15 Baylor and started by clinching the doubles point. Olivia Lincer and Hannah Rylatt showcased their prowess against the 15th-ranked tandem in the nation, with Sophia Biolay and Aya El Aouni following shortly after with a win against Baylor's 89th-ranked duo. In singles, Lincer quickly disposed of her opponent, while Jantje Tilbuerger and Olivia Bergler rounded out the final points for the team in dramatic fashion. The Knights were victorious 5-2.

The squad then played No. 40 TCU on Sunday afternoon, where they remained dominant on the court. The team once again found success within doubles and carried that momentum into their singles performance, with wins from Lincer, Biolay and El Aouni on the front three. The Black and Gold would ultimately win the match 4-1 after showcasing their dominance in singles and doubles play.

The Jayhawks boast an 8-6 record so far this season, going 2-2 against Big 12 opponents. No. 40 Kansas is no stranger to UCF, as they recently faced them in the opening round of the Big 12 championships last season.

UCF was able to clinch the win 4-2 at the championships, and the Knights hope to find the same success against Kansas on Sunday afternoon at the USTA NAtional Campus.

The Marin Cilic Foundation awarded scholarships to its seventh generation of young talents this week, supporting a record 48 musicians and athletes. Since launching in 2019, the foundation has now provided 177 scholarships to help promising individuals pursue their passions.

Grants are awarded to grade school and high school-level classical musicians and athletes from individual Olympic-classified sports, with one collegiate-level recipient in each category. The funds help cover costs like equipment, training, competition fees, and travel.

This year's winners include athletes in taekwondo, wrestling, skiing, track & field, sailing, cycling and fencing, as well as musicians playing instruments including saxophone, clarinet and violin. Past recipients have gone on to medal at European and World Championships, represent Croatia at the Olympics and study at top music academies.
The scholarship programme is a key initiative of the Marin Cilic Foundation, which works to provide financial aid and opportunities for young people. Alongside scholarships, the foundation has renovated six school laboratories, sponsored four tennis summer camps and built four multifunctional school sports courts, with a fifth under construction.

At the ceremony, former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings Marin Cilic emphasised the importance of perseverance, self-belief and hard work.
“Watching these young talents bravely follow their dreams and not give up, despite challenges, is immensely inspiring to me,” Cilic said at the award ceremony. “Each year I feel a deeper sense of how important it is to provide them with support and show them that we believe in their dreams. Perseverance, belief in oneself, and tireless work are the keys to success, and I hope that our foundation will continue to accompany them on that journey."
A standout moment this year came when former recipient Zrinka Ljutic, an alpine ski racer, chose to sponsor a new scholarship recipient. A two-time past winner herself, Ljutic's support highlights the growing cycle of past scholars giving back to the next generation.

Boris Becker and Novak Djokovic are two people associated with tennis who have made waves during their career. 

Becker managed to win eight Grand Slam titles and although he never conquered the French Open, he was the youngest male's singles champion at Wimbledon back in 1985. 

Djokovic has arguably already etched his name at the top of the greatest ever discussion. He's on 24 Grand Slam titles and at 37-years-old, he's still on the hunt for more big titles. 

These days, Becker gives his honest opinions on tennis via social media but isn't involved in any coaching capacities after spending some time working alongside Djokovic. 

There will come a time when Djokovic calls time on his career. However, right now, he's still striving to the best and claim that 25th Grand Slam crown. 

Being number one in the world is the pinnacle for any player in sport – especially a single player sport like tennis. 

Winning major titles is ultimately what you'll be judged on but being the number one player in your field is the ultimate testament to consistency. 

However, Becker has told the ATP on YouTube that he never cared too deeply about being the world number one during his days as a player. 

However, he believed that he noticed how much it impacted the players when he was actually coaching Djokovic and claimed things had changed a little bit. 

He said: “I've been player number one but I was coaching Novak Djokovic for a couple of years so I realized similar mental patterns that we all have. I'm good friends with John McEnroe, Ivan [Lendl], and Mats [Wilander], and Stefan [Edberg], we all actually get along now. Back in the day, no chance to be on the same dining table. You've got to be a little bit crazy, a little bit egoistic in a way that your life is tennis and that's it. 

“So to keep that intensity for a long time is difficult, but I think we all have a bit of this crazy mentality of just doing what it takes to win the match. Being part of this number one club, and you know, when you're in your daily errands and you're busy, you don't think about it anymore, but all these other 28 players were heroes of mine, you know, the reason I played, it was because of all these players. 

“To be amongst this very small group of players, think of the thousands of tennis players you have and only 29 made it to you know, the Mount Everest of our sport. It's very special, it's very unique and I checked the list, I think everyone on it is alive so it would be great to get all these number ones one day on the tennis court and just speak tennis, because I mean, we know how it's done.”

Well, in fairness, his chances of getting back there any time soon look pretty slim. 

His recent defeat to Botic van de Zandschulp have set him back and things might get worse from a rankings point of view before they get better. 

Djokovic is currently seventh on the list with 3900 ranking points, with Jannik Sinner way out in front on 11330 at the top of the pile. 

Having been the world number one for a staggering 122 weeks during his career, Djokovic might not be too fussed about being the best in the business these days. 

With the Serbian picking up an injury that saw him withdraw from the Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev in January, the first thing for him to do it get fit again. 

Then, he will hope to take his best form into the summer and in particular Wimbledon which is where he will surely view his best chance of winning the 25th Grand Slam title given his record in England.

Jack Draper made a statement to the rest of the players remaining in the Indian Wells Masters draw.

The British number one reached the quarterfinals at the Masters 1000 event for the first time after dispatching former champion Taylor Fritz 7-5, 6-4.

That was Draper's third top-five win of his career and he has lost just one completed match so far this season.

The 23-year-old needs is on a mission to not claim the title in Indian Wells, but establish himself as one of the world's best.

Draper is gradually climbing the ATP Tour rankings and taking on the world's best on a more consistent basis.

The World number 14 He has claimed victories over the likes of Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's and now Fritz at Indian Wells.

However, he does have a losing record against the Spaniard and he lost his 2024 US Open semi-final to Jannik Sinner in straight sets.

Draper admitted that those two players put him under a different type of pressure than from other players, and he hopes that he is now developing that aspect of his game when he steps on court.

“When I play against someone like Carlos or Jannik. When these players are playing well they put a lot of pressure on you and you feel like you have to do more,” Draper told Tennis Channel.

“You feel that pressure when you are on the court and I think that is tennis. When you play these top players or I hope when people play me now they feel pressure to do more than they think they need to.”

Draper has recorded one victory against both Alcaraz and SInner during his young career.

He defeated the Italian at the Queen's 7-6(6), 7-6(2) back in 2021, but Draper lost to Sinner at the US Open in 2024.

Draper has played Alcaraz four times and his victory also came at Queen's in a 7-6(3) 6-3 victory last summer.

But the Spaniard won their Basel Open contest in 2022, and their 2023 matchup at Indian Wells, when Alcaraz won the first of his two titles on the Californian desert.

The pair last played at the Australian Open in January, and Alcaraz was leading 7-5, 6-1 before Draper retired from the match due to injury.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. – The eighth-ranked Tennessee women's tennis team is slated to travel to No. 70 Arkansas and No.12 Oklahoma. The Lady Vols will face the Razorbacks at 6 p.m. ET on Friday, before playing the Sooners at 2 p.m. ET on Sunday.

Last weekend, the Big Orange split its matches, defeating No. 25 South Carolina, 4-1, before falling at No. 1 Georgia, 4-0. In the victory against the Gamecocks, Elza Tomase earned her 90th career singles victory against No. 19 Sarah Hamner, 6-3, 7-5. Tomase is the 15th player in program history to reach the 90-win mark.

The Lady Vols have shifted their doubles pairings and have found success doing so. The freshman duo of Conley Raidt and Saray Yli-Piipari posted a 6-3 victory against Helena Buchwald and Misa Malin. The win marked their first conference triumph together. The new partnering of Tomase and Maeve Thornton swept the No. 36-ranked duo of Sarah Hamner and Kaitlyn Carnicella, 6-0.

The duo of Leyla Britez Risso and Catherine Aulia have been a steady force thus far. Together, they have tallied a five-match winning streak.

In singles, No. 103 Britez Risso leads the Big Orange with nine victories, posting an eight-match winning streak to start the season. Tomase follows with eight triumphs; her biggest win thus far came against No. 15 Ohio State's No. 8 Luciana Perry, 6-3, 6-4.

Tennessee has knocked off six ranked opponents thus far, defeating No. 15 Texas Tech, No. 15 Pepperdine, No.4 Stanford, No. 67 Kentucky, No. 71 Ole Miss and No. 25 South Carolina.

MILESTONE TRACKER: Head Coach Alison Ojeda is approaching 200 career wins. She currently owns 197 triumphs, with 152 of them coming at Tennessee. Ojeda will join two previous Tennessee head coaches, Mike Patrick and Sonia Hanhn-Patrick, who have hit the 200 mark in their careers.

Junior Catherine Aulia is one win away from hitting 50 career doubles decisions. Aulia has collected 16 victories so far and has been ranked as high as No. 23 with partner Tomase.

Rarely heard voice recordings of trailblazing tennis entrepreneur Gladys Heldman and firsthand accounts from Billie Jean King, Rosie Casals and Nancy Richey are features of a TennisWorthy podcast released this week by the International Tennis Hall of Fame, as part of Women's History Month.

Introduced by ITHF President Patrick McEnroe and compiled by esteemed tennis historian Chris Bowers, the 25-minute oral history brings to life the tumultuous summer of 1970, when nine of the world's best women players joined forces with Heldman to rewrite the future of professional tennis.

Before delving into the archival interviews, Bowers sets the scene.

Original 9: A legacy of independence and empowerment

“For a revolution, or a war of independence to happen it requires two things: the right context and the right people,” he said. “In the great battle for independence in 1970 that gave birth to modern day women's tennis, there were two crucial people.

“One of them was Billie Jean King.”

The other was Heldman, the visionary owner and publisher of World Tennis Magazine. And the context was the ever-widening gap in playing opportunities and pay for women players, who had not benefitted from the instigation of Open tennis in 1968.

Against the broader rumblings of societal change, matters came to a head in August, 1970 when Jack Kramer's prestigious Pacific Southwest Championships announced the women's field would be paid little more than one tenth the men.

An exasperated King, Casals and Richey invited Heldman -- who was a mentor and confidante as well as a savvy businesswoman -- to lunch and told her they wanted to boycott Kramer's tournament.

“Men were still running the tournaments, promoting them, and very few women were involved in all of that,” Casals said. “It was something that was difficult to maneuver because every time we needed to talk to somebody about women, it was a man.”





 Getty Images
                        

Heldman counselled restraint but when her efforts at diplomacy with Kramer failed, she set about organizing her own eight-woman tournament at the Houston Racquet Club. Inevitably, this attracted the ire of administrators at the USLTA and their counterparts in Australia, who threatened to blacklist any player who took part in the unsanctioned event.

Throwing caution to the wind, Heldman was ready to invest her own money in the venture, but she asked her friend Joe Cullman, the tennis-crazy chief of tobacco giant Philip Morris, if she could use his company's Virginia Slims branding for added cachet. He agreed and, even better, provided one third of the prize money purse of $7,500.

The podcast goes behind the fraught scenes of the iconic dollar bill photo taken in Houston on Sept. 23, 1970 and explains the legal purpose behind the $1 dollar pro contracts Heldman signed with her players.

While these contracts did protect the athletes and indeed anyone associated with the tournament from being sued, they did not stop tennis authorities from imposing penalties -- which they did in the form of suspension from official competition, including the Grand Slams.

Nonetheless, the players were ready to take a stand.

“I mean, there was no money, so it was worth taking the chance,” Richey said. “I would rather throw myself in with Gladys Heldman who was a success at everything she ever did, versus the USLTA which was doing nothing.”

And what was King thinking as she held that hugely symbolic dollar bill aloft?

“Oh, my God, we're actually going to try to do this. And that whole week I kept calling [then-husband] Larry and saying, ‘This is nice to have this tournament. But then what?'”

The Virginia Slims Invitational was won by Casals, who defeated Dalton in the final. The event was such a success -- notably in the eyes of Cullman -- that a 21-tournament Virginia Slims Circuit was mounted early in 1971.

It was an incredible feat of organization and logistics, spearheaded by Heldman, but the sport's politics remained fraught and the USLTA even mounted a rival tour.

So on the eve of Wimbledon in 1973, Billie Jean, understanding that dividing the top talent was just bad business, brought 60 players together for another ride-or-die moment at London's Gloucester Hotel.

At that meeting, the players chose unity when they voted to form the WTA. Later that summer, the US Open introduced equal prize money, and King defeated Bobby Riggs in the Battle of the Sexes. Women's tennis was on its way -- with a little help from its ‘friends.'

“If the USLTA had not suspended them, if Jack Kramer had not screamed about women's tennis, if he had not put them down, women's tennis might have died,” Heldman said in 1979, the year she was inducted into the Hall of Fame.

“It lived because it came to a fighting climax and because Billie Jean and the other women, but mainly Billie Jean, was such a marvelous spokeswoman.”

The TennisWorthy podcast is further enlivened by anecdotes from Judy Tegart Dalton and Julie Heldman, Gladys' daughter. The powerful posse that has gone down in the history books as the Original 9 also comprises Peaches Bartkowicz, Kristy Pigeon, Kerry Melville Reid and Valerie Ziegenfuss.

In 2021, they became the first group of players to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

“The enormity of what the Original 9 achieved went well beyond tennis,” Bowers said.

“How much one views it as part of the women's lib movement of the ‘60s and ‘70s is open to question. Not all pioneering women players of the time see it quite so broadly. But there's no question they inspired people in other sports and walks of life.”

This year's induction celebration will be held at the Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island from Aug. 21-23, with Maria Sharapova and Bob and Mike Bryan set to be enshrined.

Highlights of the Fanfest surrounding the main ceremony will include a pro-celebrity tournament comprised of two teams made up of Hall of Famers Andy Roddick, Kim Clijsters, Tracy Austin, Jim Courier and Gigi Fernandez.

Listen to the full Original 9 podcast. And here's information on how to enjoy this summer's festivities.

Morgan Riddle has had it with those who look down on her career and those who accuse her of using boyfriend Taylor Fritz for content, as the tennis WAG has clapped back at some of her detractors. 

Riddle specifically targeted social-media trolls and tennis' 'older wives' who look down at what she does for a living.

The 27-year-old Riddle, who has been dating Fritz since 2020, has fully embraced her life on the road and near the court, turning into a fashion and tennis-forward influencer. 

'Historically, a lot of the older wives and partners on the [tennis] tour have been very private, heads down, in the box,' Riddle said on 'The Squeeze' Podcast.  'They're there to cheer on their partner and they didn't have super public personas.'

Riddle making content around Fritz's career led to 'a clique of older wives' posting her videos and photos in a group chat and making fun of her. 

'I think [the backlash happened] because it's different,' Riddle added. 'People expected me to sit in the box, be relatively private and not capitalize on my partner's career. And I kind of came in guns blazing. I was like, "Well, f*** that" and posted whatever I wanted to.' 

Despite appearing to be ostracized by other tennis WAGs, Riddle maintains her relationship with Fritz is as strong as ever.  

Fritz has been in the public eye longer than Riddle, as he turned pro in 2017. He coached his girlfriend on how to deal with outside attention to their romance. 

'Taylor has always been really good about [blocking out the noise],' Riddle said. 'When it first started happening, I would be like, "Oh my gosh, look at what this person said" and he'd be like, "Why are you reading that?"'

'He went pro when he was 17 so he has dealt with that for so much, much longer than I had,' Riddle added. 'So he was very helpful in coaching me through that.'

Fritz is coming off a career best 2024, where he made his first Grand Slam final at last year's US Open, falling to Jannik Sinner in straight sets. 

Also in attendance was Taylor Swift, with Riddle wanting to know where 'mother' was inside Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City. 

That tournament has put even more eyeballs on Fritz and Riddle. 

'People write crazy things about us and our relationship,' Riddle said. '[But] we really love each other. We have a very healthy relationship [and] nothing that anyone says online is gonna have any sort of effect on that.'

Justin Bieber is getting candid about the self-doubt that he often experiences following rumors about drug use and his mental health.

The 31-year-old pop star took to his Instagram Story on Thursday, March 13, to share a post detailing how he often feels undeserving of the success and praise he has received throughout the years despite being a megastar.

"People told me my whole life 'Wow Justin you deserve that' and I personally have always felt unworthy...Like I was a fraud," he wrote.

The "Lonley" singer admitted to being critical of others and feeling like he is deceiving them, writing, "Like when people told me I deserve something it made me feel sneaky like...Damn if they only knew my thoughts... How judgemental I am, how selfish I really am...They wouldn't be saying this."

The two-time Grammy Award-winning artist said he shared his inner thoughts to let people know they are not alone.

"I say all this to say. If you feel sneaky welcome to the club," he penned. "I definitely feel unequipped and unqualified most days."

The candid post comes following accusations from fans that the singer-songwriter was unwell and using hard drugs because of how he was presenting himself in public in February. However, Bieber's rep spoke to TMZ last month and vehemently denied these rumors.

His rep remarked that these rumors are "exhausting and pitiful" and show "people are committed to keeping negative, salacious, harmful narratives alive" despite the "obvious truth."

The former teen idol's rep told the outlet that he is focused on being a dad and making music, noting that 2024 was "very transformative for him as he ended several close friendships and business relationships that no longer served him."

The "Peaches" singer welcomed his first child, Jack Blues Bieber, with his wife, Hailey Bieber, in August 2024. Justin and the Rhode beauty founder tied the knot in 2018 and have shared small glimpses into their life on social media.

Blake Lively and her legal team have scored a big victory in her ongoing battle against It Ends with Us director/co-star Justin Baldoni.

If you don't know, there have been ongoing lawsuits between the pair revolving around on set behavior.

Keep reading to find out more...

On Thursday (March 13), Judge Lewis Liman granted Blake's request to keep some information private - aka "attorneys eyes only."

Blake and her team did not want sensitive information made public during the discovery phase of the trial because of the public facing nature of this case, where many celebrities and publicists are involved. 

The judge wrote (via Variety), “These cases involve both business competitors and allegations of sexual harm. Discovery will necessarily include confidential and sensitive business and personal information. The risk of disclosure is great.”

Justin's lawyers are okay with keeping sensitive information private, but they did want the ability to share with clients, according to the report.

This was not a complete win for Blake's team, however, as the judge said only the information that is deemed “highly likely” to cause “significant” injury should be kept private.

A spokesperson for Blake shared, “Today, the Court rejected the Wayfarer Parties' objections and entered the protections needed to ensure the free flow of discovery material without any risk of witness intimidation or harm to any individual's security. With this order in place, Ms. Lively will move forward in the discovery process to obtain even more of the evidence that will prove her claims in Court.”

Anya Taylor-Joy is spending the day on set of her upcoming Apple TV+ limited series!

The 28-year-old Golden Globe winner was nearly unrecognizable with red hair as she filmed scenes for Lucky at a strip mall on Wednesday (March 12) in Los Angeles.

While filming, Anya was seen chatting on the phone before hopping into the passenger seat of a cleaning service van.

Based on Marissa Stapley‘s novel of the same name, Lucky “centers on a young woman (Taylor-Joy) who left behind the life of crime she was raised in years ago, but must now embrace her darker, criminal side one final time in a desperate attempt to escape her past.”

Drew Starkey and Timothy Olyphant will also be starring in the series.

Apple TV+ recently shared the first look photos of the show!

Matty Healy just got a tattoo of his fiancée's name — but some Taylor Swift fans think it has a connection to the pop icon.

Healy and Swift famously had a brief fling from May 2023 to early June 2023, following her split from longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn that April. While the pop icon, 35, has been dating Travis Kelce since late summer 2023, the 1975 frontman has also moved on, getting engaged to Gabbriette Bechtel in June 2024.

Now, the "Chocolate" singer, 35, has permanently expressed his love for Bechtel, 27, with a tattoo of her nickname in all-capped, typewriter font on his knuckles.

It is the typewriter font that is causing a stir among Swift fans, as the 14-time Grammy winner used explicit typewriter imagery in the titular track from her 2024 album, The Tortured Poets Department. The song — as well as many of the tunes on the record — are heavily theorized to be about Healy.

In fact, some Swifties quoted "The Tortured Poets Department" directly in the comments of the TikTok video Healy's tattoo artist posted.

"Who uses typewriters anyway?!" one fan wrote.

"You left your typewriter at my apartment," another quoted, referring to the opening line of the titular track.

"Not the typewriter font 😅," a third person commented.

"typewriter font is diabolical," another user shared.

Some imagined Swift's reaction.

"I just KNOW Taylor is climbing up the walls rn," wrote a fan.

"My girl Tay is throwing furniture across her pj," said another.

Others put themselves in Bechtel's shoes. "If I was Gabi I'd be crashing out over the typewriter font," commented someone else.

The Bachelorette producers were allegedly deciding on the next lead before the show's break, according to former Bachelor star Nick Viall.

“I know one of the people they were seriously looking at [and] it would have been awesome,” Viall, 44, claimed on the Thursday, March 13, episode of his “The Viall Files” podcast. “We're not going to tell you … but it would have been awesome. It would have been amazing.”

According to Viall, the potential lead was “from an older season” of The Bachelor.

“When I found out, I was really disappointed they decided not to move forward with it,” he said.



As Grant Ellis' season of The Bachelor winds down, news broke in February that a new season of The Bachelorette will not air this year. A reason for the hiatus, as well as a return date, has not been confirmed.

Even if The Bachelorette would continue later in 2025, a leading lady has not been formally revealed. That hasn't stopped the rumor mill from speculating about a potential decision.

“I was shocked because I heard they picked the lead,” former Bachelorette Rachel Recchia alleged on the “Almost Famous” podcast in February. “I heard the lead was decided and it made sense to me who they picked. Again, rumors. I saw this on Instagram. Normally, I feel like we hear stuff on the inside. I didn't hear anything [about the pause].”

According to the 29-year-old Bachelor Nation alum, the show picked a lead “two months ago.”

“They knew who it was going to be. … I heard a name,” Recchia added. “I heard from someone who usually knows, normally it's a good source, but I don't know.”

Speculation has also swirled that Maria Georgas, a fan-favorite from Joey Graziadei's season 28, had been tapped to take over the mantle. Viall, meanwhile, denied on Thursday that the woman in consideration was Georgas, 30.

Georgas previously claimed that she turned down the role of Bachelorette before Jenn Tran headlined the latest season.

“I was offered the role. It was mine until I said it wasn't,” Georgas claimed on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in May 2024. “It became very overwhelming to the point where I had to decline. It was set in stone. I was in it. When everyone around me was so supportive of me being in this position and everyone wanted this for me, I took a second. I'm like, ‘Why am I not happy? Why am I not excited about this?'”

She has not publicly addressed the speculation about joining the franchise again.

Kaitlyn Cleveland, the estranged wife of Baltimore Ravens lineman Ben Cleveland, has made another adjustment to her social media after cheating allegations ended their marriage. 

After making her Instagram profile private earlier this month, Kaitlyn has now changed her avatar to a picture of her sipping a cocktail with a sly smile on her face. 

The switch comes days after Kaitlyn cryptically posted lyrics to Kelsea Ballerini's divorce song “Interlude (Full Length)” via her Instagram Story. 

“‘Cause people that I loved are just people that I knew once,” the lyrics read, in a post captured by TMZ. “The rumors goin' 'round, but the truth is kinda nuanced / I wanna set it straight, but my lawyers said I shouldn't.”



Ballerini, 31, wrote the song about her own 2022 divorce from ex-husband Morgan Evans. 

Ben filed divorce documents in Baldwin County, Georgia, on February 28, citing “adultery” as the reason for the dissolution of the marriage. He and Kaitlyn got married in July 2022 after meeting during their time together at the University of Georgia. 

The filing does not specify which member of the couple was allegedly unfaithful. 

In the documents, Ben listed the date of separation as on or around December 29, 2024. Ben and Kaitlyn last appeared on social media together on December 26, 2024, when Kaitlyn shared a carousel of photos via Instagram from the Ravens' Christmas Day game against the Houston Texans, including pictures of Ben and Kaitlyn posing on the sidelines together. 

Ben's filing came just 16 days after he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in Milledgeville, Georgia. He was pulled over on February 12 after being observed weaving between lanes and swerving on the road, per an arrest report shared by the NFL.

According to the report, Ben registered a .178 blood alcohol content — more than double the legal limit. He was charged with DUI and failure to maintain lane before being released on bond. 

Ben and Kaitlyn got engaged in Las Vegas in February 2020 when he proposed in front of the fountains at the Bellagio Hotel & Casino.

“If I'm being honest, your first and my last name will just sound better together and probably always will,” Ben wrote at the time in a since-deleted Instagram post. “Nobody I'd rather spend my forever with and now we get to try that out.”

In another since-deleted Instagram post from June 2020, Ben shared photos from a beach day with Kaitlyn and expressed how the couple was fine taking things slow. 

“Two years and then some until you're actually my wife,” he wrote alongside photos of the couple from a beach day. “Not sure, we haven't really started wedding planning yet and we've been engaged 6 months so that's on her. But she's gonna be my wife so that's kinda cool.”

Love Is Blind star Ben Mezzenga is sharing his side of his breakup drama with ex-fiancée Sara Carton — with “receipts.”

“Sara had just told me a few days before [we had dinner] that she was gonna be in Nashville for the whole summer,” Ben, 28, said in a Wednesday, March 12, TikTok video. “I was pretty much figuring out if I wanted to do long distance with the fragile state our relationship was in after filming.”

Sara, 29, and Ben got engaged sight unseen during Love Is Blind season 8, which was filmed in Minneapolis in spring 2024 and aired on Netflix last month. Sara ultimately called off the engagement at the altar, citing fundamental political and religious differences.

After accepting Sara's decision, Ben asked whether she wanted to continue dating. The nurse merely said, “We'll see,” later claiming at the tell-all reunion that they did briefly date. According to Sara, Ben made plans to join her in Nashville for the remainder of her travel nursing contract before allegedly backing out at the last minute.



In his candid TikTok video, Ben addressed Sara “ripping into” his alleged behavior during the Sunday, March 9, reunion and denied her claims.

“I had thought coming into the reunion that Sara and I were on good terms. The reason I thought that was because we had very little to no contact for the entire time she was in Nashville,” Ben said on Wednesday. “She did text me in October for my birthday and then she moved back in December. We'd run into each other a few times at bars with just pleasant conversations. I wasn't prepared for her to address this situation at the reunion.”

According to Ben, he “thought [they] were broken up” at a time when Sara believed they were still dating.

“The issue is the fact that I reached out to [Sara and she] ghosted me,” he claimed. “I reached out the Saturday that she moved to Nashville when I took her off ‘Find My Friends' [and] apologizing for doing that, as well as the next day because I knew she was still upset.”

To further illustrate his point — Ben captioned his upload “Inside info, timeline and receipts from the final episode, reunion and everything over the last year” — the developer shared screenshots of the former couple's alleged text messages.

“‘Made me sad, but it's OK. I feel really good now being back. I'm just telling you, so you know where I'm at,'” Ben read aloud. “In this case, she still thinks we're together, but the responses don't seem like we're together. Then it goes on [and I say], ‘I'm sorry, I know I should've handled that better.'”

After Ben's text pointed out that he was “trying to figure out” how to heal his broken heart, Ben revealed how Sara allegedly responded.

“And it goes on, ‘As a team effort to keep out respect for one another and continue to be on good terms,'” Ben read her alleged message. “Do you say to ‘be on good terms' if you're still dating someone? I don't think so.”

Ben then sent two more follow-up apologies to Sara in April 2024 and May 2024, respectively.

“She thumbed up [my message], which I guess was enough of a reply for her and I felt bad and I was thinking about it the whole day, so I texted her another apology,” he said. “This was the text that she had ‘no weight to the words.”

Ben's April 7, 2024, message said, “I want to apologize for just removing location stuff out of the blue, and not calling you on your drive to Nash. I do care about you a lot and I guess I am just wanting to protect my heart. I cried a lot yesterday morning and today, and I know there are things I should've done better yesterday. I am just trying to do my best with respecting you and stay on good terms and still care for my own feelings.”

Sara apparently didn't respond, but Ben wrote back on May 28, 2024.

“Hey Sara, you have been on my mind and since we kinda stopped talking in a weird situation, I wanted to see if you had time for a FaceTime this week,” he wrote. “It would be good to see how you are doing.”

According to Ben, he was “so confused” that Sara thought during this entire period that they were still a couple.

Sara, meanwhile, addressed the Nashville of it all during her Thursday, March 13, appearance on the “Viall Files” podcast.

“I was just hopeful that we would progress just us two,” Sara explained. “We did decide a week after the weekend that he was going to come with me to Nashville. … The day that I left for Nashville, I just felt kind of dropped. I was confused because we had such detailed agreements, but ultimately, when he removed me from ‘Find My Friends,' that's when I had the most clarity of, ‘OK, this is actually who Ben is and what the situation is.' Like I felt pretty duped.”

Love Is Blind is currently streaming on Netflix.

Kim Kardashian recently unveiled which of her children will eventually receive her 15-carat diamond engagement ring from ex-husband Kanye West. 

The SKIMS founder, who shares North, 11, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, Psalm, 5, with the rapper, opened up about the wedding band in the latest episode of The Kardashians on Thursday (March 13), per People. Speaking to her sister Khloé, she revealed: 

Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris in 2016 and lost a handful of cherished personal items including a second (and much larger) engagement ring gifted to her by Ye. She did not bring the 15-carat engagement ring that he first used to propose when she was pregnant with North in 2013. 

"And so that one I'm going to give to Northie because she was with me when I got engaged. And she held it after and I took a photo. She was just a few months old.” 

The Kardashians star divorced West in 2022 after six years of marriage.

Although Aamir has officially become a senior citizen at the age of 60, he says, 'I don't feel like a senior citizen.' He further said that he has been learning Indian classical music for the last two years. His guru is Sucheta Bhattacharya, under whose guidance he likes singing a lot.

Aamir talked to the media on his birthday and said that 60 years ago, he was born a day before Holi, and this time his birthday is falling on the day of Holi. The actor donned a black t-shirt and denim. 'I look thin in black clothes, so these days I mostly wear black,' he added. During the press meet, Aamir also sang a song from his 90s film 'Akele Hum Akele Tum' for the media.  

For the unversed, Aamir's upcoming film Sitare Zameen Par will be released this Christmas. He is also a part of Sunny Deol's Lahore 1947.

Actor Aamir Khan celebrates a major milestone in his life tomorrow, turning 60. Ahead of the big day, he hosted a meet and greet with the media at Taj Lands End in Mumbai and took on questions from the media.

Aamir was asked about his last night's meet up with his friends and contemporaries Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. The media asked him what they talked about. Aamir joked that this time, they gossiped about the media.

A journalist asked him if the actors discussed how they are all turning 60 this year. Aamir said, “No actually we didn't talk about our birthdays at all (giggling). I think we forgot. Yahan wahan ki baatein kar rahe the. Gossiping about you all,” he said.

On a more serious note, Aamir said that the friends met after a long time and had a great afternoon together.

Aamir is looking forward to the release of his next movie, Sitare Zameen Par. The film is a sequel to his 2007 movie "Taare Zameen Par”, that marked his directorial debut and received critical acclaim.

The film will, however, have a fresh story and characters. It is expected to release this year.

Also, a film festival dedicated to his career and movies will launch soon.

Films to be screened under the "Aamir Khan: Cinema Ka Jadugar" are "Dangal", "3 Idiots", "Lagaan", "Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke", "Raja Hindustani", "Ghajini", "Akele Hum Akele Tum", "Andaz Apna Apna", "PK", "Dhoom 3", "Rang De Basanti", "Ghulam", "Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak", "Secret Superstar", "Laal Singh Chadha", "Taare Zameen Par", "Sarfarosh", "Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar", Talaash", "Fanaa", "Dil Chahta Hai" and "Dil".

The festival which aims to honour Aamir's contribution to Indian cinema, will commence on the actor's 60th birthday, March 14 and will run till March 27 across PVR INOX theatres in the country.

Amitabh Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt's film Brahmastra: Part One - Shiva collected Rs 257.44 crore at the box office in 2022. At the end of the film, its sequel Brahmastra: Part Two - Dev was announced, but after that, there was no special update. At Alia Bhatt's pre-birthday party, Ranbir made a big revelation about Brahmastra 2 while talking to the media.


Ranbir gave an update on Brahmastra 2

Ranbir said, 'Brahmastra 2 has been a long-time dream of director Ayan Mukherjee. The whole story is ready in his mind. Right now he is busy with War 2. As soon as this film is released, he will start preparing for Brahmastra 2.'

He further said, 'This film will definitely be made. We have not said much about this film yet, but soon interesting announcements will be made about it.'

Ranbir opens up about SLB's Love and War

Ranbir also talked about his upcoming film, Love and War. This will be his second film with Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Their first film together was Saawariya, which was released 17 years ago. Sharing the experience of working with Bhansali, Ranbir said, 'Working with him is special. I have not seen such a hardworking person. He understands the character, emotions, music and Indian culture very well. Working on his set is tiring and long, but as an artist, it gives satisfaction. He improves the art.'

Ranbir will be seen in these films

Vicky Kaushal will also be in the lead role along with Ranbir in Love and War along with Alia Bhatt. This film will be released in March 2026. Apart from this, Ranbir also has big projects like Ramayana and Animal Park. At the same time, Alia Bhatt will soon be seen in Alpha, which will be released on Christmas this year.

As a father of five, Don Johnson is always looking for ways to guide his children. 

During an appearance on "Good Morning America" this week, the 75-year-old veteran actor, who is promoting his new Hulu show "Doctor Odyssey," opened up about his thoughts on some of his kids following in his footsteps. 

"I warned them against it. I said, ‘This is not for you,'" Johnson said, before telling the hosts of the Johnson family rule.

"When Dakota [Johnson] was graduating from high school … we have a rule in the family," he continued. "The rule is that if you don't go on to college and get a job, you're off the family payroll.

"Out of high school, I went to Dakota and said, ‘Do you want to go visit some colleges?' And she said, ‘I'm not going to college.' I said, ‘Oh, that's interesting. How are you going to look after yourself?' She said, ‘Don't you worry about it. I'm going to be an actress.'

"Three months later, she had that part in ‘The Social Network' and hasn't looked back," he added.

‘MIAMI VICE'S' DON JOHNSON'S SECRET TO A YOUTHFUL 74 IS BEING HAPPILY MARRIED: ‘A BAD MARRIAGE WILL AGE YOU'

The distinguished actor who found mega success as James "Sonny" Crockett in the 1980s TV series "Miami Vice," has been married to wife Kelley Phleger since 1999. The couple share three children: Atherton Grace, Jasper and Deacon. He is also father to son Jesse Wayne Johnson from his relationship with Patti D'Arbanville and Dakota Johnson from his marriage to Melanie Griffith.

Before finding fame, the Golden Globe Award winner once recalled being down on his luck at the beginning of his career. 

Johnson told The Wall Street Journal in 2024 he "spent years living below the poverty line" and admitted he went for years getting "cast in a lot of forgettable roles, including five unsuccessful TV pilots," before landing his role in "Miami Vice."

"I couldn't believe somebody had seemingly been jotting down my thoughts, feelings and emotions. The part was meant for me," he recalled. "The audition went well, so well that I was convinced it was a sure thing."

Johnson went on to star in the popular show for five seasons and received an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Det. James Crockett.

That same year, Johnson reflected on the ups and downs of fame during his career-making success on "Miami Vice."

"For a long time, I couldn't even go anywhere," he told People magazine. "I had to isolate. The [women] know where you are. We had security 24/7.

"One day, I reflected on Elvis [Presley] and thought, ‘Isn't this kind of the way Elvis lived and died?' Not that I'm comparing myself to Elvis, but in terms of him not being able to have a personal life. So, I learned to manage it and vowed not to let it imprison me," Johnson said. 

On a personal level, however, Johnson said he has found the key to a successful marriage. 

"Marry right," he told People. "A bad marriage will age you."

In 2023, he revealed the relationship advice he once received from Bob Dylan. 

"Obviously, [Kelley]'s a saint. I was with Bob Dylan one time, and I was having relationship issues. And Bob looks up at me and goes, ‘Well, see, love is about kindness, trust and respect, isn't it?' And that's the embodiment of Kelley," Johnson told Parade about what makes Phleger perfect for him. 

"It's kindness, trust and respect, and we have that with each other. We're lovers and friends, and it's fun. She's an amazing woman."

Along the way, Johnson has found the good in Hollywood in that he's cultivated a lot of strong relationships throughout the years, including his friendship with Bruce Willis. 

During his appearance on "Good Morning America" this week, Johnson recalled the moment he first met Willis while the "Die Hard" star was tending bar in New York City. 

"I'd go in there and sit with Bruce. ... Bruce was such a good storyteller, and he'd tell me about all the trials and tribulations of dealing with the drunks and the actors. ... And, you know, I got to be friendly with him," Johnson recalled. "I said, 'You know what? You'd be awesome.'

"So, I called the casting director … and I said, ‘This guy is interesting. He's special. Bring him in and read him.' She did and cast him in ‘Miami Vice' before he was ever in anything else."

Johnson said he knew from the beginning Willis was special, saying, "I could just tell."

During an interview with Entertainment Tonight in February, Johnson briefly touched on Willis' health. 

"We're best of friends, and he's having a little bit of a struggle right now," he said of Willis, who was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2022. "I take this moment to send him love."

Kim Kardashian alleged ex-husband Kris Humphries forced her to give up the 18-carat engagement ring that she paid for as part of their 2013 divorce settlement.

Kim Kardashian is not keeping up with her engagement ring from ex Kris Humphries anymore.

The reality star got candid on her short-lived marriage to the former NBA player, alleging that she "had to" surrender her 18-carat emerald-cut diamond ring as part of their 2013 divorce settlement.

"I didn't keep that," Kim shared during the March 13 episode of The Kardashians, explaining how she was still legally married to Kris—whom she split from in October 2011 after 72 days of marriage—when she became pregnant with her and Kanye West's oldest daughter North West. "In order to divorce him, he said I had to give him the ring."

The 44-year-old went on to allege that she paid for the ring, while Kris "contributed a fifth" of its cost during their relationship.

Although Lorraine Schwartz—who designed the ring—told Kim that she had made the "best" decision at the time, the SKIMS founder admitted she still had some lingering ire over the ordeal. As she noted, "I would've loved a collection."

So, where's the ring now? Kris ended up auctioning it off for $749,000 after settling his divorce with Kim.

"The ring is indeed Kris' property that he received through his marriage dissolution," his rep told E! News in 2013, adding in a separate statement that the Boston Celtics alum was "very pleased with the final result" of the auction.

Still, Kim has accumulated several significant jewelry pieces over the years. Her 14-carat cushion-cut engagement ring from first husband Damon Thomas actually belonged to mom Kris Jenner, while she kept a 15-carat ring from Kanye in the couple's 2022 divorce settlement.

"My first one that I got engaged with Kanye was a cushion-cut," Kim said, noting that the ring was the "only piece of jewelry" she didn't have with her when she was robbed at a Paris hotel in 2016. 

While her second engagement ring from Kanye—which featured a 20-carat emerald-cut diamond—was stolen during the harrowing robbery, Kim said the "original ring that I got proposed to" was the "most important" piece.

She added, "That one I'm gonna give to Northie because she was with me when I got engaged."

New episodes of The Kardashians air every Thursday on Hulu.

According to MGK, the unique piece can actually "come apart to make two rings," with the bands made of "thorns" so that "if she tries to take it off, it hurts."

He and Megan broke up in late 2024, shortly after the actress announced her pregnancy.

In May 2021, Courtney, who uses they/them pronouns, flashed their massive diamond engagement ring from Chris Sheng on Instagram, writing, "I said yes ...OH and the ring made me gag it's so beautiful #engaged #stopasianhate #diamondsareagirlsbestfriend." The couple split in 2023.

Give your heart a break — Demi Lovato is doing just fine.

The “Cool for the Summer” singer traded the recording studio for the kitchen to give fans a cooking tutorial on TikTok, but not everyone seemed to focus on the demonstration.

“Today we are making a whole roasted chicken,” Lovato said in the video shared on the social media platform March 11. “It seems really overwhelming, but it's not. We're gonna have fun … and I'm telling myself this because I feel overwhelmed.”

While the pop star kept things playful as she prepared her ingredients and seasoned the raw meat, some fans expressed concern that she appeared to have an unsteady hand at times, including one user who commented, “I'm afraid of seeing her shaking that hard.”

But Lovato, 32, quickly put the speculation to rest by reassuring viewers that all was well, writing back in response, “I'm okay! I promise.”

The "Sonny With a Chance" alum has been open in the past about her mental health and battle with addiction dating back to her teenage years. In fact, she recently shared that she has little recollection of her life after the release of the 2008 Disney Channel movie "Camp Rock," in which she costarred alongside the Jonas Brothers.

“I think I'd passed the threshold of what I could withstand emotionally and physically," she told The Hollywood Reporter in August. “I didn't realize that child stardom could be traumatic — and it isn't traumatic for everyone, but for me, it was.”

Lovato went on to describe her “worry” over how she treated those around her amid her struggles.

“It's easy to excuse that behavior because I was so young and in so much pain,” she continued, “but I'm really remorseful, and that's a guilt that stays with you forever.”

Fortunately, the singer appears to have found happiness with fiancé Jordan “Jutes” Lutes, to whom she got engaged in 2023 after over a year of dating. While the couple haven't publicly shared their wedding plans, they recently commemorated their engagement anniversary ahead of their walk down the aisle.

“1 year of being engaged to my favorite person,” Jutes wrote in a post on Instagram Stories in December, which Lovato reposted, adding, “I love you infinitely and cannot wait to call you my husband!!! Happy 1 year of being engaged baby!!”
