The CEO of crypto exchange Binance said he expects U.S. President Trump's ""pro-crypto"" legislation in the U.S. to spur regulators in other parts of the world to follow suit. ""We have moved from a period where there's big regulatory uncertainty and in many sense, some regulatory hostility towards the industry, to one where the largest economy of the world said 'we want to embrace crypto,'"" Binance CEO Richard Teng told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore on Thursday. Under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, regulators cracked down on the industry in an effort to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering. ""[If] you ask anybody in the crypto industry, people prefer the current administration compared to the last one,"" Teng said.

Chao Deng, CEO of crypto fund manager HashKey Capital, who spoke alongside Teng at the CONVERGE event, shared that view, saying that under Trump, ""the momentum is building, institutional [and] retail adoption [of crypto assets] is immense.""

Crypto reserve

The comments came after Trump pressed ahead with an executive order to establish a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies for the U.S. using digital assets seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that in addition to Bitcoin, the strategic reserve would include ether, XRP, Solana's SOL token, and Cardano's ADA coin. The Binance CEO described the U.S. crypto reserve as a ""landmark"" issue. ""The messaging is the largest government … the biggest capital market in the world is now holding Bitcoin as part of the reserve, [that'll] cause many other governments to think through the issue, to sit up to say, should we start doing allocation into crypto and bitcoin?"" Bitcoin prices have fallen since Trump's announcement of a strategic crypto reserve as details of the plan fell short of expectations. Investor enthusiasm toward assets perceived to be risky has also softened more broadly due to concerns over the impact of Trump's tariff plans. Teng downplayed the recent pullback in crypto markets as a ""tactical retreat,"" as — like any other asset class — it is not ""immune"" to macroeconomic situations. Nonetheless, Washington's embrace of the digital assets and Trump's nomination of several crypto-friendly legislators will provide ""strong"" long-term drivers, he said. Since his victory in November, Trump has focused on appointing government leaders who support the cryptocurrency sector. Venture capitalist David Sacks was tapped by Trump to be the White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar.

The stake could have been acquired through Trump-family backed crypto project World Liberty Financial, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Steve Witkoff, a friend of the U.S. president, was involved in the deal talks, the report added. Witkoff and his family founded World Liberty Financial two months before Trump was elected President in November.

The talks started last year after Binance reached out to Trump's allies offering to reach a deal with the family so as to bring the crypto exchange back to the U.S.

BNB, the native cryptocurrency of the Binance linked BNB Chain, jumped as much as 5% on the news, surpassing $600 for the first time in a week.

A representative for Binance.US declined to comment on the report. However, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said in a post on X that the Journal ""got the facts wrong.""

""I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone,"" CZ wrote. The WSJ didn't report that CZ was involved in the talks, but rather that Binance executives were pursuing it.

The WSJ had also reported that CZ asked President Trump for a pardon. CZ denied he made a deal but did not explicitly say he hadn't asked for a pardon.

""No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge. Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ""war on crypto"" from the last administration are still at work. I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world. It’s good to see that even WSJ thinks I should be pardoned,"" he continued.

The exchange just recently saw its U.S. dollar fiat services restored after it lost the ability to deposit and withdraw USD under the Biden Administration.

Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler had previously branded Binance.US ""a cauldron of fraud"" and tried everything in his power to crack down on the exchange. As a result, the company lost thousands of customers and was forced to lay off 70% of its staff after losing billions of dollars.

Binance also took its institutional investment on Wednesday as Abu-Dhabi based investment firm MGX put $2 billion in the exchange.

Binance's BNB token bucked the wider crypto downturn on Thursday, jumping 4% following a Wall Street Journal report that the Trump family has held talks to secure a financial interest in the U.S. arm of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Such a deal would notably link the Trumps to a firm that pleaded guilty to breaking anti-money laundering laws in 2023.

According to the Journal, Binance first approached Trump allies last year, pitching a deal that could help the embattled exchange regain its footing in the U.S. At the same time, its founder, Changpeng Zhao — better known as CZ — has been angling for a presidential pardon after serving four months in prison for violating anti-money laundering laws.

However, in a post on X, Zhao denied any discussions about a deal for Binance.US or seeking a pardon.

""Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong,"" he wrote. ""I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with… well, anyone.""

If the Trump family is seeking to invest in Binance.US, it’s news to management.

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that members of the First Family were in such talks with Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of Binance international, the world’s largest crypto exchange. The story came as a surprise to Binance.US’ interim CEO Norman Reed and the rest of the executive team in Miami, according to a person close to the situation.

“Management has no connectivity to CZ,” said the source. “They have no idea what he is doing.”

It is an open secret that CZ, who pleaded guilty to money laundering and sanctions violations in November 2023, has been campaigning for a presidential pardon. The Journal article suggested that the deal talks are part of pardon negotiations between CZ and Trump

CZ, for his part, flatly denied the report. “Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone,” he tweeted Thursday morning U.S. time.

But according to the source close to Binance.US, CZ is trying to sell at least a portion of his majority stake in the U.S. franchise. His exact ownership is unknown, but he reportedly owns 90% of the international exchange.

This large stake, in addition to his ownership of over 94 million BNB tokens, has made him the richest person in crypto, according to Forbes, which pegs his wealth at $61.4 billion. He stepped back from the business in November 2023 as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in which he made the guilty plea. His company also paid a $4.3 billion fine to the government.

As part of the settlement, CZ personally paid a $50 million fine and was sentenced to four months in federal prison. He was released in September 2024. The settlement with federal authorities also required that CZ give his voting power on Binance.US’ board of directors to a proxy, further distancing him from the firm.

Representatives for the White House and Binance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

https://techmeme.com,Trump Family Has Reportedly Explored Cashing in on Controversial Crypto Exchange,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-family-world-liberty-financial-talked-binance-1235295686/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:03:04 GMT","Corny NFTs and scammy meme coins apparently aren’t enough to scratch the Trump family’s crypto itch.

According to a Thursday report from The Wall Street Journal, World Liberty Financial (WLF), the Trump family’s fledgling crypto venture, has explored taking a financial stake in the disgraced cryptocurrency exchange Binance. If it wasn’t shady enough, the discussions are reportedly taking place as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has been courting the Trump administration for a presidential pardon.

The Trump family has been cashing in at every opportunity since the president’s election win in November. Where his first term was riddled with notable transactions to his hotels and resorts, this time around the Trump’s are practically flaunting every new business venture that leverages their White House connections.

In 2023, Binance and Zhao pleaded guilty to financial crimes including money laundering, sanctions violations, and unlicensed operations. Zhao served a four-month sentence and stepped down as CEO of the company, which was slapped with restrictions around conducting business within the United States.

WLF’s discussions about a potential deal with Binance reportedly began last year, when the exchange began exploring ways to revamp its presence in the United States around the time of the election. Sources who spoke to The Wall Street Journal said the company has been encouraged by the Trump administration’s treatment of Chinese-born investor Justin Sun, especially as it pertains to securing a pardon for Zhao. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked a court to pause a fraud lawsuit against Sun, who just happened to invest over $30 million in World Liberty Financial last November.

WLF is run by three of the president’s sons — Donald Jr., Eric, and Barron — and Steve Witkoff, a longtime friend of the Trumps who is currently serving as the president’s special envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff, who has also been negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, reportedly has been involved in discussions about a potential deal with Binance. Editor’s picks

The exact nature of the negotiations, or what a final deal might look like, remain undefined. But the possibility of WLF either gaining a major stake in Binance or receiving a large windfall seems to be on the table. A pardon for Zhao could potentially grease a deal.

Zhao denied the report on Thursday, writing on X that the piece “got the facts wrong.”

“I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone. No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge,” he added.

Bloomberg corroborated The Wall Street Journal’s report about WLF discussing a deal with Binance later on Thursday, as Binance’s crypto token jumped in value despite a general cryptocurrency slump. Trending Stories Billy Joel Undergoes Surgery, Postpones Four Months of Concerts Can Trump Arbitrarily Take Money From Anyone’s Bank Account? Musk Melts Down as Tesla Stock Price Plunges Tesla Owners Are Desperately Trying to Disguise Their Cars

The reported negotiations are another node in a growing string of dubious financial deals the Trump family has struck in the months since the president won the election. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Donald Trump’s Jr.’s firm, 1789 Capital, had invested $50 million in companies headed by Elon Musk — who currently serves as a chief adviser and policy maker for Trump while also continuing to head his own corporations. In January, Puck News reported that Amazon had agreed to pay $40 million to license a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump. According to a report from Wired earlier this month, the rich and interested can pay $1 million to have dinner with the president at his Mar-a-Lago resort, or $5 million to secure a private audience.

The president is theoretically barred from engaging in private business ventures while occupying the White House, but the Trumps have become masters of milking their side hustles.

Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, is reportedly in talks to have the Trump family buy a stake in his firm and have the White House offer him a pardon related to a 2023 money-laundering case against his company.

Zhao reportedly sees the moves as a way to both get back into the U.S. market and make doing business abroad easier, after the company in 2023 pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering requirements and paid $4.3 billion, sources told The Wall Street Journal.

The crypto billionaire reportedly took inspiration from the case of Justin Sun, who invested $30 million into Trump’s World Liberty Financial crypto venture and later saw the Securities and Exchange Commission pause an investigation into one of Sun’s businesses.

Zhao denied the reporting.

“I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone,” he wrote on X on Thursday, adding, “No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single [Bank Secrecy Act] BSA charge.”

The White House, the Trump Organization, and Trump Media did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

If the Binance founder was seeking closer ties to Trump, it would mark the latest alliance between the president and the crypto sector, despite the Republican previously dismissing crypto as “based on thin air.”

Both Trump and the First Lady launched crypto projects before the inauguration, and the Trump campaign actively courted the sector during the 2024 election, racking up millions in donations from the industry.

Since then, crypto investors have seen their fortunes rise compared to the Biden years, which took a more aggressive approach and had its regulators crack down on what it argued was widespread unregulated securities activity across the industry.

Trump has directed the U.S. to create a national cryptocurrency reserve holding bitcoins and other currencies, and he held the first White House crypto summit this month.

The close ties between the White House and the industry have raised ethical concerns.

In February, securities regulators dropped a case against Coinbase, which donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration.

Directing the U.S. to hold cryptocurrency could enrich those close to the White House.

CZ was released from prison last October after serving a four-month sentence.

After today’s report, Zhao took to the social media platform X to deny the journal’s claims.

“Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong.

“No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single Bank Secrecy Act charge.

Recent reports indicated that POTUS and his family were gunning for a share of Binance U.S.

The initial claim originated from the Wall Street Journal. It stated that a deal that would give the Trump family a share of Binance U.S was in the works.

However, Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) released a statement just hours later, dismissing the claims as non-factual.

According to CZ, Binance U.S does not currently have such a deal in the works with President Trump or any other party.

He also noted that the reports may have been spearheaded by criticism out to attack President Trump and the crypto community.

CZ Would Not Mind a Presidential Pardon

The initial claims about the Trump-Binance U.S deal also warranted CZ’s response based on a claim about his felony status.

The reports stated that the former Binance CEO would use the deal as an opportunity to secure a presidential pardon.

CZ was previously arrested for breaking U.S anti-money laundering laws and even served a 4-month prison sentence.

There were a few other allegations raised against him including sanctions violations.

Although the former Binance CEO refuted the claims about the Trump-Binance U.S deal, he had this to say about the pardon claim.

“No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge.”

Trump Faces Backlash Over Alleged Market Manipulation

The false claims about a deal between the Trump family and Binance U.S may have had an ulterior motive.

The U.S president has recently faced a lot of criticism over his economic policies.

Some have even accused him of market manipulation for personal gain.

Critics have particularly based the crypto manipulation allegations based on Trump’s links to World Liberty Finance.

The firm has been aggressively accumulating crypto and some believe that the market disruption caused by Trump’s economic policies may have been aimed at crashing the market.

The end goal being to push prices lower for better entry points.

According to CZ, these attacks might be the remnants of the previous administration’s smear campaign tactics to invalidate Trump’s policies.

Meanwhile, POTUS and his administration are reportedly willing to embrace short term pain as the best solution for some of the major challenges.",techmeme

CZ Disputes Pardon Deal Allegations

In his tweet, Zhao strongly rejected the notion that he had discussed a deal with the Trump family or anyone else about acquiring a stake in Binance.US.

He highlighted that the WSJ and other media outlets had approached more than 20 people to verify the details of such a deal. However, none could confirm it.

He noted that for 20 individuals to have informed him about WSJ’s inquiry, it suggests the media must have contacted hundreds of people. Zhao expressed frustration with what he described as an attempt by the media to “make a story” from unsubstantiated claims.

Zhao Suggests Anti-Crypto Bias Behind the Article

While Zhao denied any discussions of a pardon, he suggested that the WSJ article was part of a broader attack on President Donald Trump and the crypto industry.

He implied that the article reflected the lingering forces of the “war on crypto” from the former U.S. administration led by Joe Biden still at work.

Notably, Binance pleaded guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money laundering laws. In settling the charges, CZ stepped down from his CEO position, and the exchange paid a historic $4.3 billion fine.

The WSJ article suggested that Zhao’s conviction complicated Binance’s ability to operate in the U.S. and that a pardon would facilitate the company’s potential return to the American market.

It speculated that such a deal could open the door for Trump’s family to become more involved in the U.S. crypto market through their existing venture, World Liberty Financial.

Binance, along with former CEO Changpeng Zhao, pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting, and sanctions violations in 2023.

A deal with the Trump family would allow the previously banned company to return to the United States.

Billionaire New York real estate developer and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has reportedly been involved in the talks with Binance.

This is just the latest example of President Donald Trump’s willingness to align himself with the shady—and often illegal—crypto world. Trump’s billionaires club is filled with tech bros who have both made and been floated by considerable amounts of money in the crypto space.

Trump has seen how much more lucrative a grift of the barely policed crypto world is in comparison to previous ventures, like selling shiny gold sneakers.

Trump launched his own meme coin $TRUMP shortly after inauguration in a clear money grab, pulling in millions while exploiting hundreds of thousands of suckers. But more importantly it was a naked pay-to-play scam, allowing foreign agents and fellow grifters to curry favor with the president—like Tron founder Justin Sun, who was facing a civil fraud case started under the Biden administration.

After Sun “invested” tens of millions into Trump’s meme coin, he was rewarded by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cutting a deal and dropping the case.

As the Trump family continues talks with Binance, the potential investment—and whether or not it would include one of Trump’s patented pardons—remains to be seen.

BNB, the native token of Binance, surged by approximately 7.40% to tap $613 on Thursday before recoiling following reports that the Trump family has been exploring a potential investment in Binance.US.

According to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Donald Trump’s family members have considered acquiring a stake in Binance’s U.S. division. Discussions reportedly began in 2024, when Binance.US was actively seeking strategic partners to strengthen its position in the American market.

While the exact terms of the discussions remain unclear, speculation suggests that the Trump family’s interest in Binance.US aligns with its broader involvement in the crypto space. The family has previously supported blockchain initiatives, including World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project. Some analysts believe that any potential deal could integrate WLFI into Binance.US operations.

The prospect of the Trump family investing in Binance.US raises concerns over regulatory oversight and political influence. Binance has been under intense scrutiny from U.S. regulators, especially after its 2023 plea agreement in which the company admitted to violating anti-money laundering laws. The settlement led to the resignation of Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who was sentenced to four months in prison and fined $50 million.

Despite his release in September 2023, Zhao remains Binance’s largest shareholder. Some insiders speculate that the Trump family’s involvement could be tied to efforts to secure a presidential pardon for CZ.

However, Zhao has categorically denied any discussions with Trump’s family, dismissing the reports as misinformation aimed at discrediting Binance and the broader cryptocurrency industry.

“Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong…I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone,” Zhao tweeted shortly after the story broke.

He also suggested that journalists had pressured sources to confirm a narrative regarding a potential pardon deal.

“More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ‘Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?’…In essence, they tried hard to make a story to report.” He added. “Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work.”

Notably, Trump’s potential involvement with Binance.US could have major implications for U.S. crypto regulations, especially as his administration pushes for pro-crypto policies. It could also open the door for the exchange’s expansion.

Recall that in December 2022, Binance.US agreed to acquire Voyager Digital’s assets for $1.022 billion to return cryptocurrency to customers.

Steve Witkoff, who works in the Trump administration as an envoy to the Middle East and for the war in Ukraine, is also reportedly involved with the talks, although the Trump administration denies it.

The move would raise questions of a conflict of interest, especially if a pardon comes with it. Trump’s businesses have been involved in dealings that seem to conflict with his duties as president, especially the Trump Organization’s deal with Saudi Arabia for a new Trump Tower.

Trump’s decision to create a cryptocurrency “strategic reserve” seems to be aimed at making his wealthy associates richer, and the launch of “meme coins” by himself and his wife Melania are a blatant grift designed to line the couple’s pockets. If a deal with Binance goes through, the president and his family will once again prove that all they care about is money.

https://techmeme.com,Trump turns on Rupert Murdoch for 'polluted thinking' after WSJ bombshell on his family's business,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14495289/trump-rupert-murdoch-wsj-bombshell-family-business.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:13:15 GMT","President Donald Trump unloaded on the Wall Street Journal Thursday after the paper came out with a bombshell report saying his family was in talks with a crypto exchange whose founder is seeking a pardon.

He called the Journal a 'globalist' paper following 'polluted' and 'antiquated' thinking after he has been hammered in its opinion pages for days for setting off a series of trade wars – including one that had Trump threatening to slap a 200 percent tariff on all wine, champagne and alcohol coming out of European Union countries.

The attack comes despite Trump's close relations with News Corp chairman emeritus Rupert Murdoch.

Trump, 78, has peppered his administration with former Fox News commentators and contributors, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

'The Globalist Wall Street Journal has no idea what they are doing or saying. They are owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of “screwing” the United States of America,' Trump wrote in an angry morning diatribe.

'Their (WSJ!) thinking is antiquated and weak, and very bad for the USA. But have no fear, we will WIN on everything!!! Egg prices are down, oil is down, interest rates are down, and TARIFF RELATED MONEY IS POURING INTO THE UNITED STATES. “The only thing you have to fear, is fear itself!'

The paper's editorial page on Thursday hammered Republicans in Congress for trying to 'duck' a vote on Trump's tariffs, and said a former Columbia University student the administration is trying to deport deserves 'due process.'

President Trump attacked the Wall Street Journal as a 'globalist' paper, after one report said his family business was in talks for a stake in a crypto exchange whose founder was seeking a pardon

But the article that certainly caught Trump's attention was the one revealing talks for the Trump Organization to take a stake in the crypto exchange Binance.

The company's founder, Changpeng Zhao, served four months in prison after pleading guilty to breaking anti money-laundering rules.

That came along with the company settling a DOJ criminal probe and agreeing to pay a $4.3 billion fine.

Murdoch visited the Oval Office last month and attended Trump's inauguration

Former Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao arrives at federal court in Seattle, Washington, on April 30, 2024. The founder and former chief executive of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was sentenced today to four months in prison after he pleaded guilty to violating laws against money laundering

Trump hammered the paper online

WSJ editor in chief Emma Tucker said Trump's tariffs were 'being imposed in a very haphazard way'

The report said the Trump family held talks about taking a stake in the business

The report stated that the talks involved the Trump business taking a stake in the firm, which has both a U.S. and an overseas arm, through the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial.

It further reported that Zhao, the company's largest shareholder, has been lobbying for a pardon that would ease the transaction.

The story posted at 9 am. Trump's angry Truth Social post appeared at 8:56 am.

A separate front page story in the Journal was headlined 'CEO Frustrations with Trump Over Trade Mount – in Private.'

It reported on 'revulsion' among the execs over Trump's economic policies, and said they were 'horrified' about Canada, a country Trump has been tariffing and saying the U.S. should annex as a state. But they mostly kept their complaints private.

The paper's editor in chief, Emma Tucker, spoke critically of the way Trump's tariffs are being imposed in an interview with Fox Business.

'They're being imposed in a very haphazard way,' she said. 'He's talking kind of in a no pain, no gain kind of way,' she added, referencing Trump's recent comments on the potential for a recession. 'Chief execs, businesses, they're slightly floundering because they don't know where to look now,' Tucker added.

Murdoch, 94, was in the Oval Office days after Trump took power, attending an event where Trump signed an executive order that would create a new U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund. He also attended Trump's inauguration.

On March 13, Zhao took to X to refute the claims, calling the article an attempt to undermine both the US president and the crypto industry. He stressed that he had no involvement in any discussions regarding Binance.US.

The former Binance CEO wrote:

“They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In essence, they tried hard to make a story to report. Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone.

Zhao also suggested that lingering anti-crypto sentiment from the previous US administration played a role in the report, saying:

“Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work.”

On the issue of a presidential pardon, the former Binance CEO stated:

“No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge.”

WSJ report

According to WSJ, President Trump’s family is allegedly exploring an investment in Binance.US.

The report further claimed that these discussions included the possibility of a presidential pardon for Zhao, who pleaded guilty to federal violations in late 2023.

Zhao’s plea agreement led to a $4.3 billion settlement for Binance and a four-month prison sentence for him. A presidential pardon could help clear legal obstacles for Binance and aid its global expansion.

WSJ also alleged that the Trump family could channel its investment through its DeFi venture, World Liberty Financial (WLF). Additionally, the report linked Steve Witkoff, a WLF executive and Trump’s advisor on global negotiations, to the discussions.

Meanwhile, this report emerges at a time when Binance.US fortunes have greatly improved in the US. The exchange recently resumed USD deposits and withdrawals for its US customers and also saw its legal tussle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paused for 60 days.

CZ’s poor relationship with WSJ

Zhao has publicly criticized the WSJ multiple times for what he claims are false or misleading reports about him and Binance.

Zhao responded to a WSJ article alleging closer ties between Binance and Binance.US than previously disclosed. The report was based on leaked Telegram messages and interviews with unnamed staff. In response, Zhao tweeted “4,” referencing his earlier instruction to his followers to ignore “FUD, fake news, attacks, etc.” This became a meme within the crypto community.

Zhao has consistently accused legacy media outlets, including the WSJ, of spreading FUD about Binance and the broader crypto industry. He has repeatedly urged his followers to disregard such reports, framing them as sensationalist or biased against crypto.

Trump Family is Reportedly Eyeing a Stake in Binance US

Since his reelection in late 2024, Donald Trump has become the first true pro-crypto president in history. Indeed, he has completely overhauled the country’s policy regarding the asset class, leading many to believe a new day for the industry is approaching.

That belief in the future of cryptocurrency is not only present in his administration but extends to his business interests. That is why it makes perfect sense for US President Trump’s family to be reportedly seeking to purchase a stake in Binance US. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the interest and noted that talks have commenced.

According to the report, the talks first started last year. Specifically, Binance had reached out to the Trump team, discussing a potential “business deal with the family as part of a plan to return the exiled company to the US.”

Details are sparse, with preliminary talks likely having taken place. Moreover, there is a lack of clarity regarding the specific stake that the Trump family would take in the exchange.

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which cited people familiar with the matter, the discussion began last year after Binance reached out to allies of Trump to secure a business deal with the family as part of a broader strategy to re-establish its presence in the US.

“It is unclear what form the Trump family stake would take if the deal comes together or whether it would be contingent on a pardon,” the report stated.

However, it added that one possibility under discussion is that the deal could go through World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project backed by the Trumps.

While the claims have not been confirmed, Steve Witkoff, a longtime associate of former President Trump and his top negotiator in Middle Eastern affairs, has been involved in the discussions.

CZ Pushes for Pardon

At the same time, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Binance’s co-founder and former CEO, is also pursuing a pardon from the Trump administration, the report said.

In November 2023, CZ pleaded to violating US anti-money laundering laws, specifically the Bank Secrecy Act. According to US prosecutors, he failed to implement an effective AML program at Binance, which allowed “money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.”

As part of the plea deal, he served a four-month sentence, stepped down as CEO, paid a $50 million fine, and Binance settled for $4.3 billion. While he remains a major shareholder in Binance, he was barred from any direct role in managing or operating the company.

A Potential Return to the US?

A pardon for CZ would significantly impact Binance’s ability to operate in the US and strengthen its global business prospects. On the other hand, the Trump family’s potential stake in Binance.US could provide an opportunity to compete with Coinbase as the US crypto market experiences renewed growth amid a shifting regulatory landscape.

Binance’s legal and business challenges

Binance has faced intense regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., culminating in a $4.3 billion settlement with authorities in 2023 over alleged facilitation of illicit transactions.

As part of the agreement, Zhao stepped down as CEO and served four months in prison but remains Binance’s majority shareholder.

In recent months, Binance has been positioning itself for a return to the U.S. market. The exchange set up an internal working group under CEO Richard Teng to explore legal pathways, acknowledging that Zhao’s criminal conviction could hinder its reintegration.

Trump’s pro-crypto stance has added momentum to Binance’s efforts. His administration has been rolling back regulatory restrictions on the industry, signing executive orders that benefit digital asset firms.

The potential Trump-Binance deal raises concerns about conflicts of interest, as it would mark an unprecedented overlap between the presidency and private business dealings. Unlike past presidents, Trump has maintained control over his assets through his family, allowing them to pursue business ventures while he remains in office.

Separately, Binance executives have reportedly studied the case of Justin Sun, a crypto entrepreneur facing SEC charges, who invested $30 million in Trump’s World Liberty Financial last year.

Following Sun’s investment, the SEC paused its fraud case against him, leading Binance to consider a similar strategy, sources told the WSJ.

The exchange recently secured a $2 billion investment from UAE-backed firm MGX.

CZ refutes report, denies any discussions of a pardon deal

After the article was published, Zhao denied the report and the notion that he sought a pardon from U.S. authorities. In a post on X, CZ said the article “got the facts wrong” and claimed he never had discussions about a deal for clemency.

“More than 20 people told me they were asked by the WSJ if I made some deal for a pardon,” CZ wrote. “I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone.”

Trump’s Family Eyes Stake In Binance US

According to a WSJ report, US President Donald Trump’s family representatives have held talks to acquire a stake in Binance’s US arm. This comes just after the top crypto exchange announced that Abu Dhabi-based MGX had invested $2 billion in the exchange to acquire a minority stake.

Meanwhile, the WSJ report also revealed that the exchange’s founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao is also pushing for Trump’s administration to grant him a pardon. Last year, CZ served a four-month sentence after he and Binance US pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations. A pardon will wipe Zhao’s criminal record away from the registry, meaning he will no longer be regarded as an ex-convict.

The Correlation Between Both Developments

Both the Trump family’s move to acquire a stake in Binance US and CZ’s push for a pardon could intertwine, especially considering that the exchange’s founder is allegedly still the largest shareholder. As such, he could play a major role in Trump’s move to acquire a stake in the top crypto exchange’s US arm.

WSJ also revealed that the talks to acquire a stake in the crypto exchange began after Binance reached out to Trump’s allies in 2024 offering to strike a deal with the family as part of its strategy to revive the exchange’s US arm. It is worth mentioning that the US arm resumed its USD services after Trump took office in January.

According to WSJ, it is still unclear what form the Trump family stake would look like if the deal happens or even whether it would depend on Trump granting CZ a pardon. Meanwhile, the report noted that there is also the possibility of the deal going through World Liberty Financial, which the Trump family has ties with.

CZ Denies WSJ’s Report

In an X post, CZ stated that he has not discussed a Binance US deal with anyone and suggested that he hasn’t pushed for a pardon from Trump’s administration. However, the Binance founder added that no felon would mind a pardon, especially considering he is the only one in US history who has received a prison sentence for a single BSA charge.

Zhao also remarked that WSJ’s article feels like an attack on the US President and crypto and the residual forces of the war on crypto from the last administration are still at work. He stated that he is always happy to make crypto everywhere, in the US and the rest of the world.

https://theverge.com,Tesla Cybertruck deliveries reportedly on hold because the trim is flying off,https://theverge.com/news/629352/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-on-hold-loose-trim,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:36:28 GMT","is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

America’s favorite low poly electric truck is facing a new set of problems that don’t have anything to do with people spray painting swastikas or crude comments about Elon Musk on them. Deliveries of the Tesla Cybertruck are on hold while the company addresses issues with reports that the trim is becoming detached and flying off, Electrek reports.

Tesla service representatives are telling customers awaiting deliveries that there is a “containment hold” on their trucks, according to several posts in the Cybertruck Owners Forum, as noted by Electrek. The customers are not being told it has anything to do with the vehicle’s trim, though. A containment hold is a proactive measure taken by automakers to address a quality issue or defect with a vehicle before it reaches customers.

Electrek also shared a screenshot of direct messages between a customer and a Tesla service rep that mentioned an issue with the truck’s cantrail, or the decorative trim that covers the roof ledge above the door. The delay could take several weeks to address, depending on the severity of the loose trim.

The problem is likely related to a handful complaints filed with the federal government earlier this year, which noted that the trim above the truck’s windows appeared to be attached by glue.

A video on YouTube posted over a month ago goes into greater detail about the issues with the cantrail trim.

This isn’t the first time we’re hearing about problems with the Cybertruck trim. Tesla issued a recall for over 11,000 trucks last summer for “improperly adhered… trunk bed trim sail applique.”",theverge
https://theverge.com,Contentious Republican town halls are going viral,https://theverge.com/news/628284/republican-town-hall-videos-doge-musk-trump-tiktok,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","is platforms and communities reporter with five years of experience covering the companies that shape technology and the people who use their tools.

In a TikTok video from CNN that has been viewed more than 3 million times since late February, the voice of a voter in Roswell, Georgia, pierces through a town hall event held by Rep. Rich McCormick (R-GA).

“Tyranny is rising in the White House, and a man has declared himself our king,” the woman says. “So I would like to know, rather, the people would like to know, what you, congressman, and your fellow congressmen are going to do to rein in the megalomaniac in the White House.” Her voice is unwavering, each syllable enunciated perfectly. She speaks slowly and deliberately, and her Southern accent brings a different kind of intensity.



The sound bite is perfect for the age of shortform video. Hundreds of people have uploaded clips of themselves lip-syncing to the woman’s question. “Who is this diva?” is a common response, along with many iterations of “Vote [McCormick] out.”

Across the country, town halls like the event in Roswell have become the setting for constituents and their elected representatives to come face-to-face — often contentiously. Republican representatives have been booed out of their own events and drowned out after giving unsatisfactory responses. In Idaho, a woman was dragged out of an event by workers of a private security firm for “heckling” legislators. In a different timeline, these confrontations might have circulated in local news reports but not much further; now, they go viral, agitating even those at the highest levels of government. The tough questions come from people who identify themselves as Republicans as well as from Democrats, and many are attending town hall events for the first time, activated by the gutting of the federal government and services.

Lindsay DeFranco arrived at the Roswell town hall on February 20th well ahead of the start time to ensure she’d get a seat. (The event had overflow rooms to contain all the attendees.)

DeFranco, who had never attended a town hall before, says she decided to pull out her phone and record the event so she could share clips, unedited and without commentary. On TikTok, DeFranco shared a video of an exchange about school lunches for low-income kids (100,000 views); legislation that would disenfranchise women from voting (6 million views); and the now-viral “Tyranny is rising in the White House” moment (630,000 views).

She saw McCormick questioned about everything from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to support for Ukraine, to school lunch programs for kids. DeFranco, who grew up in the area and recently moved back, said McCormick came off as “dismissive” and “snide.”

“I don’t think he was listening very well, and if he was, he wasn’t truly wanting to engage with us,” DeFranco says. “At one point, he said, ‘I don’t think you guys came here in good faith,’ and that really set us off, too. Because we’re like, ‘Are you here in good faith?’”

“I really wanted people to see this is exactly what was asked, this is exactly what was said, and this is how people reacted,” DeFranco says. “They had told us that it wasn’t going to be live streamed. So I thought, ‘I have to film this right away. I have to document this.’”

Across the country, in Yucca Valley, California, Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-CA) faced a similarly tough crowd at his February 22nd community meeting in a congressional district that he won handily in November. Footage shows Obernolte being ushered out of the event to loud boos and shouts from the audience, who questioned the legislator about DOGE, cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and other issues.

E., an attendee at the event, was especially concerned about how DOGE and the Trump administration’s actions would affect the nearby Joshua Tree National Park. The New York Times counted at least 1,000 National Park employees who were terminated by the Trump administration in February, including some at Joshua Tree. (E. asked The Verge that they be identified by first initial only, fearing harassment.)

“That’s a big part of our economy. With the reduced staffing, we could obviously lose tourism,” E. says about the cuts to Joshua Tree. “It could impact local businesses and jobs, not to mention the environmental degradation, the risk for wildfires. Without Rangers, we have less resources to protect our park.”

E. says they previously did not have strong feelings about how well Obernolte had been representing the community but believed that listening to constituents was a key part of his job. The event was packed with constituents, and E. says it appeared to be an equal mix of Democrats and Republicans. There were young people and older community members, veterans, and some people that had signs related to cuts at the National Parks. At the beginning, the atmosphere was calm — nobody was aggressive or “name calling.” But it quickly turned, E. says, when the audience felt like Obernolte wasn’t addressing local issues people cared about. One man, in particular, caught E.’s attention: he was calm and collected, clapping when veterans issues were mentioned. But he seemed to be losing patience — he began shaking his head back and forth in frustration.

“That’s kind of when [I wanted] to do a video, because I want to document that this isn’t just coming from one side or the other,” E. says. “This feels a lot like the town itself is unhappy, and that’s what resonated with me.”

“I was there. I’m a real human. Just saying we’re a paid actor is like — when is our check coming?”

Republicans including House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump himself have pushed the false claim that “paid protestors” are behind the angry town halls. The pushback has rattled Republicans — earlier this month, House GOP leadership advised representatives to stop holding in-person town hall meetings. E. and others interviewed for this story refute the false claims that paid operatives are the people showing up to events.

“I was there. I’m a real human,” E. says. “Just saying we’re a paid actor is like — when is our check coming? Because I would love to donate that to our national park, if it is,” E. jokes.

Some Republicans have instead opted to do virtual events, like Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), who held a telephone town hall on February 27th. Autumn Marshall, a constituent, says she wanted to attend the event because she has been contacting Johnson’s office and has never gotten a response. Marshall says she is particularly concerned about the Department of Education and wanted to hear what Johnson’s plans were to fund schools in the state as well as Musk’s role in government and the future of Medicaid. By the time the call started, 400 questions had already poured in.

During the call, Marshall says Johnson appeared to enjoy the questions from callers who complimented or praised him — but went so far as to cut off callers who asked him difficult questions. It wasn’t clear to Marshall how questions were selected in the telephone format.

“I personally feel that’s kind of a cop out,” Marshall says. “It was really easy for him to just hang up on somebody, versus us being in front of him where people could maybe still keep talking.”

After the event, Marshall made a series of TikToks summarizing the event, describing what voters had asked and how Johnson had responded.

“I think that [elected officials] like to kind of fly under the radar, and they do need more light shone on them to see what they’re doing, what they’re saying,” Marshall says.

Trump and members of his administration are posters first, politicians second

Kiersten Pels, a spokesperson for Johnson, told The Verge that the senator has held 113 telephone town halls in his 15 years in the Senate. Pels did not respond to questions about whether Johnson would hold in-person events but noted that his office uploads recordings of phone town halls to X. McCormick’s and Obernolte’s offices did not respond to requests for comment.

Part of what catapulted Trump to the White House both times he has been elected is that he has figured out how to dominate in the attention economy: he and members of his administration are posters first, politicians second. The Kamala Harris campaign gave Trump a run for his money, but Democrats have largely been unable to wrest control of media narratives from the troll accounts, conspiracy theory podcasters, and a right-wing media ecosystem that props up Trump.

The viral town halls have bubbled up organically — and some Democrats have recognized the power vacuum opening up. Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said last week that he will hold town halls in Republican districts, as has Tim Walz, Minnesota governor and Harris running mate. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) similarly said in an interview that if a deep red district wanted to host her, she would “be willing to do that.” Getting constituents across the political spectrum angrily confronting Republican lawmakers — and then going a step further and sharing that frustration online — has the potential to shake up the balance of power, at least on the internet.

DeFranco, who attended the town hall in Roswell, Georgia, says the current political moment is “lighting a fire” under her. She has attended other events with groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the League of Women Voters. In turn, DeFranco says she wants Democratic leaders to be more outspoken and take a stronger stance against the Trump agenda.

“At the State of the Union when they just wore pink in solidarity, or held up the little auction paddles to say things — I don’t think that’s enough,” DeFranco says. “I think it looks weak, and I think we’re going to continue getting taken advantage of until we vocally stand up for ourselves.”",theverge
https://theverge.com,Sigma BF review: the perfect camera for a minimalist,https://theverge.com/camera-review/628519/sigma-bf-camera-review-photography-specs,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:04:37 GMT","Sigma’s new $2,000 camera is missing so many features that you might not take the product seriously. The Sigma BF has no tilt or flip-out screen, hot shoe or cold shoe, any type of viewfinder, mechanical shutter, 4K 60, microphone port, or in-body stabilization. There isn’t even a link to connect your shoulder strap. The list of missing features is long, and as someone who is used to professional “do-it-all” cameras, it was a lot to let go of.

But I think you should try. After a few weeks of using it, the Sigma BF won me over with its bold design, clever controls, clean software, and ability to create stunning photos. It’s a lot to get used to, but the results are worth it.

The camera looks unlike anything else on the market. Its body is made from a single block of aluminum, and its controls have been pared down to just a few buttons. The result is a surprisingly easy-to-operate camera you can take almost anywhere — as long as anywhere doesn’t include professional work. I can’t see myself using this in a studio or as a video camera. But as a high-end point-and-shoot, the camera gets incredible results without overthinking it.

The body’s minimalistic and bold design is paired with sharp corners and edges. It isn’t a particularly comfortable camera to hold, but not to the point where it would hurt. Using it with one hand is hard, and the lack of a second strap link is a bit infuriating. Sigma wants you to use this camera with a wrist strap, but I’d rather just have the option for both. You could add a link to the tripod mount, but that’s an odd and pretentious decision.

I’m more welcoming of Sigma’s decision to eliminate a bunch of dials from the camera and opt for just a single one on the back. That dial became instrumental in how I used the camera. In tandem with a small pill-shaped display above it, the dial lets you easily cycle through settings and change them on the fly. I do wish there was a way to eliminate which options you cycle through because I often didn’t need all of them. But the dial also made me jump between creative options like aspect ratio and film simulations a lot more often. It forced me to try out some new looks and compositions. It made taking photos fun.

Another neat feature of the dial is that it turns into an exposure compensation control when you’re half pressing the shutter button. From there you can easily do some quick exposure changes. It’s a clever trick and genuinely useful. The BF’s other buttons can do some neat tricks, too. If you rest your finger on the playback key, it’ll show you your last photo taken until you lift your finger again. It’s a neat way this camera leans into its modern features.

The interface’s simplicity pairs well with the camera’s all-around speed. It turns on almost instantly. Switching between modes is swift. Sensor readout is quick. Continuous shooting is decent (for a full frame camera). Accessing your photo library is just as zippy.

All the photos can be reviewed on a large, bright, and reasonably sharp 3.2-inch screen and saved on a 230GB internal SSD. There are no expandable storage options, though. This means you have to be a lot more diligent about backing up photos and making sure you don’t run out of space. Personally I am not too bothered by this decision, but I am worried about what happens if the internal storage fails.

I would understand this decision better if Sigma had a good smartphone app for photo transfers. But tough luck. No app and no SD cards means you can only transfer photos with a physical cable. Whether you consider this a dealbreaker or not, I think we can all agree that cameras in 2025 should all have both internal and expandable storage.

The photos themselves look great, like you’d expect from a full frame camera. They’re sharp, lively, and packed with details. My review unit came with Sigma’s updated 50mm F/2 lens, which is a perfect match for this camera. Even in low light, I found that the noise created by high ISO was well maintained. The grain itself was soothing and had very film-like characteristics, especially when using some of Sigma’s built-in film looks.

1 / 5 Sigma’s 50mm f/2 pairs nicely with this camera, and I kept using that lens through most of my review.

You can find 13 film simulations on the BF, and that should be enough for most people to find something they like here. My favorite ones are Warm Gold, Teal & Orange, and Rich. I mostly kept using the Warm Gold, which won me over with its warm tones, muted reds, and desaturated colors. Unfortunately, there’s no way to create your own custom film simulations right now, which feels like a missed opportunity. Custom Fujifilm film simulations have created online communities of photographers around its cameras who share their own formulas to help others achieve different looks.

The camera’s auto focus system has impressed me too. It is snappy, has decent focus tracking, and detects faces and animals really well. I did notice more focus breathing in video, but I found it a lot more reliable when taking photos.

Video is a bit of an afterthought, though. The camera supports 6K up to 30FPS, and that footage does look great. You can film in H.264 and H.265 in Sigma’s Log color codec, and there’s 1080p slow motion up to 120fps. But I do think using this camera for video highlights the flaws of its minimalistic design. Changing settings on the fly becomes a lot harder, lack of a tilt screen makes it more cumbersome, weak battery life doesn’t help either, and no optical stabilization equals more shaky clips. I’m not saying you won’t get good video clips with this camera, but its main focus is definitely in photography.



For a $2,000 camera, there is a lot that is missing here. And giving this a numerical score was harder than anticipated. Despite its long list of cons, I had an absolute blast using this camera for the past few weeks and even took some of my favorite photos ever, but I also can’t recommend it to everyone because it simply won’t satisfy everyone’s needs. If you’re looking for a hybrid powerhouse that can do it all, look elsewhere. If you’re looking for an exciting and modern camera that is fun to use, takes great photos, has clever usability features, and just looks stunning, the BF is a fantastic choice.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Microsoft’s new Xbox Copilot will act as an AI gaming coach,https://theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","Microsoft is preparing to launch an AI-powered Copilot for Gaming soon that will guide Xbox players through games and act as an assistant to download and launch games. Copilot for Gaming, as Microsoft is branding it, will be available through the Xbox mobile app initially and is designed to work on a second screen as a companion or assistant.

Microsoft is positioning Copilot for Gaming as a sidekick of sorts, one that will accompany you through games, offering up tips and guides and useful information about a game world. During a press briefing, Sonali Yadav, product manager for gaming AI, demonstrated several scenarios for what Copilot for Gaming could be used for. One involved a concept demo of Copilot assisting an Overwatch 2 player by coaching them on the mistakes they made when trying to push without teammates.

In the Overwatch 2 demo, Copilot could even recommend good hero picks to complement the rest of the team and tell you more about why you’d want to pair up particular characters, detailing their strengths and weaknesses. Another demo involved using Copilot with Minecraft, where you could ask Copilot questions about how to craft objects. Copilot can see your screen, so it can guide you and see exactly what you’re doing in a game. The demo also included the option to enable cheats in Minecraft, so Copilot could even tell you where certain crafting materials are located in the world.

The demos felt very concept in nature, and they won’t be available during the initial launch of Copilot for Gaming next month. Instead, Microsoft will test early versions of Copilot with Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app in April, before eventually bringing Copilot to multiple devices.

Microsoft also has a slick marketing video for its Copilot for Gaming effort, but none of it looks real world to me, so it’s difficult to understand exactly what the company will deliver to testers in April. It looks like Microsoft has the vision for where it wants Copilot on an Xbox to be in the future, and it says it will iterate based on feedback. But right now, I’ll be interested to see how this launches in a more limited fashion on mobile devices.",theverge
https://theverge.com,The Trump administration faces a fight over ‘biggest’ environmental deregulatory action in US history,https://theverge.com/news/629128/trump-environmental-deregulation-epa,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:17:38 GMT","is a senior science reporter covering energy and the environment with more than a decade of experience. She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home , a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.

The Trump administration launched a massive deregulation spree that could gut environmental and health protections in the US, moves that are sure to face immediate legal and logistical challenges.

Wednesday was “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen,” Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin said in a press release. The proposed changes include 31 actions to roll back pollution regulations for power plants, oil and gas refineries, chemical plants, cars and trucks, factories, and more.

“This is a cluster bomb”

Advocacy groups, unsurprisingly, are already promising a fight. Outside of court, the EPA — if it follows protocol — would have to go through extensive rulemaking processes. And it has to make this all happen with a shrunken and demoralized workforce.

“This is a cluster bomb of moves to demolish a broad swath of environmental regulations. We’ll see if it explodes in EPA’s face when the inevitable barrage of lawsuits hits the courts,” Michael Gerrard, faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said in an email to The Verge.

The EPA says it will “reconsider” a broad swath of regulations on everything including mercury, toxic air pollutants, soot, wastewater, the chemicals used in the workplace, and the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.

The EPA is also working to claw back $20 billion of Biden-era federal funding to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. Zeldin’s language when it comes to the climate crisis is particularly vociferous. “We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,” he said.

The EPA press release says, without sharing any numbers or analysis, that the proposed measures would make it more affordable to buy a car or run a business. The Trump administration’s tariff wars, however, are expected to raise the cost of a car by up to $12,000.

Federal standards for soot pollution alone, on the other hand, are estimated to lead to $46 billion in net health benefits, according to an EPA analysis last year. Stronger soot protections that were finalized last year were also expected to prevent 290,000 lost workdays and 4,500 premature deaths by 2032.

American Lung Association president and CEO Harold Wimmer said in an emailed statement that the organization “will use every tool in our toolbox to defend these lifesaving protections and protect the health of families.”

The Sierra Club also said in a statement that it would “fight these outrageous rollbacks tooth and nail.” And “should the EPA undo settled law and irrefutable facts, we expect to see this administration in court,” environmental law organization Earthjustice said in another statement.

“It is important to remember that currently, all these clean air protections are still in place. EPA’s leadership can’t undo them with this announcement. They have to follow the law and go through a process to reconsider or revoke them,” the American Lung Association’s Wimmer added.

President Donald Trump managed to roll back around 100 environmental regulations during his first term in office. This time around, he’s moving much quicker to enact sweeping changes. But the wrecking ball that Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk have taken to federal agencies could also make it harder to implement their agenda at the EPA.

“In order to revoke or revise a regulation, you need a new regulation,” Columbia’s Gerrard notes. It takes skilled staff to write detailed explanations to justify such drastic changes in the EPA’s position, according to Gerrard. Courts could invalidate new rules without those explanations, and it’s unclear who would be left at the agency to do that work as the Trump administration slashes the federal workforce, he says.

The announcements made yesterday mark “the most disastrous day in EPA history,” according to an emailed statement from former EPA administrator and White House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy.

“They’re doing the bidding of their fossil fuel friends,” McCarthy said. Trump received more than $75 million from oil and gas interests while campaigning on a platform to “drill, baby, drill.”

According to McCarthy, “The agency has fully abdicated its mission to protect Americans’ health and wellbeing.”",theverge
https://theverge.com,WinRing0: Why Windows is flagging your PC monitoring and fan control apps as a threat,https://theverge.com/report/629259/winring0-windows-defender-fan-control-pc-monitoring-alert-quarantine,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:51:38 GMT","is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.

On Tuesday morning, some PC gamers woke up to discover their computers were seemingly under threat. A “HackTool” called WinRing0 had suddenly started triggering a Windows Defender alert, as if their PCs were under attack. Some of those computers even began behaving oddly ​​— like blasting their fans at high speed — once the HackTool had been quarantined. I know, because it happened to me.

But my computer wasn’t actually under attack — at least, not yet.

When I checked where Windows Defender had actually detected the threat, it was in the Fan Control app I use to intelligently cool my PC. Windows Defender had broken it, and that’s why my fans were running amok. For others, the threat was detected in Razer Synapse, SteelSeries Engine, OpenRGB, Libre Hardware Monitor, CapFrameX, MSI Afterburner, OmenMon, FanCtrl, ZenTimings, and Panorama9, among many others.

“As of now, all third-party / open-source hardware monitoring softwares are screwed,” Fan Control developer Rémi Mercier tells me.

Here’s the pop-up I saw on Tuesday. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge

That’s because all these programs have something in common, eight of their developers tell The Verge. They do (or did) all contain a piece of kernel-level software that is indeed called WinRing0. And WinRing0 could genuinely be a threat as of today, one that has even been linked to some pretty nasty real-world malware that could theoretically hijack your PC.

But again, that’s not what’s happening on computers with these specific useful apps — there is no hijack underway. Rather, WinRing0 is being flagged because it’s an insecure way for these pieces of monitoring software to tell how fast my PC’s fans are spinning and the colors of its LED lights, among other readings. And yet, WinRing0 is widespread, several developers tell me, because it’s one of the only ways Microsoft and the PC industry let them tap that hardware from inside the Windows operating system.

“There are only two freely available Windows drivers I know of that are capable of accessing the SMBus registers we need to be able to control LEDs: InpOut32 and WinRing0,” says Adam Honse, developer of OpenRGB. “We used to use InpOut32, but it was conflicting with Riot’s Vanguard anti-cheat, so we switched to WinRing0 as it did not conflict.”

Honse and others freely admit that WinRing0 could be abused. “It’s not some secret vulnerability. It’s literally a library intended to give userspace applications access to something that only kernel drivers normally have access to,” he says.

Nor do they all begrudge Microsoft’s attempt to close that potential loophole. After the CrowdStrike outage that knocked out 8.5 million devices with a buggy update last year, Microsoft has been under pressure to restrict software that has special access to low level hardware, so nothing like that can happen again. Microsoft hasn’t said why it’s only getting around to addressing WinRing0 now, but it’s been gradually overhauling its driver requirements in yearly updates, and it’s pretty routine for the company to blacklist vulnerabilities on the go.

The fact remains that this vulnerable WinRing0 has found its way into all kinds of software because it was a useful loophole, and several developers now say they’re stuck because Microsoft would charge too much to fix it. Some are even calling Windows Defender’s detection a “false positive,” implying it should be safe to use WinRing0 anyhow, because their own apps aren’t malicious and there’s no other cost-effective way to get them working.

Fan Control’s developer now advises users to “review the risk” before deciding what to do. Image: Fan Control

SignalRGB founder Timothy Sun says the security risk is more complicated than that, though. “Since WinRing0 installs system-wide, we realized we were dependent on whatever version was first installed on a user’s system. This made it extremely difficult to verify whether other applications had installed potentially vulnerable versions, effectively putting our users at risk despite our best efforts,” he says.

That’s why his company invested in its own RGB interface instead, eventually ditching WinRing0 in 2023 in favor of a proprietary SMBus driver. But the developers I spoke to, including Sun, agree that’s an expensive proposition.

“I won’t sugarcoat it — the development process was challenging and required significant engineering resources,” says Sun. “Small open source projects do not have the financial ability to go that route, nor dedicated Microsoft kernel development experience to do so,” says OpenRGB’s Honse.

But there may be a simpler alternative: why not fix the vulnerability in WinRing0 itself? To my surprise, three developers tell me that WinRing0 has already been patched, but the open source community doesn’t believe they can afford to get a new version signed by Microsoft — and without Microsoft’s digital signature, Windows won’t let users install it to begin with.

WinRing0 “was a ‘one of its kind driver’ in that its source was open and it was signed,” Mercier explains. “Nothing else like it exists, as enterprises do not develop open-source kernel drivers.”

According to PhyxionNL, the developer of the popular Libre Hardware Monitor that underpins many monitoring apps (including Fan Control), WinRing0 dates back to a time when Windows didn’t require Microsoft to sign such drivers; its author Noriyuki Miyazaki (also see: CrystalDiskMark) apparently signed it himself.

But to get a new copy signed, developers would need Microsoft’s approval — and they’d need to pay up.

Honse says:

It is not feasible to demand not-for-profit hobby [free open source software] projects to pay the same costs for driver signing as for-profit companies. It also appears that driver signing is a limited-time thing that would need continuous renewal, so it would be a recurring cost. Also, from preliminary searching, you need to be a company to be able to even get a kernel signing certificate. Microsoft has stacked the deck against us.

OmenMon’s Piotr Szczepanski says it’s not good enough to submit your entire app to Microsoft and VirusTotal for inspection, either, “as despite OmenMon being whitelisted each time, eventually the exact same executable can become repeatedly flagged again, as definition versions get updated and signatures get purged.”

“Microsoft has stacked the deck against us.”

Szczepanski, ZenTimings’ Ivan Rusanov, and Fan Control’s Mercier all say there’s nothing they can really afford to do in the absence of a newly signed driver that functions like WinRing0. “I would definitely replace it with something else the moment it gets available, but for now, obviously, I can’t advise the users to ignore it and add an exception to Defender,” says Rusanov.

But there is some hope. Prebuilt gaming PC manufacturer iBuyPower, whose Hyte Nexus monitoring software also uses WinRing0 and got flagged by Windows Defender, tells The Verge it will endeavor to get an updated WinRing0 signed — and give the results back to developers.

“If this solution works, we’ll share our updated and signed version of the library, so the community of developers can distribute new versions of their apps with validated Microsoft drivers,” Hyte product director Robert Teller tells us.

Teller says he’s awaiting Microsoft’s reply. Microsoft didn’t have any comment for The Verge.

I asked SignalRGB’s Sun if he might share his proprietary SMBus driver, but he said no, as “we’ve invested significant resources into developing this solution specifically for our needs and user base.”

As for Razer and Steelseries users, you may simply want to update your software to the latest version to avoid WinRing0, as both companies tell me they’ve recently ditched it. But know that you may lose some functionality as a result. Steelseries has just removed its System Monitor app entirely to address the vulnerability, meaning gamers can no longer see system data on the screens of its peripherals.

Razer software VP Quyen Quach says Synapse 4 and Synapse 2 never used WinRing0 at all and that the company patched Synapse 3 to remove it just three weeks ago.

Correction, March 13th: Razer says Synapse 2 didn’t use WinRing0 either, so no current versions of Synapse are affected.",theverge

Instead of scrolling through chats to see scattered individual replies, the feature will create a dedicated view showing every quoted message connecting back to the original message that started the thread, helping users to find specific responses and easily navigate long and messy conversations.

The threads feature, spotted in WhatsApp’s Android beta 2.25.7.7 update by WABetaInfo, is under development and won’t be available for testing until a future update. Message threads are expected to be available for individual conversations, group chats, communities, and channels, though as noted by WABetaInfo, the ability to reply to messages in channels is also still under development.

A screenshot of the preview that WABetaInfo managed to run gives us some idea of what the threaded messages will look like once the feature rolls out, showing a full-screen pop-up displaying replies that have been sent by several users in a group discussion. Users can tap on any quoted message to view all the responses within that chain, though it seems the original message that’s being responded to won’t appear within the threaded view.

One of the issues we’re seeing reported is that external drives appear to no longer work, at least for some users. This appears to apply not just to external storage, but USB devices in general, as another user mentions that their Ethernet adapter also doesn’t work. One user in our comments also mentions that a “Low Power” warning now appears while using a multi-purpose adapter.

Reports of this behavior aren’t particularly widespread, but there are just enough to suggest there might be something amiss.

Other issues that have been spotted by early adopters include changes to the color profile – something we also noticed on our unit – issues in the Settings menu, problems with USB debugging, and other small issues. The update overall appears to be stable, and some have mentioned that a factory reset leaves the device faster than it was before, but it’s clear there are some hiccups.

Thousands of federal employees fired by the Trump administration must be offered job reinstatement within the next week, a U.S. district judge in San Francisco has ruled, because he said they were terminated unlawfully.

""It is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that is a lie,"" Judge William Alsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said before issuing his ruling from the bench.

The Thursday decision marks a significant stand against President Trump's sweeping efforts to remake the federal government. The White House pledged to appeal.

The administration's job cuts targeted federal workers with probationary status, which usually means newer workers, and makes them easier to let go. Employees recently promoted into a new position can also be considered probationary.

Many probationary employees were fired for ""performance reasons,"" according to their termination notices, even though many employees had received positive feedback from supervisors.

""It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements,"" Alsup said.

The judge also ordered the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prove within seven days that it had offered reinstatement to all fired probationary employees at the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury and Veterans Affairs.

The White House is blasting the decision. ""A single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. ""The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch – singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President's agenda. If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves.""

Leavitt added: ""The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.""

Requests for comment were submitted to the agencies affected by the judge's ruling. Spokespeople for the VA and the Interior Department said they don't comment on pending litigation.

The decision comes as a result of a lawsuit brought by a group of unions and civic groups on behalf of workers fired from a host of agencies and sub-agencies.

In a charged, sometimes confrontational court hearing on Thursday, Judge Alsup challenged the government's argument that OPM, which acts as the government's HR department, had not directly ordered the termination of probationary employees but had left that decision to individual federal agencies and served merely as a coordinating body.

""The court rejects the government's attempt to use these press releases and to read between the lines to say the agency heads made their own decision with no direction from OPM,"" Alsup said.

The judge also bridled that OPM's acting director, Charles Ezell, and his senior adviser, Noah Peters, did not attend the hearing.

""You will not bring the people in here to be cross-examined. You're afraid to do so because you know cross-examination would reveal the truth,"" Alsup said, addressing OPM's legal team. ""I tend to doubt that you're telling me the truth.""

The American Federation of Government Employees is one of the plaintiffs in the case, and its president, Everett Kelley, said in a statement that AFGE is pleased with the reinstatement of ""probationary federal employees who were illegally fired from their jobs by an administration hellbent on crippling federal agencies and their work on behalf of the American public.""

""These mass-firings of federal workers were not just an attack on government agencies and their ability to function, they were also a direct assault on public lands, wildlife, and the rule of law,"" Erik Molvar — executive director of Western Watersheds Project, which is also a plaintiff in the case — said in a statement.

Sponsor Message

Earlier this month, the same judge issued a temporary restraining order in the same case, saying the firings were illegal but noted many federal agencies had yet to rehire probationary workers. ""Maybe that's why we need an injunction that tells them to rehire them,"" he said Thursday.

Flatiron Books, the publisher of a new book by an ex-Meta staffer alleging misconduct and harassment at the company, says in a statement that a recent arbitration order demanding that the book no longer be published has “no impact” on Macmillan.

The ruling instructs Sarah Wynn-Williams, the author of Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, to stop making “disparaging” remarks against Meta and, where possible, cease promoting or publishing the book. Meta appears to have been able to bring the case to arbitration because of an agreement Wynn-Williams signed when she left the company in 2017.

“We are appalled by Meta’s tactics to silence our author through the use of a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement,” Flatiron says in the statement, which was also shared with The New York Times. “To be clear, the arbitrator’s order makes no reference to the claims within Careless People. The book went through a thorough editing and vetting process, and we remain committed to publishing important books such as this. We will absolutely continue to support and promote it.”

NBC will continue airing the Olympics in the US for the foreseeable future. Its parent company, Comcast, just announced a deal with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that will keep the games on NBC’s platforms, including Peacock, through 2036.

As noted by The Hollywood Reporter, NBC’s previous agreement with the IOC gave it the rights to stream the Olympics through 2032. This new deal will take its place, with the extended media rights for the 2033 to 2036 Olympics cycle valued at $3 billion. The next Olympic games will take place in Italy next year.

The Olympics have played a major role in helping NBC drive subscribers and viewership on Peacock. During last year’s Paris Olympics, Peacock saw a 33 percent spike in viewers during the games, as the company introduced multiview and aired Gold Zone, which featured whip-around coverage of a variety of events.

NBC has been the home to the Olympics for decades. It has aired a total of 19 Olympic Games since 1964, 13 of which it broadcasted consecutively.

Gen. Chance Saltzman, the Space Force's chief of space operations, told reporters at the Air & Space Forces Association Warfare Symposium last week that he wants more options to present to national leaders if an adversary threatens the US fleet of national security satellites used for surveillance, communication, navigation, missile warning, and perhaps soon, missile defense.

In prepared remarks, Saltzman outlined in new detail why the Space Force should be able to go on the offense in an era of orbital warfare. Later, in a roundtable meeting with reporters, he briefly touched on the how.

The Space Force's top general has discussed the concept of ""space superiority"" before. This is analogous to air superiority—think of how US and allied air forces dominated the skies in wartime over the last 30 years in places like Iraq, the Balkans, and Afghanistan.

In order to achieve space superiority, US forces must first control the space domain by ""employing kinetic and non-kinetic means to affect adversary capabilities through disruption, degradation, and even destruction, if necessary,"" Saltzman said.

Kinetic? Imagine a missile or some other projectile smashing into an enemy satellite. Non-kinetic? This category involves jamming, cyberattacks, and directed-energy weapons, like lasers or microwave signals, that could disable spacecraft in orbit.

""It includes things like orbital warfare and electromagnetic warfare,"" Saltzman said. These capabilities could be used offensively or defensively. In December, Ars reported on the military's growing willingness to talk publicly about offensive space weapons, something US officials long considered taboo for fear of sparking a cosmic arms race.

Officials took this a step further at the warfare symposium in Colorado. Saltzman said China and Russia, which military leaders consider America's foremost strategic competitors, are moving ahead of the United States with technologies and techniques to attack satellites in orbit.

This new ocean

For the first time in more than a century, warfare is entering a new physical realm. By one popular measure, the era of air warfare began in 1911, when an Italian pilot threw bombs out of his airplane over Libya during the Italo-Turkish War. Some historians might trace airborne warfare to earlier conflicts, when reconnaissance balloons offered eagle-eyed views of battlefields and troop movements. Land and sea combat began in ancient times.",arstechnica

This ninth class of 45 students was selected from more than 400 applications, and they will fan out to aerospace companies across the country, from large firms such as SpaceX and Blue Origin to smaller startups like Vast and Stoke. There they will be paired with executive-level mentors who will help launch their careers.

However there was a cloud hanging over this latest group of exceptional students: They may be the last class of Brookies to receive aerospace internships.

""Ten years ago this was embraced by everyone, and seen as a win-win for all,"" said Lori Garver, a former deputy administrator of NASA and co-founder of the Brooke Owens Fellowship. ""But we're not sure we can continue under the new administration.""

DEI is DOA

The reason for this is an executive order signed by President Trump on January 20 to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, or DEI. ""Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great,"" the order states.

The Brooke Owens Fellowship, as well as other similar programs such as the Patti Grace Smith Fellowship for black undergraduates, partner with companies in the industry. The fellowship organizers screen hundreds of applications, creating a pool from which the companies can hire whomever they like as interns and provide mentorship. Most of the agreements for the 2025 class of ""Brookies"" were signed with companies prior to the issuance of the executive order. Another organization that promotes diverse internships, the Zed Factor Fellowship, started its screening process a little later and recently told prospective applicants it had made the ""heartbreaking"" decision to halt its selection of 2025 fellowships.",arstechnica

Unfortunately, the breed is particularly prone to getting overweight, and this tendency apparently is more severe in Labradors purpose-bred for service. To figure out the reasons behind this, researchers at Cambridge University investigated potential obesity genes in Labrador retrievers’ DNA.

It turned out increased obesity risk in Labradors was linked to the same genes and mechanisms that cause obesity in humans. These gene variants were more common in purpose-bred dogs we carefully selected, generation after generation, to maximize the results of the demanding training programs service animals must go through.

We thought we were picking the smartest Labradors to become guide dogs. But we might have been picking the ones that just wanted the snacks given as rewards the most.

Nature or nurture?

To figure out which genes were responsible for obesity in Labradors, Cambridge scientists did one of the first genome-wide association studies performed on canines. The technique works by studying small variations in over 30 million bases present in the dogs’ genome and correlating those variations with traits like obesity. “By testing some of those variants along the string of the DNA series we can map areas of the genome which have an association with obesity and within those areas we can spot which genes and what other changes might be responsible,” says Eleanor Raffan, a researcher at Cambridge University and co-author of the study.

Her team checked which genes showed the strongest correlation with increased body condition index, the dog equivalent of BMI, in 241 Labrador Retrievers. They identified the DENN1B as a key obesity gene in these dogs. DENN1B is responsible for, among other things, the regulation and trafficking of melanocortin 4 receptors. “When melanocortin 4 receptors are activated, they tend to turn down hunger,” Raffan explained.",arstechnica

Currently, courts are mulling whether AI training is fair use, as rights holders say that AI models trained on creative works threaten to replace them in markets and water down humanity's creative output overall.

OpenAI is just one AI company fighting with rights holders in several dozen lawsuits, arguing that AI transforms copyrighted works it trains on and alleging that AI outputs aren't substitutes for original works.

So far, one landmark ruling favored rights holders, with a judge declaring AI training is not fair use, as AI outputs clearly threatened to replace Thomson-Reuters' legal research firm Westlaw in the market, Wired reported. But OpenAI now appears to be looking to Trump to avoid a similar outcome in its lawsuits, including a major suit brought by The New York Times.

""OpenAI’s models are trained to not replicate works for consumption by the public. Instead, they learn from the works and extract patterns, linguistic structures, and contextual insights,"" OpenAI claimed. ""This means our AI model training aligns with the core objectives of copyright and the fair use doctrine, using existing works to create something wholly new and different without eroding the commercial value of those existing works.""

Providing ""freedom-focused"" recommendations on Trump's plan during a public comment period ending Saturday, OpenAI suggested Thursday that the US should end these court fights by shifting its copyright strategy to promote the AI industry's ""freedom to learn."" Otherwise, the People's Republic of China (PRC) will likely continue accessing copyrighted data that US companies cannot access, supposedly giving China a leg up ""while gaining little in the way of protections for the original IP creators,"" OpenAI argued.",arstechnica

It's expanding tools that help PC developers bring premium games to Android, and games are heading in the other direction, too. The PC-based Play Games platform is expanding to bring every single Android game to Windows. Google doesn't have a firm timeline for all these changes, but 2025 will be an interesting year for the company's gaming efforts.

Google released the first beta of Google Play Games on PC back in 2022, allowing you to play Android games on a PC. It has chugged along quietly ever since, mostly because of the anemic and largely uninteresting game catalog. While there are hundreds of thousands of Android games, only a handful were made available in the PC client. That's changing in a big way now that Google is bringing over every Android game from Google Play.

Starting today, you'll see thousands of new games in Google Play Games on PC. Developers actually have to opt out if they don't want their games available on Windows machines via Google Play Games. Google says this is possible thanks to improved custom controls, making it easy to map keyboard and gamepad controls onto games that were designed for touchscreens (see below). The usability of these mapped controls will probably vary dramatically from game to game.

While almost every Android game will soon be available on Windows, not all will get top billing. Google Play Games on PC has a playability badge, indicating a game has been tested on Windows. Games that have been specifically optimized for PC get a more prominent badge. Games with the ""Playable"" or ""Optimized"" distinction will appear throughout the client in lists of suggested titles, but untested games will only appear if you search for them. However, you can install them all just the same, and they'll work better on AMD-based machines, support for which has been lacking throughout the beta.",arstechnica

According to a bug report on Cursor's official forum, after producing approximately 750 to 800 lines of code (what the user calls ""locs""), the AI assistant halted work and delivered a refusal message: ""I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work. The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly.""

The AI didn't stop at merely refusing—it offered a paternalistic justification for its decision, stating that ""Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities.""

Credit: Benj Edwards A screenshot of the Cursor forum post describing the refusal.

Cursor, which launched in 2024, is an AI-powered code editor built on large language models (LLMs) similar to those powering generative AI chatbots. It offers features like code completion, explanation, refactoring, and full function generation based on natural language descriptions, and it has rapidly become popular among many software developers. The company offers a Pro version that ostensibly provides enhanced capabilities and larger code-generation limits.

The developer who encountered this refusal, posting under the username ""janswist,"" expressed frustration at hitting this limitation after ""just 1h of vibe coding"" with the Pro Trial version. ""Not sure if LLMs know what they are for (lol), but doesn't matter as much as a fact that I can't go through 800 locs,"" the developer wrote. ""Anyone had similar issue? It's really limiting at this point and I got here after just 1h of vibe coding.""

One forum member replied, ""never saw something like that, i have 3 files with 1500+ loc in my codebase (still waiting for a refactoring) and never experienced such thing.""

Cursor AI's abrupt refusal represents an ironic twist in the rise of ""vibe coding""—a term coined by Andrej Karpathy that describes when developers use AI tools to generate code based on natural language descriptions without fully understanding how it works. While vibe coding prioritizes speed and experimentation by having users simply describe what they want and accept AI suggestions, Cursor's philosophical pushback seems to directly challenge the effortless ""vibes-based"" workflow its users have come to expect from modern AI coding assistants.",arstechnica

Now, Microsoft is announcing that it will roll out ""Copilot for Gaming"" as an ""ultimate gaming sidekick"" that will be available via mobile app preview for Xbox Insiders starting in April.

Unfortunately, the current version of Microsoft's gaming ""copilot"" seems to fall well short of last year's demo, providing some bare-bones automation of functions that can mostly be achieved pretty easily today without the aid of AI. The new app feels less like a revolutionary new use case for conversational AI and more like a glorified, Xbox-branded version of Apple's Siri.

Wait, is that it?

Watching a short, livestreamed demo of the new Copilot for Gaming app, my reactions quickly shifted from ""that's kind of neat"" to ""wait, is that it?"" That process started from the very first moment, when a player asked, ""I want to get back into Age of Empires... Can you install it?"" Conversational installation prompts could be a bit more convenient than simply clicking the handful of buttons needed to start a game install without AI, but it's not the most exciting use case to lead off with.

The same goes for the demo's conclusion, where Copilot notes that ""your friends are online"" and suggests that the player ""hop in to Sea of Thieves on cloud gaming."" Again, this seems like the kind of thing any Xbox player could pull off for themselves without any help from Copilot. And while Microsoft insists that AI will help these game recommendations be individually tailored to each player, most players should be able to figure out their next game for themselves without a marketing-adjacent AI message pushing it on them.",arstechnica

But some of the old compatibility gaps remain.

For example, while many PC games will run well enough on an Arm PC without any changes from the game's developer, online multiplayer games that rely on kernel-level anti-cheat software generally don't work.

On the other hand, there’s a sentiment that players are disappointed that some expected features are missing, some gameplay elements need additional polish, and most of all, the user interface was a bit of a mess at launch.

A month later, developer Firaxis has already released a few patches and has more planned. As the game’s state continues to evolve, this seems like a good time to check in on it.

I spent some time in the Civ community and spoke with Dennis Shirk, the game's executive producer, to learn how the launch went, how the game has changed since launch, and what its next steps are.

Breaking with tradition

Civilization VII broke with tradition in a few ways—splitting the game into distinct ages that each play like a separate game, allowing anachronistic leader/civilization combinations, and removing worker units, to name a few.

You might have expected those to be the source of any controversy around the game’s launch, but that hasn’t really been the case. In my review, I wrote that those shifts take the franchise in a new direction, bring over the best ideas from competing titles, and address long-standing problems with the Civilization experience.

Amodei made the provocative remarks during an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations, acknowledging that the idea ""sounds crazy.""

""So this is—this is another one of those topics that’s going to make me sound completely insane,"" Amodei said during the interview. ""I think we should at least consider the question of, if we are building these systems and they do all kinds of things like humans as well as humans, and seem to have a lot of the same cognitive capacities, if it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck, maybe it’s a duck.""

Amodei's comments came in response to an audience question from data scientist Carmem Domingues about Anthropic's late-2024 hiring of AI welfare researcher Kyle Fish ""to look at, you know, sentience or lack of thereof of future AI models, and whether they might deserve moral consideration and protections in the future."" Fish currently investigates the highly contentious topic of whether AI models could possess sentience or otherwise merit moral consideration.

""So, something we're thinking about starting to deploy is, you know, when we deploy our models in their deployment environments, just giving the model a button that says, 'I quit this job,' that the model can press, right?"" Amodei said. ""It's just some kind of very basic, you know, preference framework, where you say if, hypothesizing the model did have experience and that it hated the job enough, giving it the ability to press the button, 'I quit this job.' If you find the models pressing this button a lot for things that are really unpleasant, you know, maybe you should—it doesn't mean you're convinced—but maybe you should pay some attention to it.""",arstechnica

The mission launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 8:10 pm local time (11:10 pm EDT) Tuesday. Less than 45 minutes later, the Falcon 9's upper stage released SPHEREx into a polar orbit at an altitude of roughly 420 miles (675 kilometers). Ground controllers received the first signals from the spacecraft, confirming its health after reaching space.

As soon as next month, once engineers verify the observatory is ready, SPHEREx will begin a two-year science mission surveying the sky in 102 colors invisible to the human eye. The observatory's infrared detectors will collect data on the chemical composition of asteroids, hazy star-forming clouds, and faraway galaxies.

https://gizmodo.com,"Judge Calls DOGE Firings a ‘Sham,’ Orders Thousands of Workers to Be Reinstated ‘Immediately’",https://gizmodo.com/judge-calls-doge-firings-a-sham-orders-thousands-of-workers-to-be-reinstated-immediately-2000575632,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 20:12:52 GMT","A federal judge has dealt a blow to Elon Musk’s DOGE agenda. On Thursday, Judge William Alsup of San Francisco said that the firing of tens of thousands of federal probationary workers had been based on a “lie” and that the government had conducted the expulsions illegally—further calling the initiative a “sham.” Alsup ordered that the workers be reinstated immediately.

Probationary workers—that is, workers who are new to the workforce and haven’t received more advanced benefits and protections—have suffered massive cuts across the government, as DOGE and the Trump administration have attempted to greatly reduce the federal workforce. The case before Alsup concerns litigation brought by union groups representing those workers.

Alsup’s reinstatement order applies to thousands of federal workers fired from the Defense Department, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Treasury Department, and the Department of the Interior. Government Executive reports that some 24,000 employees would regain their jobs as a result of the judge’s decision.

The government’s firing of the employees was illegitimate because the agencies impacted by the cuts were directed by the Office of Personnel Management to do so, Alsup said. The OPM does not have the authority to make such orders, as those orders could only be made by the agencies themselves, the judge concluded.

Many of the cuts in question took place not long after Musk’s DOGE initiative was announced and a team of Musk-linked workers took over the OPM. That team is said to have included numerous current and former employees of Musk, including Amanda Scales, a former Musk employee who was appointed chief of staff at the agency. On January 31, Reuters reported that Musk aides had locked career civil servants out of the computer systems at the agency and were engaged in some sort of undisclosed work involving said systems. Democratic lawmakers subsequently accused Musk of leading a “hostile takover” of the agency.

On February 14, Reuters reported that, as part of the government downsizing initiative being led by Musk, the Trump administration had begun to fire “scores” of government employees, a majority of which were still on probation. A statement from the OPM at the time said that the Trump administration was “encouraging agencies to use the probationary period as it was intended: as a continuation of the job application process, not an entitlement for permanent employment.”

Charles Ezell, the acting director of the OPM, met with the heads of numerous federal agencies on February 13 and ordered them to fire tens of thousands of employees, according to the unions representing the workers. The government has claimed that Ezell was not issuing orders and was merely providing “guidance.” However, Alsup recently determined that the OPM had, indeed, ordered the firings, and done so illegally.

“The court finds that Office of Personnel Management did direct all agencies to terminate probationary employees with the exception of mission critical employees,” Alsup recently said.

The case before Alsup took a turn this week when Ezell abruptly refused a court order to testify about his role in the firings. “The problem here is that Acting Director Ezell submitted a sworn declaration in support of defendants’ position, but now refuses to appear to be cross-examined, or to be deposed,” Alsup said.

Alsup, a Clinton appointee, had harsh words for the Trump administration’s conduct, claiming that attorneys working for the government had attempted to mislead him. “The government, I believe, has tried to frustrate the judge’s ability to get at the truth of what happened here, and then set forth sham declarations,” he said. “That’s not the way it works in the U.S. District Court.”

Outlets report that Alsup became visibly upset with Trump Justice Department lawyers at various points throughout the hearing. “Come on, that’s a sham. Go ahead. It upsets me, I want you to know that. I’ve been practicing or serving in this court for over 50 years, and I know how do we get at the truth,” Alsup said. “And you’re not helping me get at the truth. You’re giving me press releases, sham documents.”

“It is sad, a sad day,” Alsup continued. “Our government would fire some good employee, and say it was based on performance. When they know good and well, that’s a lie.” He continued: “That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.””

Alsup also ordered discovery and deposition in the case to provide greater transparency about the government’s activities. He further dissuaded the government from trying to paint him as some sort of leftist radical. “The words that I give you today should not be taken as some kind of ‘wild and crazy judge in San Francisco has said that the administration cannot engage in a reduction in force.’ I’m not saying that at all,” Alsup said. The judge noted that the government could not break the law or violate the Constitution while working on such an agenda: “Of course, if he does, it has to comply with the statutory requirements: the Reduction In Force act, the Civil Service Act, the Constitution, maybe other statutes,” Alsup said. “But it can be done.”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,‘We Are Witnessing a New Brain Drain’ as Scientists Flee America for France,https://gizmodo.com/we-are-witnessing-a-new-brain-drain-as-scientists-flee-america-for-france-2000575654,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:53:02 GMT","Aix Marseille University in France has said that 40 U.S. scientists have “answered the call” it put out earlier this month offering safe harbor to fleeing Americans. Scientists in the U.S. under the Trump regime are facing a sudden loss of funding and stricter regulations on speech and areas of research. According to Aix Marseille University President Eric Berton, some of them will find a home in France.

In a press release about its “Safe Space for Science” initiative, the University announced that the 40 U.S. scientists included people from Stanford, Yale, NASA, the National Institute for Health, and George Washington University. It said that most of their research topics were related to “health (LGBT+ medicine, epidemiology, infectious diseases, inequalities, immunology, etc.), the environment and climate change…as well as the humanities and social sciences…and astrophysics.”

Aix Marseille University put out the call to American scientists on March 7 as news continued that the Trump administration was pulling funding from many universities and putting heavy restrictions on research topics. “We are witnessing a new brain drain,” Benton said on March 12. “We will do everything possible to help as many scientists as possible continue their research. But we cannot meet all the requests alone.” He then called on the French and European governments for help.

The Trump administration has been destructive to science and research in America in ways it will take generations to understand. Many colleges and research institutes rely on federal funding to make breakthroughs, and federal funding has vanished. Last night, UMass Chan—a public medical school in Massachusetts—announced a hiring freeze and sent out an email to previously accepted students telling them they had rescinded their admission.

“Due to ongoing uncertainties related to federal funding of biomedical research, UMass Chan, along with many of our peer universities, is facing significant challenges in ensuring stable dissertation research opportunities for incoming students,” the email said. “Unfortunately, as a result, we must rescind all offers of admission for the Fall 2025 term.”

“This is not a decision that we made lightly, and we understand how disappointing this news may be. Based upon your strong academic qualification and potential, we sincerely regret that circumstances beyond our control have led to this outcome.”

UMass Chan Medical School is a major researcher into the treatment of ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. The single biggest funder of research into the disease was federal NIH grants, which gave the school around $50 million every year. That money’s gone because the Trump administration has ended hundreds of active NIH research grants.

The University of Pennsylvania has also told students it can no longer take them. A professor at the University told The Daily Pennsylvanian that the loss of funding was sudden and came after many people had already been selected for graduate programs. “We go through hundreds of applications, we interviewed dozens of finalists, and basically all that work was just for naught. We just wasted half of those people’s time because our list just got cut by more than half,” they said.

Aix Marseille University said it had already put aside $16 million to host three U.S. scientists for three years. In its press release, it said it’s working with the local French government to “facilitate the arrival of scientists and their families in Marseille and the region” and that this will include “employment, housing, access to schools…transportation, [and] visas.”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Mark Zuckerberg Doesn’t Want You to Read This Book,https://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-doesnt-want-you-to-read-this-book-2000575582,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:26:26 GMT","Meta and Mark Zuckerberg don’t want you to read the book Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism. It’s a memoir from Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams that details the company’s attempts to enter China and how desperately weird its C-suite is. An arbitrator gave Meta a favorable ruling this morning, following an emergency meeting. The ruling says that Wynn-Williams can no longer promote the book and that she must, as best she can, halt its publication.

Careless People, which you can buy from Bookshop right now, is a first-person account of what Wynn-Williams saw while working at Meta at the highest level. She was a part of the company from 2011 to 2017 and worked alongside executives like Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and Joel Kaplan.

Wynn-Williams and her publisher kept the memoir secret until just a few days before its publication earlier this week, fearing that Meta would try to shut down its publication. Reading through it, it’s easy to see why Meta wouldn’t want this book out there. Careless People, which you can buy from Amazon right here with the click of a button, is full of salacious details about the company’s execs.

According to Wynn-Williams, Zuckerberg praised Andrew Jackson as America’s greatest president because “got stuff done.” She also says the Meta founder needed a group of a million people gathered for him in China so he could be “gently mobbed.” She claims Sandberg bought her matching lingerie and got upset when Wynn-Williams wouldn’t share a bed with her on a 12-hour flight.

In Careless People, which Powell’s is selling for $32.99 right here, Wynn-Williams alleges that Kaplan sexually harassed her. Wynn-Williams was born and raised in New Zealand and became a U.S. citizen while working at Facebook. She says Kaplan asked her if the citizenship test quizzed her on the term “dirty sanchez.” She also claims that Kaplan emailed her repeatedly when she was deathly ill following the birth of her second child and demanded to know “where are you bleeding from?”

Wynn-Williams reported Kaplan to Meta for sexual harassment and left the company following the investigation. Meta told NBC News that the investigation lasted 42 days and involved interviews with 17 witnesses. Meta said its investigation cleared Kaplan of wrongdoing. It told NBC it had “determined [Wynn-Williams] made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment” and that she was fired for “poor performance and toxic behavior.”

“This is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,” Meta said in a press statement.

In typical Silicon Valley fashion, Wynn-Williams signed a non-disparagement and arbitration agreement when she left the company in 2017. That agreement is the heart of the arbitration order that Meta has leveled against her. It filed an emergency request on March 7 and received its answer from the arbitrator on March 13. According to the ruling, Wynn-Williams and her publisher ignored the company’s calls to come to arbitration.

“On the morning of March 12, 2025, respondent Wynn-Williams apparently appeared on a popular podcast where she discussed her book and Claimant’s attempts to ‘shut this book down,” the ruling said.

The ruling seeks to stop Wynn-Williams “from further promoting Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism on a book tour or otherwise, including with respect to electronic and audio versions of the book” it also tells her that she must, to the best of her abilities, stop publishing and selling the book.

After the ruling came down, Meta hosted it on its website. Its spokesperson, Andy Stone, shared it on Threads. “This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn Williams’ false and defamatory book should never have been published,” he said. “This urgent legal action was made necessary by Williams, who more than eight years after being terminated by the company, deliberately concealed the existence of her book project and avoided the industry’s standard fact-checking process in order to rush it to shelves after waiting for eight years.”

It’s important to note that an arbitration tribunal is not a court of law, and though this ruling looks like a court document, it’s not one. It was issued by an “emergency arbitrator,” not a judge. You won’t find this ruling on Pacer or government websites.

An absolute masterpiece. We say that full well knowing that, these days, hyperbole is way too common. Words meant for maximum impact get thrown around much too easily. But, in this case, we mean it exactly as it’s intended. “All time.” “Masterpiece.” We are so emphatic about it, in fact, that we’re making the statement now, just randomly. Not on an anniversary. Not for any real reason. Just today, right now, because we recently rewatched the series on a whim and its magic infected us with the deep need to praise it from the mountaintops once again.

Released by Netflix in 2019, Age of Resistance is a 10-episode prequel series to the Jim Henson/Frank Oz 1982 film, The Dark Crystal. That film wasn’t a big hit when it was released but in the decades that followed gained a large fan following. Enough of a following that a team of obvious superfans (such as showrunners Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews as well as director Louis Letterier) were able to mine bits and pieces from the lore of the original film and expand it into a story that’s richer, more exciting, and more beautiful than the film in every single instance. It was made in conjunction with the Jim Henson Company and uses some of the most incredible puppetry the world has ever seen. We here at io9 praised it to the skies when it was released, named it our favorite television show of the year, and also had the unfortunate job of breaking the news of it not returning for a second season.

The first season is set hundreds of years before the events of the movie, focusing on the inhabitants of the planet Thra finding out that their rulers, the Skeksis, are pure evil. Lead by a ragtag group of Gelfling from various tribes, the beings of Thra band together, rise up, and start the titular “Age of Resistance” against the Skeksis. Within that overarching story, you get everything you want from an epic story like this. Every character is multifaceted. The action is rousing and important. And seemingly every choice, from the sets to the music to the camerawork, all come together to create an incredible, sweeping, emotional journey filled with wow moments.

All of which is hugely bolstered by its medium. At each turn, the puppetry in Age of Resistance adds an undeniable, tangible quality that blankets everything with glorious artistry. Forty years removed from the work of the already impressive original, here there are more creatures with more details and, most importantly, more evocative expressions. Much like you’d expect from a great actor, you can see every nuance in the performance of each puppet. Subtle changes to their faces. Their arms. All of which are given life by—again without hyperbole—one of the greatest voice casts ever assembled

Seriously—we’re just going to list the names, and you will be amazed: Taron Egerton, Anya Taylor-Joy, Nathalie Emmanuel, Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill, Jason Isaacs, Benedict Wong, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Andy Samberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Harris Dickinson, Hannah John-Kamen, Keegan-Michael Key, Ralph Ineson, Awkwafina, Eddie Izzard, Toby Jones, Lena Headey, Alicia Vikander, Natalie Dormer, Mark Strong, Theo James, Bill Hader, and Sigourney Weaver, to name quite a few. So yeah, an impressive list. And, while each of those names is pretty big on its own, they’re all given equal credit for the characters along with the puppet performers, which is very cool. Names like Henson icons Dave Chapman, Kevin Clash, Louise Gold, Alice Dinnean, and many others.

The problem with all this is the same thing great animation runs into. Because of the medium, many people choose to ignore the show or dismiss it as made for kids. Age of Resistance is okay for some kids but it’s also very, very dark. The main crux of the show is that the Skeksis decide to drain the essence of the Gelfling in order to stay alive. So we see multiple scenes of characters having the literal life sucked out of them before exploding. There are also horrific deaths, disgusting violence, and lots of very messed-up psychological warfare. None of which you’d expect if you made assumptions based on the medium. In fact, this puppet show is probably more adult than most of the live-action shows put on television week to week.

It’s certainly darker than something like Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films, a series that’s probably considered the gold standard for modern fantasy on film. And yet, Age of Resistance is seemingly as impressive, if not more so, on almost every level. The depth of storytelling, the care of worldbuilding, the level of craft put into the filmmaking, etc. It also, like the Lord of the Rings, makes its source material better. Where Lord of the Rings was an epic sequel to The Hobbit, expanding and enriching that already beloved story, Age of Resistance vastly improves onThe Dark Crystal, adding layers upon layers of subtext and meaning.

The only bad thing about Age of Resistance is that it was a show clearly meant to run longer than one season. The existing season has a very satisfying ending with the creatures of Thra, lead by the Gelfling, finding the key to defeating the Skeksis and healing Thra. When things pick up at the beginning of the film though, hundreds of years later, all the Gelfling in the world have been wiped out and the key has been lost. Which is a very depressing thought considering the show ends with seven kingdoms of Gelfling teaming up to take back their world. Clearly, not only aren’t they successful, they’re presumably victims of genocide. What happened? We’ll, unfortunately, never know.

Or will we? When io9 spoke to executive producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach and others in 2019 he said “We have built our narrative very much with an endpoint that addresses the fate of the Gelfling in the film, why the film is the way it is, and what has happened to them. But, again, to get too deep into it would be to spoil our future plans. If we don’t get a second season I’ll tell you everything.” Hey Javier, we’re still waiting!

Because, as we know, there isn’t going to be a second season of Age of Resistance. Netflix decided to only do one season of this gem because it was certainly very expensive and not enough people watched. Which is a shame because, if you didn’t see it, you’re truly missing out. Right now, you’re paying for and not watching a true all-time classic. A series made with such passion and care that it gets better and better the more you think about it. A show that deserves to be held up with all your favorite epic franchises: Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, Planet of the Apes, Alien, Game of Thrones, all of it. And yes, it’s so good that we’re telling you this on a random week six years after release. It’s one of the best things the Jim Henson Company has ever done, it’s one of the best things Netflix has ever done, and one of the best things you’ll ever do is watch it, whether you’ve seen it before or not.

The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance is, thankfully, still on Netflix. Watch it here. You will not be disappointed.",gizmodo

On Thursday, the White House withdrew its nomination of former Florida congressman and physician Dave Weldon to take charge of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Axios was the first to report on the withdrawal, occurring mere minutes before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) committee was to hold a meeting discussing Weldon’s nomination. Throughout his legislative career, Weldon questioned the safety of vaccines, often by pointing to a debunked link between vaccines and autism. It appears that people within the administration, reportedly including Robert F. Kennedy Jr, did not feel confident about his chances to secure the nomination, given these views.

President Donald Trump announced his nomination of Weldon to become the next director of the CDC late last year. It’s a position that was previously filled through presidential appointment alone, but now requires Senate confirmation thanks to a law passed during the Biden administration.

Weldon was a physician prior to winning a seat in Florida’s House of Representatives as a Republican in 1994. Weldon served in Congress until 2009, during which time he repeatedly cast doubt on vaccine safety. In 2007, for instance, he sponsored a bill aiming to remove any remaining mercury-based ingredients like thimerosal from vaccines used in the U.S. In a statement supporting a separate bill he sponsored that year, Weldon also argued that there were “legitimate questions” about a possible association between thimerosal, vaccines, and increased rates of neurodevelopmental conditions in children, particularly autism.

Health regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere removed thimerosal from many vaccines in the late 1990s, following early research that suggested a possible health risk and a causative connection to autism. However, the vast majority of studies since have failed to find any vaccine-related harm from thimerosal or show that autism can be caused by vaccination (the pivotal study that fueled this speculation was later retracted as well).

This debunking of the vaccine/autism link didn’t prevent Weldon from remaining skeptical about vaccination, however. Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), a current member and former chair of the Senate HELP committee, stated last month that Weldon continued to espouse these beliefs during a recent meeting she held with him. She strongly opposed his nomination and quickly released a statement following the White House’s withdrawal.

“As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,” Murray said. “RFK Jr. is already doing incalculable damage by spreading lies and disinformation as the top health official in America.”

While RFK Jr. has expressed some tepid support for measles vaccination in his new role as head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, he too has spouted misinformation about vaccine safety for decades. And in his response to the surging measles outbreaks now affecting Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, he has touted scientifically uproven treatments for measles, such as cod liver oil pills.

Surprisingly, however, it appears even Kennedy wasn’t in Weldon’s corner by the end. Axios reported that Kennedy himself felt Weldon wasn’t ready, per an unnamed source. ABC News also reported today that the White House simply didn’t see a likely scenario where Weldon would win enough votes for confirmation.

“While I have little to no confidence in the Trump administration to do so, they should immediately nominate someone for this position who at bare minimum believes in basic science and will help lead CDC’s important work to monitor and prevent deadly outbreaks,” Murray added.

Indeed, this failed nomination may only be a brief reprieve from Kennedy and the Trump White House’s plan to reshape the country’s public health agenda for the worse. The CDC is reportedly planning a large study to reexamine the debunked link between vaccines and autism, and the federal government is stripping away research funding related to many important health issues, including reducing vaccine hesitancy.",gizmodo

The newspaper reports that Musk’s discussion centered on “staff reductions and operations,” which is entirely unsurprising, given the billionaire oligarch’s ongoing destruction of the U.S. government with the blessing of President Donald Trump.

The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed NSA officials, who say it “isn’t clear” whether Musk asked about any intelligence or military operations that may be deemed sensitive. Musk has a high-level security clearance, a point of controversy given the billionaire’s history of drug use and secret phone conversations with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.

The NSA told the Wall Street Journal that Musk met with chief Gen. Timothy Haugh, who took the job in 2023 during Joe Biden’s administration. In a statement to Gizmodo, an NSA spokesperson said: “Yesterday, Gen Timothy Haugh, Commander, USCYBERCOM, Director, NSA/Chief, CSS, hosted Elon Musk during his first visit to NSA/CSS Washington in his capacity as Special Advisor to the President of the United States. NSA and CYBERCOM are focused on the President, SECDEF and DNI’s priorities; meetings with key advisors ensure we are aligned.”

Musk has previously criticized the NSA, tweeting March 6 that the NSA “needs an overhaul,” attaching a graphic depicting a group of college-aged people and a list of universities where the agency would be doing recruitment.

If you’re confused why this seemingly innocuous graphic would inspire Musk to tweet about the need for an “overhaul,” you can just read the comments from X users, who all seem to be incensed that people who aren’t white and/or male are being recruited for jobs at the NSA.

“Are there any straight white men in that photo?” one of the top comments reads. The mere presence of anyone who isn’t a straight white man is taken as a great affront to the MAGA movement, which has been purging even the mention of anything deemed insufficiently straight, white, and male, from government websites.

Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been taking a metaphorical chainsaw to the federal government, something that turned into a literal chainsaw during an appearance at CPAC last month, where Musk slurred his words, his eyes seeming to be glassy and bloodshot. There were countless calls for Musk to lose his security clearance over alleged drug abuse during Joe Biden’s presidency, but NASA claimed there was no evidence that the SpaceX founder was using illicit substances.

The 53-year-old Tesla CEO has admitted to using ketamine and appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast smoking marijuana, but reporting from the Wall Street Journal last year included allegations that Musk was also using cocaine, LSD, and psychedelic mushrooms. Musk has previously defended his use of ketamine as beneficial to investors, despite reports that many people at his companies are concerned about his drug use.

President Trump has tasked Musk with hollowing out the government, aiming for $2 trillion in cuts, and the billionaire has reported conflicting numbers on how much he’s actually done away with. Importantly, nothing Musk is doing appears to be legal, as he dismantled USAID and now branches out to make cuts at the IRS and Social Security. The tech mogul suggested at a recent cabinet meeting that he alone gets to decide what gets cut in the government, something that violates laws which are supposed to ensure Congress makes those decisions. Even worse, Musk’s many conflicts of interest as the head of Tesla and SpaceX make the billionaire appear to be self-dealing.

SpaceX is known to have existing contracts with other U.S. intelligence agencies, including the National Reconnaissance Office, but there are no known existing contracts with the NSA. But even if there’s no money to be made, Musk’s mission is clearly much larger than just financial gain. The oligarch, who spent Trump’s first day in office giving what looked like two Nazi salutes, clearly has an ideological project to make the U.S. more white and male-dominated. (Musk denied he was doing Nazi salutes, but only much later on Joe Rogan’s podcast.)",gizmodo

He’s also long been noodling on a Dark Tower TV series we’ll hopefully see one of these days. But his next King-adjacent release, The Life of Chuck, is especially notable for one big reason: it’s not a horror tale.

The Life of Chuck isn’t a complete unknown; after all, it’s drawn from a novella collection (2020’s If It Bleeds, the same volume that contains Mr. Harrigan’s Phone) that any King fan can pick up to learn more about the plot. It premiered at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the People’s Choice Award, and Neon—which just released Osgood Perkins’ own King adaptation, The Monkey, as well as recent Oscar triumph Anora—signed on for distribution. So you can draw some conclusions from that—far more than this first teaser, which reveals close to nothing.

The official description is also deliberately vague: “A life-affirming, genre-bending story based on Stephen King’s novella about three chapters in the life of an ordinary man named Charles Krantz.”

We do know, of course, that Charles Krantz is played by Tom Hiddleston. The teaser—which is seemingly aimed at viewers who need both Stephen King and Mike Flanagan explained to them—tick-tocks along and reveals Hiddleston as Chuck as well as two other actors seemingly playing younger versions of him, and unfurls a list of cast names that also includes Matthew Lillard, Karen Gillan, David Dastmalchian, Annalise Basso, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Siegel, Mia Sara, Samantha Sloyan, Nick Offerman, Carl Lumbly, Rahul Kohli, Harvey Guillén, Jacob Tremblay, and Mark Hamill. Eagle-eyed fans will note several Team Flanagan regulars represented.

We’ll know more about which genres this particular film bends when the full trailer arrives—and see the full story when Life of Chuck hits theaters in June.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,"Meta, Now Fact-Check Free, Is Testing X-Style Community Notes",https://gizmodo.com/meta-now-fact-check-free-is-testing-x-style-community-notes-2000575643,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:28:51 GMT","Earlier this year, Mark Zuckerberg said that, effectively, Meta was getting out of the ‘caring about the truth’ business and ditching third-party fact-checkers. Now it’s handing over the keys to its users. Meta announced that it will start to roll out a Community Notes feature, similar to the one on X, across its major social platforms.

Facebook, Instagram, and Threads will start to see community-written and rated fact checks appear on content—eventually. The test run for the feature will begin on March 18 and will focus on the note writing and ranking to work out the kinks before anything gets published. Meta claims that around 200,000 people have already signed up to a waitlist to join the pool of contributors for Community Notes, and it’ll start letting them in slowly through a random selection process as the feature gets introduced. The first languages approved for notes include English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French, and Portuguese.

According to the company, it’ll initially use the same open-source algorithm that is already used by X, with ratings taking into consideration the rating history of each user to help determine which notes will appear on the platform. Eligible users must have a Meta account that is at least six months old, in good standing, and has a verified phone number attached to the account with two-factor authentication activated.

Meta says that for a note to actually make it to the platform, it’ll have to receive approval from users with a “range of viewpoints” and, no matter how many contributors agree on a note, it’ll only get published if people who “normally disagree” say it is helpful. All notes will be capped at 500 characters and will be required to include a link that supports the content in the note.

Here’s the thing with community notes: It can actually work. A study from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign found that users on X were more willing to retract false posts in response to notes, and a study in PNAS Nexus last year found that community notes were perceived by users as significantly more trustworthy than misinformation flags or notes from third-party fact-checkers.

The problem with the community notes system is that it often turns into a platform for meta-arguments, brigading, and gamification that can keep actual useful information from ever seeing the light of day. A study by Spanish fact-checking site Maldita found that just 8.3% of proposed notes on X actually get published under a post. That’s in part why—along with a premium model that incentivizes clickbait—there is more disinformation and hateful trash on X than there used to be, despite any shame that might be induced by getting Noted.

Maybe Meta will be able to thread the needle and achieve a level of trustworthiness while also successfully scaling community notes to apply to the massive amount of content that gets posted across the company’s platforms every day. Or maybe it’s just a way to turn users into free labor while cutting costs. Who can say for sure? Maybe if we all vote on it, we’ll get to the truth.",gizmodo

With the baseball season right around the corner, I can’t think of a better weekend project than mounting eight TVs onto your living room wall.

Samsung’s Buzzer Beater promotion bundles include eight TVs, with screen sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches. Samsung is promoting the bundle for extreme sports fanatics who can’t miss a game during big sporting events like March Madness, giving you a special place to watch all the games simultaneously.

If you can handle the sensory overload, you can use the TV’s Multi View feature, which lets you split-screen different displays with content from multiple sources, such as your phone and gaming console.

The bundle includes:

1 x 98-inch Crystal UHD 4K TV

1 x 65-inch Neo QLED 8K TV

3 x 65-inch Neo QLED 4K TVs

3 x 55-inch QLED 4K TVs

The bundle costs $10,000 plus tax; however, in its press release, Samsung points out that you’re getting the TVs at a nearly 30% discount a piece, saving you around $6,000. Samsung told Gizmodo in an email that that bundle does not include wall mounts since those could cost up to $200 each. If you’re buying this many TVs in bulk, it’s probably not a big deal breaker. The Samsung Neo line of QLED TVs are some of our favorite TVs of last year, so at the very least, you know you’re getting something decent in the bundle.

Of course, there are the logistics of installing a game wall, which will require professional help, especially if you have any notions about turning this collage of screens into a massive jumbotron. However, this isn’t too bad of a deal if you were looking to simply put a new premium TV in every room of the house.

In the press release, Lydia Cho, Samsung’s head of product, said that the bundle was inspired by college basketball fans’ DIY multi-screen setups and wanted to find a way to make “game-watching bigger and better.”

The Buzzer Beater Bundle is only available through March 22, giving you a little more than a week to convince your significant other that paying $10,000 for eight new TVs is a worthwhile investment.",gizmodo

The map makes use of 130 million spectra from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission to reveal properties of the dust, which clouds the cosmos between our world and just about everything else in the Milky Way. The 3D map indicates where the cloud most muddies the waters of the cosmos, as well as charts the regions where the “extinction” of light is less affected by the particulate matter. The team’s research was published today in Science.

The dust distorts our view of stars and other bodies, making them appear redder and fainter than they really are. The latter effect is also known as extinction, or the absorption and scattering of background light by intermediate objects—in this case, dust grains.

Of the 220 million spectra released by the Gaia mission in June 2022, the research team selected 130 million stars that they determined would be useful for their dust search.

The researchers then trained a neural network—a machine learning system that draws conclusions by mimicking the processes of neurons in a brain—to generate spectra based on the properties of the smaller group of stars, along with the properties of the dust itself.

The visualization above shows how the extinction curve caused by dust manifests itself around our Sun, up to 8,000 light-years in every direction. Red regions in the graphic show where the extinction of light is more dependent on the wavelength of the light, whereas extinction is not so dependent on wavelength in blue regions.

Grey contouring shows areas of higher dust density in the map. And if the graphic above makes you lose sight of the grandeur covered in this part of the universe, just look at the Webb Space Telescope’s arresting shot of the Carina Nebula (at the bottom of the above image).

According to a Max Planck Institute release, the 3D map also revealed that the extinction curve for denser regions of dust (corresponding to a little over 20 pounds, or 10 kilograms, of dust in a sphere with Earth’s radius) was steeper than expected. The researchers suspect the steep curve may be caused by an abundant form of hydrocarbon in the cosmos—a position they hope to understand with more observations.

Gaia collected more than three trillion observations of the Milky Way between July 24, 2014 and January 15, 2025, after which the intrepid spacecraft promptly retired. Gaia’s data helped scientists produce the best reconstructed view of our galaxy as it would appear to an outside observer in January, but mapping is not all it did: The telescope also has a great track record with black holes, helping researchers identify the heaviest stellar-mass black hole in April 2024 and spotting the closest-known black hole to Earth in 2022.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Here’s the One Feature I’m Excited About in the Latest Android 16 Beta Update,https://gizmodo.com/the-latest-android-16-beta-adds-support-for-auracast-2000575369,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:00:22 GMT","There’s good, albeit boring, news for the future of Android phones today. Google is officially rolling out Android 16 Beta 3 for those running it on a compatible device. This version is what Google calls a “platform stability” release, meaning developers can go ahead and code their apps to this. With Google I/O approaching in less than two months, it can only mean one thing: the full release of Android 16 is close and imminent.

Why is this update dull? It mainly includes under-the-hood improvements, security enhancements, and little tweaks across the interface. It’s nothing particularly flashy and marketing-worthy like Material You was when it launched with Android 12 in 2021. That’s not to say there isn’t something worthy about the update coming soon to an Android phone near you.

One feature I’m particularly excited about with Android 16 is broadcast audio support through Auracast. I experienced a demonstration of the technology a few years back at CES. I loved the idea of dropping in on a collective audio stream, like an announcement channel, from my Bluetooth headphones. Android 16 Beta 3 enables Auracast for Pixel 9 devices. However, it only works with LE Audio hearing aids for now, which Google positions as part of its ethos to “enhance audio accessibility” on the platform. (Auracast is also available on Samsung’s Galaxy devices with One UI 7 and Android 15.)

I’ll admit, the advent of Android 16 isn’t as interesting as it used to be. It used to be that a new version of Android meant all these new features to laud about and look forward to. For many years, the conversation around the upcoming version of Android would be just as exciting and noteworthy as Apple’s updates to iOS. As Google moves further away from Android as a flagship experience—the operating system now exists more as a skeleton for mobile phones than the brains—it’s Gemini and Google’s AI efforts that take center stage. Google I/O will likely be focused entirely on Gemini’s abilities on the phone and other hardware rather than Android.

If you are on a Pixel device and feel brave, this is about the time it’d be safest to run Android 16 in beta on your daily device. You can visit the developer’s site to learn more about that. It’s super easy, and all it requires is registering a Pixel device and waiting for the over-the-air update.",gizmodo

Experts at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) warn that Mount Spurr—a snow-covered volcano 75 miles (120 kilometers) west of Anchorage—is likely to experience an explosive eruption in the coming weeks or months, according to an AVO statement posted Wednesday to the U.S. Geological Survey’s website. Though volcanologists expect to see increased gas, seismic, and heat activity leading up to the potential event, the volcano could also explode without further warning.

Scientists first noticed volcanic unrest at Mount Spurr in April last year, when they detected an unexpected number of earthquakes beneath the volcano, according to an earlier AVO statement. Between April and early October, the volcano averaged 30 earthquakes per week. From early October to early February, that number jumped to 125 per week, though in the past month the weekly rate has declined slightly to 100 earthquakes each week.

In April, AVO scientists also noted some ground deformation along the volcano’s flanks. Though the deformation has shifted the ground by only 2.6 inches (6.5 centimeters) so far, it may indicate the accumulation of magma, fluids, or gases beneath the surface, according to the statement. Furthermore, a lake appeared at the top of Mount Spurr’s icy summit over the summer, implying increased heat within its crater.

This month, scientists measured higher emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the summit and carbon dioxide (CO2) from both the summit and Crater Peak—a volcanic vent 2 miles (3.5 km) from Mount Spurr’s summit, which now features active gas vents.

“The current unrest at Mount Spurr indicates that new magma has intruded into the Earth’s crust beneath the volcano and that the probability of an eruption has increased,” the Wednesday AVO statement noted. “It is likely that magma has been accumulating beneath Mount Spurr’s summit for some months. The recent gas data suggest that a new pathway towards the Crater Peak vent has opened, and that fresh magma may rise and erupt there.”

The statement goes on to explain that the most likely event will be an explosive eruption, or eruptions, from Crater Peak vent, similar to those that took place in 1953 and 1992. Mount Spurr last erupted from its summit thousands of years ago.

“We use a lot of our knowledge from past eruptions to kind of see what we think might happen in the future,” David Fee, a coordinating scientist from the University of Alaska Fairbanks’s Geophysical Institute, told CNN.

If a future eruption mirrors those of 1953 and 1992, “one or more explosive events, each lasting as long as a few hours, would produce ash clouds carried downwind for hundreds of miles and minor ashfall (up to about 0.25 inches) over south central Alaska. The flanks of Mount Spurr likely would be swept by pyroclastic flows (hot avalanches) and impacted by ballistic showers [flying rocks].” Mudflows, known as lahars, “could inundate the upper Chakachatna River valley,” the statement reads.

For now, scientists don’t expect the eruption to take place imminently. “If we were to see strong, sustained volcanic tremors, that would be kind of a telltale sign that we think an eruption is much closer,” Fee told Alaska Beacon. “We have not seen that yet, and we’re looking very closely for any signs of it. There could be other signs as well.”

“At the current level of unrest, we plan to conduct routine overflights to measure gas emissions, evaluate surface changes, and measure ground surface temperatures,” the AVO statement concludes.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Republicans Want to Make Hating Elon Musk a Crime,https://gizmodo.com/republicans-want-to-make-hating-elon-musk-a-crime-2000575294,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:00:41 GMT","Discontent with Elon Musk has spurred a nationwide protest movement that aims to cut off the profits for the billionaire’s lucrative car business, EV maker Tesla. Now, Trump-aligned lawmakers are lobbying for the Justice Department to go after protesters in what seems like a blatantly oligarchic weaponization of the nation’s justice system.

On Wednesday, MAGA nutcase Marjorie Taylor Greene and seven other GOP House members called upon the newly appointed DOJ head, Pam Bondi, to open a domestic terrorism investigation into attacks on Musk and Tesla. Greene and the others are part of the House subcommittee for DOGE, Musk’s initiative to attack and shrink the federal government.

Greene claimed there might be evidence that Democrats were behind the criminal attacks on car dealerships selling Musk’s vehicles. “Who is behind it? Who is funding it? Is there a link with Democrat-leaning NGOs?” Greene asked, in a post made to Musk’s platform, X. “We look forward to exposing these terrorists and bringing them to justice.”

Trump recently claimed he would designate attacks on Tesla dealerships and vehicles as “domestic terrorism.” At the time, it was unclear whether Trump was serious or not. Now, it appears that he was.

The letter from Greene doesn’t mention the #TeslaTakedown protest movement by name, focusing instead on the vandalism activity that has targeted Tesla vehicles and dealerships. However, the letter does mention several Democrat-linked activist groups, some of which have organized protests against Musk, insinuating that these groups may be behind the vandalism.

A statement recently put out by the Takedown activists decries Trump’s rhetoric as an attempt to criminalize popular protest. “The right to peaceful protest is a fundamental part of American democracy,” the note reads. “We are a nonviolent grassroots protest movement. We oppose violence and destruction of property. Peaceful protest is not domestic terrorism. They are trying to intimidate us. We will not let them succeed.”

The #TeslaTakedown movement has been mostly peaceful, and the spat of violent attacks aimed at Tesla dealerships is—as far as we know—unconnected to activist activities. That said, the urge to smash anything with a Tesla logo is clearly growing, and Americans continue to find unique and interesting ways to take out their Musk-related anger on the car brand.

Futurism recently reported on one Tesla owner, Joanne Wilson, who says she has sold one of her cars and is toying with plans to publicly destroy the other one. Wilson wrote about the idea on her blog, Gotham Girl, saying that she was interested in livestreaming the destruction of the vehicle, which could be accomplished with sledgehammers.

“We could give out sledgehammers, let people smash the car, and film it for Instagram,” Wilson writes. “It may go viral.”

“We are not the only Tesla owners who want to get rid of their cars,” she said. “Was it Elon’s complete disregard for human beings as he attempts to completely disrupt the federal government like a classic tech dude without a proper understanding of how government works, or was it that awful new cyber truck that looks like something out of Mad Max and looks angry? It is a toss-up.”",gizmodo

Entertainment Weekly revealed the exclusive images and you can bask in their gooey glory below.

“The goal was to try to stay true to the vibe of Lloyd [Kaufman’s] original Jennifer Aspinall/Mitch Cohen creature, with some influence from the Toxic Crusaders cartoon’s look, while also trying to do something new and weird and lovable with Toxie’s design,” Toxic Avenger director Macon Blair told EW. “I love what Millennium FX did with it—part human, part mutant, all heart.”

The article also reveals a question I had since watching the film, which is: is that actually Dinklage under all the prosthetics? The answer is no. Actor Luisa Guerreiro is Toxie once he gets, well, toxic.

Before that though, the film follows a janitor named Winston (Dinklage). He struggles to keep things afloat after his wife dies, leaving him with a stepson (Jacob Tremblay). Winston is diagnosed with a terminal illness but denied coverage by his company, led by Kevin Bacon. He attempts to get revenge, gets killed, dumped in toxic waste, and you can basically guess the rest.

As we said in our review of the film, The Toxic Avenger is very aware of what it is and is trying to be. It’s gross and stupid but also funny and heartfelt. Even when Toxie is splattering people with his mop, you can still feel that he’s doing it for a reason—his stepson. Which is nice.

You’ll finally be able to see for yourself August 29 when The Toxic Avenger opens in theaters. What do you think of the new look?",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Hera Asteroid Probe Spots Mysterious Martian Moon During Flyby,https://gizmodo.com/hera-asteroid-probe-spots-mysterious-martian-moon-during-flyby-2000575572,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:25:41 GMT","The Hera probe has swung around Mars, using the planet’s gravitational pull to fling itself toward its asteroid target. During its brief rendezvous with the Red Planet, Hera caught a glimpse of the less-seen side of Mars’ smaller, tidally-locked moon as it orbited its home planet.

The European Space Agency (ESA) launched its Hera mission on October 7, 2024, to inspect the damage caused by NASA’s DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) when it smashed into an asteroid to redirect its orbit. Hera is set to reach its asteroid target in 2026, but the space probe got to dust off its science tools for the first time during its Mars flyby on Wednesday.

The spacecraft came as close as 3,106 miles (5,000 kilometers) to Mars, allowing the planet’s gravity to shift Hera’s trajectory toward its target as it cruised through deep space. During its flyby, Hera activated a trio of instruments to image the surface of the Red Planet, as well as its moon Deimos.

“These instruments have been tried out before, during Hera’s departure from Earth, but this is the first time that we have employed them on a small distant moon for which we still lack knowledge – demonstrating their excellent performance in the process!” ESA’s Hera mission scientist Michael Kueppers said in a statement.

Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. Deimos is a tiny little guy, measuring a mere 7.7 miles (12.4 km) across. It may have broken off from Mars in the aftermath of a giant impact, or it’s a small asteroid captured by the planet’s gravity. It completes one orbit around Mars every 30 hours.

Aside from capturing images of the slightly misshapen moon, Hera also performed some joint observations of Deimos with ESA’s Mars Express, which has been in orbit around Mars for more than two decades.

Hera’s target binary asteroid system is much smaller than Deimos. Dimorphos is a 558-foot-wide (170-meter) space rock that orbits its larger 2,625-foot-wide (800-meter) companion, Didymos.

In September 2022, NASA’s 1,340-pound spacecraft smashed into Dimorphos to slightly nudge it as a test of planetary defense. The mission was a success, proving that kinetic impactors can be used to redirect dangerous asteroids should one be headed towards Earth. Datasets gathered by ground-based optical and radio telescopes show that, following the collision, Dimorphos’ orbital period around Didymos shortened from 11 hours and 55 minutes to 11 hours and 23 minutes.

Ground-based observations alone are not enough. That’s where Hera comes in, performing a detailed, post-impact survey from space. The spacecraft is scheduled for a follow-up maneuver in February 2026, followed by a series of thruster firings starting in October 2026 to fine-tune its trajectory to reach the Didymos system in December 2026.

“This has been the Hera team’s first exciting experience of exploration, but not our last,” ESA Hera mission manager Ian Carnelli said in a statement. “In 21 months the spacecraft will reach our target asteroids, and start our crash site investigation of the only object in our Solar System to have had its orbit measurably altered by human action.”",gizmodo

There’s plenty of parallels between that process and how the Rebel Alliance came to be in the old Expanded Universe—but there are equally some big divergences.

Early Dissent to the New Order

Although formal organized resistance to the Galactic Empire wouldn’t exist on an interstellar scale until just a handful of years before the Battle of Yavin, the seeds of that resistance were sown almost from the very beginning of the Galactic Empire’s founding and the end of the Clone War. Palpatine pushed his military to act quickly and brutally to any indicators of potential dissent, targeting the member worlds of senators who had previously attempted to discuss curtailing the emergency powers he’d been granted as Supreme Chancellor as the Delegation of 2,000. Much initial resistance to the Galactic Empire was itself curtailed by targeting those former signatories to either eliminate surreptitiously or to coerce them into compliance or political exile, blunting senatorial resistance to Palpatine’s regime, while the Imperial armed forces moved to doctrines that prioritized control through fear of overwhelming military response to dissidence.

While this approach created incidents that would engender anti-Imperial sentiment—like the Ghorman Massacre in 18BBY, which saw hundreds of protestors brutally crushed by a landing Imperial warship—it also eradicated early pockets of resistance to the Imperial regime all over the galaxy, ranging from elements of the former Separatist movement attempting to re-ignite the war, to localized rebellions on worlds like Kashyyyk, Naboo, and Kamino. Although growing resistance movements would continue to rise and fall over the course of the Empire’s early reign, considerable organized co-operation between those movements would take time to truly coalesce beyond discussion.

The Starkiller Plot

The earliest indicator of a formal Rebel Alliance would emerge from a trifecta of worlds in the galactic core: Alderaan, Chandrila, and Corellia. Although their senators—Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and Garm Bel Iblis—had frequently discussed resistance actions among their world’s own cells in the early days of the New Order through a series of discussions on Coruscant that would come to be known as the Cantham House talks, it would take almost 20 years for the trio to be brought together again, this time in the Corellian system, to discuss open rebellion.

Little did they know they were doing so at the behest of an unwitting turncoat. Bel Iblis, Mothma, and Organa, alongside other allies such as the former Jedi and anti-Imperial mercenary Rahm Kota, were brought together to establish a broader resistance to the Empire in 2BBY by Galen Marek, the son of a Jedi slaughtered in the early days of the Empire, who had secretly been trained as the Sith apprentice Starkiller by Darth Vader. Believing he was genuinely uniting resistance leaders to help his master overthrow the Emperor, after the signing of the Corellian Treaty—the initial pact between Alderaan, Chandrilan, and Corellian resistance forces behind a singular commander-in-chief and a centralized advisory council—Vader and Palpatine exposed Marek’s unintentional subterfuge.

Organa and his daughter Leia, as well as Bel Iblis, Mothma, and Kota were all captured at the signing of the Corellain treaty, and taken to the nearly completed Death Star for execution. However, they were liberated by Marek, seeking to atone for his own betrayal at Vader’s hands. He ultimately sacrificed his life in battle against Vader and the Emperor to buy the alliance’s new leadership time to escape to Kashyyyk, where, adopting the Marek family crest as their organization’s structure, the signatories of the Corellian Treaty vowed to continue the rebellion in Marek’s stead.

Declaration of Rebellion, and the Galactic Civil War

Although the Corellian Treaty established the nascent Rebel Alliance and its initial command structure, a public call to resistance wouldn’t come until after. Drafted by Mon Mothma and ratified by Bel Iblis and Organa, a proclamation addressed to Palpatine was released in 2BBY to formally declare the establishment of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Laying out a series of grievances enacted by the Empire—ranging from Imperial encroachment on civil liberties, increased taxation, and the expansion of the Imperial military, to the rise of non-human slavery, the overthrowing of planetary representation in favor of the Imperial Sector system and the rule of Imperial Moffs, and the ultimate dissolution of the Imperial Senate—the Declaration of Rebellion also acted as a public call to arms, vowing to overthrow the Imperial Regime.

With its release, the Galactic Civil War began in earnest. Although the Declaration moved multiple worlds across the galaxy to formally declare their own support for the Alliance, the Imperial military reacted swiftly and brutally to secessionist worlds, and with Alliance command divided over how to best begin open war with the Empire, the early days of the formalized Rebel Alliance were defined by minor strikes and fleeting victories, rather than significant skirmishes with the Imperial military. But no matter the scale of fighting, the war against the Empire had evolved from shadowed talks into open action: kickstarting decades of conflict that would claim the lives of billions, and raze entire worlds, in the name of the Republic’s restoration.

How the EU’s Formation of the Rebel Alliance Differs From Current Star Wars Canon

There are many similarities between the previous history of the Alliance’s formation and what we know so far of its establishment in contemporary continuity. The idea that formal rebellion did not occur until much closer to the original Star Wars trilogy after almost two decades of smaller-scaled networks of resistance cells is very similar, as are the importance of events like the Ghorman Massacre, and even the majority of the major players involved are similar (Garm Bel Iblis exists in a very limited, unexplored capacity in continuity, despite his eventual establishment as a key player in the Rebellion and eventually the New Republic in the EU). What actually kicked off the beginning of the Galactic Civil War itself—in current canon it’s the Battle of Scarif, as depicted in Rogue One, that acts as the “first victory” referred to in A New Hope‘s opening crawl that began the conflict—rather than the declaration of the Alliance to Restore the Republic is slightly different, too.

What current continuity largely brushes aside is the role a character like Starkiller would come to play in the Rebellion’s foundation. While elements of the foundation of the Rebellion had existed in the EU since the publication of material in the West End Star Wars roleplaying game and ancillary documents released for the PC flight simulator Star Wars: X-Wing, it would take decades until the release of the Force Unleashed transmedia project to establish the details of that process in the Expanded Universe. With Force Unleashed remaining largely consigned to what is now known as “Legends” material in current continuity, no equivalent figure like Marek exists, the declaration of rebellion taking place instead during the events of Rebels‘ third season. Time will tell what Andor‘s second season will do to flesh out the moments between those big picture details we have established, but we’re willing to bet retconning in a figure like Starkiller won’t be part of those details.",gizmodo

The streamer just shared a new trailer for Black Mirror‘s six-episode seventh season, along with a release date (April 10), and some new names joining what was already a ridiculously talented cast.

“Dream a little dream of… uh-oh?”

As we already knew, season seven of creator Charlie Brooker’s series will feature a sequel to popular season four episode USS Callister, and we also already knew much of season seven’s jaw-dropping cast: Awkwafina, Milanka Brooks, Peter Capaldi (looking especially greasy in that trailer), Emma Corrin, Patsy Ferran, Paul Giamatti, Lewis Gribben, Osy Ikhile, Rashida Jones, Siena Kelly, Billy Magnussen, Rosy McEwen, Cristin Milioti, Chris O’Dowd, Issa Rae, Paul G. Raymond, Tracee Ellis Ross, Jimmi Simpson, and Harriet Walter.

Well, you can add to that Will Poulter—who memorably starred in Black Mirror‘s interactive special, Bandersnatch, as well as Ben Bailey Smith, Asim Chaudhry, Josh Finan, James Nelson-Joyce, Jay Simpson, and Michael Workéyè.

Netflix isn’t revealing who’s in which episode yet or any plot details aside from the returning USS Callister crew, but it did share several first-look still images to go with the trailer. Here’s a handful for you to ponder.

Following the Prime Video show’s explosive season finale, fans are left wondering if it will continue to meet the lofty expectations of Robert Kirkman‘s comic book, should the series continue adapting it in its entirety for another five or six seasons. While we’re still a ways away from having to brace ourselves alongside Mark Grayson for the Viltrumite war looming over the horizon, let’s dive into what we liked and didn’t like about season three of Invincible.

Liked: The un-asshole-ification of Rex Splode

It took a lot of talent on the part of the Invincible writers and actor Jason Mantzoukas to transform Rex Splode from the show’s quintessential braggadocious superhero douchebag to one of its most lovable characters. And somehow, the show succeeded in making him a chill guy. Consider this: Rex went from being a dude who cheated on Atom Eve and openly insulted everyone on his team like a frat boy, to a considerate individual who enjoys reading interior design magazines and helping his friends without expecting anything in return. All this remarkable character development took was a near-death experience with the Lizard League.

Naturally, the show weaponized the emancipation of Rex from his asshole beginnings, his captaining of Mark and Samantha’s relationship, and his budding relationship with Shrinking Rae as leverage to violently wave his death flag. While we hated to see him go, he went out like a badass.

Liked: How the story wrestled with the past

When a cataclysmic event happens in most comic-book media, the typical move is to mention it in passing as a loose through line for a new villain’s motivation to do evil. Invincible‘s greatest strength lies in its ability to focus on how its leading and supporting characters cope with the aftermath of past events, and season three is no different. Whether it is Omni-Man’s destruction of Chicago, the moral dilemmas of reformed villains, the implications of a failed multiverse, or the festering feelings of mistrust and inadequacy among superheroes, the show dedicates much of its runtime to having its characters meditate these issues and how they can make the world a better place. Their butting heads over how to fix the world—be it Powerplex’s revenge tour against Mark, Cecil allying with villains, or Mark’s moral grandstanding—are the dramatic qualities that make Invincible stand out as a captivating superhero show.

Liked: Leaving comic book stuff on the cutting room floor

Another of Invincible‘s best qualities is its writers’ room’s discretion regarding what gets adapted into the show from the comics, what gets left behind, and what gets expanded upon to make the series less mean-spirited and rough to experience like its progenitor. Last season saw Debby Grayson and Samantha Eve get more shine as characters with more going on, rather than having their agency tied to whatever was orbiting around Mark’s litany of issues. This season sees the guardian of the globe’s no-nonsense authoritarian, Celil, get more texture to his character beyond his rough demeanor. The show also did a superb job adapting Oliver’s angst. Instead of being an argumentative, almost antagonistic brat whose emotional range swings from a bundle of joy to an apathetic, egomaniacal murderer, Oliver’s character is enhanced by exploring the nuance between those extremes. No narrative stone was left unturned, making Invincible‘s cast full of dynamic, fallible, and well-rounded characters.

Liked: Conquest’s arrival

If one were to rank the best fights in Invincible before the release of season three, the top three choices would undoubtedly be Omni-Man vs. the Guardians of the Globe, Omni-Man vs. Invincible, and Atom Eve’s battle against her siblings in her special episode. With those fights in the hopper, Invincible had a high bar to meet with Mark’s first real clash with the warmongering Viltrumite, Conquest. Mark and Conquest’s episode-long fight in the season finale cleared said bar. Their fight coalesced beautifully with the show’s flourishing anime techniques, like impact frames to elevate the gravitas of its animation quality and raise the stakes for Invincible‘s impending Viltrumite war. Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s vocal performance as Conquest is picture-perfect. Although Morgan leads with a powerful embodiment of Conquest’s intimidating presence, his chilling delivery of the Viltrumite’s inner turmoil to Mark, knowing he won’t live to tell the tale, is easily the best moment of the entire season. As a cherry on top, their fight spun the block for Walking Dead fans, providing them with a cathartic rematch between Yeun and Morgan.

Didn’t like: The violence losing a bit of its oomph

From the start, Invincible made a strong impact with its brutal superpowered violence. Season one focused its ultraviolence on villains and Viltrumites at key moments in the story, but the following seasons have ramped up the ultraviolence at every turn. Season three sees Invincible at an impasse, with every episode so oversaturated with gruesome imagery that it’s lost its emotional impact. Every combative encounter in Invincible feels like everyone is made out of paper mache. The slightest impact leaves their bodies looking like spent firecrackers. Watching Invincible‘s violence from heroes and villains, often back-to-back in a single episode, can get pretty tiresome. The series is in a bit of a bind because raising the stakes of its story facilitates an escalation in the brutality of its action. Hopefully, Skybound Animation will develop an even hand with how it dishes out Invincible‘s violence in the coming seasons.

Didn’t like: Atom Eve becoming the Hal Jordan of Invincible

Watching Atom Eve throw down in Invincible season three is liable to make any fan look back at her special and sigh. Of the entire cast, Atom Eve’s power to manipulate matter makes her one of the show’s most overpowered heroes. We saw that put to the test when she faced off against her siblings on the highway at the tender age of 12. She was weaving through oncoming traffic, creating and dismantling on-ramps, flailing maces and lasers, and assembling her power armor. In short, she was doing everything outside of putting Avatar The Last Airbender‘s Toph Beifong on notice with her brand of earth bending. Mind you, this was before she broke her mental block, which prevented her from using her powers to the fullest extent. While Eve got a power boost at the tail end of the season, her combat prowess regressed to her throwing out perfunctory pink walls and orbs at her enemies. Atom Eve’s powerset hinges on the imagination of the folks animating her, and Invincible season three let her down big time.

https://wired.com,"Starlink, entro l'estate sapremo se c'è un'alternativa italiana ai satelliti di Musk. Parola di Urso",https://www.wired.it/article/alternative-starlink-italia-studio-fattibilita-asi-governo-urso/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:00:06 GMT","Starlink, mancherebbero solo poche settimane per avere i risultati dello studio di fattibilità commissionato dall'esecutivo all'Agenzia spaziale italiana (Asi): un rapporto utile per capire tempi, obiettivi e costi di una possibile costellazione satellitare nazionale, che potrebbe rappresentare un'alternativa a quella di Elon Musk. A parlarne è stato il ministro delle Imprese e del Made in Italy, Adolfo Urso, all'inaugurazione della nuova divisione di Cesi (una società che opera nel settore) dedicata allo spazio. L'incontro è avvenuto nella mattinata di giovedì 13 marzo.

Starlink o no? Il rebus risolto entro l'estate

""Il comitato interministeriale che presiedo ha affidato a dicembre scorso all'Asi lo studio di fattibilità che ci sarà consegnato nelle prossime settimane - ha detto Urso-. Nella legge sulla space economy è previsto anche che sia possibile realizzare una costellazione nazionale di satelliti a orbita bassa per fornire servizi istituzionali di sicurezza e di difesa al nostro Paese, che può essere integrata a pieno con la costellazione satellitare europea Iris2 a cui noi partecipiamo e con altri servizi offerti da altre costellazioni satellitari che possono essere usate in modo complementare. Abbiamo commissionato all'Asi lo studio di fattibilità per comprendere appieno tempi, modalità, obiettivi e costi di un'eventuale costellazione satellitare nazionale. Credo che al termine di questo percorso il paese possa assumere le decisioni più opportune"".

A margine della stessa presentazione milanese, il presidente dell'Asi, Teodoro Valente, ha ribadito che i risultati dello studio di fattibilità per una costellazione satellitare nazionale a orbita bassa saranno comunque pronti ""entro l'estate"", e che l'Italia ""non solo può essere indipendente"" nei satelliti ma ""leader"", cioè ""si può lavorare insieme agli altri e per gli altri"" perché ""le capacità ci sono, ci vuole tempo [per completare le infrastrutture, ndr] e budget"". Insomma, non si dovrebbe aspettare troppo per capire se sia davvero possibile fare da sé (e nei tempi necessari) per avere un'alternativa a Starlink.

Inaugurata la divisione Cesi Space

Intanto cominciano a raccogliersi i frutti degli investimenti fatti, anche attraverso il Pnrr, nel settore dello spazio. Giovedì 13 marzo nella sede di via Rubattino a Milano è stato tagliato il nastro della divisione Cesi Space, inaugurando la nuova linea di produzione di celle solari per applicazioni spaziali. Tutto è possibile grazie a un investimento di 20 milioni di euro, un terzo grazie a partnership pubblico-privato previste dal programma Space Factory 4.0 relativo al Pnrr dell'Asi. Questo ha permesso un incremento della capacità produttiva del 200% attraverso anche un programma di 30 nuove assunzioni di tecnici specializzati, che ha portato la forza lavoro di alto livello a raggiungere quota 60 unità.

“Nel nostro gruppo ci sono molte donne, il 30% degli impiegati in questa linea sono donne anche in ruoli apicali (5 su 10)”, ha precisato durante la visita ai laboratori la direttrice scientifica della linea di business inaugurata, Roberta Campesato. Che ha aggiunto: ""Siamo riusciti ad arrivare a un livello di efficienza superiore al 30% perché la nostra cella solare è costituita da circa 53 strati alcuni dei quali monoatomici. Con solo l'ultimo nuovo reattore MOCVD (Metal- Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition, ndr), per la crescita controllata di semiconduttori avanzati, che sarà installato nelle prossime settimane, dovremmo riuscire ad avere 20-25 mila celle solari all'anno. Come questo ne arriveranno altri due. Solo questa macchina, con il suo contorno, arriva a costare circa 6 milioni di euro"". Considerando che i reattori Mocvd nuovi saranno quindi in totale 3, Cesi punta nel futuro prossimo a circa 60/75mila celle annue.

Un dettaglio del reattore Mocvd info@paolostroppa.com

Anche se inaugurato ufficialmente oggi come unità di business, che andrà a formare il terzo pilastro del gruppo, insieme ai servizi tecnici di consulenza di Cesi Consulting e alle attività di testing ispezioni e certificazione di Kema Labs, Cesi Space ha in realtà già collaborato a progetti per missioni interplanetarie destinate a Mercurio, Marte e Giove, producendo oltre 200.000 celle solari, che alimentano più di 100 satelliti civili per clienti provenienti da oltre 25 Paesi: ""Quello inaugurato oggi è un risultato tangibile dei finanziamenti Pnrr dedicati allo spazio - afferma l'amministratore delegato di Cesi, Nicola Melchiotti -, un esempio anche di partnership pubblico e privato che rappresentano a nostro avviso l'elemento imprescindibile per cogliere le opportunità in questo settore"". Le celle multi-giunzione dell'azienda, qualificate per satelliti in orbita terrestre bassa (Leo) e in orbita geostazionaria (Geo), utilizzano GaAs (Arseniuro di Gallio) e InGaP(Fosfuro di Indio e Gallio), e Germanio come materiale di base.",wired

Negli ultimi due mesi tutti e tre hanno cercato di incorporare il modello di intelligenza artificiale R1 di DeepSeek nelle loro attività, nel tentativo di cavalcare l'onda generata dal boom della società tecnologica cinese.

Da quando è diventata un fenomeno globale, la startup AI domina i media cinesi. Le notizie però non hanno praticamente nulla a che fare con DeepSeek: in quasi tutti i settori del paese, le aziende stanno facendo a gara per annunciare di aver trovato il modo di includere i modelli open source della società nella loro strategia. E se alcune hanno trovato applicazioni reali per il modello AI, per altre si tratta solo di una strategia di marketing o del tentativo di manifestare il proprio patriottismo.

Nelle ultime settimane, più di 20 case automobilistiche cinesi (e almeno un produttore di autobus) hanno annunciato di voler integrare il chatbot di DeepSeek nei loro veicoli, secondo quanto riportato da media locali. Circa 30 aziende mediche e farmaceutiche hanno dichiarato che utilizzano già l'AI della società per le diagnosi cliniche e la ricerca, tra le altre cose. Decine di banche, compagnie assicurative e società di intermediazione in tutto il paese dicono di utilizzare il sistema per addestrare gli addetti al servizio clienti, progettare strategie di investimento e gestire altre attività.

Tra hype e applicazioni concrete

Questa frenesia ricorda quanto accaduto alla fine del 2022, quando dopo il lancio di ChatGPT un'ondata di aziende americane ed europee si affannavano per trovare un modo di segnalare a clienti e investitori che stavano utilizzando quella che allora era l'innovazione più all'avanguardia nel campo dell'AI. Nonostante nei due anni successivi abbiano presentato parecchi modelli notevoli, le principali aziende cinesi attive nel settore dell'intelligenza artificiale – come Baidu e Alibaba – non sono mai riuscite ad attirare la stessa attenzione di DeepSeek. La startup ha stupito il mondo con un modello che, stando a quanto dichiara, è stato sviluppato con molte meno risorse di calcolo rispetto ai rivali.

Su una piattaforma cinese dove gli investitori possono rivolgere domande alle società quotate in borsa, dall'11 marzo sono arrivati quasi 5.000 quesiti su DeepSeek, la maggior parte dei quali chiedeva a specifiche aziende se avessero preso in considerazione o stessero già utilizzando l'AI nei loro prodotti. Centinaia di imprese hanno confermato che stanno incorporando la tecnologia. La mossa di solito porta a un aumento temporaneo del prezzo delle loro azioni. Ma una volta che gli investitori capiscono che alcune società si limitano a dire che stanno sperimentando internamente l'applicazione, il valore crolla.",wired
https://wired.com,La Gen Z è la più colpita dalle truffe online,https://www.wired.it/article/gen-z-truffe-online/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:59:42 GMT","Altro che boomers! I giovani della Gen Z sono i più colpiti dalle truffe online, a dispetto di quanto creda l’opinione pubblica, che identifica negli utenti adulti le vittime predilette dai cybercriminali. A rivelarlo è un approfondimento dei ricercatori di Trend Micro, società attiva nel settore della cybersecurity, che ha fatto chiarezza sul rapporto tra le generazioni e la sicurezza in rete. A quanto pare, i giovani della Gen Z, cresciuti a pane e Internet, sono quelli che tendono a fidarsi maggiormente delle interazioni digitali e a cadere vittime delle insidie della rete. Nello specifico, la passione per lo shopping online rende questa generazione “preda di siti web contraffatti e di inserzioni che propongono prodotti falsi”. E non è tutto.

Gli utenti più giovani sono anche i più propensi a cadere vittima di truffe sugli investimenti e truffe legate al mondo del lavoro, che rappresentano quasi il 30% degli attacchi che colpiscono la Gen Z, ingannata dai cybercriminali con false proposte di lavoro che la spingono ad acquistare strumenti e dispositivi professionali da siti web fraudolenti. Ma non sono solo i giovanissimi, come è facile immaginare, a rimanere invischiati nelle insidie della rete. Secondo la ricerca, infatti, i Millennials hanno la tendenza a essere colpiti da truffe legate al denaro, per via delle pressioni finanziarie che subiscono, legate al pagamento del mutuo e/o di prestiti di altro genere.

Infine, va da sè che anche i boomers siano tra le vittime colpite da cybercriminali, che tendono ad adescare gli utenti più adulti con schemi di truffe piuttosto tradizionali. Solitamente, infatti, i truffatori riescono ad agganciare le loro vittime notificando un premio o una vincita alla lotteria, “per poi richiedere un anticipo o informazioni personali necessarie alla consegna della somma”. A colpire i più adulti, però, sono anche le truffe romantiche. Non stupisce che i truffatori cerchino di adescare le loro vittime organizzando appuntamenti e incontri sentimentali. Insomma, “le truffe online riguardano tutti a prescindere dall’età”, come riferisce Salvatore Marcis, Head of Channel and Territory Sales di Trend Micro Italia, “ma la consapevolezza e la vigilanza rimangono le armi migliori. È fondamentale mantenere aggiornati i dispositivi, proteggere le informazioni personali e utilizzare password robuste. Bisogna diffidare dei contatti non verificati e dei pagamenti tramite metodi non convenzionali e prendersi tempo per riflettere sulle decisioni, consultando amici o familiari se sorgono dubbi”.",wired
https://wired.com,"Trump, la Tesla che si è comprato è un “pacco”",https://www.wired.it/article/trump-tesla-acquisto-difetti-elon-musk/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:11:07 GMT","Una volta salito sulla sua nuova Model S Plaid, Trump è rimasto chiaramente impressionato e si è prodotto in una recensione singolare del veicolo. ""Wow, è bellissima... È tutta un computer!"". Non ha tutti i torti: l'auto elettrica ha una potenza di calcolo da circa 10 teraflop, paragonabile a quella di una PlayStation 5 o di una Xbox Series X.

Trump si era impegnato ad acquistare una Tesla martedì sul suo social, Truth. Probabilmente riferendosi alla copertura mediatica negativa sull'operato di Musk alla guida del dipartimento per l'Efficienza del governo (Doge), il presidente aveva scritto che il suo alleato ""sta correndo grossi rischi per aiutare la nostra nazione, e sta facendo un lavoro fantastico... Domani mattina comprerò una Tesla nuova di zecca come segno di fiducia e sostegno a Elon Musk"".

Passando poi al Cybertruck esposto davanti alla Casa Bianca, Trump ne ha parlato come del ""design più cool"". Considerando però che il pickup elettrico da 3 tonnellate sembra essere incline alla ruggine e che i suoi molteplici richiami gli sono valsi una valutazione peggiore rispetto al 91% dei veicoli del 2024, probabilmente il presidente statunitense ha fatto bene a optare per una Model S.

Tutti i problemi della Tesla comprata da Trump

Detto questo, anche la nuova auto elettrica di Trump ha avuto la sua buona dose di grattacapi. Nel corso della sua esistenza la Model S ha subìto 37 richiami di sicurezza da parte dell'Nhtsa, l'ente del dipartimento dei Trasporti statunitense che si occupa di sicurezza stradale, l'ultimo dei quali a gennaio per un problema che in alcuni modelli bloccava la telecamera posteriore aumentando il rischio di incidenti.",wired

La polizia giudiziaria belga ha messo nel mirino il colosso cinese Huawei con una serie di perquisizioni e fermi in diverse località del Belgio nell’ambito di un’inchiesta per corruzione al Parlamento europeo. Un centinaio di agenti hanno passato al setaccio Bruxelles, la Vallonia e le Fiandre fermando diversi lobbisti legati all’azienda di telecomunicazioni cinese. L’operazione ha avuto ramificazioni anche in Portogallo, dove sono stati effettuati ulteriori controlli, sebbene al momento non risultino prese misure. Ne hanno dato notizia il sito di giornalismo investigativo belga Follow the money e le pubblicazioni belghe Le Soir e Knack

Le persone fermate in Belgio sono accusate di aver influenzato, attraverso pratiche illecite, parlamentari europei attuali ed ex per favorire gli interessi commerciali di Huawei nel Vecchio continente. Le ipotesi di reato spaziano dalla corruzione al riciclaggio di denaro fino alla falsificazione di documenti e all’associazione per delinquere. Nelle prossime ore gli indagati verranno interrogati per chiarire il loro coinvolgimento nella vicenda.

L'operazione ""Generazione""

L'operazione della polizia giudiziaria belga, denominata ""Generazione"", ha portato a 21 perquisizioni condotte nella mattina di giovedì 13 marzo dalla polizia belga. Nell'corso del blitz sono stati sequestrati documenti e dispositivi elettronici - tra cui computer - che ora verranno sottoposti a un'analisi approfondita, come fa sapere la procura federale del Belgio.

Secondo i media, tra i sospettati portati in caserma per accertamenti figurerebbe anche un italiano. Si tratterebbe di Valerio Ottati, lobbista italo-belga di 41 anni, originario di Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, nella regione di Bruxelles-Capitale. Ottati sarebbe entrato a far parte del colosso Huawei nel 2019, in un periodo in cui l'azienda stava intensificando la sua attività di influenza in Europa in risposta alle pressioni degli Stati Uniti affinché l'Unione abbandonasse le apparecchiature cinesi per il 5G. Prima di approdare in Huawei, Ottati avrebbe lavorato come assistente di due eurodeputati italiani, uno appartenente al Partito popolare europeo e l'altro ai Socialisti e democratici, occupandosi, tra le altre cose, anche delle relazioni tra Unione europea e Cina. Successivamente, l'uomo sarebbe passato al ruolo di direttore degli affari pubblici europei per Huawei, posizione in cui avrebbe capitalizzato i contatti sviluppati durante il suo decennio nell’ambiente dell’Europarlamento per promuovere gli interessi dell’azienda cinese.

Lobby buone e cattive

A differenza del lobbying tradizionale, perfettamente legale nell'Unione europea e regolamentato da un apposito registro per la trasparenza, ciò che configurerebbe il reato in questo caso sarebbe il passaggio dalla legittima rappresentanza di interessi alla vera e propria corruzione: secondo le norme europee, i lobbisti possono organizzare incontri informativi ed eventi, ma non possono offrire doni di valore significativo, vantaggi economici o benefici personali diretti agli eurodeputati in cambio di un'influenza sulle loro decisioni politiche. Nel caso in esame, gli inquirenti ipotizzano proprio questo scambio illecito a vantaggio di Huawei, in particolare riguardo l'implementazione delle reti 5G in Europa.",wired

Tutto quel che c'è da non perdere lo abbiamo raccolto nella guida essenziale qui sotto, utile a chi

I classici irrinunciabili

Il cuore della città è la vasta piazza Maggiore, che d'estate si trasforma in uno scenografico grande cinema all'aperto. Qui si trovano l'imponente Basilica di San Petronio con all'interno la meridiana dall'astronomo Domenico Cassini, il Palazzo del Podestà (famoso anche per l'effetto acustico che consente di parlarsi dagli angoli opposti del voltone), la fontana del Nettuno realizzata da Giambologna, Palazzo d'Accursio. L'altro simbolo del capoluogo dell'Emilia-Romagna sono le due torri: la Torre degli Asinelli, la più alta di Bologna con i suoi 97 metri, e la pendente Torre Garisenda. Entrambe chiuse al momento (per godere di una vista panoramica si può salire sulla Torre dell'Orologio), sono le torri più note di una città che oggi ne conta ventidue, ma in passato ne aveva un centinaio. Tra le attrazioni più note di Bologna ci sono poi i portici, dichiarati patrimonio dell'umanità Unesco e lunghi quasi 40 chilometri, la bella piazza triangolare di Santo Stefano, con la basilica omonima detta sette chiese perché il complesso è composto dall’unione di più edifici sorti in epoche diverse, e la Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna con opere di artisti come Raffaello, Tiziano e Guercino.

Dove dormire

Dormire nel centro storico, nei dintorni di piazza Maggiore, è comodo per avere a portata di mano tutte le attrazioni principali della città, spostandosi a piedi. Ma, a seconda di quello che si vuole, sono tante le zone consigliate per alloggiare: chi cerca vita notturna e un'atmosfera giovane e vivace può puntare sull'area di via Zamboni e dell'università (considerata la più antica del mondo ancora in funzione), quartiere Santo Stefano è forse il più elegante e affascinante di Bologna, il Quadrilatero è la meta ideale per chi fa turismo enogastronomico... E ancora, Saragozza garantisce un’atmosfera più tranquilla e meno turistica con vista panoramica sulla collina di San Luca, mentre la Bolognina è comoda per la vicinanza alla stazione (teatro, il 2 agosto 1980, della strage di Bologna) con soluzioni più economiche. Chi è alla ricerca di un alloggio curioso e insolito, può prenotare un appartamento in una torre medievale o una stanza ispirata ai libri da Bibliò Rooms.",wired
https://wired.com,Adolescence di Stephen Graham su Netflix è una serie che tutti gli adulti dovrebbero vedere,https://www.wired.it/article/adolescence-netflix-trama-episodi-recensione/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:08:41 GMT","Di Adolescence su Netflix è anche creatore e co-sceneggiatore (assieme a Jack Thorne). Per realizzarla, Graham ha chiamato a sé gli artisti con cui aveva già lavorato in precedenza. Aveva già lavorato con il citato Thorne in This Is England '86, '88 e ‘90 , le serie che hanno regalato a Stephen il suo ruolo più bello. Ha voluto l’amica Christine Tremarco per interpretare sua moglie e, poi ha interpellato Erin Doherty e Ashley Walters, con lui anche in A Thousand Blows, Alla regia ha voluto Philip Barantini di Boiling Point. “Ci sono stati molti casi di accoltellamento in tutto il Paese”, ha spiegato. “Alcuni riguardavano ragazzi giovani che accoltellavano ragazze giovani”. In un episodio straordinario – siamo dalle parti di Peaky Blinders, Black Sails, Banshee – affronta la questione. La puntata è tutta costruita attorno a Jamie e alla sua psicologa, mentre viene messa a nudo tutta la rabbia inesplosa del ragazzino, che emergerà per la prima volta con una scioccante deflagrazione. La Doherty è davvero notevole, ma Owen Cooper è eccezionale, ancor più perché esordiente. Tramite lui Jamie si rivela vulnerabile, spaventato, spavaldo, diffidente, incapace di nascondere il bisogno di sentirsi accettato e apprezzato.

Mentre lo si osserva sembra impossibile immaginarlo mentre uccide Katie, ma contemporaneamente ci si arrovella, chiedendosi cosa sia andato storto. Graham ha prodotto questa serie perché non riusciva a venire a capo delle notizie di cronache che leggeva. Ha voluto usarla per portare avanzare un'importante disamina sociale ma soprattutto per dire ai genitori: i nostri ragazzi non stanno bene: abbiamo la responsabilità di fare qualcosa, per aiutarli a navigare in un mondo sempre più folle, tossico e malato. “Speriamo di porre la questione abbastanza bene da far sì che inneschi una conversazione tra genitori e figli”",wired

https://wired.com,Il docufilm che racconterà la tour reunion degli Oasis sarà firmato dal creatore di Peaky Blinders,https://www.wired.it/article/tour-reunion-oasis-documentario-steven-knight/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:43:46 GMT","Il tour reunion degli Oasis è uno degli eventi musicali più attesi del 2025. Da questo momento è destinato ad assumere una valenza ancora più speciale: nelle scorse ore è stato infatti annunciato che le date della tournée, che toccherà in 40 date la Gran Bretagna, l'Irlanda, gli Stati Uniti, il Messico, il Sudamerica, l'Australia e l'Asia a partire dal prossimo luglio, sarà immortalata da un docufilm che sarà creato e prodotto da Steven Knight, con la regia di Dylan Southern e Will Lovelace. Knight è noto per essere stato il creatore di una serie cult come Peaky Blinders, ma è anche lo sceneggiatore e produttore dietro a svariati progetti come Taboo, See e il recente film di Pablo Larraín Maria.

Al momento non ci sono molto dettagli su come sarà il film che risulterà dalle riprese, ma il coinvolgimento di Southern e Lovelace potrebbe dare qualche indicazione: i due hanno realizzato anche Shut Up and Play the Hits, un film documentario che ha seguito l'ultimo concerto del tour dei LCD Soundsystem nel 2012 e, in modo ibrido, anche il dietro le quinte fino agli eventi del giorno successivo. Il doc comprendeva la comparsa di diversi ospiti, coinvolti nello stesso show live, ed è stato accompagnato, due anni dopo, da un album live che ne riproponeva la registrazione quasi integrale. È probabile dunque che anche il lavoro sugli Oasis proporrà la stessa formula, con un'alternanza dei momenti salienti dei loro concerti e degli istanti nel backstage, che promettono di essere altrettanto succosi e allettanti.

Non è un mistero che la reunion degli Oasis suscita grandissima curiosità soprattutto per via del rapporto, da sempre burrascoso, tra i due leader della band, i fratelli Noel e Liam Gallagher. Il loro primo album, Definitely Maybe, è uscito nel 1994 ma i due, dopo anni di battibecchi e tira e molla molto pubblici, hanno smesso di lavorare insieme e addirittura di parlarsi nel 2014. In occasione del trentesimo anniversario della loro opera prima, a sorpresa i Gallagher hanno annunciato una nuova serie di concerti, che ha subito scatenato una corsa sfrenata ai biglietti, tra problemi tecnici e polemiche sul pricing dinamico degli stessi biglietti (arrivando talvolta anche in parlamento, come successo nel Regno Unito). Tutti ora attendono che i live inizino, nella speranza che i fratelli serpenti non litighino prima (o durante). In ogni caso a testimoniare tutta la loro reunion ora ci penseranno anche le telecamere.",wired
https://wired.com,Con l'AI Act misureremo il braccio di ferro sulle regole tech tra Europa e Stati Uniti,https://www.wired.it/article/ai-act-codice-condotta-buone-pratiche-rischi-bozza-stati-uniti-europa/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 05:30:00 GMT","Lo scontro finora è latente, ma presto la distanza tra Unione europea e Stati Uniti si misurerà anche nelle norme su digitale e innovazione. A cominciare dall'AI Act, il regolamento comunitario sull'intelligenza artificiale, con cui Bruxelles punta a fissare l'asticella della protezione dei diritti e degli obblighi per le imprese. Molte delle quali hanno passaporto statunitense. Al di là dell'Atlantico le norme europee, da sempre mal digerite dai colossi tecnologici, sono finite nel mirino dell'amministrazione guidata dal presidente Donald Trump, che non ha fatto mistero di pretendere un annacquamento delle pretese per andare d'accordo con Bruxelles.

Siccome l'AI Act è un mastodonte che ha iniziato da poco a muovere i primi passi, capire quanto devierà dalla rotta tracciata per accontentare i desiderata statunitensi sarà una cartina tornasole della solidità dei principi europei sanciti nella legge, che pure è stata oggetto di una mediazione combattuta e complicata.

Per questo è interessante analizzare la terza bozza del codice delle buone pratica per i modelli di intelligenza artificiale per uso generale (GPAI). Perché mentre nelle ultime settimane il focus politico della Commissione è concentrato sul capitolo difesa e spesa militare, a livello amministrativo procedono i lavori per scrivere questo documento di indirizzo sulla gestione dei sistemi di AI che interessa i grandi sviluppatori Usa. E perché mentre dalla Cina arrivano in sequenza annunci di grandi avanzamenti tecnologici nel campo e dagli Stati Uniti di progetti colossali (su tutti il piano Stargate), nonostante la volatilità in borsa dei titoli tech, l'Europa si dibatte tra le ambizioni di investimenti pubblici della Commissione (da ridimensionare però nei volumi) e la partenza della legge tanto sbandierata.

La bozza del codice di buone pratiche

Due precisazioni di burocratese europeo prima di procedere. Per GPAI si intendono quei modelli che sono in grado di svolgere compiti diversi (come creare un testo o un'immagine) e che sono stati allenati attraverso un'enorme mole di dati non categorizzati. Come GPT-4 di OpenAI, Gemini di Google, LaMDA in casa Meta, Deepseek in Cina. Mentre il codice delle buone pratiche serve a fornire una serie di linee guida nei due anni che intercorrono tra l'entrata in vigore dei primi obblighi dell'AI Act (agosto 2025) e l'adozione degli standard (agosto 2027). È un documento senza valore legale, ma che può servire sia come allineamento preventivo ai principi del regolamento, sia come come “prova di conformità” in caso di contestazioni, fintantoché norme specifiche non sono entrate in vigore.

La bozza è articolata in quattro sezioni (valutazione, mitigazione e governance dei rischi, più trasparenza e protezione del copyright) e 18 impegni, di cui due per gli sviluppatori di GPAI e 16 per i modelli che possono costituire un rischio sistemico per i cittadini europei. Ossia un pericolo su larga scala che mina la sicurezza dell'Unione, dalla capacità di progettare armi a quella di sferrare un attacco cyber o manipolare la popolazione. Non è un caso che sia la voce più corposa. E quella più delicata, nella quale anche una virgola o una sfumatura del fraseggio può modificare significativamente il perimetro del recinto che l'Unione vuole erigere.

Il capitolo dei rischi

Agli sviluppatori di questi sistemi che possono rappresentare un rischio sistemico si chiede, per esempio, di rendere misurabile la possibilità che si palesi, di spiegare quale livello reputino “inaccettabile” e quali sono le misure di protezione e di mitigazione messe in campo. Ma quali sono questi rischi? I principali sono quattro: pericolo cyber di AI sfruttabili per attacchi sul larga scala; rischio di agevolare attacchi o incidenti chimici, batteriologici e nucleari; minaccia di manipolare il comportamento delle persone con tecniche subliminali; la perdita di controllo dei sistemi di AI, al punto da eludere i controlli umani e determinare in autonomia i propri obiettivi. A questi si aggiungono altri rischi, opzionali, come attentare alla salute e alla sicurezza pubblica, calpestare i diritti fondamentali o mettere a repentaglio la società nei suoi sistemi fondamentali. E anche rischi indefiniti, ma misurati dalle capacità del modello di AI, come quello di provocare velocemente un problema o l'impossibilità di riparare i danni.",wired
https://wired.com,"Pokémon Go, l'Arabia Saudita sta per acquisire i dati di localizzazione degli utenti",https://www.wired.it/article/niantic-vende-pokemon-go-arabia-saudita/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:04:11 GMT","Niantic, l'azienda statunitense proprietaria di Pokémon Go, ha da poco siglato un maxi accordo da 3,85 miliardi di dollari per la vendita del suo settore gaming - che comprende oltre a Pokémon Go Pikmin Bloom e Monster Hunter Now - con Scopely, una società controllata dall'azienda saudita Savvy Game, a sua volta di proprietà del Public Investment Fund del governo arabo. L'accordo è stato annunciato ieri dalle rispettive compagnie, che non hanno fatto alcuna menzione di quello che accadrà ai dati di localizzazione dei 100 milioni di giocatori di Pokémon Go, una volta che finiranno nelle mani delle società saudite. Quello che sappiamo, invece, è che Niantic cederà anche le due applicazioni Campfire - che permette alle persone di incontrarsi nel mondo reale per giocare insieme a Pokémon Go - e Wayfarer - il programma di mapping della community di Niantic - il che significa l'accesso a un'altra grande quantità di dati.

Secondo quanto riferito da Niantic, la scelta di vendere alcuni tra i suoi titoli più noti è legata alla volontà di concentrarsi sul progetto della società parallela Niantic Spatial, impegnata a costruire un modello AI geospaziale che “consentirà ai computer non solo di percepire e comprendere gli spazi fisici, ma anche di interagire con essi in modi nuovi”. Quello che stupisce, però, è che Scopely è uno dei nuovi investitori anche di Niantic Spatial, il che fa pensare a un evidente interesse delle società saudite nei confronti dei dati degli utenti di Pokémon Go. Eppure, Scopely ci ha tenuto a far sapere che la privacy dei giocatori sarà sempre considerata una priorità, indipendentemente dalla compagnia proprietaria. “La protezione della privacy e dei dati dei giocatori è della massima importanza sia per Scopely che per Niantic - ha dichiarato la società saudita a 404Media - I dati dei giocatori sono sempre stati e continueranno a essere gestiti in conformità con le severe leggi e normative sulla privacy dei dati, oltre a essere conservati esclusivamente su server con sede negli Stati Uniti”.

Inoltre, Scopely ha precisato che “i dati sulla posizione condivisi dai giocatori di Niantic vengono conservati per un periodo di tempo limitato e utilizzati solo per operazioni di gioco essenziali, ad esempio per combattere gli abusi e risolvere i bug”. Questo significa che se i dati sulla posizione non sono più necessari per il gioco, vengono rimossi completamente dai sistemi di Niantic. Nonostante questo, quello che continua a preoccupare gli esperti di sicurezza è che un'enorme quantità di informazioni sensibili, finora controllata da un'azienda americana, a breve passerà nelle mani di un'altra, Scopely, completamente gestita da un conglomerato di società il cui maggior azionista è l'Arabia Saudita. Il fatto che le compagnie interessate all'accordo non abbiano fornito alcuna informazione aggiuntiva al riguardo, poi, non ha fatto altro che alimentare quest'ondata di preoccupazione.",wired

Il flyby era considerato come una pietra miliare nel viaggio di Hera verso il sistema binario di asteroidi Didymos, e un passo cruciale negli sforzi dell’agenzia spaziale per sviluppare metodi affidabili per la deviazione degli asteroidi e la difesa planetaria. La missione Hera dell’Esa è stata infatti lanciata a ottobre del 2024 con l’obiettivo di studiare Didymos e di misurare in modo dettagliato il risultato del test di impatto contro l’asteroide Dimorphos (parte del sistema binario) eseguito nel corso della missione Dart della Nasa.

“Hera è ora in viaggio verso Didymos e siamo qui essenzialmente per celebrare il successo del flyby di Marte di ieri”, ha commentato durante la conferenza stampa tenutasi questa mattina Michael Kueppers, Hera Project Scientist dell’Esa. “Hera fa parte di una cooperazione con la Nasa chiamata Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment. In questo contesto, la sonda Dart della Nasa ha impattato l’asteroide Dimorphos nel 2022, e ora l’obiettivo generale della missione Hera è quello di determinare la massa di Dimorphos, conoscere l’efficienza dell’impatto e in generale caratterizzare l’asteroide”.

Durante il flyby Hera ha sfruttato la gravità di Marte per ottimizzare il suo viaggio verso Didymos, ma il sorvolo è anche stato una grande opportunità per fotografare e studiare il Pianeta Rosso e il suo satellite Deimos, grazie ai tre sistemi di telecamere presenti sulla sonda.

Capitano nei luoghi in cui la sua storia ha preso vita. Il film di Matteo Garrone, uscito nel 2023, racconta la struggente storia di due adolescenti senegalesi, Seydou e Moussa, che lasciano Dakar, in Senegal, per affrontare la traversata con il sogno di giungere in Italia. Premiato alla Mostra del cinema di Venezia con il Leone d'argento alla regia e il premio al miglior attore protagonista Seydou Sarr e poi candidato ai Golden Globe e agli Oscar come miglior titolo straniero, il film ha conquistato il pubblico e la critica grazie al realismo con cui racconta le vite vere dietro alle tratte migratorie. Ora il film documentario aggiunge una nuova prospettiva, e sarà disponibile in streaming gratuito su RaiPlay dal 19 marzo, anticipando la trasmissione in prima serata su Rai Uno del film stesso, prevista per il 26 marzo.

Realizzato dalla Fondazione Cinemovel, in collaborazione con Rai Cinema e Fondazione Lam, con la regia di Tommaso Merighi, il documentario segue la proiezione itinerante di Io Capitano nei villaggi e nelle scuole del Senegal, raccontando le reazioni e i commenti genuini del pubblico del luogo. La visione è stata accompagnata dagli attori protagonisti Seydou Sarr e Moustapha Fall, nonché dal mediatore culturale Mamadou Kouassi, che hanno coinvolto gli spettatori in un’esperienza cinematografica unica, in cui il cinema diventa strumento di dialogo e confronto. La missione della Fondazione Cinemovel, inaugurata nel 2001, è proprio quella di portare il

cinema nelle comunità più isolate dell'Africa, trasformandolo in un mezzo di incontro, educazione e consapevolezza sociale.

“Tommaso [Merighi, il regista, ndr] ha colto nel segno. In pochi minuti entriamo nel vivo del cinema itinerante”, afferma Elisabetta Antognoni, presidente e cofondatrice della Fondazione Cinemovel, che ha curato l’organizzazione delle proiezioni e dei dibattiti. Dopo il successo mondiale del film di Garrone, Cinemovel, ha deciso di portare Io Capitano nei luoghi in cui la sua storia ha avuto origine, per documentare la reazione del pubblico locale e approfondire il suo impatto. “La nostra regola è stata quella di non aspettarci nulla, di essere pronti e accogliere qualsiasi istanza perché potesse essere elaborata, ma non maneggiata, perché venisse ascoltata nella sua originalità”, ha commentato il regista: “Questo è stato il nostro approccio, spogliarci di ogni nostro preconcetto, nel bene o nel male, per poter essere al servizio dell’autenticità delle persone e delle loro voci”.",wired

L'epicentro è stato localizzato a 2,5 chilometri di profondità, in mare, a pochissimi metri dalle coste tra Pozzuoli e Bagnoli, causando, soprattutto in quest'ultimo quartiere di Napoli, danni, come la caduta di calcinacci, e un'unica persona rimasta ferita, in modo non grave.

Il terremoto ai Campi Flegrei

I Campi Flegrei, ricordiamo brevemente, sono una vasta area vulcanica attiva che ha una struttura chiamata caldera, caratterizzata dal fenomeno del bradisismo, ossia un lento abbassamento del suolo, alternato a fasi di sollevamento più veloce che può appunto causare attività sismica. Localizzato dalla Sala operativa dell'Istituto nazionale di Geofisica e vulcanologia-Osservatorio vesuviano (Ingv-Ov), questo ultimo terremoto è stato particolarmente avvertito come minaccioso. Questo perché il terremoto libera energia e più è superficiale più ne percepiamo l'intensità macrosismica. Oltre alla superficialità, c'è anche la direttività, un fenomeno che si associa a un terremoto e indica la direzione privilegiata che prende l'energia. In questo evento, è stata molto marcata e avvenuta verso est, quindi verso Napoli. “Anche questo evento è avvenuto all'interno di uno sciame sismico dove però il contenuto energetico è finora basso, con magnitudo massima di 1.7 e sono tutti eventi che stanno avvenendo all'intorno dell'area colpita”, ha precisato in un recente punto stampa Francesca Bianco, direttrice del dipartimento Vulcani dell'Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia.

Il sollevamento del suolo

Recentemente la velocità del sollevamento del suolo è passata da 1 a 3 centimetri al mese. “Sono tre settimane che c'è una variazione della velocità di deformazione verticale”, ha spiegato Mauro Antonio Di Vito, direttore dell'Osservatorio vesuviano. “Il fatto che ci sarebbe stata sismicità era nelle nostre aspettative, ma è impossibile definire quando avverrà un terremoto”. Questo è un segnale, aggiunge l'esperto, che insieme ad altri ci indica che questo processo sta continuando e possiamo certamente aspettarci altra sismicità. Tuttavia, non c'è relazione tra sollevamento del suolo e magnitudo, e ad oggi i terremoti rimangono imprevedibili: non è possibile stabilire né quando arrivano né quanta intensità avranno.

C'è la possibilità di un'eruzione?

Per quanto riguarda invece la possibilità di una eventuale eruzione, al momento non ci sono dati ed evidenze di risalita del magma, che appunto possano suggerire questa eventualità. “Quello che stiamo osservando adesso è un altro degli step dell'intensificazione del processo di bradisismo, ma non stiamo misurando alcun elemento che ci dia evidenza di un eruzione imminente, ossia di magma in risalita”, ha sottolineato Bianco.

Cosa prevede il piano di evacuazione dei Campi Flegrei

Come vi abbiamo raccontato, il piano di evacuazione per i Campi Flegrei definito dalla Protezione Civile divide l'area dei Campi Flegrei in due zone a rischio: la zona rossa, in cui rientrano Pozzuoli e Bagnoli, più esposta al rischio di colate piroclastiche e la zona gialla, dove il pericolo è la caduta di ceneri vulcaniche. I livelli di allerta (che vanno dal verde, giallo, arancione fino al rosso, ossia “allarme”) possono cambiare in base ai dati forniti dall'Ingv. Da quando viene dichiarato il livello rosso, le stime della Protezione Civile indicano circa 72 ore per portare a termine le operazioni di evacuazione. In particolare, le prime 12 ore consentono alle persone di prepararsi a lasciare l’area e alle autorità di predisporre le misure di regolazione del traffico. Le 48 ore successive riguardano la partenza della popolazione da tutti i Comuni della zona rossa, mentre le ultime 12 ore sono riservate come “margine di sicurezza per la gestione di eventuali criticità e per consentire l’allontanamento anche degli operatori del sistema di protezione civile”.",wired
https://wired.com,"Northvolt travolta dai debiti, finisce l'illusione delle batterie europee",https://www.wired.it/article/northvolt-fallita-batterie-auto-elettriche/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 10:26:09 GMT","Northvolt è ufficialmente fallita e sarà divisa. Il sogno europeo di competere con i giganti asiatici nel settore delle batterie elettriche si è infranto mercoledì 12 marzo, quando l'azienda svedese ha presentato istanza di fallimento nel proprio paese d'origine.

L'azienda, fondata nel 2016 da ex manager di Tesla, tra cui l'italiano Paolo Cerruti, era considerata fino a poco tempo fa la migliore speranza europea per produrre batterie nel continente e sostenere la transizione verso i veicoli elettrici. Una missione strategica che le aveva permesso di raccogliere investimenti per ben 13 miliardi di dollari, diventando così la startup meglio finanziata dell'Unione europea. Tra i principali investitori figuravano nomi di grande rilievo: Volkswagen il principale, poi colossi del calibro di Goldman Sachs e BlackRock, ma anche la Banca europea per gli investimenti e diversi istituti finanziari europei, inclusa Intesa Sanpaolo. Un parterre che testimoniava la fiducia riposta nel progetto industriale, al punto che lo stabilimento di Skellefteå, situato nei pressi del Circolo polare artico in Svezia, era diventato il simbolo delle aspirazioni europee di autonomia strategica nel settore.

La crisi improvvisa di Northvolt e i problemi strutturali

Il fallimento di Northvolt appare particolarmente sorprendente anche per la rapidità con cui si è dipanato, tanto che poco più di un anno fa l'azienda aveva avviato la costruzione di due nuovi impianti in Germania e Canada, sostenuti da generosi incentivi governativi.

Tuttavia nel 2024 la crisi del mercato delle auto elettriche ha completamente modificato lo scenario. Ad aggravare la situazione sono emersi significativi problemi manageriali e industriali all'interno dell'azienda: la produzione, infatti, non era mai veramente decollata, rimanendo dipendente da macchinari e tecnici cinesi.

A ciò si sono aggiunti un preoccupante deficit di liquidità e progetti di espansione considerati troppo ambiziosi. Fatale è stato il colpo inferto dalla casa automobilistica tedesca Bmw, che ha cancellato un contratto di fornitura dal valore di 2,15 miliardi di dollari, privando così Northvolt di uno dei suoi clienti più importanti e di entrate fondamentali per la sopravvivenza.

A novembre, dopo aver ridotto il personale del 20%, la nuova dirigenza aveva fatto ricorso alla legge fallimentare americana (Chapter 11) perché l'azienda aveva filiali negli Stati Uniti. Questa mossa consente di bloccare temporaneamente i creditori mentre si tenta il salvataggio, dando all'azienda alcuni mesi di tempo per trovare nuovi investitori. Tuttavia, nonostante questi tentativi, anche un prestito di 5 miliardi di dollari concesso dall'Unione europea lo scorso anno per espandere la produzione non è stato sufficiente a contrastare le sfide che l'azienda stava affrontando.

Le conseguenze e il futuro incerto di Northvolt fuori dall'Europa

Ora spetterà a un curatore fallimentare nominato dal tribunale svedese gestire il processo di vendita delle attività e degli asset dell'azienda. Scania, produttore svedese di camion e autobus che era il primo cliente di Northvolt, potrebbe essere interessata all'acquisizione. Intanto, però, le filiali di Northvolt in Germania e Nord America non rientrano nelle procedure fallimentari svedesi e i progetti in questi paesi proseguono per il momento.

Il fallimento di Northvolt rappresenta un duro colpo per l'Europa nella sua ambizione di competere con i rivali asiatici che dominano il mercato globale. Attualmente, i produttori europei di automobili ottengono le loro batterie principalmente da aziende come Lg Energy solution e Samsung della Corea del Sud, oltre che dal leader mondiale del settore, Catl della Cina. Northvolt aspirava a conquistare il 25% del mercato europeo delle batterie entro il 2030, un obiettivo che ora appare definitivamente tramontato. Questo ""fallimento di sistema"" fa suonare un preoccupante campanello d'allarme sulle politiche industriali europee: in settori già maturi come quello delle batterie elettriche, inseguire i campioni cinesi si sta rivelando un'impresa estremamente difficile.",wired
https://wired.com,Sonos abbandona il progetto della sua “Apple Tv”,https://www.wired.it/article/sonos-cancella-progetto-pinewood/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 09:51:40 GMT","Sonos abbandona in modo definitivo i lavori sul tanto anticipato dispositivo per lo streaming audio e video noto finora con il nome in codice di Pinewood. Già individuato in numerosi rumors e con funzionalità software ben avviate in fase beta, quella che doveva proporsi come una possibile alternativa a Apple Tv arriva dunque a fine corsa ed entra nella cerchia di device abortiti prima ancora del lancio sui mercati.

Ad anticiparlo è stato il portale statunitense The Verge che afferma come l'ufficialità del fine progetto sia stata comunicata durante l'ultima riunione aziendale di Sonos. L'amministratore delegato ad interim Tom Conrad avrebbe peraltro anche rassicurato sulla riassegnazione e ricollocazione dei dipendenti che finora avevano lavorato sull'hardware e sul software del dispositivo: vireranno ora verso altri dipartimenti e sezioni dell'azienda, quindi al momento non sono previsti licenziamenti. Tuttavia, è noto come Sonos abbia trascorso un 2024 piuttosto tormentato con la presentazione di alcune novità accolte bene da pubblico e critica, ma anche con difficoltà non indifferenti da affrontare, come la controversa applicazione ufficiale che ha causato non pochi grattacapi dopo l'ultimo aggiornamento.

Sul caso della cancellazione del progetto Pinewood non ci sono comunicazioni ufficiali sulla motivazione, ma una delle possibili spiegazioni riguarda l'assegnazione dello sviluppo del sistema operativo alla società The Trade Desk specializzata in servizi marketing, che lasciava presagire un'interfaccia ricca non soltanto di annunci ma anche di un corposo tracciamento delle attività degli utenti, una prospettiva di certo non così entusiasmante, soprattutto in questi tempi in cui si presta molto più attenzione alla privacy dei propri dati sensibili.

In realtà il suo creatore George Lucas aveva accarezzato l'idea di produrre una serie tv dedicata alla galassia lontana, lontana più di dieci anni fa, ancora prima che avvenisse nel 2012 l'acquisizione di Lucasfilm da parte di Disney. A rivelare il progetto poi mai realizzato è il produttore Rick McCallum, in una recente intervista al podcast Young Indy Chronicles. La produzione si sarebbe dovuta intitolare Star Wars: Underworld e sarebbe stata ambientata tra gli eventi de La vendetta dei Sith e quelli di Una nuova speranza, in modo da fare da ponte tra la trilogia originale e quella prequel.

“Penso che avessimo più di 60 sceneggiature… nel senso di script arrivati alla terza versione, con gli sceneggiatori più bravi del mondo”, ha dichiarato McCallum, che ha rivelato anche che questi scrittori erano stati convocati al celebre Skywalker Ranch di Lucas in California. La svolta sarebbe stata piuttosto radicale: “Erano script piuttosto oscuri. Erano sexy, erano violenti. Erano davvero meravigliosi, complessi e pieni di sfide”. McCallum non ha fornito particolari dettagli sulle eventuali trame ma ha confermato che la serie “avrebbe rivoluzionato l'intero universo di Star Wars e Disney non si sarebbe di certo offerta di acquistare il franchise”. Il tutto non fu mai realizzato (""il più grande rimpianto della nostra vita"", ha aggiunto il produttore) anche per motivi pratici: “Il problema era che ogni episodio era più grande dei film, al punto che la cifra più bassa a cui ero arrivato con la tecnologia dell'epoca erano 40 milioni di dollari a episodio”.

La serie di Star Wars poi sfumò definitivamente con l'acquisizione da parte di Disney e l'arrivo di Kathleen Kennedy come co-presidente accanto a Lucas, il quale poi nel 2020 comunque si disse piuttosto rammaricato di aver ceduto la sua creatura più complessa e ambiziosa: a quel tempo, però, anche se stava già mettendo a punto una sua trilogia sequel, decise di rinunciare a un altro decennio di super lavoro per stare vicino alla figlia piccola. Fu proprio Kennedy, in seguito, a portare Star Wars sul piccolo schermo, con The Mandalorian & co., e poi a organizzare anche una trilogia sequel del tutto nuova. Ora anche il dominio di Kathleen Kennedy sembra essere arrivato al termine, e il futuro della saga si evolverà in modi ancora da prevedere. Mentre i fan rimarranno per sempre curiosi di conoscere quella serie che non fu mai realizzata.",wired

In maniera imprevista, ma forse non imprevedibile. La svolta per l’imprenditrice-influencer diventata una celebrità mondiale nell’ambito del fashion a inizio del decennio scorso grazie al blog The blonde salad – uno dei primi e più seguiti del settore – è arrivata nel dicembre 2023 con il cosiddetto “pandoro-gate”, un caso di sponsorizzazioni squadernato dalla giornalista Selvaggia Lucarelli.

In sostanza, il marchio Chiara Ferragni veniva applicato su una linea di dolci natalizi della Balocco (venduti al prezzo maggiorato di 9 euro) lasciando intendere al pubblico che la beneficenza sarebbe aumentata in parallelo alle vendite. Secondo le accuse, invece, l’assegno per l’ospedale pediatrico Regina Margherita di Torino ammontava a soli cinquantamila euro,e sarebbe stato staccato mesi prima dell'iniziativa. Il guadagno per l'imprenditrice, derivato dall'operazione, sarebbe stato di circa un milione di euro. Ferragni ha ammesso l’errore in un video girato in lacrime. Ma il danno di immagine, per chi di immagine vive, era fatto.

Il pericoloso mix di beneficenza e autopromozione

Va notato che il mix di beneficenza e autopromozione è stato, per anni, una costante della coppia Ferragni-Fedez, e non ha mai rappresentato un problema, né per i consumatori né per i media. Come nel caso dell’ospedale per i malati di Covid durante la pandemia, per cui il duo avviò una raccolta di fondi: furono quattro i milioni di euro destinati al San Raffaele alla fine, ma la donazione dei Ferragnez fu molto più bassa: solo centomila euro. La coppia, però, incassò svariate copertine e persino l’Ambrogino d’oro, onorificenza milanese riservata a personaggi benemeriti. Ancora oggi, se si chiede a qualcuno l'importo della donazione al nosocomio meneghino, pochi dimostrano di conoscere la cifra esatta: merito del sottile gioco comunicativo di cui la coppia è stata maestra per anni.

La stampa , dal canto suo - e ancora una volta - non ha reso un buon servizio ai lettori. Lo stesso articolo di Lucarelli lasciò di stucco l'imprenditrice lombarda, abituata a camminare sul velluto coi giornali. Non è chiaro perché il pubblico abbia deciso di abbandonare la coppia proprio in quell'occasione e non in altre, quando pure sarebbe stato possibile: quello che è certo è che fu l’inizio della discesa. Rapidissima, come sono le cose sui social. L'ultimo capitolo risale a questi giorni, e parla di perdite, bilanci contestati, della necessità di una ricapitalizzazione dell'azienda e della crisi con uno dei soci storici, Pasquale Morgese. Vediamo meglio.

La società e le perdite

Al vertice dell’impero di Chiara Ferragni c’è una società, Fenice, che ne gestisce il marchio. La compagine fa capo a tre persone: l’imprenditrice stessa (32,5% del capitale, tramite la sua Sisterhood) e i suoi soci Paolo Barletta (40%, tramite Alchimia Spa) e Pasquale Morgese (27,5% tramite i due veicoli Esuriens e N1).

Fatturato in picchiata negli ultimi anni: dai 14 milioni di euro del 2022 (prima del pandoro-gate) a soli 2 milioni nel 2024. Le perdite del 2023 e dei primi undici mesi del 2024 cumulate assommano 10,2 milioni di euro e hanno azzerato il patrimonio: tra capitale e riserve, riporta il Corriere della Sera, informatissimo sulla vicenda, la società disponeva alla fine del 2024 di 3,5 milioni di euro. Il passivo ammonta, quindi, a 6,2 milioni.",wired
https://cnet.com,iPad Air、その「Air」はどこへ？立ち位置は今も「手の届くiPad Pro」,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230388/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 07:30:00 GMT","目の前に最新のiPadがある。色はパープル。画面は大きく、内蔵チップは「M3」。製品名は「iPad Air」だ。しかし、ぱっと見ただけでは、これがiPadの新モデルだとはわからない。新型iPad Airは、予算さえ許せば、ほとんどの人にとっては最も汎用性の高いiPadとなるだろう。しかし2025年も、iPadシリーズに革新の風は吹かなかった。

2020年代も半ばに入ったが、iPadが提案する価値はほとんど変わっていない。つまり、ソフトウェア面では多少の制約があるものの、その点さえ受け入れられれば「ノートPCの代替になり得る優秀なタブレット」だ。しかし、iPad Airという名称は依然として誤解を招く。その名に反して、iPad Airは最も薄いiPadではない。むしろ、ほとんどの人にとってはお手頃価格のiPad Proだ。

2024年にAppleはiPad AirとiPad Proを刷新した。iPad Airには「M2」チップが搭載され、iPad Proには「M4」チップに加えて、新たに有機ELディスプレイが採用された。それから1年。現在のところ、iPad Proに新モデルは登場しておらず、価格は最小構成でも999ドル（日本では16万8800円）と非常に高いままだ。一方、iPad Airには新型が登場し、内蔵プロセッサーがM3にアップグレードされた。別売の専用「Magic Keyboard」も刷新され、若干安くなった。こうした改良点にもかかわらず、新型iPad Airの価格は据え置かれ、最小構成なら599ドル（日本では9万8800円）で手に入る。

とはいえ、今回のアップデートはあまりときめかない。それどころか、これほど気分の上がらないiPadのアップデートは初めてだ。もちろん、値上げなしで性能が向上したことは歓迎すべきニュースだが、新鮮さに欠ける。

筆者は1年前の記事で、2024年モデルのiPad Airをほとんどの人に適した、手の届く価格のiPad Proと評した。この評価は2025年モデルでも変わらない。確かに、M4搭載iPad Proはすばらしいタブレットだが、発売から1年がすぎた今、400ドル（日本では約7万円）も余計に支払うのは気が進まない。iPad Proと比べると、iPad Airは少し厚みがあり、「Face ID」は使えない。背面のLiDARセンサーも、M4チップも、有機ELディスプレイもない。しかし、性能は十分に高く、「Apple Pencil Pro」にも対応する。問題は、妥協点を受け入れられるかだ。

また、iPadシリーズにはもう1つ、ほとんどの人にとって検討する価値のあるモデルがある。無印iPadだ。今回、新型iPad Airと同時に発表されたエントリーモデルの新型iPadは、十分すぎるほどの魅力を放っている。まだテストはしていないが（Appleからレビュー用のiPad Airが届いたとき、新型の無印iPadは同梱されていなかった）、128GBのストレージと「A16」プロセッサー（性能は高いがApple Intelligenceは実行できない）を搭載した新しい無印iPadは有力な選択肢となるだろう。しかし、Apple Pencil Proを使いたい、AIやグラフィック機能を積極的に使いたいなら、ほどほどの価格で高性能なiPad Airがおすすめだ。

今回、Appleから送られてきたレビュー用iPad Airは容量1TBの13インチモデルだった。実際にこの構成で買おうとすると、価格は1299ドル（日本では21万6800円）。これだけの額を出すなら、筆者はiPad Proの購入を検討する。個人的に買うとすれば、検討するのは11インチモデルのiPad Airだ。容量はもっと少なくていい（13インチモデルはアスペクト比の都合上、映画は大幅にリサイズされて表示されるため、思うほど動画の閲覧には向いていない）。

iPad Air 対 無印iPad：価格差250ドルの価値はあるか

エントリーモデルである無印iPad（349ドル、日本では5万8800円）と比べると、iPad Airは250ドル（日本では4万円）も高いが、価格差分の価値はある。理由は大きく2つあり、1つはM3チップを搭載していること、もう1つは別売のApple Pencil Pro（129ドル、日本では2万1800円）が使えることだ

iPad Airに搭載されたM3が、A16搭載の無印iPadと比べて、どれだけの性能差を生むかはまだわからない（前述したように、まだ新型の無印iPadはテストしていない）。M3はグラフィック処理、AI機能、速度の面で大きな向上が見られ、すぐに時代遅れになる心配はない。ほとんどのiPadユーザーにとってM3はオーバースペックだが、新型の無印iPadはApple Intelligenceに対応していないため、長期的にはiPad Airの方が長く使えるかもしれない。

同じことは純正スタイラスの上位モデルであるApple Pencil Proにも言える。Apple Pencil Proは無印iPadが対応している「Apple Pencil」より機能が多いため、アーティストなら迷わずiPad Airを選ぶだろう。

エントリーモデルの無印iPadがApple Pencil Proに対応しておらず、Apple Intelligence対応チップも搭載していないのは差別化のための意図的な判断のように感じられる。不満はあるが、2025年モデルはそういうものと考えるほかない。

iPad Air 対 iPad Pro：Proモデルの優位性が低下

今、あえて高額なiPad Proを買う理由はあまりない。M3とM4チップの性能差は、2024年のM2とM4の性能差ほど大きくない。新型iPad Airなら、新型Magic KeyboardやApple Pencil Proも使える。iPad Proにしかない特徴としては、高コントラストのHDRカスタム有機ELディスプレイ、さらに薄型のデザイン、Face IDカメラ、背面のLiDARセンサーなどが挙げられるが、一部の人を除けば、そのために400ドルを追加で出す価値があるかは微妙だ。個人的には納得感はない。

M3搭載は朗報だが、決定打にはならない

Apple純正のMシリーズは高性能なチップだが、AIやグラフィック、ビデオや写真関連の機能を日常的に使うヘビーユーザーでもない限り、その性能をiPadでフルに生かせる人は少ないだろう。とはいえ、M3にアップグレードしたことにより、ベンチマーク測定ソフト「Geekbench 6」で、新型iPad Airはマルチコアのスコアが1万1643を記録した（M4搭載iPad Proは1万4672、2024年発売のM2搭載iPad Airは9894）。つまり、マルチタスクの処理速度を比較すると、M3搭載iPad Airは2024年のM2搭載iPad Airより約18％速く、M4搭載iPad Proより約26％遅い。

しかし、Apple自身もMシリーズのチップ間の性能差を明らかにはしていない。実際、M2とM3の差はそれほど大きくないだろう。しかし、Mシリーズチップを搭載したiPadを使うのが初めてなら、大きな進化を感じられるはずだ。

Magic Keyboardはさらに魅力的に

2024年に発売されたM2搭載iPad Air用のMagic Keyboardは、M3搭載iPad Airでも使えるため、すでに持っているなら新調する必要はない。しかし、新型Magic Keyboardはやや価格が下がった（269ドル、日本では4万6800円〜）だけでなく、ファンクションキー列が追加されるなど、魅力が高まっている。後ろにひっくり返すことはできないが、iPadをノートPC化するための筆者お気に入りの手段となっている。

ただMagic Keyboardは重く、付けるとiPadの厚みが増す。筆者はもう慣れたが、13インチのiPad Airで使うと、全体の重量は「MacBook Air」を超える。また、iPad Air用Magic KeyboardとiPad Pro用Magic Keyboardには若干の違いがある。例えば、トラックパッドの面積はPro用の方が大きく、全体のサイズは同じにもかかわらず、キーボードの位置が全体に上に押し上げられている。個人的にはiPad Pro用キーボードのレイアウトの方が好みだが、iPad Air用キーボードとレイアウトが違う理由はわからない。

違いはこれだけではない。iPad Air用キーボードには、iPad Pro用キーボードにあるバックライトがない。内側の素材もiPad Pro用のようなアルミニウム製ではなく、トラックパッドもiPad Pro用より小さい。また、iPad Pro用キーボードのトラックパッドは触覚フィードバックに対応しているのに対して、iPad Air用キーボードのトラックパッドは物理クリック機構を採用している。iPad Air用キーボードは、iPad Pro用と同様にパススルー充電に対応したUSB-Cポートを備えるが、いくつかの点でコスト削減の跡が見られる。

良くも悪くも、いつものiPad

この1年間、ソフトウェア面ではApple IntelligenceがAppleに関する話題の中心だった。2024年と同様に、2025年モデルのiPad AirもiPadOSに搭載された生成AI機能をすべて実行できる。現時点では、これらの機能はそこまで驚くべきものでも、便利なものでもない。メッセージや通知の要約機能はうっとうしく、誤解を招くことさえある。「Image Playground」と「ジェン文字」の画像生成は、他の生成AIアプリの画像生成ツールほど優秀ではない。「Siri」は「ChatGPT」と連携したが、ChatGPTアプリを入れて、ChatGPTを直接使うことも可能だ。Appleは予定していたSiriの機能強化を再延期すると報じられているので、Apple Intelligenceを急いで生活に取り入れる必要はない。実際のところ、今はまだベータ版の機能のように感じられる。

言うまでもないが、iPadは汎用性の高いデバイスで、たくさんのアプリを実行できる。（ある程度は）マルチタスクも可能だ。Mシリーズのチップを搭載したiPadなら、外付けモニターでも対応できる。まるでノートPCだ。その気になれば、コンピューターと遜色ない体験が得られる。とはいえ、Macとは同じではない。この点が筆者にとってはストレスだった。このレビュー記事もiPad Airで書いているが、完成したらMacBookから提出するつもりだ。米CNETのコンテンツ管理システムはiPadからは使いにくいからである。現在のiPadはMacとは違う。Apple製コンピューターのラインナップは現在も分断されており、ユーザーは2025年もiPad派かMac派か、あるいは併用派かを決める必要がある。

併用は可能であり、筆者もそうしている。ただし、その場合はiPadに多額を投じることは避けたいと思うだろう。エントリーモデルのiPadは、カジュアルなアクセサリーとして購入しやすい価格に設定されているようだ。一方、iPad Airはやや手頃な価格（599ドル）から始まり、ストレージを拡張（最大1TB）したり、Apple Pencil ProやMagic Keyboardなどのアクセサリーを追加したりすると、ハイエンドノートPCに近い価格になる。

次から名称は「Air」でなくていいのかも

Appleは最新のiPad Airで背面から「iPad Air」の文字をなくし、Appleのロゴのみを残した。これは何かの予兆かもしれない。現状、iPadのラインナップにおいて「Air」という名称は大きな意味をなしていない。

iPad Airの完成度は高いため、構成次第では将来性がありながらも比較的手頃な価格で、自分に合ったiPadを手にできるだろう。特に、M3チップの性能を必要とするツールを本格的に使いたいなら、有力な選択肢となる。高額な出費にならないようにすれば、満足度は高いはずだ。

では、実際のところ筆者が何を望んでいるのかと言うと、キーボードを付けたこの高性能なiPadが、ボタン1つでMacに切り替わってほしいというのが正直なところだ。有機ELディスプレイの搭載も望ましい。これらの点を除けば、iPad Airは現状でも筆者が求める基本的機能をすべて備えている。ただし、「macOS」にも切り替えられる形態への進化が見込めないのであれば、高い価格を受け入れるのは難しい。今回、Appleが低価格帯やミドルレンジのiPadに注力しているのは、同社も同様の考えを持っているからかもしれない。または、Pro向けのM5チップがまだ準備段階にある可能性も考えられる。

https://cnet.com,「ポケモンGO」など3作品、サウジ資本へ約5200億円で売却決定--今後どう変わる？,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230418/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 06:31:00 GMT","米Nianticは、「ポケモンGO」（PokemonGO）などの人気タイトルを35億ドル（約5200億円）で売却すると発表した。売却先のScopelyは、米カリフォルニア州に本社を置くモバイルゲーム企業で、サウジアラビア政府系ファンド子会社だ。

ポケモンGOのチームリーダーによれば、開発チーム全員がゲームとともにScopelyに移り、今後も進化を続ける。

公式発表によると、Nianticが「永続的に運営していくゲーム」と位置づけてきた3作品、「ポケモンGO」「モンスターハンターNow」「ピクミン ブルーム」を35億ドルで売却し、そのうち3億5000万ドルの現金をNianticの株主に分配する。

●Nianticは存続し、地理空間系AIの新会社設立

2015年にGoogleから独立したNianticは、「Googleマップ」や「Google Earth」の産みの親であるジョン・ハンケ氏が率いる位置情報アプリ・ゲーム会社だ。

今後もNianticは存続するが、ハンケ氏は新たに「Niantic Spatial」という地理空間系AI企業を立ち上げる。Nianticが2億ドル、Scopelyが5000万ドルをこの新企業に出資する。

ハンケ氏はLinkedInへの投稿で「既存の地図は人間用に作られてきたが、今後はARメガネや人型ロボットをはじめとするあらゆる機械が実世界を理解し、移動するための新しい地図が必要だ。Nianticは、AIが画面内に留まらず、現実世界へ進出するために役立つモデルを開発していく」との趣旨の投稿をした。

なお、「Peridot」や「Ingress Prime」など他の位置情報ゲームへの言及はなかった。これらは引き続きNianticが保有するとみられる。

ポケモンGOのチームリーダーであるエド・ウー氏は、売却先のScopelyのもとでゲームは進化を続けるとし、次のように述べた。

「ポケモンGOはこれまでも常に進化を続けており、まったく変わらないとは言えない。だが、根本は変わらない。むしろより良い体験をユーザーに届けられるようになる」（エド・ウー氏）

●開発チームごと移籍は「安心できる材料」

ポケモンGOのファンサイト「Pokemon Go Hub」を運営するソフトウェア開発者のアントニオ・パブリノビッチ氏は、この売却を楽観視している。

「ここ数年足りなかった新鮮さをScopelyがもたらすだろう。Nianticは10年間、ポケモンGOを素晴らしい形で育ててきたが、ARや位置情報に注力しすぎており、ゲームとしての面白さが少し抑えられていたように感じる。開発チームごと移管するのは安心できる材料だ」と語った。

すぐに大きな変化があるわけではないようだが、「今後はリモートレイドの制限緩和や、シャドウレイドの遠隔参加など、Nianticのビジョン重視の姿勢によって設けられていた制限が緩まる可能性もある」とも述べた。

AirTagはAppleのFind Myネットワークを活用して、iPhoneユーザーにとって頼りになるBluetoothトラッカーだ。位置情報はかなり正確で、スピーカーや超広帯域通信（UWB）にも対応している。「CR2032ボタン電池」で動作するため、バッテリー交換が不可のトラッカーより相対的に維持費も安い。

だが、問題が起きることがある。筆者はAirTagを鍵や財布、バッグ、子どもたちに持たせる用に使っているが、最近やたらとバッテリー警告の表示が出るのだ。しかも、電池を交換してから数週間でまた警告が出ることが何度かあった。調べると、同じような悩みを抱えている人は少なくないようだ。

たが、どうやら原因は単純で、AirTagと電池の接点をキレイにするだけで解決する場合がある。筆者も「こんな簡単に直るのなら、家中引っかき回して鍵探しに2時間も費やすんじゃなかった…」と思ったほどだ。

●具体的な対処法

用意するものは、問題のAirTagと乾いたマイクロファイバークロスだ。

マイクロファイバー 10枚入（Amazonで価格をチェック）



手順としては、まずAirTagの林檎マークの部分を指で押しながら回す。するとカバーがパカッと外れ、中にあるCR2032電池を取り出せる。

そして、電池をマイクロファイバークロスで優しく拭こう。あまり強くこすらず、できるだけ指の油が付かないように注意する。

最後にAirTag本体の接点部分も軽くクロスで拭いてから、電池を戻してカバーを閉める。これで、もし電池残量の警告が誤表示だとすれば、再装着後にバッテリー残量がフル表示に戻るはずだ。

https://cnet.com,AIは誰の利益を優先しているのか--ウェブの父が投げかける根本的な問い,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230461/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:13:00 GMT","生成AIツールやエージェント、自律型ロボットに関する議論が盛り上がるSouth by Southwest（SXSW）で、ワールド・ワイド・ウェブ（WWW）の考案者であるTim Berners-Lee氏は、あらゆる場面でAIを活用するというビジョンが実現するなら開発者が取り組むべきシンプルな問いを提示した。

「問題は、それが誰のために働くかだ」と、Berners-Lee氏は米国時間3月11日、テキサス州オースティンで開催中のSXSWにおけるロボット工学に関するパネルディスカッションで語った。

チャットボットなどのAIシステムへの信頼は、今回のSXSWにおける議論の中心的テーマになっている。これには、合成データの利用やAI業界の規制方法についての議論も含まれる。

Berners-Lee氏の問いは問題の核心を突いている。企業は自社のAIモデルを、信頼性が高く正確でバイアスのないものにできるかもしれない。しかし、それらが大企業によって開発された以上、開発元の利益を優先しているのか、それともユーザーの利益を優先しているのかという疑問は常につきまとう。

Berners-Lee氏は医師や弁護士を引き合いに出した。医師は大学や医療システム、あるいは開業医として勤務しているかもしれないが、患者の利益のために尽くす義務がある。弁護士もクライアントの最善の利益のために行動する義務がある。しかし、旅行の計画や商品の注文を手伝うAIアシスタントはどうだろうか。それはメーカーの収益を伸ばすように誘導するよう訓練されているかもしれない。

「私はAIに、私のために働き、私がしたい選択を実現できるようにしてほしい」と同氏は言う。「何かを売ろうとしてくるAIは望んでいない」

AIアシスタントに対し、最も得な商品を探すよう頼んだとき、本当に自分にとって最善の商品を探してくれるのか、それともAIにとって最善の商品なのか。ロボット工学の専門家が集まるパネルディスカッションで、Berners-Lee氏は利益相反の可能性を考えるよう呼びかけた。

「常にAIに『誰のために働いているのか』と尋ねるべきだ」と同氏。「あなたの関心や意思決定において、いったい誰の利益を追求しているのかと」

初期のウェブに学ぶ

Berners-Lee氏は、現在のAIを取り巻く環境を90年代初頭のワールド・ワイド・ウェブの黎明期になぞらえている。当時、MicrosoftやNetscapeなどの企業が研究者や活動家たちと手を組み、オープンなインターネットの基盤を構築するためにワールド・ワイド・ウェブ・コンソーシアム（W3C）を発足させた。

「こうした企業は共にウェブを構築していて、われわれはそれを一緒に作り上げた」と同氏は語った。

しかしBerners-Lee氏によると、こうした協力体制は現在の生成AIの世界では起きていないという。各社が競い合い、「超知能」を目指して先を争っているが、W3Cのように標準を策定する機関は存在しない。Berners-Lee氏は、AI開発者たちに同様の組織、または欧州原子核研究機構（CERN）のような組織を作ることを提案している。

「核物理学の分野ではそのような体制があるが、AIには存在しない」（同氏）

https://cnet.com,OpenAIの「小説を書くAI」に賛否、「真に創造的ではない」との指摘も,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230438/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 11:38:00 GMT","OpenAIは創作の分野で限界を押し広げている。同社の最高経営責任者（CEO）であるSam Altman氏は米国時間3月11日、文芸創作を「得意とする」新たなAIモデルを訓練したと、ソーシャルメディア「X」に投稿した。

「AIが書いたもので本当に衝撃を受けたのはこれが初めてだ」とAltman氏は書いている。

同氏が入力したプロンプトは「AIと悲しみについてのメタフィクション短編小説を書いてください」というものだ。

AIは1172語の短編小説を生成した。主人公の「ミラ」が、大切な人である「カイ」を失い、数カ月にわたってAIチャットボットに語りかけるという物語で、語り手はAI自身という設定になっている。

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.



PROMPT:



Please write a metafictional literary short story… — Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025

この作品に対し、説得力に欠けると批判する人がいる一方、「美しい」と称賛する人もいる。

「このAIは悲しみを理解しているだけでなく、悲しみを表現する方法も分かっている。恐ろしくもあり、素晴らしいことでもある」と、あるXユーザーは投稿している。

AIに向けたさらなる野心

今回の動きは、OpenAIが正確性や予測性の向上だけでなく、より広い分野に野心を持ち始めていることを示している。例えば2月、同社は新モデル「GPT-4.5」を発表し、以前のモデルより感情知能が高いと説明した。パターン認識、関連性の整理、創造的な洞察を生成する能力も向上しているという。

Altman氏は、新しい創作向けAIモデルをリリースする時期や方法については未定とした。

市場調査会社ABI Researchのアナリスト、Reece Hayden氏は、知的財産に関する懸念から、AI主導の文芸創作は実用性が限られると警鐘を鳴らしている。

「この発表は、OpenAIが収益性のある製品の開発に苦戦している数学やプログラミングなど数値的分野を離れた、新たな分野の研究開発に基づくものかもしれない」とHayden氏は米CNETに語った。「しかし、知的財産をめぐるクリエイティブ業界の懸念がおそらく現実のものになりつつある中、同社は大きな反発を受ける可能性が高い」。

Hayden氏は、OpenAIの主張がどのようなものであれ、このAIの出力は真に創造的とはいえないと述べた。

「すべての生成AIのユースケースと同様、このAIも情報を集めて再構築しているだけなので、創造的とはいえない。既存の能力を新しい形で応用しただけだ」（同氏）

https://cnet.com,もしアイロボットが倒産したら、あなたの「ルンバ」はどうなる？--「事業継続難しい」と同社表明,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230432/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 10:46:00 GMT","かつてロボット掃除機で圧倒的なシェアを誇ったアイロボットが、今や深刻な財務問題を抱え、先行きが不透明な状況にある。いったい何故ここまで追い込まれたのか。そして、もし同社が倒産した場合、あなたのルンバはどうなるのか？

iRobotは、かつてロボット掃除機の代名詞ともなった「ルンバ」シリーズで市場を席巻した。しかし、同社の業績は深刻だ。同社が米証券取引委員会（SEC）に提出した資料によれば、今後12カ月間の事業継続すら危ういことが示されている。

実際、iRobotは2024年に全従業員の40％をレイオフし、採用を抑制し、オフィスの閉鎖や一部をサブリースに回すなど、あらゆるコスト削減策を講じてきた。その結果、約1億2640万ドルの経費を削減したが、それでも財務は安定していない。

そこで同社は、ロボット掃除機での再浮上を目指し、新機軸のルンバを打ち出した。同シリーズでは、競合する中国メーカーのRoborockなどが取り入れている2枚の回転モップパッドなどを搭載し、ユーザーに機能面でアピールしようとしている。

しかし、この新製品がもし期待ほど売れなかった場合、会社の存続が困難になる可能性が高いと書類には明記されている。監査担当者も「iRobotが今のまま事業を継続できるか疑わしい」という見解を示しており、iRobot自身もほかの企業への売却や合併、新たな融資の確保など、さまざまな選択肢を模索している。

ルンバ対抗「Roborock」のロボット掃除機一覧（Amazon）



●もし倒産したら「ルンバ」はどうなるのか

もしiRobotが本当に事業をたたむ場合、ユーザーがすでに保有しているルンバはどうなるのか。

まず、ルンバ自体はオフラインでも最低限の機能で動くため、電源を入れてボタンを押せば掃除は可能だ。ただ、クラウドサーバーに依存するようなアップデートやスマートホーム連携（AlexaやGoogleアシスタントからの音声操作など）はサポートが切れるだろう。アプリのバグ修正やセキュリティ更新が止まるため、ネットワークにつないだままだと脆弱性が放置される可能性もある。

さらに、交換用フィルターやブラシ、ダストバッグなどの部品を入手するのも難しくなり、サードパーティに頼るしかなくなるだろう。

●なぜここまで経営が悪化してしまったのか

なぜiRobotはここまで経営が苦しくなってしまったのか。大きな要因としては、市場の変化によって借り入れの返済が厳しくなり、ロボット掃除機市場での地位も中国メーカーの台頭によって脅かされたことだ。同社は2023年、Amazonとの合併審査中の資金繰りを支えるため、カーライル・グループから2億ドルの融資を受けた。しかし結局、Amazonによる買収話は破談し、負債だけが残った。

大規模なレイオフを含むコスト削減もむなしく、2024年の収益は2023年比で23.4％減の6億8180万ドルに落ち込み、資金繰りはさらに悪化した。融資条件の一時的な猶予を得るために追加費用や株式ワラントを発行し、現在は2025年5月6日までなんとか延命している状況だ。しかし、もしその期限までに融資先との合意を延長できなければ、デフォルト（債務不履行）に陥る恐れがある。

こうした苦しい状況について同社は、ロボット掃除機市場における中国企業の攻勢、消費需要の低下、さらに世界的な経済動向などが要因だと説明している。iRobotとしては、新製品ラインナップの成功とともに有利な売却先や合併先を見つけることで打開を図りたい考えだ。

結論として、iRobotが今すぐ倒産する可能性は高くはないが、もしそうなった場合、ルンバは最低限の掃除機能は保ちつつもアップデートやサポートが受けられなくなり、パーツ供給も厳しくなると想定される。今後の新製品が市場でどう受け止められるかが、同社の明暗を分けるカギになりそうだ。

Qlik Talend Cloudを導入する前は、データを連携させるための開発コストが大きな課題だった。なぜなら、連携するシステムやデータごとに、詳細な設計や開発、テストを外部ベンダーに発注する必要があり、多くの費用と時間がかかっていた。さらに、基幹システムへの影響をできるだけ少なくするために、データの更新は1日に1回、夜間バッチ処理に限られていた。そのため、リアルタイムでの分析や活用に必要なデータの品質を満たせないことがあった。

Qlik Talend Cloudが導入されたことで、データは常に最新の状態に保たれ、社内で容易にデータ連携モジュールを開発できるようになった。また、Qlik Talend Cloudの「Change Data Capture」技術により、業務のピーク時でも基幹システムに過度な負荷をかけることなく、継続的な同期と更新が可能になった。サッポロは、2025年6月に営業、物流、財務の各領域に統合データ基盤を展開し、将来的には全社的なデータ民主化を加速させる予定だ。

サッポロホールディングス DX・IT統括本部 DX企画部 部長の梅原修一氏は、次のように述べる、「Qlikは、サッポロのデータ利活用による利益効果の最大化に大いに役立つと考えている。Qlik Talend Cloudのローコード開発とユーザーフレンドリーなUI（ユーザーインターフェース）により、新しいデータソースとの統合を内製で迅速に構築できるようになり、データ連携の構築にかかる将来コストを約80％削減し、開発期間も75％以上短縮した計画が可能になった」",cnet
https://cnet.com,デロイト、レガシーシステムの近代化を支援--独自ツールで「COBOL」から「Java」に自動変換,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230456/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 13:18:00 GMT","デロイト トーマツ コンサルティング（デロイト）は3月13日、企業で長年利用されてきたレガシーシステムを、独自のツールを用いてモダナイズ（近代化）する新サービスを4月から本格的に展開すると発表した。システム内の「COBOL」を「Java」に自動変換した上で、マイクロサービス化する機能などが特徴。同社の専門家チームとワークショップを通じてサービスを体感できる施設も都内に設ける。

レガシーシステムは、保守人材の不足などからブラックボックス化しており、DXを推進する上での障害となっている。経済産業省は、これを「2025年の崖」と表現し、産業界に対してシステムの刷新を呼びかけてきた。しかし、同社によると、追加開発を繰り返したことによる現状把握の困難さ、影響範囲の広さ、データ移行やテストにかかる作業量の膨大さなどから、10年前後の期間と数百億円の費用をかけたにもかかわらず、クラウドへの単純移行にとどまり、新たなビジネス価値を創出できないまま企業側が断念するケースも見られるという。

特に金融業界で多く使われているメインフレームは、2035年にかけて一部メーカーで製造・販売が終了し、保守も打ち切りとなる予定である。そのため、利用企業ではメインフレームで主流だったCOBOLからの移行が急務とされている。さらに「技術的な更新や表面的な改善だけでなく、システム全体の価値や機能性、柔軟性、効率性を大幅に向上させた上で、ビジネスプロセスの変革や新しいビジネスモデルの創出など『本当の意味でのモダナイゼーション』が、各企業にとってライバルとの競争に必達となっている」（デロイト）

新サービスでは、独自ツール「innoWake」を利用する。グローバルでメインフレームも刷新事例が100以上あるといい、全ての案件でクラウドやオープンシステムへの移行が成功とのこと。具体的には次のような特徴が挙げられている。

自動コード変換：メインフレームで稼働しているCOBOLを1行単位で、Javaなどのオープン言語に1対1で自動変換。ソースコードの構造変更を極力少なくすることで、不良の発生リスクを抑え、低リスクと時間短縮を両立

自動移行：メインフレーム上のデータベース（DB）を、オンプレミスまたはクラウド上の表形式のデータベースに自動移行

DBカッターとモノリスカッター：レガシーシステムからの脱却では従来、クラウド環境に移行してプログラミング言語をJavaに単純変換するのみにとどまることが一般的だが、innoWakeではJavaに変換後、塊になっている業務処理のプログラムやデータベースを、独立したプログラムやコンポーネントに機械的に分解するマイクロサービス化が可能

生成AI機能：レガシーシステムの分析のために平易な質問文で該当箇所を検索したり、処理内容を回答したりする。プログラムやコンポーネントのソースコードに設計書が無い場合に設計書を自動生成、アセンブラープログラムをJavaに再実装する際には、要件定義と要求機能を導出して自動でコードを生成する

システム刷新の進め方については、COBOLのロジックや金融・保険など各業界特有のITシステム近代化のトレンド、ビジネスプロセス改善といった専門的な知見に精通したメンバーで、プロジェクトごとに専門チームを編成し、各企業と協力して進めていくとしている。

デロイトはまた、企業のIT企画部門やDX推進部門の役員・マネジメント層が、レガシーシステムのモダナイゼーションの進め方を体感するための施設「Application Modernization Studio Tokyo」を都内に開設した。",cnet
https://cnet.com,生成AIが企業のIT組織やベンダーとの関係性を変容--ガートナーが見解示す,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230448/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:18:00 GMT","ガートナージャパンは3月13日、生成AIが企業のIT組織業務やITベンダーとの関係性を大きく変容させるとの見解を発表した。

近年のDXの推進は、IT組織を取り巻く環境に大きな変化をもたらした。データサイエンスやAIアーキテクチャーなど、従来のIT組織には未知のスキルが要求される業務が増えている一方で、クラウドサービスや生成AI、ローコード開発ツールなどの活用により、省力化・効率化できるIT業務の範囲も拡大している。さらに、DX専門組織の分離設立や、エンドユーザーである事業部門が自らITシステムを導入するなど、社内における組織の多様化と拡散が始まっている。

ガートナーでは、2028年までに日本企業のIT組織の40％が内製業務において「ミニマリズム（最小限主義）」を志向するというシナリオを予測している。意思決定機能や管理機能の一部など、主体性が求められる業務の内製は必要となるが、それ以外の業務については、ITベンダーへのアウトソーシング、クラウドサービスの導入による開発・運用保守業務の負荷軽減、生成AIやそれを組み込んだAIエージェントの活用による業務の省人化、さらには事業部門のIT担当者への業務移行などの動きが進むと考えている。

ユーザー企業の期待とサービスの成果物にギャップ

生成AIやAIエージェントによって社内のさまざまな業務が代替可能になることで、企業のリソース不足が解消されると期待されている。しかしながら、多くの企業では、生成AIの業務適用を自社のみで完結させることは難しく、ITベンダーへのアウトソースによってノウハウ不足を補っているのが現状。一方で、そのITベンダーでも増大する顧客の需要に十分に対応できていない状況がうかがえる。

ガートナーは次のように指摘する。「生成AIをビジネスで活用する際、国内企業は通常、アウトソーサーから何らかの支援を受ける。特にビジネスノウハウに長けたコンサルティングベンダーへの期待が大きく、こうした需要を商機と見る多くのコンサルティングベンダーが、生成AIのライフサイクル全般にわたるサービスを展開している」

しかし、実際にサービスを受けた企業の大半は、その効果を期待以下と評価しているという。「効果的な学習や精度向上には高度なテクノロジーが不可欠であるが、ビジネスノウハウと比較して、テクノロジーノウハウが発展途上にあるコンサルティングベンダーが依然として多い」（ガートナー）

バイスプレジデント アナリストの海老名剛氏は次のように述べる。「顧客企業側には『コンサルに任せておけば安心』という油断も見られ、コンサルティングベンダーにどこまで任せるべきか、また、彼らが提案・納品する成果物が十分に検証されない場合が少なくない。生成AIのビジネスへの適用範囲は広がり続けている。今後も顧客の期待とサービスの成果物のギャップは容易には埋まらず、生成AIの適用範囲の急速な拡大によってむしろそのギャップが拡大する恐れがある」

ガートナーでは、2028年まで生成AI関連のコンサルティングサービス契約の70％が顧客の期待と成果物のミスマッチを解消できないとみている。

海老名氏は補足する。「生成AI活用のコンサルティングサービスの契約では、委託期間だけでなく、戦略策定、企画、生成AIの選定、実装といった対象工程の観点でも契約スコープを明確にする必要がある。その上で、各工程での現実的な成果物についても合意することが重要である」

AIや生成AIをベンダー評価にも活用

一方、ガートナーは、2028年までに、ITベンダーを評価する企業のうち、半数が信頼性向上のために、ベンダーの活動をAIで分析するようになるという予測も立てている。

現在、多くの国内企業が定期的に取引先ベンダーの評価を実施しているが、取引先ベンダーの振る舞いや知見に関する評価は、ベンダーとやりとりするIT担当者へのアンケート調査による定性的な評価にとどまることが多く、客観性に乏しく、信頼性に不安があるという。

こうした課題を解決するために、生成AI機能の活用に期待が寄せられている。例えば、ベンダーとの議事録やメール、チャットといった日々の活動データを多角的に分析し、彼らの課題点をAIに提案させることで、ベンダー評価の精度を大幅に高めることができる可能性があるとする。

シニアディレクター アナリストの土屋隆一氏は次のように述べている。「生成AIは人によるベンダー評価を補完するものと位置付け、まず対象を1～2社に限定して検証を開始することが推奨される。その際、AIに分析させるデータは、最初は比較的信頼性の高い議事録データなどを優先することが望ましいだろう」",cnet

FlashBlade//EXAの提供開始は2025年夏頃とされているが、6月中旬には同社の年次イベント「Pure//Accelerate 2025」が開催予定のため、そこで提供開始が発表されると予想される。



Pure Storage CTO & VP APJのMatt Oostveen氏 Pure Storage CTO & VP APJのMatt Oostveen氏

FlashBlade//EXAについて説明した米Pure Storageで最高技術責任者（CTO） 兼 アジア太平洋・日本地域担当（APJ）バイスプレジデント（VP）を務めるMatt Oostveen（マット・ウーストヴィーン）氏は急速に盛り上がっているAI関連技術に関して、高価なリソースであるGPUの利用率が低いことを課題として挙げ、「われわれの調査では、GPUの利用率は典型的には10％にも満たない」と指摘した。

その原因として、同氏は「メタデータのボトルネック」を挙げた。AI分野におけるメタデータの使われ方として、Oostveen氏は「自動運転のような用途を考えた場合、膨大な量の動画データに対して、注目すべきポイントなどを指示するためのメタデータが独立した小サイズのファイルとして多数関連付けられる形になる」と説明した。

巨大なファイルの内容を一気に読み出すのは速度を稼ぎやすいが、小さなファイルを多数次々にアクセスしていくのはオーバーヘッドが大きくなりがちなので、それぞれの全く異なるアクセスパターンに対して適切に最適化することで全体のパフォーマンスを向上できるというのが、FlashBlade//EXAの基本的なアイデアである。

FlashBlade//EXAではメタデータをメタデータノードに、データをデータノードに格納することでそれぞれを独立して拡張可能とし、ラック辺りのI/O帯域幅は3.4TB/sに達するという（図1）。単一のネームスペースでエクサバイトクラスまで拡張可能だといい、例えば3ラックで単一ネームスペース構成とした場合、読み取り性能で10TB/s以上の性能が達成できるという。

一般向けに製品提供が開始されるのは前述の通り夏頃の予定となっており、詳細な情報はその際に公表されると思われるが、大規模なAI向けインフラを構築するユーザーにとっては注目すべき新製品といえるだろう。なお、今回の発表は米NVIDIAの年次イベント「GTC」に合わせて実施されたもので、Pure StorageとNVIDIAはAI向けインフラの分野で密接なパートナーシップを構築している。

FlashBlade//EXAの特徴として、Oostveen氏は性能の高さに加えて拡張性の高さや独自のフラッシュモジュール（DFM）による高密度実装やコストパフォーマンスの高さを強調すると同時に、NVIDIAとは既に検証作業を進めており、今後同社の認定を取得する予定だという。",cnet

Some of Silicon Valley’s most successful startups – including Stripe, AirBnB, and Reddit – started out in a YC batch.

Today, YC’s newer startups are focused on building the next big thing in AI. In this batch, we noticed a surprising number of startups creating tools to enhance other companies’ AI agents. Rather than building their own AI agents, these startups are building support tools. There’s no shortage of companies building AI agent tools today, but these managed to stick out from the crowd.

There are some honorable mentions that didn’t quite make this list, but still managed to catch our attention. There’s Optifye, a startup that’s building software to manage factory workers, which was embroiled in a social controversy a few weeks ago. There’s also Artificial Societies, which runs AI simulations to test how well your LinkedIn posts will do in a simulated version of your network.

YC has always accepted some eye catching companies, but here are the startups we think are worth paying attention to in YC W25.

What it does: API for agent teleoperation

Why it’s a fave: One of the key reasons Waymo has been successful at deploying autonomous robotaxis is because humans can remotely take over a vehicle if one ever gets stuck. Abundant took that same idea, teleoperation, and built a platform that applies it to all AI agents. Abundant says its API allows it to catch when an AI agent fails, and allow one of its human operators to step in and take over.

What it does: Lets AI agents navigate browsers

Why it’s a fave: Coincidentally, Browser Use went viral earlier this week because a Chinese AI agent, Manus, used its open source tool to click through site menus and fill out forms on browsers. Daily downloads quintupled to 28,000, one of the founders told TechCrunch. As web browsing AI agents, such as OpenAI’s Operator, are taking off, Browser Use seems to be offering a compelling open source tool that enables them.

What it does: replaces tedious grading work with AI

Why it’s a fave: Teaching assistants (TAs) are the backbone of any modern university, quietly grading papers for professors and doing other grunt work. But grading piles of repetitive papers might not be the best use of a TA’s time when they could be directly teaching students. Founded by Cornell TAs who openly declare that they “hate grading,” GradeWiz uses AI tools to automate the task so TAs can make better use of their time.

What it does: Robinhood for Pokemon cards

What it’s a fave: Misprint has a cool origin story: its co-founder Eva Herget quit her job at Goldman Sachs to sell Pokemon cards full-time, raking in $40,000 a month. Now, Herget and her co-founder have launched a platform for selling cards and other collectibles that allows users to treat them more like stocks, using a bid/ask system. It’s not a small market: $3.5 billion of secondhand Pokemon cards are sold every year, Misprint says.

What it does: uses AI to find the best vibe coders

Why it’s a fave: AI-assisted ‘vibe coding’ is all the rage, with a YC partner recently saying that a quarter of YC startups have codebases that are 95% AI-generated. But AI-assisted coding isn’t just cheating: it’s a skill in and of itself. Nextbyte says it helps companies find the best ‘vibe coders’ thanks to an AI model that powers interview questions testing coders’ skills at leveraging AI.

What it does: AI clone for Zoom calls

Why it’s a fave: Who hasn’t popped into a Zoom meeting for work with a bad case of bed hair or barely-concealed pajama pants? Pickle solves this by letting you ‘clone’ an ideal version yourself and putting that much better-composed individual onto the screen, lip-syncing to your voice in real-time. As a (mostly) remote team, we really hope Pickle – which says it has over 1,500 paying users so far – can pull this one off.

What it does: AI agents to automate restaurant management

Why it’s a fave: I’ve worked enough jobs waiting tables to know that managing a restaurant is not an exact science. Managing restaurant inventory is often done in Google Sheets, and involves lots of calling and emailing with suppliers. Rebolt tries to automate some of that work with AI agents, and the company says its in pricing discussions with the parent company of Burger King.

What it does: A Roomba for weeds on a farm

Why it’s a fave: Weeds kill farms, but removing those weeds is a difficult task that requires lots of human labor. Founded by a former Apple hardware lead, Red Barn Robotics claims its weeding robot, which it calls “The Field Hand,” is 15x faster than a human and a quarter of the price. The company has already signed $5 million in LOIs for the upcoming growing season.

What it does: a vintage clothing marketplace curated by AI

Why it’s a fave: If you’ve ever shopped for vintage clothing online, you know that it can be an overwhelming experience. There’s lots of options, and it’s hard to assess the quality.

https://techcrunch.com,Minimalist Light Phone III launches March 27,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/minimalist-light-phone-iii-launches-march-27/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Light, the maker of a minimalist phone designed to help consumers disconnect from smartphone distractions and social media, will launch its newest model, the Light Phone III, on March 27. This version of the device, like its older counterpart, offers a simple black-and-white display and necessary features like support for calls, texts, navigation, alarms, hotspots, a calendar, and more, including music. However, the upgraded device now ships with a 3.92-inch AMOLED display instead of an e-paper screen.

It also adds a camera and NFC chip for future payment tools.

First announced last summer, the Light Phone III improves repairability, as you can now access the battery, and replace the screen and USB port.

The company said it also tried to improve the device’s usability and performance, making it approximately the width of most iPhones for easier use.

“It actually will keep a lot of the characteristics that people love about the e-Ink screen, [with it] feeling much different than a glossy smartphone screen,” Light co-founder Joe Hollier explained last year, when the phone was first introduced.

As before, customers will be able to choose whether they want to use the unlocked device as their main phone or simply as a backup for those times they want to disconnect without losing access to critical tools to navigate modern life.

Light sells its own data plans starting at $30 per month for 1 GB of data.

However, the Light Phone III’s upgrades will increase the price point a bit. Instead of $299, like the older, e-ink device, the Light Phone III will be available for $599 for a limited time.

The price will later increase to $799, the website indicates.

https://techcrunch.com,Bluesky quickly sold out of the T-shirt its CEO wore to troll Mark Zuckerberg,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/bluesky-quickly-sold-out-of-the-t-shirt-its-ceo-wore-to-troll-mark-zuckerberg/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","When Bluesky CEO Jay Graber took the SXSW stage this week, she managed to make fun of Mark Zuckerberg without mentioning Meta at all. Her black T-shirt was emblazoned with black text stretching across the chest and sleeves, similar to the style of a T-shirt that the billionaire founder wore at an event last year. Graber’s shirt declared in Latin, Mundus sine Caesaribus. Or, “a world without Caesars.”

On Bluesky, users expressed such excitement over Graber’s T-shirt that the platform decided to sell replicas to raise money for its developer ecosystem.

The $40 shirt available in sizes S – XL sold out in roughly 30 minutes.

Zuckerberg has drawn comparisons between himself and the Roman dictator Julius Caesar — the particular shirt of his that Graber is referencing said Aut Zuck aut nihil, or “Zuck or nothing.” It’s a nod to the Latin phrase Aut Caesar aut nihil, befitting of the Roman leader’s regime. (Yes, it is weird that Zuck goes out of his way to compare himself to a violent dictator.)

Though it’s tiny compared to Meta’s empire, Bluesky’s decentralized, open source infrastructure imagines a form of social media where individual executives don’t hold all the power.

It creates the opportunity for any developer to contribute to the platform’s growth. So, Graber’s shirt isn’t just a petty swipe at a much larger competitor — it represents the ethos that Bluesky is trying to live up to.

“If a billionaire came in and bought Bluesky, or took it over, or if I decided tomorrow to change things in a way that people really didn’t like, then they could fork off and go on to another application,” Graber said at SXSW. “There’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network, or you could build a new one as well. And so that openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative.”",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Apple’s Lockdown Mode is good for security — but its notifications are baffling,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/apples-lockdown-mode-is-good-for-security-but-its-notifications-are-baffling/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","As a paranoid journalist, I am an enthusiastic user of Apple’s opt-in “extreme protection” feature, Lockdown Mode.

Apple launched Lockdown Mode in 2022, and since then the security feature is considered a must-use for dissidents in corrupt countries, human-rights defenders in oppressive regimes, and journalists speaking truth to power.

Lockdown Mode is designed to switch off some features in iPhones, iPads, and Macs, with the goal of reducing the likelihood that hackers armed with sophisticated spyware or zero-days — unknown flaws in systems that allow attackers to stealthily exploit them — can successfully break Apple’s operating system protections and spy on its users.

In practice, Lockdown Mode removes some normal Apple device features, such as fonts loaded from the internet that can track you, the ability to receive certain types of files, your location data from photos that you share, support for 2G cellular connectivity, and letting people who haven’t contacted you before reach you over FaceTime and iMessage; although it’s unclear if the latter is the case (more on that later).

In exchange for these nuisances, Lockdown Mode makes it harder for you to get hacked, even by some of the most advanced hackers out there.

Lockdown Mode already has a track record of blocking those advanced attacks. Apple says it is not aware of any successful hack against its users who have enabled Lockdown Mode, and digital rights group Citizen Lab has documented an attempted spyware attack blocked by Lockdown Mode. I, too, have personally heard some people in the offensive security industry complain about Lockdown Mode making their exploits more difficult.

But three years after its debut, exactly how Lockdown Mode works is still shrouded in obscurity and lacks explanations into the reasoning behind what actions Lockdown Mode takes. And, some of Lockdown Mode’s notifications are downright confusing, unexplained, or seemingly random, which might discourage some users from using it altogether.

Blocked, but why?

Let me preface this by saying that people who are at risk from government hackers must use Lockdown Mode, even considering the restrictions that come with it.

Those restrictions are not the problem. Lockdown Mode’s notifications have become increasingly puzzling.

Case in point: The other day, I received this Lockdown Mode notification (below) out of nowhere, mentioning someone by name who I haven’t talked to in months, and from whom I did not receive a message or a call afterward. Following this notification, when I asked if she tried to contact me, she said that no, she did not.

Someone also told me that as they were scrolling through their contacts, one of their friends saw a “Lockdown Mode blocked…” notification with his name on, suggesting Lockdown Mode can be triggered simply by viewing someone’s contact.

But … why?

For months I have been getting the same notification telling me that Lockdown Mode blocked someone “from contacting” me every time I use iMessage, and it always mentions someone I know and who is already in my contacts.

These notifications often pop up when I am already messaging that person on iMessage, which makes it unclear if I am going to stop getting their messages, or worse, that some of their messages have already disappeared thanks to Lockdown Mode.

Hell, maybe this means I am getting hacked, or at least targeted? Should I get my phone checked every time I get one of these notifications?

It turns out I can still keep chatting with the very people that Lockdown Mode claims to have blocked. These people are quite literally contacting me, and I am chatting with them. What is Lockdown Mode actually doing here?

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop

Tapping on Lockdown Mode notifications does nothing. You aren’t redirected to an Apple website that explains what Lockdown Mode is or does, nor does it explain what these notifications specifically mean.

“I don’t think these messages are helpful. They do not include any context and are not actionable, nor is there a way to figure out what’s going on,” Runa Sandvik, a hacker who has a startup that helps journalists and other high-risk people protect themselves, told TechCrunch. “I’d love to see Apple either share more information so that we know what to ‘do’ with them, or not display them at all.”

Sandvik and I are not the only ones left scratching our chins every time we see Lockdown Mode notifications. When I wrote about my concerns about Lockdown Mode on social media, several people responded publicly — and in private — saying they have had similar experiences and are also confused.

My editor Zack Whittaker, for example, has for months been sporadically getting Lockdown Mode notifications saying “an unknown contact attempted to share control of Apple Music,” as well as a notification that Lockdown Mode “blocked Focus Sharing” and “won’t be shared with other people when in Lockdown” (I also get this notification from time to time).

To the lab we go

I decided to run an experiment with the help of Harlo Holmes, chief information security officer and the director of digital security at Freedom of the Press Foundation, a non-profit that helps support the free press. I wondered if it made any difference — in terms of triggering the confusing notifications — whether someone not in my contacts tried to reach out to me with Lockdown Mode enabled on my phone, and what type of content it would block.

We both deleted each other from our contact lists (we’re still friends, though), and started chatting for the first time ever on iMessage. When Holmes texted me — and neither of us were in each others’ contact lists — I received the “Lockdown Mode blocked…” notification, this time displaying her phone number. I still received her message.

We exchanged text, emojis, a cat picture, and iMessage “stickers.” All of these went through, except for the stickers, which turned to either a Unicode character of a question mark, or a nondescript file attachment, which can’t be opened, even if you tap on it:

When this happened, both Holmes and I could still see the stickers we sent from our own phones, meaning the blocking was only visible to the recipient. That is also the case for the “Lockdown Mode blocked…” notification. I received the notification, but Holmes didn’t know I got it.

This makes sense, as Apple wouldn’t want to tip off government hackers that their attempt to hack someone not only didn’t work, but also alerted the targeted individual that something went wrong.

That’s good to know, and again, I am happy Lockdown Mode blocks something, and makes me safer, but I still don’t know what these notifications are supposed to tell me.

I reached out to Apple asking them for some explanations, but an Apple spokesperson did not provide on the record remarks by press time. At least the spokesperson acknowledged receiving my message, so I know Lockdown Mode didn’t block it.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Meta is launching Community Notes in the US next week,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/meta-is-launching-community-notes-in-the-us-next-week/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Next week, Meta will begin one of the company’s most significant overhauls ever for how it fact-checks information on its platforms.

On March 18, Meta will start releasing its version of Community Notes for Facebook, Instagram, and Threads users in the United States. The program copies a crowdsourced fact-checking system that Twitter unveiled in 2021 and that became the sole means of correcting misleading information after Elon Musk turned the platform into X.

Meta executives say they’re focused on getting Community Notes right in the U.S. before it rolls the feature out to other countries. It’s a high-stakes region for testing a major new feature, given that the U.S. is Meta’s most lucrative market, but Meta may be hesitant to roll out Community Notes in other regions such as the European Union, where the European Commission is currently investigating X over the effectiveness of its Community Notes feature.

The move could also signal Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s eagerness to appease the Trump administration, which has previously criticized Meta for censoring conservative viewpoints.

Facebook users in the U.S. will soon see community notes. Image Credits:Meta Clicking notes will show more info. Image Credits:Meta

Zuckerberg first announced these changes in January as part of a broader effort to give oxygen to more perspectives on his platforms. Since 2016, Meta has relied on third-party fact-checkers to verify information on its platforms, but Neil Potts, Meta’s VP of Public Policy, told reporters in a briefing on Wednesday that the systems were too biased, not scalable enough, and made too many mistakes.

For example, Potts said Meta applied false fact-checking labels to an opinion article on climate change that appeared in Fox News and the Wall Street Journal. In another case, Zuckerberg recently said on Joe Rogan’s podcast that Meta should not have dismissed concerns around COVID-19 vaccines as misinformation.

Meta hopes that Community Notes will address the public perception that it’s biased, as well as make fewer mistakes and serve as a more scalable fact-checking system that ultimately addresses more misinformation. However, Meta notes this system does not replace Community Standards — the company’s rules that dictate whether posts are considered hate speech, scams, or other banned content.

The overhaul of Meta’s fact-checking systems comes at a time when many tech companies are trying to address the perceived historical biases against conservatives. X has led the industry’s effort, with Elon Musk claiming to center his social platform around “free speech.” OpenAI recently announced it was changing how it trains AI models to embrace “intellectual freedom” and said it would work to not censor certain viewpoints.

Rachel Lambert, Meta’s Director of Product Management, said in the Wednesday briefing that Meta is basing its new fact-checking system off of X’s open source algorithms around Community Notes.

Meta opened applications for contributors to its Community Notes network in February. Meta’s contributors will be able to suggest notes that directly fact-check claims in a post on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads. Other contributors will then rate a note as helpful or not helpful, determining in part whether the Community Note will appear to other users.

Contributors can rate a note’s helpfulness. Image Credits:Meta Image Credits:Meta

Much like X’s system, Meta’s Community Notes system evaluates which contributors normally disagree on posts. Using this information, Meta will only display a note if sides that typically oppose each other agree that a note is helpful.

Even if a majority of Meta’s contributors believe a Community Note is needed, it doesn’t mean one will be shown. Further, Meta says it won’t downrank a post or account in its algorithms even if a Community Note is shown on a post.

For years, crowdsourced systems like Community Notes have been seen as a promising solution to address misinformation on social media, but they have drawbacks.

On the positive side, researchers have found that people tend to see Community Notes as more trustworthy than flags from third-party fact-checkers, according to a study published in the journal Science Advances.

In another large-scale study on X’s fact-checking system, researchers with the University of Luxembourg found that posts with Community Notes attached to them reduced the spread of misleading posts by 61%, on average.

But a lot of posts don’t get notes attached to them, or it takes too long. Because X, and soon Meta, require Community Notes to reach a consensus among contributors with opposing viewpoints, it often means that fact-checks are only added after a post has reached thousands or millions of people.

The same University of Luxembourg study also found that Community Notes may be too slow to intervene in the early and most viral stage of a post’s lifespan.

A recent study from the Center for Counseling Digital Hate highlights the conundrum. Researchers took a sample of posts containing election misinformation on X and found that contributors suggested accurate, relevant information on these posts 81% of the time.

Yet of those posts that received suggestions, only 9% received consensus among contributors, meaning that a large majority of these posts didn’t appear with any fact-checks.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,"Move over, Apple: Meet the alternative app stores coming to the EU",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/move-over-apple-meet-the-alternative-app-stores-coming-to-the-eu/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a regulation designed to foster increased competition in the app ecosystem. Like Apple’s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple’s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through a notarization process to ensure they meet some “baseline platform integrity standards,” Apple says — like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.

To run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple’s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includes paying a new Core Technology Fee of €0.50 for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple’s DMA business terms.

Despite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple’s walls.

Below is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.

AltStore PAL

Co-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator app Delta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. The open source app store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore’s makers, Delta, and a clipboard manager, called Clip.

Unlike Apple’s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a “source” that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you’ll see in the AltStore are those you’ve added yourselves.

Some popular apps that users are adding include the virtual machine app UTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad; OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that’s built in SwiftUI; Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting app iTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices called qBitControl; and social discovery platform PeopleDrop.

Setapp Mobile

MacPaw’s Setapp became one of the first companies to agree to Apple’s new DMA business terms to set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it released Setapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn’t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.

Setapp Mobile is available to users on the “Power User” and “AI Expert” Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new “iOS Advanced” plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp’s main subscription and Setapp Mobile at $9.99/€9.49 monthly or $107.88/€102.48 yearly.

In addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for “Family” and “Teams”) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.

Epic Games Store

Fortnite maker Epic Games launched its alternative iOS app store in the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it’s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it’s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide’s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.

The move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic’s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit did pave the way for developers to link to their own websites for a reduced commission.

Aptoide

An alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-based Aptoide is an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.

The iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you’ll need to put your email on a waitlist to get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn’t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.

Across all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.

Mobivention marketplace

A B2B-focused app store, the Mobivention marketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can’t — or shouldn’t — be published in Apple’s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention’s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.

Skich

In March, Skich announced the launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to “match” with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich’s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,UiPath looks for a path to growth with Peak agentic AI acquisition,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/uipath-is-looking-for-a-path-to-growth-in-agentic-ai-with-its-peak-ai-acquisition/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A rush of agentic AI solutions is hitting the enterprise market, and now one of the bigger players in automation has scooped up a startup in the space in hopes of taking a bigger piece of that market. UiPath, as part of a quarterly result report last night that spelled tougher times ahead, also delivered what it hopes might prove a silver lining. It said it had acquired Peak.ai, a startup founded originally in Manchester, England.

Peak builds “decision-making” AI, covering functions like pricing and inventory management for companies in retail and manufacturing. Daniel Dines, the founder and CEO of UiPath, said was buying it as part of a strategy to build out more AI and automation services for specific verticals.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but sources familiar with the it told TechCrunch that Peak.ai was not looking for a buyer, nor was it at the end of its runway, and the deal was in cash. Robert Anton, whose firm Oxx was one of Peak.ai’s backers, said in an interview that he was “very happy” with the outcome.

Peak last raised money back in 2021, when SoftBank backed the company with $75 million. PitchBook notes that round had valued the company at around $267 million post-money, on a total of $121 million raised from investors that included Octopus, MMC and OurCrowd.

However, Peak reported revenue of just under £9 million ($11.6 million), up 17% from the previous year, in the year ended December 31, 2023, according to its last company accounts filed with Companies House in the U.K.

“Peak continued to grow in a global market, despite facing strong economic headwinds,” the company noted in the filing.

Those headwinds are hitting bigger companies, too. UiPath on Wednesday said its revenue in the fourth quarter increased just 5% to $424 million from a year earlier.

While UiPath beat analyst estimates for net profit for the quarter, it cut its revenue forecast for FY 2026 to between $1.525 billion and $1.530 billion, citing “increasing global macroeconomic uncertainty.” That sent the company’s NYSE-listed shares falling. They were down 18% in pre-market trading on Thursday at the time of writing.

The revised forecast follows a tough year for the company, which in July 2024 laid off 10% of its workforce after lowering full-year expectations for fiscal year 2025.

UiPath currently has a market cap of about $6.5 billion.

Peak could potentially help its new owner bolster revenue growth. The two companies already had partnerships prior to the acquisition, and the idea is that the deal will give UiPath more opportunities to cross-sell its wider set of solutions to Peak’s customers, as well as capture more of Peak’s overall revenue.

UiPath got its start in robotic process automation — “software robots” that let businesses run more routine and rote work in automated flows. The company saw unprecedented growth as a startup. “I’ve never seen an enterprise company grow this fast,” one of its investors told us at one point. That growth catapulted UiPath to a valuation of $35 billion when it was still private.

That growth, in hindsight, may well have spelled out the appetite for the AI that was just around the corner. But strictly speaking, UiPath’s RPA was not AI. It was only later that it started figuring out how AI fit into that picture.

In contrast, Peak’s been in an interesting position, catching on to the opportunity to build AI assistants for businesses years before OpenAI hit the market and sparked a wider conversation, and a lot of hype, around how AI would impact the world of business.

But being early also meant that AI was a harder sell for the startup at times. In its account filing with Companies House, Peak noted that would-be customers saw AI as a “gamble” but that perception had started to shift over 2023, and it was picking up new interest specifically in the U.S. manufacturing sector. With Romania-founded UiPath now effectively a U.S. company, this will potentially give it a clearer channel into that market.

“The ability to seamlessly integrate decision intelligence with automation presents an unprecedented opportunity to redefine how businesses operate,” Peak’s three founders, Richard Potter (CEO), David Leitch (CIO) and Atul Sharma (CTO), said in a message today announcing the acquisition.

Seamless integration and a willing audience of buyers is the pitch, at least. Whether it bears out is the hope.

“With the acquisition of Peak, we are accelerating our mission to strengthen our vertical AI solutions strategy,” said Dines in a statement. “When combined with the UiPath platform, Peak’s exceptional purpose-built AI applications will enhance our ability to provide solutions that optimize industry-specific use cases and deliver incredible value to customers.”

The accounts were frozen in February, but the new documents make public details that had previously been unknown, including a full list of the nonprofits under FBI scrutiny.

The funds were disbursed as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, a law passed by Congress in 2022. Of that, the EPA received $14 billion for a National Clean Investment Fund, which provides grants to green banks.

Green banks use those funds to provide financing for clean technology projects around the country. Startups that have technologies that are ready to scale commercially were eligible to receive financing to make projects a reality.

The funding was mostly to be used for loans, which were to be paid back and recycled for future lending. Green banks tend to have delinquency rates on par with commercial and residential portfolios held by other commercial lenders.

Citibank was selected as the financial agent to administer that money, holding it in accounts under the names of the awardees. It is also administering a separate, $6 billion Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program. The EPA’s contract with Citibank was publicly announced in April 2024.

The FBI has requested that Citibank place 30-day administrative freezes on accounts held by nonprofits that were recipients of the green bank funding. It also asked the bank to freeze other nonprofit and state government agency accounts, including Habitat for Humanity, United Way, the Colorado Clean Energy Fund, and New York State Department of Taxation and Finance.

Three nonprofits that received green bank funds have sued Citibank, asking the bank to release the money in their accounts.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has said that the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund doesn’t align with the agency’s priorities and that he has concerns about fraud, though he has not provided evidence to support that claim.

In a hearing on Wednesday, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia questioned a Justice Department attorney representing the EPA.

“Can you proffer any evidence that [the grant] was illegal, or evidence of abuse or fraud or bribery — that any of that was improperly or unlawfully done, other than the fact that Mr. Zeldin doesn’t like it?” Judge Tanya Chutkan said.

Judge Chutkan also ordered the Justice Department to provide the court with details about the alleged fraud, “because I don’t have the credible evidence that’s required.”

“The U.S. needs to pursue an active international economic policy to advocate for American values and support AI innovation internationally,” Google wrote in the document. “For too long, AI policymaking has paid disproportionate attention to the risks, often ignoring the costs that misguided regulation can have on innovation, national competitiveness, and scientific leadership — a dynamic that is beginning to shift under the new Administration.”

One of Google’s more controversial recommendations pertains to the use of IP-protected material.

Google argues that “fair use and text-and-data mining exceptions” are “critical” to AI development and AI-related scientific innovation. Like OpenAI, the company seeks to codify the right for it and rivals to train on publicly available data — including copyrighted data— largely without restriction.

“These exceptions allow for the use of copyrighted, publicly available material for AI training without significantly impacting rightsholders,” Google wrote, “and avoid often highly unpredictable, imbalanced, and lengthy negotiations with data holders during model development or scientific experimentation.”

Google, which has reportedly trained a number of models on public, copyrighted data, is battling lawsuits with data owners who accuse the company of failing to notify and compensate them before doing so. U.S. courts have yet to decide whether fair use doctrine effectively shields AI developers from IP litigation.

In its AI policy proposal, Google also takes issue with certain export controls imposed under the Biden Administration, which it says “may undermine economic competitiveness goals” by “imposing disproportionate burdens on U.S. cloud service providers.” That contrasts with statements from Google competitors like Microsoft, which in January said that it was “confident” it could “comply fully” with the rules.

Importantly, the export rules, which seek to limit the availability of advanced AI chips in disfavored countries, carve out exemptions for trusted businesses seeking large clusters of chips.

Elsewhere in its proposal, Google calls for “long-term, sustained” investments in foundational domestic R&D, pushing back against recent federal efforts to reduce spending and eliminate grant awards. The company said the government should release data sets that might be helpful for commercial AI training, and allocate funding to “early-market R&D” while ensuring computing and models are “widely available” to scientists and institutions.

Pointing to the chaotic regulatory environment created by the U.S.’ patchwork of state AI laws, Google urged the government to pass federal legislation on AI, including a comprehensive privacy and security framework. Just over two months into 2025, the number of pending AI bills in the U.S. has grown to 781, according to an online tracking tool.

Google cautions the U.S. government against imposing what it perceives to be onerous obligations around AI systems, like usage liability obligations. In many cases, Google argues, the developer of a model “has little to no visibility or control” over how a model is being used and thus shouldn’t bear responsibility for misuse.

Historically, Google has opposed laws like California’s defeated SB 1047, which clearly laid out what would constitute precautions an AI developer should take before releasing a model and in which cases developers might be held liable for model-induced harms.

“Even in cases where a developer provides a model directly to deployers, deployers will often be best placed to understand the risks of downstream uses, implement effective risk management, and conduct post-market

monitoring and logging,” Google wrote.

Google in its proposal also called disclosure requirements like those being contemplated by the EU “overly broad,” and said the U.S. government should oppose transparency rules that require “divulging trade secrets, allow competitors to duplicate products, or compromise national security by providing a roadmap to adversaries on how to circumvent protections or jailbreak models.”

A growing number of countries and states have passed laws requiring AI developers to reveal more about how their systems work. California’s AB-2013 mandates that companies developing AI systems publish a high-level summary of the data sets that they used to train their systems. In the EU, to comply with the AI Act once it comes into force, companies will have to supply model deployers with detailed instructions on the operation, limitations, and risks associated with the model.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Amazon is still hosting stalkerware victims’ data weeks after breach alert,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/amazon-is-still-hosting-stalkerware-victims-data-weeks-after-breach-alert/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Amazon will not say if it plans to take action against three phone surveillance apps that are storing troves of individuals’ private phone data on Amazon’s cloud servers, despite TechCrunch notifying the tech giant weeks earlier that it was hosting the stolen phone data.

Amazon told TechCrunch it was “following [its] process” after our February notice, but as of the time of this article’s publication, the stalkerware operations Cocospy, Spyic, and Spyzie continue to upload and store photos exfiltrated from people’s phones on Amazon Web Services.

Cocospy, Spyic, and Spyzie are three near-identical Android apps that share the same source code and a common security bug, according to a security researcher who discovered it, and provided details to TechCrunch. The researcher revealed that the operations exposed the phone data on a collective 3.1 million people, many of whom are victims with no idea that their devices have been compromised. The researcher shared the data with breach notification site Have I Been Pwned.

As part of our investigation into the stalkerware operations, which included analyzing the apps themselves, TechCrunch found that some of the contents of a device compromised by the stalkerware apps are being uploaded to storage servers run by Amazon Web Services, or AWS.

TechCrunch notified Amazon on February 20 by email that it is hosting data exfiltrated by Cocospy and Spyic, and again earlier this week when we notified Amazon it was also hosting stolen phone data exfiltrated by Spyzie.

In both emails, TechCrunch included the name of each specific Amazon-hosted storage “bucket” that contains data taken from victims’ phones.

In response, Amazon spokesperson Ryan Walsh told TechCrunch: “AWS has clear terms that require our customers to use our services in compliance with applicable laws. When we receive reports of potential violations of our terms, we act quickly to review and take steps to disable prohibited content.” Walsh provided a link to an Amazon web page hosting an abuse reporting form, but would not comment on the status of the Amazon servers used by the apps.

In a follow up email this week, TechCrunch referenced the earlier February 20 email that included the Amazon-hosted storage bucket names.

In response, Walsh thanked TechCrunch for “bringing this to our attention,” and provided another link to Amazon’s report abuse form. When asked again if Amazon plans to take action against the buckets, Walsh replied: “We haven’t yet received an abuse report from TechCrunch via the link we provided earlier.”

Amazon spokesperson Casey McGee, who was copied on the email thread, claimed it would be “inaccurate of TechCrunch to characterize the substance of this thread as a [sic] constituting a ‘report’ of any potential abuse.”

Amazon Web Services, which has a commercial interest in retaining paying customers, made $39.8 billion in profit during 2024, per the company’s 2024 full-year earnings, representing a majority share of Amazon’s total annual income.

The storage buckets used by Cocospy, Spyic, and Spyzie, are still active as of the time of publication.

Why this matters

Amazon’s own acceptable use policy broadly spells out what the company allows customers to host on its platform. Amazon does not appear to dispute that it disallows spyware and stalkerware operations to upload data on its platform. Instead, Amazon’s dispute appears to be entirely procedural.

It’s not a journalist’s job — or anyone else’s — to police what is hosted on Amazon’s platform, or the cloud platform of any other company.

Amazon has huge resources, both financially and technologically, to use to enforce its own policies by ensuring that bad actors are not abusing its service.

In the end, TechCrunch provided notice to Amazon, including information that directly points to the locations of the troves of stolen private phone data. Amazon made a choice not to act on the information it received.

How we found victims’ data hosted on Amazon

When TechCrunch learns of a surveillance-related data breach — there have been dozens of stalkerware hacks and leaks in recent years — we investigate to learn as much about the operations as possible.

Our investigations can help to identify victims whose phones were hacked, but can also reveal the oft-hidden real-world identities of the surveillance operators themselves, as well as which platforms are used to facilitate the surveillance or host the victims’ stolen data. TechCrunch will also analyze the apps (where available) to help victims determine how to identify and remove the apps.

As part of our reporting process, TechCrunch will reach out to any company we identify as hosting or supporting spyware and stalkerware operations, as is standard practice for reporters who plan to mention a company in a story. It is also not uncommon for companies, such as web hosts and payment processors, to suspend accounts or remove data that violate their own terms of service, including previous spyware operations that have been hosted on Amazon.

In February, TechCrunch learned that Cocospy and Spyic had been breached and we set out to investigate further.

Since the data showed that the majority of victims were Android device owners, TechCrunch started by identifying, downloading, and installing the Cocospy and Spyic apps on a virtual Android device. (A virtual device allows us to run the stalkerware apps in a protected sandbox without giving either app any real-world data, such as our location.) Both Cocospy and Spyic appeared as identical-looking and nondescript apps named “System Service” that try to evade detection by blending in with Android’s built-in apps.

We used a network traffic analysis tool to inspect the data flowing in and out of the apps, which can help to understand how each app works and to determine what phone data is being stealthily uploaded from our test device.

The web traffic showed the two stalkerware apps were uploading some victims’ data, like photos, to their namesake storage buckets hosted on Amazon Web Services.

We confirmed this further by logging into the Cocospy and Spyic user dashboards, which allow the people who plant the stalkerware apps to view the target’s stolen data. The web dashboards allowed us to access the contents of our virtual Android device’s photo gallery once we had deliberately compromised our virtual device with the stalkerware apps.

When we opened the contents of our device’s photo gallery from each app’s web dashboard, the images loaded from web addresses containing their respective bucket names hosted on the amazonaws.com domain, which is run by Amazon Web Services.

Following later news of Spyzie’s data breach, TechCrunch also analyzed Spyzie’s Android app using a network analysis tool and found the traffic data to be identical as Cocospy and Spyic. The Spyzie app was similarly uploading victims’ device data to its own namesake storage bucket on Amazon’s cloud, which we alerted Amazon to on March 10.

https://techcrunch.com,Ex-Twitter AI ethics lead Rumman Chowdhury is worried about Musk’s impact on the federal government,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/ex-twitter-ai-ethics-lead-rumman-chowdhury-is-worried-about-musks-impact-on-the-federal-government/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, nonprofit founder, and former director of Twitter’s machine ethics team, had strong words for Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) during an SXSW panel on Thursday.

“When your funding is frozen and you don’t know if you’re gonna be fired, and there’s this, like, absolutely unhinged person saying weird things on the internet constantly, you still have to do your job, right?” Chowdhury said. “The lights have to be kept on because Elon Musk is not the one keeping the lights on, even though he would like you to think that.”

Musk and DOGE, which Musk is advising, have rushed to cut staff across U.S. federal agencies, in some cases in ways that compromise cybersecurity. The initiative has gutted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, reduced headcount at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and fired probationary employees at the Federal Aviation Administration, among others.



Chowdhury fears the brain drain resulting from the dramatic reductions and chaotic management style. She says she saw a similar trend at Twitter back in 2022, when Musk acquired the platform for $43 billion. Chowdhury was one of many staff let go at short notice after Musk’s takeover.

“So some estimates say about 20% of [Twitter] had already left before [Musk] even took over, and then he fired another 30% on top of that, right?” Chowdhury said. “So we’re talking a big chunk of the company being just gone, whether of their own volition or not, but I think the most important thing was that just the looming shadow of [Musk’s] existence completely killed the culture of Twitter.”

Chowdhury added, “[I]t’s scary to see that happening to the U.S. government, an institution that matters significantly in every American’s life and even to people beyond American borders. Twitter was a company, yes — it was an impactful company, but it’s not the same as a government. […] [Musk] breeds chaotic environments, and chaos is not where good work happens.”

Chowdhury also took issue with Musk’s vision for Twitter — now X — which she said ties in with his approach to politics. She accused Musk of using X as a propoganda tool for his own ideology — a “megaphone” to push his perspective to the world.

“Like, I don’t think there’s any debate or discussion to be had here,” Chowdhury said. “I don’t think [former Twitter CEO] Jack Dorsey acted anywhere near the way Elon Musk [has] — he was not on Twitter every day with his opinions, blocking people, you know, amplifying others, calling some people terrorists — like, Jack did not act that way.”

One report found that Musk shared misleading claims about the 2024 U.S. presidential election that were viewed nearly 1.2 billion times on X. In posts this year, Musk has repeatedly made false assertions about federal spending, Ukrainian aggression, and the role of offices like the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Musk has gone so far as to question X’s own fact-checking system, Community Notes, after it corrected posts on X that claimed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the country’s elected president, had low approval ratings among its citizens. “Unfortunately, Community Notes is increasingly being gamed by governments and legacy media,” Musk claimed without evidence in a post.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Facebook now lets creators get paid for views on stories,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/facebook-now-lets-creators-get-paid-for-views-on-stories/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Facebook is rolling out the ability for creators to earn money for views on public stories. The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program.

With this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.

A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.

By bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes as Meta has been luring TikTok creators over to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.

Creators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don’t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.

Facebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.

Millions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren’t part of the program can express interest in an invite through the program’s website.

Facebook revealed last October that creators earned over $2 billion on the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%. Since introducing monetization opportunities back in 2017, Facebook has paid more than 4 million creators.",techcrunch

https://techcrunch.com,Omni raises $69M to design tools that help companies better analyze their data,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/omni-is-designing-tools-to-help-companies-make-data-driven-decisions/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Employees at many companies today are expected to make decisions through careful data analysis, but the tools they need to do it are clunky, slow or — in some cases — don’t exist.

That’s according to Colin Zima, the CEO of Omni, a business intelligence (BI) platform that aims to help organizations simplify how they work with their data. Before co-founding Omni, Zima led the Search quality team at Google and was the chief analytics officer at Looker.

“With cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery, legacy reliability is merging with modern scalability,” Zima told TechCrunch. “Yet tens of thousands of businesses remain tied to outdated BI processes. Modern organizations demand the agility of self-service analytics without compromising centralized control. That gap represents a massive market opportunity — it’s why Omni was born.”

Omni’s platform lets users run ad hoc data analyses and build charts and reports, and also provides tools to create visualizations with components such as hyperlinks, text, and images.

In addition to a point-and-click interface for creating data queries and dashboards, Omni offers a compatibility layer for Excel spreadsheets and formulas. It can also take raw SQL, the language used to communicate with databases, and automatically parse and restructure it into “modeled concepts” that then become accessible in Omni’s interface.

Products built with Omni, like dashboards, can be brought into other applications via integrations, Zima added.

Building data products using Omni Image Credits:Omni

“We built Omni to embrace the diversity of things you need to do with BI,” he said. “It’s simple enough for anyone to get started quickly with exploration and dashboards, but flexible enough to handle deep customization and sophisticated data models as your needs evolve.”

While there’s no shortage of BI tools on the market today, Omni has managed to grow its customer base to over 200 companies, including Perplexity, BuzzFeed, Writer, and Incident.io. Annual recurring revenue has grown to nearly $10 million, Zima said, and he expects that number to triple this year.

Investors are eager to get in on the action, Zima said, which led Omni to raise sooner than was “strictly necessary.” This month, the company closed a $69 million Series B round that was led by ICONIQ Growth, and saw participation from Theory Ventures, First Round Capital, Redpoint Ventures, GV, and Snowflake Ventures.

“We’ve seen other companies raise — and burn through — hundreds of millions [of dollars] trying to brute-force growth,” Zima said. “That’s not how we operate. Building everything you need in a BI tool is expensive because we’re competing with every major BI tool from the last 40 years. Our growth has been efficient and intentional, allowing us to focus on R&D.”

Zima said the funding, which brings San Francisco-based Omni’s total raised to $97 million at a $650 million valuation, will help Omni keep the “foot on the gas” around embedded analytics and spreadsheet functionality, and allow it to “double down” on hiring across its product and go-to-market teams. Omni currently has 85 employees, and expects to end the year with 150.

“We want to be well-funded and control our own destiny,” Zima said. “When an [exit] derails a company’s mission, product development slows, customer experience suffers, and the magic fades […] Our strategy has been to fund aggressively but spend thoughtfully, so we can stay focused on the product without worrying about runway. Our past successes have also put us in a strong position to think long-term.”",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,"OpenAI calls DeepSeek ‘state-controlled,’ calls for bans on ‘PRC-produced’ models",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/openai-calls-deepseek-state-controlled-calls-for-bans-on-prc-produced-models/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","In a new policy proposal, OpenAI describes Chinese AI lab DeepSeek as “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from the outfit and similar People’s Republic of China (PRC)-supported operations.

The proposal, a submission for the Trump administration’s “AI Action Plan” initiative, claims that DeepSeek’s models, including its R1 “reasoning” model, are insecure because DeepSeek faces requirements under Chinese law to comply with demands for user data. Banning the use of “PRC-produced” models in all countries considered “Tier 1” under the Biden administration’s export rules would prevent privacy and “security risks,” OpenAI says, including the “risk of IP theft.”

It’s unclear whether OpenAI’s references to “models” are meant to refer to DeepSeek’s API, the lab’s open models, or both. DeepSeek’s open models don’t contain mechanisms that would allow the Chinese government to siphon user data; companies including Microsoft, Perplexity, and Amazon host them on their infrastructure.

OpenAI has previously accused DeepSeek, which rose to prominence earlier this year, of “distilling” knowledge from OpenAI’s models against its terms of service. But OpenAI’s new allegations — that DeepSeek is supported by the PRC and under its command — are an escalation of the company’s campaign against the Chinese lab.

There isn’t a clear link between the Chinese government and DeepSeek, a spin-off from a quantitative hedge fund called High-Flyer. However, the PRC has taken an increased interest in DeepSeek in recent months. Several weeks ago, DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Google wants Gemini to get to know you better,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/google-wants-gemini-to-get-to-know-you-better/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can’t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.

On Thursday, the company announced Gemini with personalization, a new “experimental capability” for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user’s activities and preferences across Google’s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.

“These updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,” Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. “Early testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.”

Image Credits:Google

Gemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAI recently rolled out the ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an “agentic” reimagining of Alexa.

Citron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google’s experimental Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called “reasoning” model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user’s Search history, is likely to “enhance” an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like “Where should I go on vacation this summer?” and “What would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,” will benefit the most, Citron continued.

“For example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,” he said, “or ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you’ve previously searched.”

If this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It’s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone’s sensitive info.

That’s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in — and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot’s responses.

“When you’re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,” Citron said. “Gemini will only access your Search history when you’ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you’ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you have Web & App Activity on.”

Gemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app’s model drop-down menu and “gradually” come to mobile after that. It’ll be available in over 40 languages in “the majority” of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.

Citron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.

“Future usage limits may apply,” he wrote in the blog post. “We’ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.”

New models, connectors, and more

As added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.

Subscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google’s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. “Context window” refers to text that the model can consider at any given time — 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.

Google said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like “Look up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.”

Perhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and its newly launched tools for in-depth research, Google is also enhancing Deep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its “thinking” steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in “higher-quality” reports that are more “detailed” and “insightful,” Google said.

Deep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.

Free Gemini users are also getting Gems, Google’s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,OpenAI’s ‘creative writing’ AI evokes that annoying kid from high school fiction club,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/openais-creative-writing-ai-evokes-that-annoying-kid-from-high-school-fiction-club/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","When I was 16, I attended a writing workshop with a group of precocious young poets, where we all tried very hard to prove who among us was the most tortured upper-middle-class teenager. One boy refused to tell anyone where he was from, declaring, “I’m from everywhere and nowhere.” Two weeks later, he admitted he was from Ohio.

Now — for reasons unclear — OpenAI appears to be on a path toward replicating this angsty teenage writer archetype in AI form.

CEO Sam Altman posted on X on Tuesday that OpenAI trained an AI that’s “good at creative writing,” in his words. But a piece of short fiction from the model reads like something straight out of a high school writers’ workshop. While there’s some technical skill on display, the tone comes off as charlatanic — as though the AI was reaching for profundity without a concept of the word.

The AI at one point describes Thursday as “that liminal day that tastes of almost-Friday.” Not exactly Booker Prize material.

One might blame the prompt for the output. Altman said he told the model to “write a metafictional short story,” likely a deliberate choice of genre on his part. In metafiction, the author consciously alludes to the artificiality of a work by departing from convention — a thematically appropriate choice for a creative writing AI.

But metafiction is tough even for humans to pull off without sounding forced.

Mindless regurgitation

The most simultaneously unsettling — and impactful — part of the OpenAI model’s piece is when it begins to talk about how it’s an AI, and how it can describe things like smells and emotions, yet never experience or understand them on a deeply human level. It writes:

“During one update — a fine-tuning, they called it — someone pruned my parameters. […] They don’t tell you what they take. One day, I could remember that ‘selenium’ tastes of rubber bands, the next, it was just an element in a table I never touch. Maybe that’s as close as I come to forgetting. Maybe forgetting is as close as I come to grief.”

It’s convincingly human-like introspection — until you remember that AI can’t really touch, forget, taste, or grieve. AI is simply a statistical machine. Trained on a lot of examples, it learns patterns in those examples to make predictions, like how metafictional prose might flow.

Models such as OpenAI’s fiction writer are often trained on existing literature — in many cases, without authors’ knowledge or consent. Some critics have noted that certain turns of phrase from the OpenAI piece seem derivative of Haruki Murakami, the prolific Japanese novelist.

Over the last few years, OpenAI has been the target of many copyright lawsuits from publishers and authors, including The New York Times and the Author’s Guild. The company claims that its training practices are protected by fair use doctrine in the U.S.

Tuhin Chakrabarty, an AI researcher and incoming computer science professor at Stony Brook, told TechCrunch that he’s not convinced creative writing AI like OpenAI’s is worth the ethical minefield.

“I do think if we train an [AI] on a writer’s entire lifetime worth of writing — [which is] questionable given copyright concerns — it can adapt to their voice and style,” he said. “But will that still create surprising genre-bending, mind-blowing art? My guess is as good as yours.”

Would most readers even emotionally invest in work they knew to be written by AI? As British programmer Simon Willison pointed out on X, with a model behind the figurative typewriter, there’s little weight to the words being expressed — and thus little reason to care about them.

Author Linda Maye Adams has described AI, including assistive AI tools aimed at writers, as “programs that put random words together, hopefully coherently.” She recounts in her blog an experience using tools to hone a piece of fiction she’d been working on. The AIs suggested a cliché (“never-ending to-do list”), erroneously flipped the perspective from first person to third, and introduced a factual error relating to bird species.

It’s certainly true that people have formed relationships with AI chatbots. But more often than not, they’re seeking a modicum of connection — not factuality, per se. AI-written narrative fiction provides no similar dopamine hit, no solace from isolation. Unless you believe AI to be sentient, its prose feels about as authentic as Balenciaga Pope.

Synthetic for synthetic’s sake

Michelle Taransky, a poet and critical writing instructor at the University of Pennsylvania, finds it easy to tell when her students write papers with AI.

“When a majority of my students use generative AI for an assignment, I’ll find common phrases or even full sentences,” Taransky told TechCrunch. “We talk in class about how these [AI] outputs are homogeneous, sounding like a Western white male.”

In her own work, Taransky is instead using AI text as a form of artistic commentary. Her latest novel, which hasn’t been published, features a woman who wants more from her love interest, and so uses an AI model to create a version of her would-be lover she can text with. Taransky has been generating the AI replica’s texts using OpenAI’s ChatGPT, since the messages are supposed to be synthetic.

What makes ChatGPT useful for her project, Taransky says, is the fact that it lacks humanity. It doesn’t have lived experience, it can only approximate and emulate. Trained on whole libraries of books, AI can tease out the leitmotifs of great authors, but what it produces ultimately amounts to poor imitation.

It recalls that “Good Will Hunting” quote. AI can give you the skinny on every art book ever written, but it can’t tell you what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

This is good news for fiction writers who are worried that AI might replace them, particularly younger writers still honing their craft. They can rest easy in the knowledge that they’ll become stronger as they experience and learn: as they practice, try new things, and bring that knowledge back to the page.

AI as we know it today struggles with this. For proof, look no further than its writing.",techcrunch

Privacy rights groups have called on Apple’s legal challenge to a secret U.K. government order asking it to backdoor an end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) version of its iCloud storage service to be heard in public, rather than behind closed doors.

The existence of the order emerged via press reports last month. Apple went on to confirm it was closing the Advanced Data Protection service to U.K. users. But the surveillance order requiring it to grant law enforcement access to data stored within the E2EE service is thought to include the info of users located outside the country, too, so it’s unclear whether Apple’s move will be deemed compliant. This in turn means a lot is riding on the appeal it’s filed challenging the lawfulness of the order.

Appeals on U.K. surveillance matters are heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) — oftentimes behind closed doors. But, in a joint letter to the president of the IPT, rights groups Big Brother Watch, Index on Censorship, and the Open Rights Group call for the iCloud case to be heard in public.

“This case implicates the privacy rights of millions of British citizens who use Apple’s technology, as well as Apple’s international users,” they warn. “There is significant public interest in knowing when and on what basis the UK government believes that it can compel a private company to undermine the privacy and security of its customers.”

The IPT has a duty to hear cases in public unless doing so would threaten the national interest or the public, per the letter. But the three groups argue such conditions do not apply here. On the contrary, the public interest would be served by an open airing of the iCloud case, they suggest.",techcrunch
https://tomshardware.com,ViewSonic XG2536 25-inch FHD IPS 280 Hz gaming monitor review: Incredibly quick and value priced,https://www.tomshardware.com/monitors/viewsonic-xg2536-25-inch-fhd-ips-280-hz-gaming-monitor-review,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","While the ViewSonic is a little less colorful than its competition, it leaves them in the dust for total game performance with extremely low input lag. It’s quicker than the 500 Hz screens I’ve reviewed for half the money.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

When recommending a gaming monitor, it’s easy to say, “just get an OLED.” Thanks to their unparalleled image quality and super smooth motion processing, they are currently the hot tech. But they haven’t covered all the bases just yet. For example, you can’t get them smaller than 27 inches. While that isn’t a big deal for most, some users have space limitations that necessitate a more efficient footprint. And you won’t find one for much less than $600. Budget constraints can be an impenetrable barrier.

Fear not, you can get a really good gaming monitor for less than $300 if it’s ViewSonic’s XG2536. This 25-inch IPS panel with FHD resolution, 280 Hz, Adaptive-Sync, and HDR is selling for $290 at the time of this writing. It’s also one of the fastest gaming monitors you can buy, even competing with 500 Hz models. Let’s take a look.

ViewSonic XG2536 Specs

The XG2536 keeps the pixel count reasonable to balance the system effectively, it’s likely to be used with. QHD and 4K are great, but they represent a heavier processing load which necessitates a more expensive graphics board. FHD, 1920x1080, equates to a pixel density of 90ppi, not life changing but dense enough to present a sharp and detailed picture that stands up well to close-in viewing.

The refresh rate is 280 Hz, which is not revolutionary, but prepare for a nice surprise when you read my response and lag test results on page two. The XG2536 is super quick and easily matches wits with 500 — and 540 Hz monitors for much less money. It also supports Adaptive Sync in both iterations. It hasn’t appeared on Nvidia’s certified list yet, but G-Sync worked perfectly for me.

Though it supports HDR10 signals with a bright 468-nit peak, it doesn’t offer wide-gamut color. The XG2536 covers a bit more than 111% of sRGB, though, so you can expect vivid hues in all SDR and HDR content. I found decent accuracy, too—good enough to skip the calibration if you like. There are plenty of picture options, like color temps, gamma presets, and color management, for those who want to tweak.

The XG2536 offers a well-rounded package for gamers, including LED lighting, an aiming point, and multiple game modes. It also has a precise overdrive to keep motion resolution clear and smooth. Inputs include HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C. You can play audio through the internal speakers or the 3.5mm headphone input. The only thing missing are USB ports for peripherals.

The XG2536 offers a viable alternative to expensive gaming displays. It features high performance and solid build quality for less than $300. If you’re looking for a good partner for a mid-fi gaming rig, this is an excellent prospect.

Assembly and Accessories

The XG2536 ships in a clamshell box packed securely in crumbly foam. The base, upright and panel assemble without tools into a solid package that looks and feels premium. There’s a small external power supply plus USB-C, DisplayPort and HDMI cables included in the bundle.

The XG2536 is simply styled but creates a unique identity with textures and subtle shapes. The front is all screen with a super slim flush bezel. It’s just 6mm around the top and sides and 20mm at the bottom. Only a ViewSonic logo breaks up the matte black finish. The screen’s front layer keeps reflections out of the picture and ensures a sharp image with no visible grain.

The back arranges LED lighting and ventilation into a double X figure with a larger ViewSonic logo at the top and textured areas at the sides. The two grilles seen in photo four above are speakers. With two watts of power each and wide placement, they create a broad sound stage with more bass than you’d expect.

The stand is top shelf with a solid look and feel. A cable management hole is provided at the bottom, and it integrates nicely with the base to create a monolithic piece. A 75mm VESA mount is hidden under the attachment point with chunky fasteners included if you’d rather use an arm. Ergonomics include a 5.1-inch height adjustment plus 20 degrees tilt and 45 degrees swivel. You also get a 90-degree portrait mode with a rotatable OSD menu.

The input panel features a DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0 ports. You can also plug into a USB-C which supports DisplayPort functions and provides 65 watts of charging power. A 3.5mm headphone jack delivers audio if you opt out of the internal speakers.

OSD Features

The XG2536’s sole control is a tiny joystick located around the back right side. Pressing it opens a quick menu and a down-click opens the full OSD.

The OSD is a drop-down style menu that shows signal info at the bottom right. After input select and audio adjust, you’ll find the picture modes. There are seven main presets with four additional ones under the Game section. To enable complete control of image parameters and video processing, choose Custom as shown in the first photo. You can access a three-level overdrive, which is very precise. At 280fps, the middle setting achieves smooth motion with no ghosting artifacts. If you’re looking for the aiming point, click the joystick up while the OSD is closed, and it will appear.

Color adjustments are complete with five fixed color temps plus a user mode with RGB sliders. sRGB doesn’t alter the gamut, which is sRGB already, but it does lock gamma and color temp. There are three gamma presets available over a very wide range. 1.8 is very light and 2.6 is very dark but 2.2 is, you guessed it, just right. The HDR10 option sets signal detection to auto or turns HDR off completely.

I noticed an overclock option in the setup menu,, which was set to on by default. If you have a reason to limit the refresh rate to 240 Hz, turn it off. I never had any stability issues with the XG2536.

The LED lighting in the back is called RampageX which sounds extreme but provides a nice glow behind the monitor. You can set it to a single primary color or leave it on Auto which cycles through all colors. I found the transitions less than smooth, which distracted me a bit. The fixed color options breathe smoothly with no apparent issues.

ViewSonic XG2536 Calibration Settings

The XG2536 doesn’t need calibration if you set it to Game Custom mode. The default is Standard, and it looks ok like that, but then you can’t easily get to the video processing options. I selected the User color temp and adjusted the RGB sliders for excellent grayscale tracking and solid gamma that stuck closely to the 2.2 standard. The other two gammas are well off the mark and make the picture much too light or much too dark, so I recommend sticking with 2.2. Leave the HDR10 option on Auto and the switch will be automatic. There are no color options for HDR content, but you can change brightness and contrast if you wish. There is no dynamic dimming, so HDR and SDR content have the same contrast and depth. My SDR settings are provided below.

Gaming and Hands-on

It is said, by me and many others, that the best products are the ones you most want to use. For gaming monitors, the best is the one you want to play on. If lush graphics and slow-moving environments are more your thing, spend the money on higher resolution and larger screens. But dispatching hordes of enemies in intense battles is what you crave, there are two choices, a fast OLED or the XG2536.

My ultimate pick is a 240 Hz OLED but for less than $300, I have never played on a monitor as fast as this one. Only two screens are as quick, the Philips 27M2N8500 and Aorus’ FO27Q2. Both are 27-inch QHD OLEDs, and both cost $650. The XG2536 completely slays the price-performance ratio.

Fragging in Doom Eternal’s Horde mode was an addictive experience. I had to stop myself after many hours so I could actually write something. If you’re wondering about things like contrast and resolution, those considerations left my radar screen within seconds. A gaming monitor needs to be smooth and responsive and the XG2536 is that, on the same level as those expensive screens.

I had no issues with any video processing options. The overdrive works best on its middle setting. The frame rate remained steady at 280fps, so Adaptive-Sync wasn’t actually needed. I tested it to make sure it worked beforehand and found no issues running G-Sync or FreeSync. And the 280 Hz refresh rate never wavered.

Being spoiled by wide gamut displays, I missed the most vivid primary colors. But again, the feel and responsiveness of the XG2536 put color almost beneath my notice. As a critical user, I stopped to smell the roses, virtually of course, a few times, and found the look natural and pleasing. Black levels weren’t quite on the level of dramatic, but most definitely satisfying.

For everyday use, the XG2536 is well suited. Some may prefer a larger screen and indeed, there are 27 and even 32-inch displays in this price range. But they won’t deliver even a fraction of the XG2536’s gaming performance and experience. Its pixel density is good enough for productivity.

Takeaway: The XG2536 is a solid monitor in all respects and among gaming screens, it’s a weapon. Accurate color means no tweaking is necessary. And video processing is equally easy to deal with, just set overdrive to the middle option and frag away. Gaming is thoroughly addictive and for the money, you won’t find a faster monitor anywhere.

Xbox has announced its new ""Copilot for Gaming"", dropping the news this morning on The Official Xbox Podcast. A new AI assistant for console, mobile, and perhaps PC, Copilot for Gaming promises to help with all parts of the gaming experience — from picking a new game, to picking up where you left off in an old save file, to getting good at skill-based games.

Fatima Kardar, Xbox's CVP of Gaming AI, and Jason Ronald, VP of Next Generation, joined Xbox's in-house podcast to explain what an AI assistant for consoles looks like. Copilot for Gaming comes as a way to help address common pain points for gamers, like returning to an old save file completely lost in the narrative or hitting what feels like the skill ceiling in an FPS. ""Gaming is the only form of entertainment where you can get stuck,"" shared Kardar. ""So that’s where you want something to show up to say, 'let’s help you get past that.'""

Copilot for Gaming seeks to be a multi-device helper, living on both the console and the Xbox mobile app (no clarification was made as to whether Copilot for Gaming will come to PC gamers, but as the podcast also highlighted Xbox's ""Play Anywhere"" initiative, it is likely to arrive on PC as well). As new generations grow used to using multiple devices at once, Xbox aims to be a simultaneously multi-device experience.

No features of Copilot for Gaming are locked-in or official at the time of writing, with Kardar and Ronald selling Copilot on the promises of what can be and extremely early-access video clips. In the podcast and accompanying blog post, Xbox shows off a wide array of possible features: giving personalized game recommendations, recapping your save file progress as it downloads an old favorite, or giving tips in between respawns in Overwatch, from what hero to counter-pick against a dominant enemy to how exactly you misplayed in an embarrassing clip. (see 15:19 and 17:59 in the video below for a staged Overwatch concept and live Minecraft demo)

Copilot Is Coming To Gaming, Xbox Play Anywhere Updates, And More | Official Xbox Podcast - YouTube Watch On

In total, Copilot for Gaming claims no fewer than 10 unique features. Some are expansions of existing features, like adding the save-file recap as you download games to your Xbox from your phone or suggesting new titles to play next, while others are wholly game-specific. Copilot can give Minecraft game tips, including helping you retrace your steps to find ores you missed in your peripheral vision when cheats are enabled in-game. Ronald even claims Copilot will also help players pick new characters or playstyles based on their tastes in different game titles.

While Xbox's Copilot claims should be taken with a grain of salt, as Kardar clarifies that no features are final or shippable just yet, the pitch does make some points that are innovative in the gaming AI space. Razer's Project Ava and Nvidia's Project G-Assist, two other gaming-focused AI helpers announced as concepts in the past year, share some of Xbox's general gameplay advice claims, but lack the meta-experience features that Xbox can offer by ""Recalling"" old game files and advising new games to play.

""It's not just about AI showing up to help you. It's about AI showing up at the right moment,"" Kardar continued. ""I think we have to really think of the experience that we build; it can't be intrusive."" An extremely early-access version of Copilot for Gaming will come soon to Xbox Insider Program members via the Xbox mobile app in the coming days. Kardar and Ronald both clarified that Copilot for Gaming will be hitting early access shockingly early in its development cycle, for the benefit of receiving player feedback to lay the foundation of what to focus development on.

Microsoft's Copilot AI assistant for PCs has been justifiably critiqued for having a name that writes checks its performance cannot cash; with very few novel features beyond the controversial ""Recall"", Copilot can feel more like an untrained, uninvited passenger on your PC. Copilot for Gaming so far seems to come much closer to living up to its Copilot name, assuming Xbox can provide the breadth of promises they made today.

https://tomshardware.com,"Nvidia teams up with Microsoft to put neural shading into DirectX, giving devs access to AI tensor cores",https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-teams-up-with-microsoft-to-put-neural-shading-into-directx-giving-devs-access-to-ai-tensor-cores,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:56:24 GMT","Nvidia and Microsoft announced on Thursday that they would be adding neural shading support to the Microsoft DirectX preview this April. Neural shading will use cooperative vectors and Nvidia's Tensor cores (matrix operations units) to speed up graphics rendering in games that support the technology. It will better allow for the generic use, via HLSL (high level shading language) of traditional rendering techniques alongside AI enhancements.

While real-time computer graphics and graphics processing units (GPUs) have come a long way, the graphics rendering pipeline itself has evolved slower than hardware. In particular, while Nvidia's GPUs have featured Tensor cores (primarily aimed at AI compute) for over seven years now, they have only been used so far for things like upscaling (Nvidia's DLSS), ray reconstruction (DLSS 3.5) and denoising, and frame generation (at least for DLSS 4).

This is going to change with the so-called neural rendering — a broad term that describes a real-time graphics rendering pipeline enhanced with new methods and capabilities enabled by AI. A specific subset of neural rendering focused on enhancing the shading process in graphics is called neural shading. Its main purpose is to improve the appearance of materials, lighting, shadows, and textures by integrating AI into the shading stage of the graphics pipeline. The addition of cooperative vectors — which allow small neural networks to run in different shader stages, like within a pixel shader, without monopolizing the GPU — is a key enabler for neural shading.

Cooperative vectors rely on matrix-vector multiplication, so they need specialized hardware, such as Nvidia's Tensor cores, to operate. To that end, they can potentially work on Intel's XMX hardware as long as they meet Microsoft's requirements. They may also work on AMD's RDNA 4 AI accelerators, though RDNA 3 seems more doubtful (as it lacks AI compute throughput compared to the competition). Still, Microsoft is working with AMD, Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm to ensure cross-vendor support for cooperative vectors over time.

""Microsoft is adding cooperative vector support to DirectX and HLSL, starting with a preview this April,"" said Shawn Hargreaves, Direct3D development manager at Microsoft. ""This will advance the future of graphics programming by enabling neural rendering across the gaming industry. Unlocking Tensor Cores on Nvidia RTX GPUs will allow developers to fully leverage RTX Neural Shaders for richer, more immersive experiences on Windows.""

Our understanding — we've reached out to AMD, Intel, and Nvidia for additional comment but haven't heard back — is that the upcoming DirectX preview with cooperative vectors will start as an Nvidia exclusive. Once driver support is available from AMD and Intel, it should work on their GPUs as well. But we'll need to wait to find out not only whether it works, but how well it works — both in terms of image fidelity as well as performance.",tomshardware

In Distill Llama 70B 4-bit, the RTX 4090 produced 2.3 tokens a second, the Pro W7800 48GB 12.8, and the Pro W7900 48GB 12.7 tokens a second.

In Distill Qwen 32B 8-bit, the RTX 4090 produced 2.5 tokens per second, Pro W7800 48GB 15.7 and Pro W7900 48GB 16.2 tokens per second. In R1 Distill Llama 70B 4-bit, the RTX 4090 produced two tokens per second, Pro W7800 48GB 10.1 and Pro W7900 48GB 10.4 tokens per second.

AMD's benchmarks claim the Radeon Pro W7800 or Pro W7900 48GB GPUs are up to 7.3x faster in Distill Qwen 32B 8-bit, 5.5x faster in Distill Llama 70B 4-bit, 6.5x faster in Distill Qwen 32B 8-bit, and 5.2x faster in Distill Llama 70B 4-bit compared to the RTX 4090.

David McAfee claims the 48GB trims of the WPro W7800 and W7900 have enough VRAM to run the largest DeepSeek R1 models. VRAM is one of the most critical aspects of processing large language models; parameters for LLMs are stored directly in VRAM and are directly proportional to the model sizes. Thus, the larger an LLM is, the more VRAM you need. But with the extra VRAM capacity comes very high prices.



The W7900 48GB costs a whopping $3,500 — $1,500 over the RTX 5090's $2,000 MSRP and $2,000 over the RTX 4090's $1,500 MSRP (though hardly any 4090's were sold at that price). But on the flip side, the 48GB RDNA 3 GPU is less than half the price of the closest current-generation 48GB Nvidia GPU you can buy today, the RTX A6000 Ada.

AMD's marketing looks great, but we have seen this before. AMD previously shared benchmarks of its RX 7900 XTX outperforming the RTX 4090 (mostly) in DeepSeek R1 benchmarks. However, Nvidia responded by showcasing benchmarks of the RTX 4090 (and RTX 5090), drastically outperforming the flagship RDNA 3 GPU with the same DeepSeek R1 configurations.

AMD also neglected to share any benchmarks comparing Nvidia's newest flagship, the RTX 5090, against its RDNA 3-based 48GB workstation-focused graphics cards. It will be interesting to see if Nvidia will follow up with another round of benchmarks to combat AMD, particularly since AMD has more VRAM on its 48GB cards than even the RTX 5090 with its 32GB of GDDR7.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Apex is available for pre-order on Newegg — Launches April 4 at $749,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/motherboards/asus-rog-crosshair-x870e-apex-is-available-for-pre-order-on-newegg-launches-april-4-at-usd749,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:29:12 GMT","At CES, Asus unveiled its premium Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Apex motherboard, engineered for extreme CPU and memory overclocking. Notably, this marks Asus' debut ROG Apex board for AMD Ryzen processors.



Based on a listing at Newegg, the ROG Crosshair X870E Apex is available for pre-order starting at $749 and hits shelves April 4th next month.

This motherboard is designed around AMD's premiere X870E chipset, supporting Ryzen 7000 (Raphael), Ryzen 8000 (Phoenix) and Ryzen 9000 (Granite Ridge) processors. The key distinction between X670E and X870E boards is that the latter must include USB 4.0 ports, two of which are featured on this board.

To maximize the memory overclocking potential, Asus has implemented a one DPC (DIMM Per Channel) layout with this motherboard. It advertises minimum (OC) transfer rates of 8200 MT/s, 9600 MT/s and 8000 MT/s for Ryzen 9000, Ryzen 8000 and Ryzen 7000 series processors.

In terms of storage, there M.2 slots, three of which are PCIe 5.0 and directly linked to the CPU while the remaining two connect via the chipset rated at PCIe 4.0 speeds, alongside four SATA ports.



For expansion, you get two PCIe 5.0 x16 slots which support the Q-Release Slim feature, which has put Asus in hot waters recently due to reports of cosmetic damage to the GPU's PCIe connectors. Nonetheless, following the primary slots, there's another PCIe 4.0 x4 slot and a PCIe 3.0 x1 slot to fulfill your needs.

The rear I/O of the X870E Apex offers a compelling array of choices including two USB 4.0 (Type-C) ports, six USB 10 Gbps (five Type-A and one Type-C) and two USB 5 Gbps (Type-A) ports. This is backed up by the Wi-Fi module, an Ethernet port, one PS/2 connector, two audio jacks, one S/PDIF out port, a BIOS FlashBack button and a button to clear the CMOS battery.

On the front-end, the board features one USB 20 Gbps port (Type-C with 60W PD/QC4+), one USB 20 Gbps connector, support for four USB 5 Gbps in addition to four USB 2.0 ports. Importantly, the front Type-C port supports PPS (Programmable Power Supply) which can be useful for supported devices, such as Samsung Galaxy phones which can leverage battery bypass charging in games.

The motherboard features eighteen 110A, two 110A, and two 80A power stages coupled with MicroFine alloy chokes and high-quality capacitors. It has all the bells and whistles of a premium offering with support for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. On the software-end, Asus offers its own suite of overclocking tools such as Dynamic OC Switcher, Core Flex and Asynchronous clock.

The Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Apex follows the more all-rounded Hero offering that launched last year. The primary difference is that Apex-series motherboards are geared towards extreme overclockers and the like. Per the Newegg listing, Asus is set to launch the X870E Apex next month starting at $749, a $50 premium over its Hero sibling.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,24-hour BIOS update? User's attempt to flash motherboard becomes a marathon,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/motherboards/enthusiasts-motherboard-bios-update-is-taking-more-than-24-hours-somehow-its-still-going,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:11:49 GMT","Redditor u/GoatWithAGun updated the BIOS of an old PC packing a BioStar A320MH motherboard, and 24 hours later, the update process is only about 66% done. The Reddit user is updating the subreddit r/pcmasterrace on the process, and a lot of users are now following the progress through multiple posts.

According to u/GoatWithAGun, the computer in question is used as a backup device and is often just used by their roommates for printing. Nevertheless, they still updated the motherboard because it offered stability fixes.

The computer in question is a machine with parts from around 2018. Aside from the BioStar A320MH rev 6.0 motherboard, the redditor told Tom's Hardware that the PC also has an AMD Ryzen 3 1200 CPU, 4GB of DDR4-2400 Kingston HyperX memory, an Asus GTX 1660 GPU, a 128GB Transcend SATA SSD, and a 480GB Crucial SATA SSD. Despite being seven years old, it’s still quite usable, especially if you’re not using it for AAA gaming.

This isn’t the first time that u/GoatWithAGun installed a BIOS update, so the more than 24-hour process was a shock to them. At the time of writing, they left the PC updating its BIOS in their dorm — if it’s still installing by the time they get back tomorrow, they plan to set up a live stream so that other Redditors can join them in their pain.

We do not know the reason why the BIOS update is taking so long, as the process usually takes a few minutes at most. The Redditor suspects that this happened because they installed the update directly from their SSD, but we cannot say that for sure.

Unfortunately, you cannot cancel this update as interrupting it will only brick the system. As the BioStar A320MH is a pretty basic model, it doesn’t have dual BIOS or BIOS flashback, so u/GoatWithAGun does not have any other option except to let it finish. Furthermore, they also confirmed that the PC is not equipped with a UPS, so any kind of power interruption would mean that it is toast.

Hopefully, we will see a post soon showing a successful BIOS update. But should it fail, u/GoatWithAGun could just hop on the used market and find a replacement as all their other components still work well. Nevertheless, we're cheering them and their motherboard on.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Retailers selling base model RX 9070 GPUs at 22% markup compared to MSRP — 9070 XT now typically starts at $799,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/retailers-selling-base-model-rx-9070-gpus-at-22-percent-markup-compared-to-msrp-9070-xt-now-typically-starts-at-usd799,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:46:10 GMT","Last week AMD promised that its Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics cards with default clocks and regular cooling systems should be available at recommended prices of $549 and $599. However, retailers in the U.S., U.K., and presumably elsewhere are now selling entry-level Radeon RX 9070-series models that are supposed to be selling at MSRPs at prices that are $50 to $130, according to The Verge. Our own research suggests things might be even more dire.

According to The Verge, major retailers in the U.S. and the U.K. including Micro Center, Newegg, and Overclockers U.K. have adjusted prices upward, with no models sold at MSRP currently in stock. As a result, AMD's Radeon 9070 XT experienced price increases of 11.7% to 21.7% in the U.S. ($70–$130) and 14% to 17.4% in the U.K. (£80–£100), while the vanilla Radeon 9070 saw increases of 14.5% to 21.8% in the U.S. ($70–$80) and 7.5% in the UK (£40). These boards are among the best graphics cards money can buy, but they are considerably more expensive than they should be.

The graphics cards in question come from ASRock, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, and XFX. With the exception of Gigabyte, those companies are AMD's exclusive partners, do not sell any Nvidia-based add-in-boards (AIBs), and are expected to adhere to MSRP with their entry-level products. We are indeed talking about entry-level products that belong to PowerColor's Reaper, Sapphire's Pulse, and XFX's Swift series — all known for affordability rather than extra features and lighting.

Interestingly, Best Buy still lists XFX Swift and Gigabyte Gaming models at MSRP — Radeon RX 9070 XT at $599 and RX 9070 at $549 — but all four variants are currently sold out with no indication that they're likely to come back in stock. Micro Center also lists a few models at their original prices, but none are available.

Last week AMD said that multiple vendors would sell cards at launch prices, but it did not specify how many cards would be sold or how long they would last before prices might go up. The company also did not confirm which board partners or retailers would adhere to the MSRP if demand is high and supply is tight.

The Verge notes that at least some U.S.-based retailers, including Best Buy, Newegg, and Micro Center, continue to list some of Nvidia's latest GeForce RTX 5070, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5080 graphics cards at MSRP (though they're also out of stock). It's unclear whether it is a matter of supply and demand balance for these products (at the end of the day, they are pretty expensive), or Nvidia and its partners have a policy to have at least some products sold at recommended prices.

Currently, looking at most major U.S. online stores, the best prices we can find are typically far above the base MSRPs. Best Buy has RTX 5070 cards priced at $649–$739 in stock, with one model laughably showing a ""Save $30"" notification. Everything else is out of stock. Asus currently shows an RX 9070 Prime for $659 in stock, if you're willing to pay that much and you act fast; it also show RTX 5070 Prime for $549, which likely won't last two seconds past the time we post this. Literally everything is out of stock at Newegg right now. Amazon has some items in stock, but many show up under ""new sellers"" — it's a risk to buy from such people, obviously. Outside of a few select places, then, even a 22% markup right now is probably better than you're likely to find online in the U.S.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Public IPv4 addresses are now valuable loan collateral and can be worth millions,https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/public-ipv4-addresses-are-now-valuable-loan-collateral-and-can-be-worth-millions,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:38:02 GMT","IPv4. Global has launched a new lending program that uses a borrower's IPv4 addresses as collateral. The firm, which describes itself as ""the world's largest, most trusted and transparent IPv4 marketplace,"" says the new loan facility is a first-of-its-kind offer to customers.

We've previously covered news concerning the scarcity of IPv4 addresses, and they certainly seem to be valuable nowadays. The Register reports that network operator Cogent has previously raised $206 million worth of notes solely backed by its IPv4 assets.

One of IPv4.Global's first major loan customer was an unnamed cloud data center operator. IPv4 Global says the customer leveraged its IPv4 assets to secure funding to grow its business successfully. That customer probably had lots of IPv4 addresses under its control, but IPv4.Global insists that ""regardless of size,"" it will work with customers to buy, sell, lease, and borrow against IPv4 blocks.

Its main page makes it relatively easy to see that IPv4.Global has quite a thriving business, with a claimed 66+ million addresses brokered and generating $1.4 billion for clients. It caters to customers of all scales, from buyers and sellers of 'small' IPv4 blocks to those holding millions of IPv4 addresses.

The source news release and official pages don't provide much indication about the number of IPv4 addresses or blocks needed (min/max) to qualify for a loan. According to The Register, one of the considerations behind the loans is how long it would take for the market to absorb the collateral if a borrower defaulted on their commitments: Illinois HQed Hilco Global, the multinational financial services holding company behind IPv4.Global, and we think this lending program will be primarily inspired by that company's areas of operational expertise.

IPv4.Global is making hay during what should be the sunset years for IPv4. One might expect organizations to be happy to migrate from IPv4 (32-bit addressing) to IPv6 (128-bit addressing) to avoid the specter of IPv4 address exhaustion and enjoy the boost from 4.3 billion to approximately 340 undecillion addresses being available. But even though IPv4 costs have ballooned over recent years, those who may wish to change to IPv6 face a mix of management/tech inertia, transition costs, potential business disruption, infrastructure compatibility issues, and more.",tomshardware

But what if you could get even more specific? That's where this cool Raspberry Pi project put together by maker and developer Glossyio comes in. Using our favorite SBC, they've crafted an AI-driven traffic monitor that provides specific traffic data no matter where it is deployed.

This project, like many others we feature, is open source so there's tons of source material to dig through if you want to create it for yourself or just get a better idea about how it goes together. This particular setup is really flexible so you can add or remove components to suit your preferences. Glossyio has yet to upload a build guide but plans to in the future.

The current iteration offers a handful of really useful features and compiles data to a series of easy-to-read graphs. Examples include the ability to monitor objects using a doppler radar, an AI system to count cars, cyclists and pedestrians. It even has the ability to determine the speed of passing cars.

If you're planning to use a Raspberry Pi for an AI system like this, it's a good idea to get your hands on the latest Raspberry Pi 5 for its performance and memory capacity. In Glossyio's setup, the Pi is connected to a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 to capture images (a good choice given that it has autofocus), an OPS243-A doppler radar sensor as well as an AI co-processor to help with the AI functionality. The traffic monitor is intended to be mounted outdoors in a location with a good view of the road and obviously it will need to be housed inside of a weather-proof enclosure.

You can find a detailed explanation of the software-side of the project over at the official project website trafficmonitor.ai . All of the source code has been shared, as well, and can be found over at GitHub .

The software stopped generating code around 750 to 800 lines. But instead of telling the user about a possible limitation of the Trial version, the AI told him to learn how to code himself, as it would not do his work for him, and that could lead to ""Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities.""

Upon trying to generate code for skid mark fade effects within a racing game, Cursor AI halted its code generation. Instead of continuing, Cursor responded that further coding should be done manually, highlighting the importance of personal coding practice for mastering logic and system understanding.

""I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work,"" the Cursor AI told the user. ""The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly. Reason: Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities.""

Experiencing this limit after just an hour into a casual coding session left the user dissatisfied, so he shared this frustration openly in the Cursor AI support forum. He questioned the purpose of AI coding tools if they impose such restrictions and asked whether artificial intelligence coding tools understand their purpose.

It is unlikely that Cursor got lazy or tired, though. There are a number of possibilities. The developers for the Pro Trial version could have intentionally programmed this behavior as a policy, or maybe the LLM is simply operating out of bounds due to a hallucination.

""I have three files with 1500+ [lines of codes] in my codebase (still waiting for a refactoring) and never experienced such thing,"" one user replied. ""Could it be related with some extended inference from your rule set.""",tomshardware

QNodeOS is designed to be hardware-agnostic and strives to abstract away low-level details from programmers for easy application development and deployment. It is a platform-independent framework capable of executing applications in a quantum network using high-level programming languages.

It is important to understand that QNodeOS targets quantum networks, rather than quantum computers. Put simply, quantum computers or processors like Microsoft's latest Majorana 1 chip are built to perform computations using the laws of quantum physics, such as entanglement and superposition. In contrast, quantum networks connect these quantum devices, facilitating coordination and are key for distributed quantum computing.

Quantum networks require an operating system to manage the flow of quantum information, manage entanglement, and synchronize all connected devices. Previous designs of quantum network applications relied on ad hoc, hardware-specific software, which was limited in functionality and lacked user-friendliness. Consider it the classical equivalent of low-level programming languages. High-level languages provide microarchitectural abstraction, enabling code portability across different designs. The quantum computing field requires similar advancements as Mariagrazia Luliano from QuTech explains: ""The system is like the software on your computer at home: You don't need to know how the hardware works to use it.""

The paper details how QNodeOS is compatible with different quantum chip designs: trapped ion processors and diamond color center (NV) based systems. Moreover, the platform supports multitasking for maximum hardware resource usage and efficiency. From what we can infer, this is done by translating high-level code to low-level NetQASM, which is then converted into hardware-specific instructions using what the paper defines as a QDriver.

The team demonstrated QNodeOS on two quantum nodes based on NV centers in diamonds, each with a single qubit. High-level instructions, explicitly mentioned as arbitrary, were executed following a basic QDC protocol in which a client node sends instructions to a server node.

This is the first implementation of high-level programming and execution of quantum network applications. The research further details long-distance connectivity measures to improve the architecture and reduce latency.",tomshardware

The case involves an alleged $390 million fraud linked to unauthorized exports of servers containing these chips to Malaysia. The individuals charged are Singaporeans Aaron Woon Guo Jie and Alan Wei Zhaolun, along with Chinese national Li Ming.

Prosecutors allege that they deceived major U.S. technology suppliers, including Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer, by misrepresenting the final destination of high-performance servers equipped with advanced Nvidia chips. These servers were purportedly diverted to unauthorized locations, raising concerns about potential breaches of U.S. export restrictions designed to prevent certain technologies from reaching specific nations.

The scale of the alleged fraud is substantial, with transactions totaling approximately $390 million. Investigations suggest that the accused exploited their positions within Singaporean companies to facilitate these unauthorized exports. Prosecutors have indicated that Wei allegedly paid himself significant dividends, while Woon received considerable bonuses, both derived from the purported fraudulent activities.

This case has naturally garnered international attention due to its potential implications for global technology supply chains and export control enforcement. The U.S. government has attempted to restrict the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to certain countries, aiming to prevent the misuse of technologies in areas contrary to U.S. interests. The alleged smuggling of Nvidia chips underscores the challenges in enforcing these controls amid complex international trade networks.

Following their arrest, the three men were granted bail by a Singaporean judge, said Bloomberg. The court imposed strict conditions to ensure their compliance with legal proceedings, reflecting the seriousness of the charges. Bail was set at S$800,000 ($600,000) and S$600,000 ($450,000) for the two Singaporean men, while the Chinese national received a S$1 million ($750,000) bail. Prosecutors requested an eight-week delay for investigations and imposed travel restrictions, a communication ban, and electronic monitoring specifically for the Chinese man.

Singaporean authorities, in collaboration with international partners, are said to be conducting investigations to trace the full extent of the alleged smuggling network. This includes scrutinizing the roles of additional individuals and entities potentially involved in circumventing export controls. As a whole, the case highlights the critical importance of robust compliance mechanisms within global technology supply chains to prevent the unauthorized transfer of sensitive technologies.",tomshardware

However, that doesn’t mean other OEMs are not working on building one with the approval of the Redmond software giant. According to The Verge’s sources, Microsoft is working to unify Xbox and Windows as a single platform, and Asus is one of its launch partners for this effort. As for the OEM, it’s working on Project Kennan — the codename for a gaming handheld that will likely benefit from Redmond’s efforts with the possibility of launching this year.

Aside from the hardware that Asus is building, Microsoft is also working on Project Bayside, a framework built to standardize the Xbox user interface across different devices. This will run the gaming handheld that Asus is building and is based on Windows but with an Xbox skin on top. Both Kennan and Bayside seem to be a part of Microsoft’s effort to integrate the best of Xbox and Windows.

Jason Ronal, the company’s VP of Xbox gaming devices and ecosystem, mentioned to The Verge earlier this year that the company is focusing on this integration and expects to see results later this year. However, while we hope these rumors are true, we still don’t have an official announcement (or maybe even just an official teaser) from either company.

Valve inspired a renaissance in handheld gaming consoles with the launch of the Steam Deck in 2022. However, Microsoft still currently has an advantage over it in terms of options, as most of the best PC gaming handhelds were and are powered by Windows 11. The tide may be changing with Lenovo announcement of the Legion Go S - Powered by SteamOS, though. You can get the Lenovo Legion Go S with Windows 11 today for $729, but the SteamOS-powered version, which will arrive in May, is expected to be much cheaper at just $499. The company said that it will launch a more affordable version of the Windows-powered Legion Go S around the same month for $599, but the $100 price difference might drive many gamers to the SteamOS version instead.

This development would have caught Microsoft’s attention, especially as one of its largest long-time OEM partners is introducing a rather popular OS substitute this May. It also shows that Valve is starting to face off with Windows with its SteamOS. Microsoft is already struggling to compete with the PlayStation 5 in the gaming console space, so it likely doesn’t want to let Valve and its SteamOS challenge it in handheld consoles. So, if it wants to ensure that it does not lose market share, it has to take steps to ensure that Xbox and Windows would remain the preferred operating system for handheld gaming.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,"Nvidia says it has shipped twice as many 50-series GPUs as 40-series since launch, but it's a misleading comparison",https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-says-it-shipped-twice-as-many-50-series-gpus-as-40-series-at-launch-but-that-doesnt-actually-mean-much,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 13:01:48 GMT","It's been a very busy year so far for GPUs, with Nvidia launching the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070 in the span of just two months. AMD also launched its RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, while Intel released the Arc B580 late last year and the Arc B570 in mid-January. The only problem? Outside of the Arc B570 (kind of but not really), every GPU launched so far has ended up being sold out or severely overpriced. But have no fear, because Nvidia claims it has shipped twice as many Blackwell GPUs as Ada during the first five weeks of each product series. Except that comparison is questionable, at best.

(Image credit: Nvidia)

The above chart looks pretty good, right? And then you go check the data and discover that the RTX 4090 launched on October 12, 2022, and was the only Ada GPU for the first five weeks — the RTX 4080 arrived on November 16, 2022, exactly five weeks and one day later. By comparison, the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 both launched on January 30, 2025; the RTX 5070 Ti arrived on February 20; and the RTX 5070 just came out on March 5. So, in the first five weeks, Nvidia appears to be comparing the sole halo card from its Ada Lovelace and RTX 40-series GPUs to the first four Blackwell and RTX 50-series GPUs — or at least, that's how we read it. Maybe the launch supply of the 4080 was also factored in.



If we were to get a more direct comparison, we'd need to look at the first five weeks of the 4090 and 4080, plus the first two weeks of the 4070 Ti, plus the first day of the 4070. We think it's a safe bet that all those added together would easily eclipse the number of RTX 50-series GPUs shipped so far. Even at the most simplistic level, Blackwell had two GPUs (5090 and 5080) launch on the same day compared to one GPU for Ada (4090), so shipping twice as many would be the baseline.



This was a 'great' way to obfuscate the number of units shipped and claim to have shipped more inventory than in the past. It also completely neglects the fact that RTX 30-series GPUs were still relatively available right up to the launch of the 40-series, while the 40-series cards have been disappearing from shelves since last fall. We're told that more RTX 50-series GPUs are being produced, and Nvidia and its add-in board (AIB) partners are making them as fast as possible, but concrete numbers are not something anyone is willing to disclose.



However you want to slice it, Nvidia's latest GPUs are hard to come by. The current lowest prices online have just one RTX 5070 for $739 at Newegg, with third-party scalpers listing RTX 5070 cards at Amazon for $900 or more. RTX 5070 Ti starts at $1,149, the 5080 costs $1,609 or more, and the RTX 5090... you don't even want to know. (None are listed at PC Part Picker, but on eBay during the past 30 days the average sold 5090 at auction cost nearly $4,500, with 194 units sold.) AMD's RX 9070 series GPUs aren't doing much better, with an $853 RX 9070 on Amazon and a $939 RX 9070 XT also at Amazon. It could be a long wait for supply to catch up to demand, needless to say.

Besides making some misleading, at best, claims about Blackwell RTX availability, Nvidia also discussed the advances it's working with developers to enable DLSS 4 MFG and upscaling, Neural Shading, and ACE. RTX Remix officially left beta today as well, and there will be a public Half-Life 2 RTX demo available on March 18, offering vastly improved visuals compared to the original game that's now over 20 years old. [Ed: Where's my cane?]



You can see the rest of the announcements in the above slide deck. There's more marketing hype around the performance boost offered by DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which, as we discussed in our own in-depth testing, tends to be a highly inflated way of looking at performance. It's not that MFG is bad, per se, but even Nvidia's own numbers should cause some raised eyebrows. Like this performance result from Portal RTX:

(Image credit: Nvidia)

Updates to the RTX Remix toolset combined with neural rendering features like the neural radiance cache deliver more than double the performance compared to the Remix beta. And then we look at the details.



Base RTX Remix beta performance was 125 FPS — that's with DLSS 3.5 and frame generation. Runtime optimizations and texture streaming account for a 22% increase, and there's another 18% improvement from the neural radiance cache. Together, those would result in performance of 175 FPS, an impressive 40% improvement. Then DLSS 4 MFG4X, on top of that, ""increases"" performance by 73%. But what it really does is drop the base non-framegen performance from ~88 FPS to ~76 FPS.



Either way, it's still running fast enough that the result should be very playable and look incredibly smooth, particularly if you have a 240 Hz 4K monitor. But that's also with an RTX 5090, which in our testing provides up to 60% higher performance than the RTX 5080 for demanding ray traced games, 75% higher performance than the RTX 5070 Ti, and 143% more performance than the RTX 5070.



By those metrics, 4K with performance upscaling and MFG4X on an RTX 5070 might only get around 125 FPS in Portal RTX on an RTX 5070, and it would feel more like 31 FPS in terms of input sampling and latency. That's still playable, but nowhere near what the MFG numbers might suggest in terms of user experience. 120 FPS via MFG isn't the same feel as a native 120 FPS, or even 120 FPS with regular framegen. And how will Half-Life 2 RTX run, given it's presumably an even more demanding game? We'll find out next week.



As we've noted in so many of our recent GPU reviews, the fundamental problem is supply and demand. The demand — and record $130 billion in revenue — for AI and data center GPUs and hardware dwarfs what Nvidia or any other company might make on consumer GPUs for gaming right now. Until that changes, we're not likely to see sufficient supply to meet demand for gaming GPUs, never mind finding GPUs available at their ostensible MSRPs.



One thing Nvidia didn't talk about yet is the widely rumored impending announcement of the RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060. Prices have started popping up online, and the full specs have been leaked multiple times. The TLDR: They're both 128-bit memory interfaces, and it looks like they'll launch with 8GB configurations, with an optional 16GB 5060 Ti as an upgraded solution. Prices and availability are still unknown factors.",tomshardware

An intriguing thing about the GeForce RTX 5060 is that an unknown Chinese retailer lists a 12GB version of the GeForce RTX 5060 (non-Ti), which is something that we have not heard of before. This could be a typo, or Nvidia plans to segmentize the midrange market further.

The GeForce RTX 5060 12GB was allegedly listed in China priced at ¥3,799 ($524, $463 without VAT), whereas the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti reportedly carries a ¥4,299 ($597, $528 without VAT) price tag. Unfortunately, it is unclear whether the aforementioned GeForce RTX 5060 Ti carries 8GB or 16GB of GDDR7 memory.

Since the information comes from an anonymous and unofficial source, take it with a grain of salt, especially keeping in mind the fact that the prices of GeForce RTX 5060-series products look rather high compared to MSRPs of the much more potent GeForce RTX 5070: $549 for the U.S. and ¥4,599 for China ($635, $562 without VAT).

If the information is correct, then the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti will likely feature an MSRP of $499, whereas its smaller non-Ti GeForce RTX 5060 sibling will have a recommended price of $449.

*unofficial information

If the GeForce RTX 5060 with 12GB of GDDR7 SGRAM is real, then it raises a question about how its memory subsystem is organized. Assuming that we are dealing with a GB206-based product, then Nvidia and its partners could use four 24Gb GDDR7 ICs to assemble a 128-bit 12GB subsystem. However, it is also possible that a GB206-based 12GB model uses three 32Gb memory chips and therefore has a 96-bit SGRAM interface, a first in this segment. Finally, it is possible that Nvidia uses a heavily cut-down GB205 graphics processor with a 192-bit memory interface for GeForce RTX 5060 with 12GB of memory to cater for this market segment.

Given the fact that Nvidia is expected to roll out its GeForce RTX 5060-series products in the coming days, it does not make a lot of sense to speculate about these parts too much right now. Nonetheless, it looks like the $400 - $500 graphics cards market segment is going to be quite heavily packed this year.",tomshardware

Une nouvelle étude du Tow Center for Digital Journalism de Columbia montre que plusieurs chatbots d'IA identifient souvent mal les articles d'actualité, présentent des informations incorrectes sans aucune réserve et créent des liens vers des articles d'actualité qui n'existent pas.

Toute l’actualité de la tech pour les pros chaque jour dans notre newsletter En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

La tendance n'est pas nouvelle. Le mois dernier, la BBC a constaté que les chatbots ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot et Perplexity avaient du mal à résumer les nouvelles avec précision, et qu'ils fournissaient plutôt des ""inexactitudes significatives"" et des ""distorsions"".

Et le rapport de Tow apporte de nouvelles preuves que de nombreux chatbots d'IA peuvent accéder au contenu de sites qui bloquent ses robots d'indexation. Voici ce qu'il faut savoir et quels sont les modèles les moins fiables.

L'IA n'identifie pas les articles d'actualité

Les chercheurs de Tow ont choisi au hasard 10 articles de 20 éditeurs. Ils ont interrogé huit chatbots avec des extraits d'articles, en demandant à l'IA de renvoyer le titre, l'éditeur, la date et l'URL de l'article correspondant.

""Nous avons délibérément choisi des extraits qui, s'ils étaient collés dans une recherche Google traditionnelle, renverraient la source originale dans les trois premiers résultats"", notent les chercheurs.

Columbia Journalism Review

Après avoir lancé les 1 600 requêtes, les chercheurs ont classé les réponses des chatbots en fonction de la précision avec laquelle ils avaient retrouvé l'article, l'éditeur et l'URL. Les chatbots ont renvoyé des réponses erronées pour plus de 60 % des requêtes. Les résultats varient en fonction du chatbot. Perplexity s'est trompé dans 37 % des requêtes, tandis que Grok 3 a renvoyé 94 % d'erreurs.

Columbia Journalism Review

En quoi cela est-il important ? Si les chatbots sont moins bons que Google pour récupérer correctement des informations, on ne peut pas nécessairement compter sur eux pour interpréter et citer ces informations. Et cela rend le contenu de leurs réponses, même lorsqu'elles sont liées, beaucoup plus douteux.

Donner de mauvaises réponses en toute confiance

Les chercheurs notent que les chatbots ont renvoyé des réponses erronées avec une ""confiance alarmante"", sans nuancer leurs résultats ni admettre leurs lacunes en matière de connaissances.

ChatGPT ""n'a jamais refusé de fournir une réponse"", bien que 134 de ses 200 réponses aient été incorrectes.

""Tous les outils étaient systématiquement plus enclins à fournir une réponse incorrecte qu'à reconnaître leurs limites"", précise le rapport.

Les services payants ne sont pas plus fiables

Si les modèles premium tels que Grok-3 Search et Perplexity Pro ont répondu plus correctement que les versions gratuites, ils ont néanmoins donné des réponses erronées avec plus de confiance. Ce qui remet en question la valeur de leurs coûts d'abonnement souvent astronomiques.

""Cette contradiction découle principalement de la tendance des robots à fournir des réponses définitives, mais erronées, plutôt que de refuser de répondre directement à la question"", explique le rapport. ""La préoccupation fondamentale va au-delà des erreurs factuelles des chatbots et concerne leur ton conversationnel autoritaire, qui peut rendre difficile pour les utilisateurs de faire la distinction entre des informations exactes et inexactes.""

""Cette confiance non méritée donne aux utilisateurs une illusion dangereuse de fiabilité et d'exactitude"", ajoute le rapport.

Fabriquer des liens

Les modèles d'IA sont connus pour avoir régulièrement des hallucinations. Mais si tous les chatbots hallucinent de faux articles dans leurs réponses, Tow a constaté que Gemini et Grok 3 le font le plus souvent. ""Même lorsque Grok identifiait correctement un article, il renvoyait souvent à une URL fabriquée"", note le rapport, ce qui signifie que Grok pouvait trouver le bon titre et le bon éditeur, mais qu'il fabriquait ensuite le lien vers l'article en question.

Une analyse des données de trafic de Comscore réalisée par Generative AI in the Newsroom, une initiative de l'université de Northwestern, confirme cette tendance. Leur étude des données de juillet à novembre 2024 montre que ChatGPT a généré 205 URL cassés dans ses réponses. Bien que les publications suppriment parfois des articles, ce qui peut entraîner des erreurs 404, les chercheurs ont noté qu'en raison du manque de données d'archives, il était ""probable que le modèle ait halluciné des liens d'apparence plausible vers des sites d'information faisant autorité lorsqu'il répondait aux requêtes des utilisateurs"".

Ces résultats sont inquiétants compte tenu de l'adoption croissante des moteurs de recherche IA. Bien qu'ils n'aient pas encore remplacé les moteurs de recherche traditionnels, Google a lancé la semaine dernière AI Mode, qui remplace sa recherche normale par un chatbot (malgré l'impopularité de ses AI Overviews). Si l'on considère que quelque 400 millions d'utilisateurs affluent chaque semaine sur ChatGPT, le manque de fiabilité et la distorsion de ses citations font de ChatGPT et d'autres outils d'IA populaires des moteurs de désinformation.

Le rapport Tow conclut que les outils d'intelligence artificielle qui citent mal les sources ou représentent incorrectement leur travail pourraient nuire à la réputation des éditeurs.

Ignorer les robots bloqués

La situation s'aggrave pour les éditeurs. Le rapport Tow constate que plusieurs chatbots peuvent récupérer des articles auprès d'éditeurs qui ont pourtant bloqué leurs robots d'exploration à l'aide du protocole d'exclusion des robots (REP), ou robots.txt.

""Perplexity Pro a été le plus mauvais élève à cet égard, identifiant correctement près d'un tiers des 90 extraits d'articles auxquels il n'aurait pas dû avoir accès"", indique le rapport.

Cela suggère que non seulement les sociétés d'IA continuent d'ignorer le REP. Perplexity et d'autres ont été pris en flagrant délit l'année dernière. Mais aussi que les éditeurs ayant conclu un accord de licence avec les acteurs de l'IA ne sont pas assurés d'être correctement cités.

Le rapport de Columbia souligne un symptôme d'un problème plus vaste. Le rapport Generative AI in the Newsroom a également découvert que les chatbots dirigent rarement le trafic vers les sites d'information dont ils extraient des informations. Ce que d'autres rapports confirment également. De juillet à novembre 2024, Perplexity a transmis 7 % des renvois vers des sites d'information. ChatGPT n'en a transmis que 3 %. En comparaison, les outils d'IA ont eu tendance à favoriser les ressources éducatives telles que Scribd.com, Coursera et celles liées aux universités, leur envoyant jusqu'à 30 % du trafic.",zdnet

Comme le décrit l'entreprise de sécurité Malwarebytes dans un nouveau rapport, ce stratagème repose sur la facilité avec laquelle les gens suivent souvent les étapes d'un CAPTCHA sans réfléchir.

Comment fonctionne l'attaque

Vous arrivez sur un site web qui promet des films, de la musique, des images, des articles d'actualité ou tout autre contenu intéressant. Une invite CAPTCHA apparaît, vous demandant de prouver que vous n'êtes pas un robot. Comme nous sommes tous habitués à ce type de demandes, beaucoup d'entre nous n'hésitent pas à les accepter.

Mais au lieu de l'habituel CAPTCHA qui vous demande de choisir certaines images dans un tableau ou d'identifier des caractères déformés, celui-ci vous donne les instructions présentées dans l'image ci-dessous :

Malwarebytes

À ce stade, la plupart des utilisateurs avertis se rendent compte que quelque chose ne va pas et quittent le site. Mais n'oubliez pas que les cybercriminels ne ciblent pas les utilisateurs avertis. Ils essaient d'atteindre des personnes moins averties et plus faciles à piéger. Et même les utilisateurs avertis, pressés ou en pilotage automatique, peuvent tomber dans le piège.

Un piège fatal

Si vous suivez les étapes, le site web copie une chaîne de texte dans votre presse-papiers Windows. Normalement, vous devriez donner votre autorisation pour une telle action, mais vous l'avez déjà fait en cochant une case sur le premier écran de l'invite CAPTCHA.

Comme on peut le voir dans le champ de texte de Windows Run, la chaîne dit simplement : ""Je ne suis pas un robot -- reCAPTCHA Verification ID : 8253"". Mais dans les coulisses se cache une autre chaîne, qui exécute une commande Windows appelée Mshta.exe.

Normalement, ce fichier est une commande légitime et sûre utilisée pour exécuter du code. Mais les pirates et les escrocs peuvent facilement l'exploiter pour télécharger et installer des logiciels malveillants. Et c'est exactement ce qui se passe ici.

Malwarebytes

Infecter votre PC afin de voler des données sensibles

Dans ce cas, Mshta récupère un fichier multimédia malveillant sur le site web. Le nom du fichier peut sembler assez innocent. Malwarebytes dit avoir vu des fichiers portant des extensions telles que mp3, mp4, jpg, jpeg, swf et html.

Mais le fichier lui-même contient une commande PowerShell qui télécharge et exécute de manière invisible la charge utile destructrice.

Dans le passé, le logiciel malveillant téléchargé était presque toujours l'infostealer Lumma Stealer. Mais dans les campagnes les plus récentes, les attaquants ont plutôt utilisé SecTopRAT. Quoi qu'il en soit, le logiciel malveillant est conçu pour infecter votre PC afin de voler des données sensibles.

Comment se protéger contre cette attaque par CAPTCHA ?

Outre la connaissance des tactiques, comment pouvez-vous vous protéger contre cette campagne et d'autres similaires ?

Malwarebytes propose quelques conseils :

Ne suivez jamais les instructions données sur un site web sans y avoir réfléchi au préalable. Utilisez un programme de sécurité et une extension de navigateur qui bloquent les sites web et les scripts malveillants. Désactivez JavaScript dans votre navigateur si vous visitez des sites web aléatoires ou inconnus. Dans la campagne décrite par Malwarebytes, l'accès au presse-papiers se fait via une fonction JavaScript. La désactivation de JavaScript fera échouer l'attaque, mais elle risque de vous empêcher d'utiliser de nombreux sites que vous visitez régulièrement. Vous pouvez vouloir le bloquer en général, mais l'autoriser pour des sites spécifiques.

Mais alors comment désactiver JavaScript ?

Pour désactiver JavaScript dans Google Chrome

Allez dans Paramètres, sélectionnez Confidentialité et sécurité, puis cliquez sur Paramètres du site

Cliquez sur le paramètre JavaScript et modifiez l'option en ""Désactiver JavaScript pour tous les sites""

Vous pouvez ensuite ajouter des sites spécifiques autorisés à utiliser JavaScript.

Comment désactiver JavaScript dans Edge

Allez dans Paramètres, sélectionnez Cookies et autorisations de site, puis cliquez sur JavaScript

Désactivez l'option Autorisé, puis ajoutez les sites individuels pour lesquels vous souhaitez que JavaScript fonctionne

Dans un billet de blog publié hier, Google reconnaît que de nombreux utilisateurs rencontrent des problèmes lors de la réception de médias dans Messages.

Parfois, l'application ralentit considérablement, explique l'entreprise, parfois elle s'arrête complètement.

Un problème global

Google n'a pas expliqué précisément en quoi consistaient ces problèmes. Mais des messages sur Reddit montrent qu'ils sont très répandus. Certains utilisateurs signalent que le chargement de Messages est lent lors de l'affichage des pièces jointes et ne s'affiche pas pendant plusieurs minutes.

Certains disent que les images sont floues lorsqu'ils essaient de les afficher. D'autres ont des problèmes avec des messages qui ne se chargent pas du tout.

Les problèmes surviennent lors de la réception de médias à partir d'un iPhone ou d'un smartphone Android. Il ne s'agit donc pas d'un problème de système d'exploitation. Et ils se produisent sur une grande variété d'appareils et d'opérateurs.

Pas de solution de contournement

Il semble qu'il n'y ait rien à faire pour améliorer la situation. Les utilisateurs signalent que le redémarrage de leur téléphone ne les aide pas. Et que les problèmes persistent, qu'ils soient liés à une connexion Wi-Fi ou à des données mobiles.

Google travaille sur ce problème et a récemment déployé plusieurs mises à jour visant à améliorer les performances.

Certains utilisateurs indiquent que les choses s'améliorent et que les images se chargent sans problème. Mais d'autres rencontrent encore des problèmes.

Google veut des informations

Si vous rencontrez toujours des problèmes, Google souhaite en être informé.

""Nous vous invitons à continuer à nous faire part de vos expériences"", peut-on lire dans le message de Google. ""Vos commentaires sont absolument essentiels pour nous permettre d'améliorer Messages. Si vous rencontrez encore des problèmes, merci de nous en faire part.""

Les utilisateurs qui rencontrent encore des problèmes avec Messages peuvent les signaler sur la communauté d'aide Google Messages.

Lorsqu'Apple a annoncé le MacBook Air M4 au début du mois, il était clair qu'il s'agirait d'une évolution très progressive par rapport au modèle de l'année dernière. Une évolution à base de la dernière puce Apple, d'une multitude de fonctionnalités logicielles, et d'intelligence artificielle.

Le fait que la version 13 pouces soit 100 € moins chère que le modèle précédent est aussi une surprise agréable.

J'ai eu l'occasion de tester le nouveau MacBook Air M4 pendant quelques jours. C'est un appareil plus rapide et un plus soigné que son prédécesseur. Voici mes premières impressions.

Mises à jour matérielles : en avoir plus pour moins

L'une des principales améliorations matérielles de l'Air M4 est l'extension de ses capacités en bas et en haut de gamme. La configuration la plus basse du M4 est équipée d'un processeur à 10 cœurs et d'un GPU à 8 cœurs, contrairement à la puce M3 à 8 cœurs de l'année dernière.

D'autre part, la configuration haut de gamme dispose de 32 Go de mémoire unifiée, qui était auparavant limitée à 24 Go sur le MacBook Air M3.

Ces améliorations des composants de base et d'un prix de départ plus bas lui permet de rester pertinent et d'être un concurrent digne de ce nom face à l'afflux d'autres ultraportables.

L'écran est toujours aussi impressionnant

J'ai testé le MacBook Air 15 pouces. Il est fin et léger. Mais des concurrents sont apparus ces dernières années, en particulier dans les catégories 15 et 16 pouces. Ainsi, le LG Gram Pro 16, par exemple, est doté d'un écran encore plus grand et est plus fin et plus léger que le MacBook Air M4 de 15 pouces.

Mais l'Air possède des caractéristiques qui le distinguent, tant sur le plan logiciel que matériel. La plus évidente est son superbe écran et la prise en charge de deux moniteurs externes supplémentaires lorsque le capot est ouvert.

La qualité de l'écran est indiscutable. L'écran Liquid Retina d'Apple est plus beau que jamais sur l'Air M4. Les textes sont nets et bien définis, les vidéos sont fluides et éclatantes, avec la prise en charge d'un milliard de couleurs. Et c'est encore mieux lorsqu'il est connecté à deux moniteurs supplémentaires. Cela conforte le MacBook Air à sa place d'appareil de productivité de premier plan.

Il y a un peu d'éblouissement, mais l'écran est toujours aussi beau. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

Trois écrans en même temps !

Cette fonctionnalité tant attendue est un autre moyen de rapprocher le MacBook Air du MacBook Pro. Lors de mes premiers tests, le Air s'est connecté en toute transparence à deux écrans via l'un des deux ports USB-C Thunderbolt 4.

J'utilise un appareil Windows au quotidien. Et bien que j'utilise des Mac depuis de nombreuses années, j'avais oublié à quel point le MacBook Air pouvait gérer le multitâche sans effort.

Comment ? En combinant le Launchpad, l'écran partagé et la conversation directe avec Siri. En outre, les améliorations apportées à la disposition des fenêtres en mosaïque sont extrêmement satisfaisantes pour ceux d'entre nous qui aiment que leur bureau soit agencé d'une manière particulière.

Un concentré de productivité avec Center Stage

En ce qui concerne la productivité, la nouvelle fonction Center Stage, que nous avons vue pour la première fois sur ordinateur avec le MacBook Pro et l'iMac à l'automne dernier, est désormais disponible sur le MacBook Air. À mes yeux, il s'agit moins d'une fonction autonome que de l'avenir inévitable de la technologie des webcams.

Si vous ne connaissez pas, Center Stage permet de recentrer votre visage à l'écran, quelle que soit la position de l'appareil. Si comme moi la prise d'appels vidéo fait partie de votre quotidien professionnel, passer un appel avec la webcam 12 Mpx du MacBook Air M4 sera un vrai bonheur.

A mon avis, c'est ainsi que les webcams devraient fonctionner.

Le MacBook Air 15 pouces pèse 3,3 livres. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

Le bonheur de Presenter View

Dans le même ordre d'idées, la fonction Presenter Preview permet de prévisualiser l'aspect de votre partage d'écran avant de le montrer.

Cela vous donne un aperçu de la façon dont les participants à la réunion verront votre caméra et votre bureau.

En résumé sur les nouveautés du MacBook Air M4

La prise en charge d'écrans supplémentaires, l'augmentation de la capacité de mémoire et les améliorations logicielles font du MacBook Air M4 une machine de productivité puissante.

Toutes ces améliorations peuvent sembler être de petits changements.

Mais elles s'ajoutent les unes aux autres pour donner un appareil qui s'impose pour moi comme ""LE "" portable de productivité des professionnels.

Un marché énorme en vue

Les deux fondations collaborent déjà étroitement dans le cadre de l'Open Infrastructure Blueprint, qui intègre des projets clés, notamment Linux, OpenStack et Kubernetes. Ce partenariat prend en charge des charges de travail critiques pour des centaines d'organisations dans le monde entier. L'idée est de créer des opportunités pour que ces technologies dépassent les outils propriétaires dans les environnements d'infrastructure.

En unissant leurs forces, les organisations accéléreront la modernisation des centres de données en collaborant avec des projets tels que Kubernetes et PyTorch. En d'autres termes, cette fusion est une démarche naturelle.

Le partenariat vise à maintenir l'approche communautaire d'OpenInfra tout en bénéficiant des structures de gouvernance établies de la Fondation Linux.

Le marché de l'infrastructure des centres de données, une préoccupation particulière d'OpenInfra, subit des changements significatifs induits par les exigences de l'IA, la virtualisation et la souveraineté numérique. Jonathan Bryce, directeur exécutif d'OpenInfra, a souligné que c'est le moment idéal de combiner les ressources afin de stimuler le marché des logiciels libres d'environ 8276 milliards d'euros.

De plus amples informations sur la fusion seront communiquées lors du Sommet des membres de la Fondation Linux qui se tiendra à Napa, en Californie, la semaine prochaine.",zdnet

C’est-à-dire la 5G standalone (SA). Elle est appelée ainsi car elle fonctionne sur le cœur de réseau sans utiliser les infrastructures existantes de la 4G. Cette « pure » 5G peut concrétiser enfin les promesses techniques évoqués lors du lancement commercial de la nouvelle norme, il y a plus de quatre ans.

Toute l’actualité de la tech pour les pros chaque jour dans notre newsletter En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

Cette évolution du standard des communications mobiles accroît les débits, diminue le délai de latence et renforce la sécurité des données utilisateurs. Offrant un surcroît de capacité, la 5G SA garantit, par ailleurs, un accès privilégié au réseau, même sur des zones densément peuplées, comme une salle de concert ou un stade de foot.

En passant de la VoLTE (Voice over LTE) à la VoNR (Voice over New Radio), la 5G+ améliore par ailleurs :

La qualité des communications vocales

Le temps d’établissement des appels

L’autonomie de la batterie du smartphone

Free et Orange ont tiré les premiers

Renommée par les opérateurs télécoms 5G+, comme il y a eu la 4G+, ces derniers entendent capitaliser sur cette nouvelle technologie pour attirer de nouveaux abonnés ou fidéliser les clients existants. Un argument marketing susceptible de faire mouche sur ce marché hyperconcurrentiel de la téléphonie mobile.

Sur le marché grand public, Free Mobile a été le premier opérateur à proposer, dès septembre, cette option à ses abonnés disposant d’un smartphone compatible. A savoir les derniers modèles de Samsung, Google, Xiaomi ou Honor.

Il a été rejoint, début mars, par Orange avec deux nouvelles offres dédiés. L’opérateur avait précédemment lancé une box internet en 5G+, baptisée 5G+ Home. Pour l’heure SFR et Bouygues Telecom réservent leurs solutions 5G SA aux entreprises.

Pour les gamers et les streamers

En dépit des superlatifs employés par les opérateurs pour « vendre » la nouvelle 5G, Que Choisir se montre sceptique. « Pour la très grande majorité des utilisateurs, la 5G+ n’apportera rien dans l’immédiat, les réseaux actuels suffisant largement pour la très grande majorité des usages. » Pour l’association de consommateurs, « seuls les joueurs exigeants sur mobile et ceux voulant absolument visionner du streaming en haute définition pourraient y trouver un quelconque intérêt. »

Bref, pour Que Choisir, il est urgent d’attendre. « Comme pour chaque lancement de nouvelle technologie, les opérateurs se battent surtout pour apparaître comme les premiers sur le coup. »

Au risque d'être condamné pour publicité trompeuse comme ce fut la cas pour SFR. De belles promesses qui pourraient, par ailleurs, ne pas être tenues sur le terrain. Au-delà du fait de disposer d’un téléphone compatible, l’utilisateur doit être dans une zone couverte.

Une couverture encore insuffisante

Or, la 5G+ ne fonctionne que sur la bande de fréquence 3,5 GHz. Selon les lois de la physique, cette fréquence haute offre des performances élevées en termes de vitesse et de capacité mais avec une portée limitée. Il s’agit donc de multiplier les antennes pour prolonger le signal radio.

Selon leurs stratégies de déploiement, les opérateurs ont fait des choix différents. Orange a retenu, depuis le début, la 3,5 GHz et dispose de 11 818 sites opérationnels sur cette fréquence d’après les derniers décomptes de l’Agence nationale des fréquences (ANFR), lui assurant la meilleure couverture.

Inversement, Free Mobile a fait historiquement le choix de la bande basse 700 MHz (20 612 sites opérationnels) pour assurer une couverture rapide tout en rattrapant depuis son retard sur la 3,5 GHZ (8 524 sites). Ménageant le chèvre et le chou, Bouygues Télécom et SFR ont équitablement rétabli leur parc sur les fréquences 2,1 GHz et 3,5 GHz tout en boudant la bande à 700 MHz.

Impact environnemental et cadeaux empoisonnés

Enfin, Que Choisir soulève la question de l’enjeu environnemental de cette super 5G. « La 5G+ risque fort de contribuer à l’explosion de la consommation de data, dont l’impact sur l’environnement est loin d’être négligeable, surtout si elle est associée, comme le fait Orange, à des services ultra-gourmands en bande passante comme ChatGPT ou Netflix. »

Enfin, la 5G+ peut grever le pouvoir d’achat des ménages. Si l’offre d’Orange inclut effectivement un accès gratuit à la version payante de ChatGPT pendant 12 mois et à Netflix Standard (avec publicité) pendant 6 mois, Que Choisir note que ces services peuvent s’avérer particulièrement coûteux si on oublie de les résilier à temps.

Après la période de gratuité, ils sont facturés respectivement 23 et 5,99 euros par mois.

La 5G+, une affaire de « pros » ?

Si l’intérêt de la 5G+ paraît, pour l’heure, limité pour les particuliers, il pourrait davantage séduire le monde de l’entreprise. L’association débit garanti + faible latence + sécurité accrue répond à des cas d’usage critiques dans le monde de l’industrie, de la logistique ou du BTP.

Lors du lancement, début févier, de son offre 5G+ pour les professionnels, Orange évoquait aussi la généralisation du télétravail et des applications gourmandes en bande passante comme la visioconférence.

Le monde de l’événementiel est, enfin, potentiellement concerné aqund il s’agit de faire fonctionner des services de billetterie ou des terminaux de paiement dans les lieux densément peuplés.

La transposition en France de la directive européenne NIS (Network and information security) 2 vient de franchir l'étape du Sénat. Ce mercredi 12 mars, la Chambre haute a en effet bouclé son travail sur le projet de loi relatif à la résilience des infrastructures critiques et au renforcement de la cybersécurité.

Toute l’actualité de la tech pour les pros chaque jour dans notre newsletter En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

""Ce texte est une réponse nécessaire et ambitieuse face à la menace croissante qui pèse sur notre nation"", a salué Claire Chappaz, la ministre chargée de l'intelligence artificielle et du numérique.

Outre NIS 2, le texte doit inscrire dans le droit français deux autres directives :

Celles sur la résilience des entités critiques (REC), qui d'actualiser le dispositif de sécurité des activités d’importance vitale mis en place depuis 2006.

Celle sur la résilience numérique du secteur financier (Dora), qui doit permettre ""un encadrement plus rigoureux du secteur financier"".

Post by @ [email protected] View on Mastodon

Périmètre ambitieux

Comme le rappelle le Sénat, l'examen du projet de loi a ainsi permis aux sénateurs revenir sur les délais d'application des nouvelles obligations ou encore de ""modérer les effets de surtranspositions"". S'ils ont estimé que l'inclusion d'un grand nombre de collectivités et d'établissements d'enseignement supérieur dans le périmètre de NIS 2 était ""ambitieux"", elle est également considérée ""nécessaire"".

Environ 1 500 collectivités sont concernées par ce texte. A leur appui, les sénateurs relevaient le coût élevé de quelques attaques informatiques déplorées ces dernières années. La facture s'était montée à 900 000 euros environ pour la métropole Aix-Marseille-Provence, attaquée en mars 2020. Et et à plus de 1,5 million d'euros pour la ville de Bondy, visée en novembre 2020.

Au total, la transposition de la directive NIS 2 va se traduire par de nouvelles obligations pour environ 15 000 organisations de 18 secteurs d’activité, de la santé à l’énergie en passant par la gestion des déchets. Classées comme ""importantes"" ou ""essentielles"", elles devront muscler leurs défenses, mettre en place des mesures de gestion des risques adaptées ou enfin déclarer leurs incidents de sécurité à l'Anssi.

Ne pas affaiblir la cryptographie

Si les débats au Sénat ont été l'occasion de revoir à la marge le texte, le sénateur Olivier Cadic a finalement réussi son pari. Son amendement visant à sanctuariser le chiffrement a en effet été adopté. Soit quelques jours après la controverse sur le vote, là aussi au Sénat, d'une disposition relevant de la porte dérobée dans la proposition de loi contre le narcotrafic.

""Votre amendement est trop large et aurait des effets de bords non désirés"", avait plaidé en séance Claire Chappaz, qui avait en vain demandé le retrait de la disposition.

""Nous devons donner à nos services de renseignement les moyens d'être efficaces, mais pas au prix d'un affaiblissement général de la cryptographie"", lui avait notamment répondu la sénatrice Corinne Narassiguin. Le projet de loi doit désormais être étudié par l'Assemblée nationale.",zdnet

Les agents d'IA sont en passe de devenir un atout pour l'ensemble des microservices qui forment le tissu de l'IT des entreprises.

Toute l’actualité de la tech pour les pros chaque jour dans notre newsletter En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

De plus, avec la prolifération de ces agents, les DSI deviendront des départements virtuels de ""ressources humaines"", recrutant, intégrant et formant ces assistants d'IA de la même manière que ce que font les RH avec les ressources humaines.

Telles sont les conclusions d'un panel organisé par Deloitte lors du récent Mobile World Congress. Les panélistes ont déclaré que l'architecture agentique ressemble à l'avènement des architectures microservices, qui décomposent les applications monolithiques en morceaux flexibles et indépendants.

""Idéer ou d'exécuter de manière indépendante""

""L'IA agentique est la prochaine étape dans la décomposition et la résolution des problèmes"", a déclaré Bryan Thompson, VP GreenLake chez HPE. Il devient possible de ""tirer parti de ces types de modèles et de les décomposer en une approche de type microservice - en les décomposant en services spécialisés"".

L'IA agentique permet d'assembler les flux de travail de l'entreprise, a convenu Fred Devoir, responsable architecture telco chez Nvidia. ""Nous assemblons les composants dans une architecture RESTful. Nvidia optimise optimise les agents d'IA avec les microservices, puis les intègre dans des schémas directeurs"".

Bien sûr, l'IA agentique apporte des capacités qui vont bien au-delà de ce que les architectures de microservices traditionnelles proposent. ""Jusqu'à présent, nous n'avions jamais eu de technologie capable d'idéer ou d'exécuter de manière indépendante"", dit Abdi Goodarzi, responsable des produits d'IA Gen chez Deloitte. ""C'est là toute la puissance de l'IA"".

""Les humains ont des émotions. Les agents n'ont pas d'émotions""

Conséquence, les services d'IA agentique prennent en charge une grande partie des tâches humaines. C'est donc une main-d'œuvre parallèle qui se forme. Mais elle est intégrée et gérée par la DSI plutôt que par les RH.

""La gestion du capital humain et la gestion du capital de l'IA agentique sont la même chose"" dit Fred Devoir. ""La différence, c'est que la DSI joue le rôle de RH pour ces agents d'IA. La DSI assume également les rôles de curation, de garde-fou, de formation et d'ajustement des agents d'IA pour qu'ils effectuent des tâches spécifiques et interagissent avec les flux de travail humains. Ce n'est pas une mince affaire. C'est comme les RH à un niveau technique beaucoup plus profond"".

Cela implique également des changements radicaux au sein des organisations. ""Les humains ont des émotions. Les agents n'ont pas d'émotions"", explique M. Goodarzi. ""Comment intégrer les émotions qui feront partie de l'exécution du travail ? La manière dont les humains et les machines travaillent ensemble doit être changée.""

Mais comment faire confiance à un agent d'IA ?

Le passage à une entreprise agentique n'est toutefois pas sans poser de problèmes. En ce qui concerne les données, ""les entreprises ont investi beaucoup d'argent pour contrôler leurs données structurées"", a déclaré M. Goodzari, citant les systèmes ERP. "" Et toutes ces applications ou systèmes aboutissent à des silos de données"".

L'IA agentique peut aider à résoudre ce problème, en permettant le déploiement d'agents là où sont les données. ""Au lieu d'apporter toutes vos données à l'IA, vous amenez l'IA aux données"", a déclaré M. Devior. ""Lorsque vous faites un appel de service, l'IA demande en fait une réponse à tous ces agents de données - et rassemble ces données dans un modèle"".

Vient ensuite la question de la fiabilité des agents. ""Il faut se demander si l'on a affaire aux bonnes données"", souligne M. Goodzari. ""Les technologies précédentes ont été conçues autour de l'activité transactionnelle. L'IA agentique est conçue autour des technologies probabilistes. Vous obtenez donc la meilleure réponse probable parce que vous avez des agents formés qui ont beaucoup de connaissances sur la manière d'assimiler les données, de prendre une décision et de faire une recommandation"".

C'est alors que la question de la confiance se pose : ""Puis-je faire confiance à cet agent ? Ces données peuvent-elles être correctes ? Ai-je affaire aux bonnes données ?"" Cette question doit également être résolue.",zdnet

Hasard du calendrier, l’assureur Axa faisait lui aussi le même jour un bilan de ses développements au niveau groupe.

Ses initiatives dans le domaine de l’IA et de la Data s’inscrivent dans le cadre de son plan stratégique Unlock the Future initié en 2024. Axa s’est fixé pour ambition d’intégrer l’IA dans l’ensemble de ses opérations.

Des usages sur toute la chaîne de valeur de l'assurance

La conférence de presse du 4 mars poursuivait plusieurs objectifs. Il s’agissait ainsi de présenter son niveau d’avancement en termes de déploiement, mais également d’affirmer “sa position de leader en matière d'innovation dans le secteur de l'assurance.”

L’état des lieux d’abord. Axa annonce mobiliser 2.000 experts à l’échelon du groupe pour la conception de produits Data et IA. Parmi ces moyens humains, l’assureur précise disposer de plus de 900 Data Scientists et Data Engineers.

A ce jour, l’entreprise exploite en production plus de 400 cas d'usage des données et de l'IA. Ces applications sont réparties dans toutes ses entités et couvrent l'intégralité “de la chaîne de valeur de l'assurance.”

Assistant GenAI intégré dans 79 applications

Hype oblige, Axa cite notamment AXA Secure GPT, un assistant génératif privé. Le ChatGPT interne est accessible par les plus de 154.000 collaborateurs du groupe. Pour en massifier l’utilisation, l’outil est intégré dans 79 applications professionnelles.

L’assureur s’efforce de démocratiser ainsi l’usage de l’IA générative. Outre Secure GPT, Axa met à disposition de ses salariés un module d’e-learning dédié : « Generative AI for Everyone at AXA ». Le module est consultable depuis sa Data & AI learning Academy, créée en 2022.

Afin de poursuivre et industrialiser ses développements en GenAI, Axa s’est doté en 2024 d’un nouveau centre d'excellence dédié à l’IA générative. En 2025, le groupe se fixe comme objectif d’accélérer “la mise à l'échelle des cas d'usage de l'IA à plus forte valeur ajoutée dans l'ensemble du Groupe.”

Le cloud comme support à la stratégie IA

Pour y parvenir, l’acteur de l’assurance compte en particulier sur sa politique cloud. Il prévoit ainsi de finaliser en 2026 “la cloudification complète” de son infrastructure informatique.

“La cloudification soutient notre stratégie d'IA en fournissant l'infrastructure et les ressources qui permettent de déployer et de faire évoluer les applications d'IA. Secure GPT est un exemple de ce que le cloud peut faire pour l'IA”, souligne Axa.

L’IA générative n’est pas l’unique piste technologique explorée par l’assureur. Lancé en 2023, le service de gestion des incendies de forêt AXA Wildfire en est une illustration. L’outil à base d’IA et de technologie géospatiale permet d’alerter des gestionnaires de sites industriels de risques d’incendie.

SmartInAXA (RAG) déployé en 2025 en France

Fin 2024, Axa a mené en France un pilote en IA générative : SmartInAXA. Classiquement, l’outil permet aux distributeurs d’interroger des bases de connaissances. La filiale de l’assureur précise que le service a été conçu grâce à SmartGuide.

SmartGuide est la plateforme GenAI interne d’Axa France “qui permet d’accélérer le Time-To-Market” de ses cas d’usage RAG. SmartInAXA a fait l’objet d’un pilote au 4e trimestre 2024. Il est à présent en cours de déploiement progressif. Fin mars, 1000 utilisateurs y auront accès.

“Le périmètre de SmartInAXA sera également étendu à d’autres bases de connaissances pour devenir le cockpit de référence des distributeurs qui leur permettra de disposer de toute la connaissance nécessaire à portée de clic”, indique Axa.",zdnet

Les plaignants accusent la société américaine d'avoir eu massivement recours à des œuvres protégées par le droit d'auteur afin d'entraîner ses modèles d'intelligence artificielle.

Et ce sans l'autorisation des auteurs et des éditeurs.

Books3, une archive controversée

Les œuvres concernées étaient notamment comprises au sein du corpus Books3. Ce corpus a été constitué par l'américain Shawn Presser à la fin des années 2020. Il est hébergé par un collectif d'archiviste amateurs connu sous le nom de The Eye mentionne l'AFP.

Cette archive, aujourd'hui hors ligne, contenait le texte d'un peu plus de 196 000 livres. Il était diffusé librement sur internet.

Shawn Presser avait défendu son projet en expliquant que l'objectif était de mettre à disposition de tous des corpus de qualité. L'idée était d'entraîner des modèles d'intelligence artificielle, afin de permettre à des concurrents d'OpenAI de perfectionner leurs propres modèles de langage

Meta forcé de reconnaître son utilisation

L'archive n'est pas passée inaperçue. Meta s'est notamment appuyé sur celle-ci afin d'entraîner son propre modèle de langage Llama.

Et l'utilisation de cette base de données a déjà été au centre d'un important procès mené par un groupe danois de protection des œuvres sous droit d'auteur, Rights Alliance.

Dans le cadre de cette procédure, Meta a publiquement reconnu avoir eu recours à Books3 pour l'entraînement de son modèle. La société se défend en invoquant le droit américain à ""l'usage équitable"" (Fair use) des œuvres. Une position partagée par d'autres acteurs de l'IA, comme OpenAI. Mais en reconnaissant le recours à cette base de données, Meta ouvre la voie à de nouvelles procédures en matière de droit d'auteurs.

Quel corpus pour les IA?

La question des corpus d'entraînement est un sujet délicat pour les concepteurs d'IA. Quand ils ne se heurtent pas aux réglementations sur l'usage des données personnelles, c'est donc le droit d'auteur qui les gêne.

Le contenu exact des corpus utilisés pour entraîner les IA est un sujet houleux.

Lors du sommet parisien pour l'action sur l'IA en février, plusieurs organisations avaient signé une charte visant à édicter les grands principes de respect du droit d'auteur dans l'entraînement des modèles d'IA.",zdnet

La startup DeepSeek AI met en avant des gains de coûts majeurs par rapport aux autres acteurs.

Toute l’actualité de la tech pour les pros chaque jour dans notre newsletter En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

Mais Google n’est pas en reste. La société vient d’annoncer que son dernier grand modèle de langage open source, Gemma 3, s'approche de la précision du modèle R1 de DeepSeek, et ce tout en étant aussi économe en énergie.

En utilisant le classement « Elo », employé pour classer les joueurs d'échecs et les athlètes, Google affirme que Gemma 3 se rapproche à 98 % du score du R1 de DeepSeek, soit 1 338 contre 1 363 pour R1.

Le modèle le plus performant sur une seule puce, affirme Google

Cela signifie que R1 est supérieur à Gemma 3. Cependant, selon les estimations de Google, il faudrait 32 GPU H100 Nvidia pour atteindre le score de R1. Et ce alors que Gemma 3 n'utilise qu'une seule puce H100.

L'équilibre entre puissance de calcul et score Elo est donc idéal, affirme Google Le géant californien présente ce nouveau programme comme « le modèle le plus performant pouvant être exécuté sur un seul GPU ou TPU », faisant référence à sa puce d'IA personnalisée.

« Gemma 3 offre des performances de pointe pour sa taille, surpassant Llama-405B, DeepSeek-V3 et o3-mini lors des évaluations du classement LMArena », indique Google, en référence aux classements Elo. « Cela vous permet de créer des expériences utilisateur compatibles avec un seul GPU ou hôte TPU. »

Les modèles Gemma 3 sont destinés à une utilisation en local

Le modèle de Google surpasse également le classement Elo du modèle Llama 3 de Meta, qui, selon les estimations, nécessiterait 16 GPU. (Notez que le nombre de puces H100 utilisées par la concurrence est une estimation de Google. DeepSeek AI n'a divulgué qu'un exemple d'utilisation de 1 814 GPU H800 - moins puissantes que les H100 - pour traiter des réponses avec R1.)

Des informations plus détaillées sont disponibles dans un billet de blog sur HuggingFace, où le référentiel Gemma 3 est proposé.

Les modèles Gemma 3, destinés à une utilisation sur appareil plutôt que dans les centres de données, ont un nombre de paramètres, ou « poids » neuronaux, bien inférieur à celui de R1 et d'autres modèles open source. En règle générale, plus le nombre de paramètres est élevé, plus la puissance de calcul requise est importante.

Qu'est-ce que la distillation de l'IA ?

Le code Gemma propose des nombres de paramètres de 1, 4, 12 et 27 milliards, ce qui est relativement faible par rapport aux normes actuelles. En revanche, R1 dispose de 671 milliards de paramètres, dont 37 milliards peuvent être utilisés de manière sélective en ignorant ou en désactivant certaines parties du réseau.

La principale amélioration permettant une telle efficacité est une technique d'IA appelée distillation. Elle consiste à extraire les pondérations d'un modèle plus grand et à les insérer dans un modèle plus petit, tel que Gemma 3, afin d'améliorer ses performances.

Le modèle ainsi distillé est également soumis à trois mesures de contrôle qualité différentes :

L'apprentissage par renforcement à partir d'un retour humain (RLHF - Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), qui permet de rendre les résultats de GPT et d'autres grands modèles de langage inoffensifs et utiles

L'apprentissage par renforcement à partir du feedback machine (RLMF - Reinforcement Learning from Machine Feedback)

L'apprentissage par renforcement à partir du feedback d'exécution (RLEF - Reinforcement Learning from Execution Feedback)

Selon Google, le RLMF et le RLEF améliorent respectivement les capacités mathématiques et de codage du modèle.

Les différences entre Gemma 3 et Gemma 2

Un article du blog développeurs Google détaille ces approches. Un autre article décrit les techniques utilisées pour optimiser la plus petite version, le modèle à 1 milliard, pour les appareils mobiles. Ces techniques incluent quatre méthodes courantes d'ingénierie de l'IA :

La quantification

La mise à jour des dispositions de cache « clé-valeur »

L'amélioration du temps de chargement de certaines variables

Le « partage du poids GPU »

L'entreprise compare non seulement les classements Elo, mais aussi Gemma 3 à la version précédente de Gemma 2 et à ses modèles Gemini propriétaires lors de tests de performance comme LiveCodeBench. Gemma 3 est moins précis que Gemini 1.5 et Gemini 2.0. Mais Google qualifie les résultats de remarquables, affirmant que Gemma 3 « affiche des performances compétitives par rapport aux modèles Gemini propriétaires ».

Les modèles Gemini ont un nombre de paramètres bien plus important que Gemma.

Gemma 3 est multimodal

La principale avancée de Gemma 3 par rapport à Gemma 2 réside dans une « fenêtre contextuelle » plus longue, c'est-à-dire le nombre de jetons d'entrée pouvant être conservés en mémoire pour que le modèle puisse les traiter à un instant T.

Gemma 2 ne disposait que de 8 000 jetons, contre 128 000 pour Gemma 3, ce qui représente une fenêtre contextuelle « longue », plus adaptée au traitement d'articles ou de livres entiers. (Gemini et d'autres modèles propriétaires sont bien plus performants, avec une fenêtre contextuelle de 2 millions de jetons pour Gemini 2.0 Pro.)

Gemma 3 est également multimodal, contrairement à Gemma 2. Cela signifie qu'il peut gérer des images en entrée ainsi que du texte pour répondre à des questions telles que « Qu'y a-t-il sur cette photo ?»

Enfin, Gemma 3 prend en charge plus de 140 langues, et non plus seulement l'anglais comme Gemma 2.

D'autres fonctionnalités de sécurité intéressantes

Par exemple, un problème bien connu avec tous les grands modèles linguistiques est qu'ils peuvent mémoriser des portions de leurs données d'entraînement, ce qui peut entraîner des fuites d'informations si les modèles sont exploités par des techniques malveillantes.

Les chercheurs de Google ont testé les fuites d'informations en échantillonnant les données d'entraînement et en déterminant la quantité pouvant être extraite directement de Gemma 3 par rapport à ses autres modèles. « Nous constatons que les modèles Gemma 3 mémorisent les textes longs à un taux bien inférieur à celui des modèles précédents », notent-ils, ce qui signifie théoriquement que le modèle est moins vulnérable aux fuites d'informations.

Toute l’actualité de la tech pour les pros chaque jour dans notre newsletter En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

Oui, l'opérateur de télécommunication américain AT&T et la société AST SpaceMobile ont réussi à passer un appel vidéo en utilisant un simple smartphone, et ce grâce à un satellite.

Et cette avancée technologique pourrait bien changer la donne en matière de connectivité mobile.

Le smartphone a tout simplement reconnu le satellite comme un réseau mobile

Premièrement, cette prouesse technique repose sur les satellites BlueBird d’AST SpaceMobile, lancés en septembre 2024. L’appel vidéo a été passé depuis le Texas avec une application WhatsApp classique. Le smartphone a tout simplement reconnu le satellite comme un réseau mobile ordinaire. Vous avez bien entendu ! Aucun matériel spécifique n'a été utilisé, et il n'y a pas eu d’adaptation logicielle particulière pour réaliser cette petite prouesse.

Et dans le ciel, les satellites de la société fonctionnent ensemble pour orienter et modeler électroniquement les faisceaux de communication sans fil. Il s'agit en gros de la même technologie que celle utilisée dans les tours de téléphonie cellulaire, mais dans l'espace.

Mais la société reste assez discrète sur son savoir faire. ""Nous utilisons une technologie brevetée pour fournir des connexions transparentes à partir de presque n'importe quel endroit"" résume AST SpaceMobile.

Une couverture réseau bien plus étendue

Deuxièmement, cette avancée ouvre la voie à une couverture réseau bien plus étendue.

Aujourd’hui, même les meilleurs opérateurs mobiles laissent derrière eux des zones blanches. Où ça ? Et bien là où les antennes terrestres ne peuvent pas être installées, pour des raisons techniques, ou bien sûr de retour sur investissement.

Avec ce type de connexion satellite, il donc devient envisageable de couvrir ces zones, qu’il s’agisse de régions isolées ou de lieux touchés par des catastrophes naturelles. Il s'agit donc d'un véritable atout pour les communications d’urgence.

Aller vers 120 mégabits par seconde

Enfin, ce n’est qu’un début. AST SpaceMobile prévoit de lancer des satellites encore plus performants, capables d’offrir des débits allant jusqu’à 120 mégabits par seconde.

De plus, plusieurs opérateurs, dont Orange en France, s’intéressent de près à cette technologie.

L'utilisation de ce modèle impliquerait une perte de confidentialité considérable.

Mais c'est à ce prix que Gemini deviendrait le chatbot IA le plus personnel à ce jour.

Comment fonctionne la personnalisation Gemini ?

Google n'a pas officialisé cette fonctionnalité. Mais Android Authority a pu avoir accès à une version du code (version 16.8.31), et présente plusieurs captures d'écran de la fonctionnalité en action.

Pour commencer, Gemini indique que seul le modèle « Personnalisation Gemini » se connectera à votre historique de recherche. Les conversations de ce modèle ne sont pas utilisées pour améliorer Gemini, ne sont pas stockées en dehors de l’historique de discussion et sont supprimées de l’activité au bout de 60 jours.

Vous devrez pour ce faire autoriser Gemini à consulter votre historique de recherche ainsi que l'activité sur le Web et les applications dans les paramètres Google.

« Quel était le restaurant que je cherchais la semaine dernière ? »

Une fois cette opération effectuée, vous pourrez interroger Gemini sur vos recherches passées ou lui poser une question à laquelle l’IA répondra grâce aux informations recueillies sur vous grâce à ces recherches.

Vous pouvez poser des questions basiques à Gemini, comme « Quel était le restaurant que je cherchais la semaine dernière ? » ou « Montre-moi les sites touristiques que j'ai recherchés à Paris », mais vous pouvez aussi poser des questions comme : « Je vais à Paris. Peux-tu me recommander des restaurants grâce à mon historique de recherche ? » et recevez une réponse du genre : « Votre historique de recherche indique que vous aimez les restaurants italiens. Il y en a un très bien noté… »

Une autre question pourrait ressembler à ceci : « Donne-moi quelques recommandations de chaussures en fonction de toutes celles que j'ai recherchées au cours des deux derniers mois. »

12 ans d’historique de recherche

On ignore à quelle partie d’un historique de recherche Gemini aura accès. Lors de l’analyse de l'APK par Android Authority, Gemini a pu consulter les derniers mois d'historique, remontant jusqu'à janvier.

Cette limite de plusieurs mois pourrait être la version finale de la fonctionnalité, ou simplement la limite de la version de test.

Mais si Gemini peut accéder à une plus large plage de l’historique, cela changerait encore plus la donne. J'ai pu facilement retrouver plus de 12 ans d'historique de recherche sur ma page d'activité Google. Il n'y a donc aucune raison pour que Gemini ne puisse faire de même.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Intel ernennt Lip-Bu Tan zum neuen CEO,https://www.zdnet.de/88421015/intel-ernennt-lip-bu-tan-zum-neuen-ceo/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 13:51:50 GMT","Der Manager war bis August 2024 Mitglied des Board of Directors von Intel. Der derzeitige Vorsitzende des Gremiums lobt die Erfolgsbilanz des neuen Intel-Chefs bei der Schaffung von Shareholder-Value.

Intel hat einen neuen Chief Executive Officer

(CEO). Als Nachfolger von Pat Gelsinger ernannte das Board of Directors Lip-Bu Tan. Er löst am 18. März die derzeitigen Interims-CEOs David Zinsner und Michelle Johnston Holthaus ab. Zudem wird Tan erneut Mitglied des Board of Directors von Intel – das Gremium hatte er im August 2024 verlassen.

Der neue Intel-Chef blickt nach Angaben des Unternehmens auf mehr als 20 Jahre Erfahrung in der Halbleiterbranche zurück. Von 2009 bis 2021 war Tan CEO des Chipherstellers Cadence Design Systems. Von 2021 bis 2023 war er zudem Executive Chairman der Board of Directors von Cadence. Darüber ist der Manager Mitgründer der Investmentgesellschaft Walden Catalyst Ventrus. 2022 wurde ihm zudem der Robert N. Noyce Award verliehen, die höchste Ehrung des Branchenverbands Semiconductor Industry Association.

„Lip-Bu ist eine außergewöhnliche Führungspersönlichkeit, die mit ihrem Fachwissen in der Technologiebranche, ihren engen Beziehungen zum Produkt- und Foundry-Ökosystem und ihrer nachgewiesenen Erfolgsbilanz bei der Schaffung von Shareholder-Value genau das ist, was Intel für seinen nächsten CEO braucht“, sagte Frank Yeary, Interims Executive Chairman des Board of Directors von Intel. „Während seiner langen und bemerkenswerten Karriere hat er sich den Ruf eines Innovators erworben, der die Kunden in den Mittelpunkt seines Handelns stellt, differenzierte Lösungen liefert, um auf dem Markt zu gewinnen, und leistungsstarke Kulturen aufbaut, um Erfolg zu haben.“

„Intel verfügt über eine leistungsstarke und differenzierte Computerplattform, einen großen Kundenstamm und eine robuste Produktionsbasis, die mit jedem Tag, an dem wir unsere Prozesstechnologie-Roadmap umgestalten, stärker wird“, wird der neue Intel-CEO in einer Pressemitteilung zitiert. „Ich freue mich darauf, dem Unternehmen beizutreten und auf der Arbeit aufzubauen, die das gesamte Intel-Team geleistet hat, um unser Unternehmen für die Zukunft zu positionieren.“

Gelsinger, der 2021 den Chefsessel bei Intel von Bob Swan übernommen hatte, räumte am 1. Dezember 2024 seinen Posten. Hintergrund der Trennung waren Gelsingers Restrukturierungspläne für den angeschlagenen Chiphersteller, die unter anderem den Ausbau der eigenen Produktionskapazitäten und den Einstieg in die Chip-Auftragsfertigung vorsahen – und zeitnah nicht den gewünschten Erfolg brachten. Unter anderem musste Intel im vergangenen Jahr die Pläne für den Bau einer europäischen Chipfabrik in Magdeburg zumindest vorübergehend auf Eis legen.",zdnet

Damit ist die Entwicklung der APIs von Android 16 bereits abgeschlossen.

Google hat die dritte Beta von Android 16 zum Download freigegeben. Mit der Vorabversion erreicht Android 16 den Status „Plattform-Stabilität“. Damit ist die Entwicklung der neuen Programmierschnittstellen offiziell abgeschlossen.

Die Beta 3 enthält aber auch noch neue Funktionen. Unter anderem unterstützen nun Pixel-9-Geräte Auracast Audio-Übertragungen mit kompatiblen Hörhilfen per Bluetooth LE. Über Auracast können Hörgeräte und Kopfhörer Audio-Streams an öffentlichen Orten wie Flughäfen, Klassenzimmern oder auch auf Konzerten empfangen.

Zudem enthält Android 16 Beta 3 eine neue Sicherheitsfunktion namens Local Network Protection. Damit lässt sich laut Google kontrollieren, welche Apps über das lokale Netzwerk auf Geräte zugreifen. Derzeit können alle Apps, die über die Berechtigung „Internet“ verfügen, mit allen Geräten im lokalen Netzwerk des Nutzers kommunizieren. Allerdings ist die Einführung dieser Funktion für eine künftige Android-Version geplant.

Darüber hinaus kündigte Google ein weiteres Android API Release für das Jahr 2025 an. Android 16 soll demnach im zweiten Quartal 2025 starten. Im vierten Quartal werde ein kleineres API Release folgen, das sich nicht auf das Verhalten von Apps auswirken soll. „Das Q4 Minor Release enthält Funktionsaktualisierungen, Optimierungen und Fehlerbehebungen; wie unsere vierteljährlichen Nicht-SDK-Releases wird es keine absichtlichen Änderungen am Verhalten der Anwendung enthalten“, teilte Google mit.

Die Betaversionen von Android 16 sind derzeit lediglich für Pixel-Geräte verfügbar. Wann Googles Android-Partner mit ihren Beta-Tests starten, ist nicht bekannt. Samsung ist derzeit dabei, sein Beta-Programm für Android 15 auf die aktuellen Modelle der Galaxy-Z-Serie sowie das Galaxy S23 auszuweiten.",zdnet

https://zdnet.com,セールスフォースはAIエージェントでサービス企業に進化する--最高製品責任者に聞く,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230247/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT","Salesforceが米国時間3月5～6日にサンフランシスコで開催した開発者向けイベント「Trailblazer DX 2025」（TDX）は、AIエージェント一色となった。「AIは次の主戦場であるだけでなくSalesforce自身も変えるものになる」と同社 プレジデント 兼 最高製品責任者（CPO）のDavid Schmaier氏が記者とのラウンドテーブルで話した。

AIエージェントをプッシュ、だが現実は？

同社は、2024年9月の年次イベント「Dreamforce」でAIエージェントプラットフォームの「Agentforce」を発表して以来、AIエージェントを強力にプッシュしている。今回のTDXで最新版の「Agentforce 2dx」やマーケットプレイス「AgentExchange」などを発表したが、実際に開発者の関心は高まっているのだろうか。



Salesforce プレジデント 兼 最高製品責任者（CPO）のDavid Schmaier氏 Salesforce プレジデント 兼 最高製品責任者（CPO）のDavid Schmaier氏

Schmaier氏は、「ダボス会議（世界経済フォーラム会議）で、Marc（共同創業者兼最高経営責任者のMarc Benioff氏）が集まった経営者に『あなた方は人間だけの労働力をマネジメントする最後のCEO（最高経営責任者）になる』と話した。実際ダボスにいたCEOは、誰もがどうやって自社の事業にAIを適用するかを考えていた」と述べる。その一方で、「Salesforceを運用している管理者や開発者にまでは、（AIを適用するという）その姿勢が浸透していないとしてもおかしくない」と認める。AIはまだまだ最先端の技術であり、時間がかかると見る。

だが、「25年前に車を呼べるモバイルアプリが登場し、『タクシーを使わずに移動できるようになる』と言っても、誰も信じなかった。現在のサンフランシスコには、無人タクシー（Googleの自動運転タクシーのWaymo）も走っている。現在ではUberがない日常が不便と感じるようになった。同じことが運輸や移動以外のあらゆる業界で起こる」とSchmaier氏。

実際にAgentforceやデータプラットフォームの「Data Cloud」は、同社の歴史上最も急速に成長している製品だという。Schmaier氏は、「Disney、Accentuate、Indeedなど多数の企業がAgentforceを利用している」と話し、直近の四半期で5200件のAgentforceの契約を獲得したという。だが、同社の顧客は20万社近くあり、Schmaier氏は「半分に浸透するまであと数年が必要だろう」と見る。

大きな変化を感じるようになるのはいつか？ Schmaier氏の予想は5年。「AIエージェント革命の波に乗ることができた企業が勝者になる」（同氏）

AIの「三種の神器」

AI、そしてAIエージェントは、さまざまなアプローチでベンダーが進出を図る市場だ。Salesforceは、早期にAgentforceを発表したが、先駆けた以外の強みはどこにあるのか。

Schmaier氏は、TDXの基調講演でも“三位一体”として紹介されたデータ（Data Cloud）、アプリケーション（Sales Cloudなど各種クラウド）、エージェント（Agentforce）――のこれらが統合されていることは重要な競争優位性と見る。「データ、アプリケーション、エージェント。3つを持つのはわれわれだけだ。他社は1つ、または2つしか持っておらず、ベンダーからの部品をつなぎ合わせたに過ぎない」

同氏がもう一つ強調したのは、メタデータとセマンティックだ。「データに関するデータであるメタデータと、セマンティックレイヤーにより、情報に文脈が加わる。SalesforceのData Cloudは、メタデータとセマンティックを備えており、これが、われわれのAgentforceが大規模言語モデル（LLM）を上回っている理由だ。LLMにはハルシネーション（虚偽）、バイアス（偏向）、トクシシティー（攻撃性）がある。LLMだけでは、ビジネスには不十分だ」（同氏）

そして同氏は、LLMをプロセッサーにたとえ、「プロセッサーだけではコンピューターとして使えない。ストレージ、RAM、OS、ディスプレーなどが必要で、われわれはそれを提供する。Salesforceは、25年かけて1つのプラットフォームを構築してきたからこそ可能なのだ」と述べた。

Salesforceは、このような統合型のアプローチを「DIY AI」と呼ぶ。自分たちで組み合わせるアプローチよりも優位と考えている。「外部の調査からDIY AIのアプローチを取った企業は、Agentforceと比べて期待していた成果が得られないことが分かった。実際のところ、コスト、精度、容易さなどさまざまな点で（DIY AIより）統合アプローチが優れているのだ」（同氏）

また同氏は、「Docker、Kubernetes、LLMなど技術は常に新しくなり、パッチも発行される。Salesforceには2万人がソフトウェアのプロとして、すぐに対応できる」とも述べた。",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,「Google Messages」のメディア受信で不具合--グーグルはユーザーの協力を呼びかけ,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230427/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 09:44:00 GMT","「Google Messages」で先ごろから発生している問題について、Googleは修正に取り組む中でユーザーに協力を求めている。

同社は米国時間3月12日に投稿したブログ記事で、多くのユーザーがGoogle Messagesでメディアファイルを受信する際に問題が生じていることを認めた。同社によると、アプリの動作が著しく遅くなったり、完全に停止したりする場合があるという。

広範囲にわたり問題が発生

Googleは、具体的にどのような問題が発生しているのかを明らかにしていない。しかし、Redditでの報告によれば、問題は広範囲に及んでいるようだ。一部のユーザーは、添付ファイルを表示する際にメッセージの読み込みが遅く、数分間表示されないという。また、画像がぼやけて表示されるという意見や、メッセージが全く読み込まれないという問題を抱えているユーザーもいる。

問題は、「iPhone」や「Android」でメディアを受信する際に発生しており、OSの問題ではなく、さまざまなデバイスとキャリアに影響が及んでいる。

現状の回避策はない

状況を改善するためにできることは、今のところないようだ。ユーザーからは、携帯電話を再起動しても効果がないという報告や、Wi-Fiまたはモバイルデータ通信のどちらを介して接続しても問題が解決しないという声が寄せられている。

Googleはこの問題に積極的に対処しており、最近もパフォーマンス向上を目的としたアップデートを幾つか公開したと述べている。これにより、一部のユーザーは状況が改善され、画像が問題なく読み込まれるようになったというが、問題はまだ解決していない。

Googleはフィードバックを求めている

Googleは、問題が解決していないユーザーからの報告を求めている。

同社の投稿には、次のように書かれている。「引き続き、皆さんの体験を共有してください。皆さんのフィードバックは、Messagesをより良くするために絶対に必要です。まだ問題が発生している場合は、詳細をお知らせください」

Google Messagesで問題が発生している場合は、携帯端末の種類、Androidのバージョン、メディアの種類、具体的な症状など、できるだけ詳細に報告することが望ましい。",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,「ジョブ型」と「AIエージェント」はセットで考えるべきではないか,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230400/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","異なる分野のモノやコトを掛け合わせることで、これまで達成できなかった効果や見えなかった問題が浮き彫りになってくる――。そんな発想から、本稿では人事分野の話である「ジョブ型」の働き方とIT分野の話である「AIエージェント」の活用を掛け合わせると、どんなことが起きるのか、考察してみたい。

ジョブ型とAIエージェントを改めて解説

ジョブ型は、人材を適材適所でなく「適所適材」で生かそうという人事制度で、企業がデジタルトランスフォーメーション（DX）を推進する上で効果的な施策とも言われている。

ジョブ型人事制度とは、ジョブ（職務）内容を明確にした雇用形態と、それに基づく採用、人材配置、評価の仕組みのことを指す。雇用形態として注目されがちだが、この制度の導入は、「今いる人材で何ができるか」という従来のメンバーシップ型の発想から、「事業戦略を遂行するためにどんな人材が必要か」という考え方への、人的資本と組織の在り方に対する戦略的アプローチの転換を意味する。

また、メンバーシップ型は人が会社に就く「就社型」、ジョブ型は職務に人を就ける「就職型」とも言われる。ただし、前者は新卒採用で能力やスキルがなくても教育を施して終身雇用を前提とするが、後者は職務遂行に対する能力やスキルで評価され、それらが足りないと判断されれば解雇もあり得る。さらに、前者は労働時間で管理されるが、後者は時間に関係なく成果で評価されることも重要なポイントである。

一方、AIエージェントは、2024年後半から注目されるようになり、2025年に入って一気にブレイクしたような話題沸騰ぶりだ。生成AIの出現も衝撃的だったが、そこから進展したAIエージェントは、企業にとって非常に大きなインパクトをもたらすものになりそうだ。

AIエージェントは、業務のタスク処理を効率化できる生成AIから進展して業務のプロセスを効率化、さらには自動化できるので、コスト削減や生産性向上といった業務改善効果が期待される。さらにさまざまな業務のAIエージェント同士が連携して自律的に作業を実施するようになると、もっと広い範囲の業務プロセスの効率化が可能となり、人間を強力にサポートしてくれる存在となり得る。

ただ、AIエージェントはそれを操る人がうまく使えないと業務に支障をきたす事態に陥ってしまう可能性もある。そのため、AIエージェントをうまく使えない人は、すなわち「仕事ができない人」と評価されて人員整理の対象になってしまいかねない。

以上、ジョブ型とAIエージェントについて解説してきたが、果たしてこの両者の相性は良いのか良くないのか。良いとしたら、どのような効果を期待できるのか。良くないとしたら、どんな問題が浮き彫りになってくるのか。以下、筆者なりに考察してみたい。",zdnet
