The Microsoft-backed AI startup will also expand its London office, building up its research and engineering teams at OpenAI's first international location opened two years ago, according to a statement. As part of the agreement, OpenAI will share technical information with the UK AI Security Institute to deepen the government's knowledge of AI capabilities and security risks. "The partnership will explore where it can deploy AI in areas such as justice, defense and security, and education technology in line with UK standards and guidelines to demonstrate the opportunity to make taxpayer funded services more efficient and effective," the statement said.

US Stocks:

The S&P 500 Index is looking at a double-digit increase in the second half of the year, powered by the resilient strength of America's technology behemoths, according to Wells Fargo Securities LLC's Christopher Harvey.

The bank's chief US equity strategist is Wall Street's biggest bull, with a year-end price target on the S&P 500 of 7,007, set in December. He's sticking to his call, implying an 11% gain from Friday's closing price of 6,296.79. His view is that Big Tech companies, which have been instrumental in the equity gauge's 27% surge since its April low, will keep the stock market soaring regardless of President Donald Trump's ever-changing trade policies.</p>

OpenAI:

Fidji Simo, the chief executive officer of Instacart who is departing for OpenAI, during a Bloomberg Studio 1.0 interview in San Francisco on Thursday, March 3, 2022.

Fidji Simo, the outgoing Instacart chief executive officer headed to OpenAI, outlined her vision for the newly created role of CEO of applications ahead of her official start at the ChatGPT maker next month.

Simo will begin her new role on Aug. 18, an OpenAI spokesperson said. In a blog post published on the company's website on Monday, she set the tone for how she envisions the company's artificial intelligence technologies can be used by more people, rather than concentrated in the hands of the wealthy and connected. While she did not specify a product roadmap, she reflected on how AI can be useful in six broad areas, including knowledge, health, creative expression, economic freedom, time and support.</p>

Citigroup Inc. is asking its new class of investment-banking analysts to disclose whether they've already accepted a job offer from another firm, in the latest step by banks to clamp down on aggressive recruitment by private equity firms.

First-year analysts will be required to complete an “attestation” intended to “foster a fair and transparent environment,” according to a memo sent to analysts' managers on Monday and seen by Bloomberg News. The attestation is expected to be a one-time form, but the bank might also ask analysts to repeat it annually, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>

Trump's Second Term:

Marty Makary, commissioner of the FDA, is naming George Tidmarsh director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

The FDA's White Oak campus in Silver Spring, Maryland.

Food and Drug Administration commissioner Marty Makary has chosen former biotech executive George Tidmarsh as the agency's top drug regulator, the agency confirmed Monday.

Tidmarsh, an adjunct professor of pediatrics and neonatology at Stanford University, will serve as director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, one of the FDA's largest and most important divisions with a staff of about 5,700 that reviews the vast majority of new drug applications. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, the acting head of the CDER, recently announced she was leaving the agency.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft has warned of "active attacks" targeting its SharePoint collaboration software, with security researchers noting that organizations worldwide stand to be affected by the breach. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Sunday in a release that the vulnerability provides unauthenticated access to systems and full access to SharePoint content, enabling bad actors to execute code over the network. Microsoft late Sunday issued fixes for customers to apply to two versions of the SharePoint software. Another 2016 version remains vulnerable and the company said it is working to develop a patch. Researchers at Palo Alto Networks said the hack likely reached thousands of organizations globally. "The exploits are real, in-the-wild and pose a serious threat," they added. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on the incident beyond what was shared in a company blog post. In an alert Saturday, Microsoft said the attack applies only to on-premises SharePoint servers, not those in the cloud like Microsoft 365. SharePoint software is commonly used by global businesses and organizations to store and collaborate on documents. The vulnerability is especially concerning because it allows hackers to impersonate users or services even after the SharePoint server is patched, according to researchers at European cybersecurity firm Eye Security, which said it first identified the flaw. SharePoint servers often connect to other Microsoft services such as Outlook and Teams, meaning such a breach can "quickly" lead to data theft and password harvesting, Eye Security researchers said. "Once inside, they're exfiltrating sensitive data, deploying persistent backdoors, and stealing cryptographic keys," Michael Sikorski, CTO and head of threat intelligence for Palo Alto's Unit 42, said in a statement. "The attackers have leveraged this vulnerability to get into systems and are already establishing their foothold." Separately, Alaska Airlines briefly halted its ground operations for about three hours on Sunday due to an IT outage. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

In May, the company announced a $2 billion debt offering plan that sent shares soaring 19%. Last week, Coreweave shares rallied after the company announced a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania. CoreWeave, whose biggest clients include Nvidia and Microsoft, has more than tripled in share price since its March debut on the Nasdaq. Some investors have raised concerns about the company's debt and the sustainability of demand for its products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest crypto treasury company is set to hit the public market with an ambitious plan to build the largest public vehicle for institutional exposure to ether. The Ether Machine will begin trading on the Nasdaq through a merger with blank check company Dynamix Corporation. Andrew Keys, the co-founder and chairman of the new company, has committed about $645 million in an anchor investment. Keys' company plans to differentiate with a focus on yield generation through "staking" rather than simply buying and holding the ether. Staking is a mechanism for generating yield by contributing to network operations around security and transaction processing. By purchasing ether from a crypto exchange or buying shares of an ether ETF, investors would get exposure to the coin's price, "but without access to the dividend," Keys explained. "Ether produces yield if it's properly managed," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box" Monday. "The ETFs right now don't generate yield because they don't enable staking … we're able to enable staking and we're able to do other additional risk management on top of that." On Thursday, BlackRock filed with the SEC to include staking to its popular ETHA ether ETF, which just logged a record week of inflows. The Bitcoin network "has one asset on it, bitcoin, that can be moved from peer to peer, but Ethereum can tokenize any asset," Keys said. You can have employment contracts that get paid by the minute, as an example." Shares of Dynamix jumped 30% in premarket trading. The Ether Machine follows Bitmine Immersion Technologies – the company newly chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee and more recently backed by Peter Thiel – in its ether treasury ambitions. Pantera was also a backer of Bitmine. Also this year, SharpLink Gaming, whose board is chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, also initiated an ETH treasury strategy; and Bit Digital recently exited bitcoin mining to focus on its ETH treasury and staking plans. Ether has taken the spotlight in crypto from bitcoin in recent months as investors anticipated the stablecoin bill known as the GENIUS Act would be signed into the first major U.S. crypto law, which President Trump did Friday. The regulatory clarity should benefit institutions and brands becoming more interested in tokenization, which includes stablecoins, most of which are issued on the Ethereum network. Ether has doubled in the last three months and last week, ether ETFs posted a record $2.18 billion in weekly inflows. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

The toxic water that gushes out of oil wells in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico has spurred environmental concerns and even earthquakes. Now the problem has become so acute that it's turning producers against one another. 

In an ongoing case in Texas' Loving County (population: 48), a New Mexico oil driller says Devon Energy Corp. and another company wrecked its reserves by flooding them with wastewater.</p>

Bitcoin treasury companies and asset managers are absorbing flows that once passed through individual wallets. 

A relentless wave of optimism is sweeping the nearly $4 trillion crypto market, driven by a frenzy of Washington policy moves accelerating its assimilation into regulated finance. The passage of a landmark stablecoin law and broader legislative momentum have injected new legitimacy into the sector, lifting prices and rekindling risk appetite across digital assets.

Signs of retail re-engagement are resurfacing. Coinbase's app surged to fifth place in Apple's Finance category, up from 25th a month earlier, according to data tracker Sensor Tower. Google searches for “Bitcoin” are climbing. Telegram groups and Discord forums saw spirited activity during Washington's “Crypto Week,” a highly choreographed policy blitz that culminated in President Donald Trump signing the first major US stablecoin framework into law.</p>

US-China Trade War:

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the next round of US-China talks could include a discussion of China's purchases of Russian and Iranian oil, a signal that the focus could shift from more traditional trade issues to ones that cross over into matters of national security.

“Trade is in a good place,” Bessent said on CNBC, referring to recent and ongoing negotiations with China. “And I think now we can start talking about other things. The Chinese, unfortunately, are very large purchasers of sanctioned Iranian oil, sanctioned Russian oil — so we could start discussing that.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What started as a startup Cinderella story has quickly turned into a cautionary tale for future deals in Silicon Valley. The end result — a company split in two with its CEO and top talent getting bought out for far more than the rest of its employees. "This breaks the Silicon Valley social contract," said Amjad Masad, CEO of Replit, a competitor to Windsurf. What's the point of joining a startup and working your ass off if you might get screwed?" It was only a few weeks ago that the kind of life-changing event early startup employees dream about happened at Windsurf: OpenAI announced it was buying the AI-powered coding startup for $3 billion. When he read the news, Dave Pack, a Los Angeles startup founder, opened a group chat and congratulated his friend who works at Windsurf, whom he declined to name. He joked that with his friend's sudden change in net worth, he could afford to foot the bill for their next guys' trip. "I was really excited for him," Pack said. Discussions with OpenAI fizzled, and there was a new suitor: Google. But instead of acquiring Windsurf, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent and license the company's intellectual property. "It was some of the most insane 72 hours I've seen in startup land," said Maor Fridman, a general partner at F2. "It was my job to explain to the company our path forward," Wang, who was formerly the company's head of business, wrote in a post on X. Terms were not disclosed, though the Cognition deal appears to be far lower than what OpenAI originally offered. Three sources estimated Cognition, which itself is only worth $4 billion, paid about $300 million in stock. Spokespeople for Windsurf and Google declined to comment. Varun Mohan, the cofounder of Windsurf who is now part of Google; Scott Wu, cofounder and CEO of Cognition; and Jeff Wang, Windsurf's new CEO, all did not respond to requests for comment. Cognition said "100% of Windsurf employees will participate financially" in the deal and "they will also have all vesting cliffs waived and will receive fully accelerated vesting for their work to date." "It's a pretty sad place to be," said Deedy Das, an investor at Menlo Ventures. "When you join a company, you expect decisions to be made together, so this does have a chilling effect on founding team members." "Windsurf and others are really bad examples of founders leaving their teams behind and not even sharing the proceeds with their team," wrote storied investor Vinod Khosla on X. "I definitely would not work with their founders next time." Traditionally, early employees are willing to accept less cash and more equity while working 100-hour weeks in the hope that they will share in the upside should their company be acquired someday. "If an exit can happen and you don't participate in it, that's pretty bad for startup employees," said Masad. "If you were part of Windsurf and got left behind, we'd like to talk," he wrote. "We've passed on many acquisitions over the years, and any liquidity has always included employees." Some Windsurf investors have also been critical of the deal. "The problem is that the company technically didn't actually fully realize that decacorn potential, which was the reason we invested in them," said Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures, referring to a startup worth more than $10 billion. "We would've preferred to just take a clean exit from OpenAI. "Their mojo gets thrown in the blender," Ramadurai said. What happened at Windsurf follows other unusually structured deals for Character AI, Inflection, and Scale AI, where Big Tech companies avoided outright acquiring a company in order to gain access to its founders and top AI researchers. In the case of Scale AI, Meta paid $14 billion for a 49 percent stake in the data labeling company and hired its founder, Alexandr Wang, to run its Superintelligence group. Meta also hired some of the startup's researchers. Last week, Scale AI laid off 14% of its workforce, or 200 employees, and revealed it is unprofitable. Every transaction is different, and in the case of Windsurf, the company was not seen as having conventionally elite AI talent. "Through that lens, Google's license fee resembles an upfront payment for permanent access to this capability, similar to Microsoft's deal with OpenAI." What all these deals have in common is that they can close quickly and avoid regulatory scrutiny — two benefits that mean this type of transaction is only going to become more common, according to Steve Brotman, managing partner at Alpha Partners. For startup employees, that makes it more important than ever to make sure they are joining the right company, according to Jake Saper, a general partner at Emergence Capital. "Startups with unique data feeds, embedded distribution or clear recurring revenue have leverage to stay independent," Saper said. "If a company's main asset is a brilliant but portable research team, you should assume Big Tech will come knocking."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mary Monohan, 37, saw the signs when the powers that be started reorganizing teams and switching up her assignments: Layoffs were coming. Less than a month later, she's starting to realize that she may have to be willing to make a lateral professional move or even "a few thousand dollars less than I was making before," she told Business Insider. Caught somewhere between entry-level roles and the C-suite, they're especially vulnerable to the Great Flattening, a trend of eliminating middle managers brought on by companies' desires to cut costs and bureaucracy. Those who are let go may have to accept lower pay or titles in their next role, while those who remain are left to take on extra responsibilities and reports. Daniel Radmanovic, 40, was laid off from his managerial position at Deloitte in October. He started actively job searching in January and said it was a "soul-sucking learning experience." He described it as a "pivot" because he'll be in a client-facing individual contributor role and not managing people, but it isn't a step back since he's excited to embrace the change. Many older millennials have found themselves caught in the Great Flattening. Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform, found that 35- to 44-year-olds are being hardest hit by manager firings or layoffs at 8,500 of its small and midsize business clients. Layoffs among that age group of managers rose more than 400% between January 2022 and September 2024, compared to a decline of 48% for 55- to 64-year-olds. Managers who survive the layoffs face another problem: a growing pool of direct reports. Gusto data showed that individual contributors per people manager nearly doubled from 3.2 in January 2019 to 5.8 in September 2024, based on the sample of small and midsize businesses analyzed. "I've worked hard as a manager to try and get people that worked under me recognized, and sometimes it could take six months or longer to get them the bonus or the recognition that they deserve." She added that she's not sure what will happen with some of her outstanding duties, like her former report's performance review. The job market isn't all doom and gloom for millennials. The US rate of layoffs and discharges is still low. Monohan is confident her past experience will lead to a job, but is worried about how soon she can get one and the lack of opportunities available. "As a single person without a second income or healthcare plan to fall back on, I have to know my worth but also face the realities of how long I can be out of work without having to move in with family or make dramatic life changes," Monohan said. She's open to individual contributor roles, but would ideally get another manager job. In the meantime, she's been networking and might take on some contract work. Others in her position have told BI they are settling for work they feel overqualified for to pay the bills. Radmanovic recommends not going through the job search process alone, if possible. They gave each other advice, helped with interview preparation, and commiserated during the process.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Kremlin is building its way toward a reality where it can soon launch 2,000 Shahed one-way attack drones in one night, according to two recent Western assessments. Maj. Gen. Christian Freuding, the German defense ministry's commander of planning and command staff, said in a Bundeswehr interview aired on Saturday that Russia was "striving to further increase production capacity" of its Shaheds. "They want to expand the drone attacks we just talked about," Freuding said. In a separate assessment on Sunday, the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, wrote that Russia's per-night use of Shahed drones increased by 31% each month in June and July. "ISW assesses that Russia may be able to launch up to 2,000 drones in one night by November 2025, should this current growth trend in drone usage continue," its analysts wrote. However, they added that Russia likely wouldn't be able to consistently sustain 2,000 drone launches per day. Shaheds are long-range Iranian exploding drones with estimated ranges of 600 to 1,200 miles, depending on the design. This year, Russia has continually increased the number of Shaheds and decoy drones it launches a night at Ukraine, recently peaking at 728 uncrewed aerial vehicles in one salvo earlier this month. As these numbers surge, Ukraine and its allies fear that Russia's nightly attacks will overwhelm Kyiv's air defenses. Western governments and analysts say some vital parts for production come from China. "Despite a steady flow of Shahed-136s from Iran, Moscow is heavily investing in its own production facilities," the IISS analysts wrote. Ukraine has periodically tried to strike Yelabuga with its own long-range fixed-wing drones, but it's unclear if the factories have sustained any significant damage. Kyiv's military intelligence also said in February that it had found production markings on some attack drones that mention the city of Izhevsk, possibly pointing to another production line there. Freuding, the German general, said that against such quantity, it would be nonsensical to rely on expensive Western interceptors such as the Patriot system to destroy Shaheds. "We essentially need countermeasures that cost two, three, four thousand euros," he said. By comparison, a single Patriot system costs the US government $1.1 billion, and one of its missiles can cost about $4 million. Ukraine now uses a multilayered air defense network against Shahed waves, including surface-to-air missiles, air-launched missiles, and mobile fire groups that try to shoot down the Iranian drones with machine guns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"It's not a hard choice," Mann said on an episode of "Lenny's Podcast" published Sunday. Other AI startups have seen key talent poached by mega paydays. "I think we've been maybe much less affected than many of the other companies in the space because people here are so mission-oriented," he said. "They get these offers and then they say, 'Well, of course I'm not going to leave because my best case scenario at Meta is that we make money, and my best case at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity." Mann also said he doesn't blame anyone who takes those "mega offers." His comments come as tech giants like Meta and OpenAI engage in a fierce talent war, offering massive payouts to top AI researchers. "To pay individuals like $100 million over a four-year package, that's actually pretty cheap compared to the value created for the business," he said. "We're just in an unprecedented era of scale, and it's only going to get crazier." Mann also said that he and several other leaders left OpenAI in 2020 to start Anthropic because "safety wasn't the top priority there." A former researcher told Fortune last year that nearly half of OpenAI's safety team had exited. "Our responsibility to prepare for emerging security threats to users, customers, and global communities shapes everything we do," the company said on its website. The tech giant added that its API and ChatGPT products undergo routine third-party testing to "identify security weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors." Mann, Anthropic, and OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Big Tech has always paid top dollar for elite talent, but the latest AI hiring frenzy has taken things to a whole new level, as BI previously reported. It started when Meta recruited Scale's CEO, Alexandr Wang, last month as part of a $14.3 billion deal to take a 49% stake in his company. Then, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said Meta had tried to poach his best employees with $100 million signing bonuses. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced last month that Wang would co-lead a new superintelligence unit with six top researchers from OpenAI. Perplexity's CEO, Aravind Srinivas, said on a podcast published Thursday that Big Tech companies need to ensure that employees are motivated by mission as well as money. Srinivas also said that he was "surprised by the magnitude" of the salaries Zuckerberg is reportedly offering to top AI researchers, adding that it "seems like it's needed at this point for them." With the massive salaries, "failure is not an option" for Meta's new team, Srinivas said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stock markets are shrugging off major risks and smashing records — so much so that even seasoned investors are scratching their heads. Both indexes are hovering near the all-time highs they reached earlier this month, continuing a rebound after the post-"Liberation Day" sell-off. That rebound has stunned analysts, given the pile-up of macro risks, particularly President Donald Trump's ongoing threats to impose steep tariffs on key trading partners. Yet investors keep piling in — even if many are doing so with one eye on the exit. "In many ways, this is a rally that really no one's had much conviction in it," Andrew Pease, the Asia Pacific head of investments for Russell Investments, told Business Insider. He said the firm's analysis shows investors are neutral, not euphoric. "Everyone's very wary about this particular rally," Pease said. Wall Street veterans have spent months warning that investors may be underestimating the risks. Those concerns may soon be put to the test. It's not just tariffs that suggest trouble could be brewing. China's economic slowdown, Middle East tensions, and softening US data all suggest trouble could be brewing. Despite inflationary concerns tied to Trump's tariff threats, the US economy remains on solid footing. As BI's Jennifer Sor recently reported, recession fears are fading. Big banks kicked off earnings season on a strong note last week. But retail sales rose 0.6% in June from May and the job market remains robust. The US added 147,000 jobs in June, well above expectations, while unemployment dipped to 4.1% from 4.2%. Some investors are leaning on the "TACO trade" — short for "Trump Always Chickens Out." "Finally, the market is not wrong in pricing in a good chance that Trump will not follow through with his latest tariff threats, instead settling for some deal by 1 August," wrote Davide Oneglia, the director of European and global macro at Global Data.TS Lombard, on July 16, referring to the trade deadline. Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, agreed: "The prevailing view among investors seems to be that these tariff threats are more bark than bite — a negotiating tactic rather than a firm policy stance." That's created what analysts call "asymmetry:" Markets could keep rising if talks go well, but they are vulnerable to sharp corrections if discussions break down. Even as risks loom, traders don't want to miss out. Retail traders have been jumping back in, chasing gains as indexes push higher, even if they missed the earlier run-up. "MOMO and FOMO" are likely to dominate until proven otherwise," wrote Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, in a June 30 note. "Newton's First Law applies: A body (market) that is in motion will stay in motion until acted upon by an external source," he added. Sosnick said that implied volatility remains low, even as risks mount, suggesting investors are choosing to look past potential trouble. Pease at Russell Investments agreed that momentum could unravel quickly — but only if there's a clear macro shock. The Federal Reserve has signaled it could cut rates another two times this year — a boon for stocks. Lower rates reduce bond yields, making equities more attractive. Dimon warned that the Fed might still hike if inflation proves sticky. He sees a 40% to 50% chance of another increase this cycle. AI hype continues to drive the market, especially Big Tech. "AI is still the dominant theme, particularly as the Big Tech companies are giving solid earnings guidance and other companies are joining in as well, then that's the world in which you could see that this rally has further to go," Pease said, while cautioning that gains could become overdone. Summer trading is thinner, meaning volatility can spike quickly. Last year's yen carry trade unwind is a fresh reminder that things can turn fast. "Negotiations have not broken down and the market is acting rationally — at least on this," Oneglia wrote. Until August, market asymmetry remains, so there's "room to rise on good news, but the potential for a swift and severe correction if trade tensions escalate," Hathorn added.</p>
