                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unionization will lead to better and safer patient outcomes, says one medical resident. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Amid rising labor militancy over the past few years, one group of workers has gone under the radar: medical residents. Also known as resident physicians or housestaff, medical residents are doctors who have finished medical school and are working in hospitals as apprentices on the path to getting independently licensed. They are the patient-facing backbone of hospital operations, working extremely long hours under stressful conditions for mediocre pay. Over the past few years, from California to New England, medical residents have been unionizing and striking by the thousands. They labor in the strategic sector of health care, which intersects with multiple struggles around social justice and corporate power. To discuss these questions and more, Truthout spoke with two union medical residents who represent a cross-section of this growing part of the labor movement. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Dr. Mahima Iyengar is a chief resident of internal medicine and pediatrics at Los Angeles General Medical Center. Dr. Armin Tadayyon was an anesthesiology resident at the University at Buffalo's affiliated hospitals who helped lead a successful 2023 union drive and 2024 strike of UB residents, which resulted in their first contract. Buffalo residents are affiliated with the Union of American Physicians and Dentists. The two interviews were conducted separately and have been edited into a roundtable format. The following transcript has also been lightly edited for length and clarity. Derek Seidman: Can you explain who medical residents are and the role of their labor within hospitals? Armin Tadayyon: A medical resident is essentially a medical school graduate who is doing further training to become licensed and eventually board certified to work independently in their specialty. Medical residents are monumental to the care that patients receive. Most of the direct patient contact is with residents. If residents don't show up to work, the hospitals are in crisis mode. Your first-year resident, fresh out of medical school, is called an intern. Your level of responsibility and independence grows as you progress through residency, from a junior resident to a senior resident. Some attending physicians pursue further training, and they're called fellows. Hospital operations are structured into hierarchies where attending physicians oversee many medical residents who are on the front line caring for patients. Medical residents really determine the quality of care that patients receive. We pretty much do everything, depending on the specialty. We do multiple rounds a day with patients. We order medications, call families for information, consent patients for surgeries, perform surgery under supervision, talk to nurses, explain treatment plans, and much more. Almost all this day-to-day work is done by interns, residents, and fellows. But that doesn't mean the employers should be allowed to exploit us.” Why do you think there's been an uptick in resident unionization over the past few years? Iyengar: Resident physicians have been overworked and underpaid for decades as we've seen the consolidation and corporatization of health care. We've been taught over generations to just push through and ignore our working conditions. In some hospitals, residents didn't have access to vaccines even though they were first in line to see patients. There was a collective realization that hospitals are completely dependent on our labor and these mega-corporations that own hospitals are not valuing how much we do and how necessary we are to patient care. Tadayyon: Residents work very hard to get through medical school. They know that residents need the hospital's approval to become licensed and graduate. This creates an environment where residents are exploited. Unionization has been the way for residents to fight back against this exploitation and ensure a fair and just workplace. That's why residents across the nation, without any geographical bias, are unionizing. During the pandemic, residents were forced into situations where they didn't have any input. They had to take the shifts that nobody wanted. That made many people angry and shed light on how residents are treated. “There are many ways we can use our numbers — and, honestly, our privilege, being doctors with white coats — to speak up for our patients and the broader issues that, in the end, are health issues.” What are the big issues and challenges facing medical residents that have led them to organize? Child care is a huge issue for many residents, and also fertility benefits. We're in an age range where these things are really important. If you have a child, it's hard to find a daycare with hours that work for our jobs, and paying for child care on our salary is prohibitive. Depending on the city, we've been working in coalition with community groups and other unions to advance affordable and accessible child care. Unionization has helped residents advocate for better patient care and get funds for equipment and supplies that patients need. Many unions are fighting for better mental health coverage in their contracts. During my intern year, I worked 28-hour shifts in the neonatal intensive care unit. Every few hours I would be at another delivery trying to make sure that baby was born OK. I can't imagine being a patient on the other end of that. We have an 80-hour workweek averaged over the course of four weeks. Tadayyon: The rising cost of living is a huge issue. Our salaries didn't increase when inflation went up. Residents in Buffalo were taking out personal loans just to stay afloat. Residents are always given the shifts that nobody else wants. I've worked every single holiday over the last three and a half years. But that doesn't mean the employers should be allowed to exploit us. How are the struggles of medical residents connected to larger struggles in our society and also to patient care? We have a unique moment to engage residents in thinking of themselves as workers who are part of a bigger struggle and who have power to make changes outside of just the exam room. There's much more that goes into why a person is sick than what's directly in front of you. As a labor union, we have the ability to connect these struggles for our members and help them see that bigger picture. There are many ways we can use our numbers — and, honestly, our privilege, being doctors with white coats — to speak up for our patients and the broader issues that, in the end, are health issues. Since the 1970s, we've also had a patient care fund in Los Angeles County that's funded by residents forgoing a part of their raise. We've bought things like sleeper couches and new ultrasound machines when the hospital won't buy them. Tadayyon: Our resident unions fight for patient care. Unionization has let residents bargain over bringing more safety to patients, and we have better outcomes. How do you see medical resident unions in relation to the larger labor movement? I'm always meeting people who are wondering how to join the union. We're also workers, and we're fighting for the same things as everyone else, like child care, better public transportation, more affordable housing, and addressing the rising cost of living. Every new union residency program adds people to the labor movement. The more members we have means the more power we have to achieve victories for us and our patients. I don't see this slowing down anytime soon, because residents have now seen what unions can do for us. Finally, what keeps you energized and hopeful for this movement? Tadayyon: When you compare morale today among Buffalo medical residents to before we unionized, it's huge. Fast-forward to today, and residency is still hard, but there's less burnout and less stress over whether you can pay rent. What inspired me to join our organizing committee and help win our union was that residents were not being treated right. I love looking at junior residents today and seeing that, instead of stressing about rent or groceries, they're worried about questions like, “Did that patient do well?” “How should I follow up with that patient?” “Did I provide the best care possible?” That's how residency should be. Iyengar: I get to interview the next set of residents that come to our program, and I've noticed a huge shift. A few years ago, nobody was asking about the union. I'm also seeing a huge wave of people who see the union as a powerful tool for advocating for patients in ways that intersect with health care but aren't specifically health care. I'm not going to be a resident for much longer. I'm really hopeful that in the next year, we can harness all this energy of younger, newer doctors that are so excited to be part of the labor movement and use that energy in coalition with others. I think that's the next frontier for us. Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining. As we face mounting repression, Truthout appeals for your support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Broadcaster to take precautions in future after whistling, shouting and music leave parts of exchange inaudible A German public broadcaster has said it is reviewing its procedures after a live interview with the leader of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland was interrupted by protesters. Amid whistling and shouting, the speakers of a bus used as part of the demonstration blared the anti-AfD song Scheiß AfD Jodler (Shit AfD Yodellers) by Corner Chor, an award-winning activist choir from Augsburg. Some parts of the interview were inaudible to people watching it on TV. On Monday ARD said it would learn lessons from the incident but refused to say whether it would redo the interview. The Berlin police said no arrests had been made, but that it was considering launching proceedings against the demonstrators. The journalist carrying out the interview, Markus Preiß, said afterwards: “I have to say: Alice Weidel was quite sporting, considering the volume.” He added: “Everyone is allowed to demonstrate; that's a good democratic right. While she tried to make light of it, calling the choir a “tax-funded NGO” and insisting she was used to protests against her, Weidel appeared to grow increasingly frustrated as the interview went on. Preiß said he and Weidel had briefly discussed whether they should keep going and had agreed to continue. AfD members and supporters said the broadcaster was responsible for guaranteeing equal conditions for politicians of all parties during interviews. The media lobby group Reporters Without Borders said internet companies should be taxed to create a fund to help public broadcasters deal with the pressures they are increasingly facing from far-right parties. The group's director general, Thibaut Bruttin, cited Donald Trump's decision to “dismantle” the US's international broadcasting service, saying it echoed “the offensive being waged by certain political forces against public radio and television broadcasters across Europe”, naming Hungary, Italy and Slovakia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Bangladesh Air Force jet crashed into a college in the capital Dhaka on Monday, killing at least 20 people according to the military – in the country's deadliest air incident in recent memory. Related article Air India crash rekindles debate over cockpit video recorders Students were attending afternoon classes when the BAF F7 jet hit the two-story campus around 1:18 p.m. local time (3:18 a.m. EST) after a mechanical fault, according to state media BSS News, citing the country's armed forces. The plane's pilot made “every effort to divert the aircraft away from densely populated areas toward a more sparsely inhabited location,” the military said. The government announced a day of mourning and special prayers, BSS News said. “I express my deep grief and sorrow over the tragic incident of casualties caused by the crash,” the country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus wrote in a post on X. “This is a moment of profound pain for the nation. Eyewitnesses, including the parents of students, recalled huge plumes of ash rising over the school – after a banging sound rang out following the deadly crash. “When I was picking (up) my kids and went to the gate, I realized something came from behind,” Masud Tarik, also a teacher at the school, told Reuters. Others watched the chaotic aftermath unfold on TV. “I was terrified watching videos,” Rafiqa Taha, a student at the facility, told The Associated Press. Video from Bangladesh's Channel 24 shows smoke billowing as firefighters spray water onto the crash site while onlookers gather around. Other rescue workers search the rubble. Video from the hospital shows people being urgently rushed in. A family member is heard saying his injured sister is a grade four student. Another family member told Channel 24 a first batch of victims arrived at the hospital with severe burns. “We literally saw skin being torn off,” she said. A young, injured girl tells Channel 24 from her hospital bed: “When we came out, we saw many students who had been charred.” Condolences came in from across the region with Pakistan and India's prime ministers expressing their solidarity with Bangladesh.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The only conclusion that one can come to is that Israel is doing this deliberately,” says analyst Alex de Waal. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. The starvation crisis in Gaza is deepening under Israel's brutal blockade and amid regular massacres of civilians attempting to secure aid at the only officially sanctioned aid sites, run by Israeli troops and American mercenaries. “I've been working on this field of famine, food crisis and humanitarian action for more than 40 years, and there is no case, over those four decades, of such minutely engineered, closely monitored, precisely designed mass starvation of a population as is happening in Gaza today,” says de Waal, who is also the author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: In one of the deadliest days yet for aid seekers in Gaza, Israeli forces killed at least 115 people on Sunday, including 92 who were killed while seeking aid. In the deadliest attack, at least 79 people at the Zikim crossing in North Gaza were massacred as they gathered near an aid convoy sent by the U.N. World Food Programme in northern Gaza in the hopes of getting flour. These latest killings come as the starvation crisis in Gaza continues to deepen. UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, has accused Israel of starving civilians, including a million children. The entire population, more than 2 million people, lack access to sufficient food, putting their lives at immediate risk. Health authorities in Gaza say 19 people died of starvation over the last day, including at least one infant. This is the uncle of 3-month-old Yahya Al-Najjar. ANAN AL-NAJJAR: [translated] He died due to malnutrition and the unavailability of baby formula at the Gaza Strip. We urge the entire world, all Arab countries and everyone with a living consciousness, humanity and dignity, to just stand with the children, just to let baby formula get into the Gaza Strip. AMY GOODMAN: Since late May, when militarized aid sites run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were established, nearly 900 Palestinians have been killed while attempting to access aid, and more than 5,700 have been injured. This is the brother of Raed Sindy, who was killed by Israeli fire while attempting to access aid yesterday at a site run by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Aid Foundation. AHMED SINDY: [translated] They go out just trying to stave off their hunger and the hunger of their children, but they come back wrapped in shrouds. We ask God Almighty, and we appeal to the international community, that these death traps be shut down and that humanitarian corridors be opened, out of mercy for our children, our women and our elderly. AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined by two guests. In London, Davide Piscitelli is with us, an advanced researcher at Forensic Architecture at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he co-directs Gaza research and is working on a forthcoming report tentatively titled “The Architecture of Genocidal Starvation in Gaza.” And in Somerville, Massachusetts, Alex de Waal is with us, executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine. You are coming out with this final report in the next few weeks, but you felt it was critical to get out something faster than that. Talk about why and what you found. And there is a reason for this. The GHF system has only like four stations. As we know, three are in Rafah, south of Gaza. One is in central, close to the Wadi Gaza. So, the population that are in the north, they are completely cut out of this system. So, we have been collecting and verifying visual evidence of attacks against civilians and infrastructure, again, both in the proximity of the GHF or inside them. And we also analyze the temporal and spatial architecture of the GHF system, which is a system that is designed to be little. I can speak a bit more about the spatial and temporal architecture of the system, if you like. DAVIDE PISCITELLI: So, the GHF system, we are analyzing in two elements. But in the meantime, there is a military infrastructure that is growing inside Gaza, starting from the margin, especially over the month of April and May 2025. So, between the Morag Corridor and the Philadelphi Corridor, we start to see pop up new military stations. And few days after, we started to see what is today the aid distribution center of the GHF starting to grow out of this infrastructure. So the GHF aid system is an extension of the military infrastructure that Israelis put in place in Gaza. And then there's a temporal element of it. We analyzed over 160 announcements of the GHF. And by putting them on a timeline, we started to see that, on average, the site is only open for 20 to 23 minutes. Having only 17 minutes means two things: one, that Palestinians cannot access to the site, because they have to walk between 2.5 to 10 kilometers, by walk, under hot temperature, hot surfaces like sand and between rubble, but also it means that it forces further displacement towards the south. And we are seeing from satellite images that new tents are getting closer and closer to the GHF, but the GHF stations are inside the military zone, and this is where the shootings are happening right now. AMY GOODMAN: Alex de Waal, I'd like to bring you into this conversation. You're working with Forensic Architecture on their report. We have just heard that in the last day 19 people, including at least one infant, have died of starvation in Gaza. Can you talk about why this is happening? ALEX DE WAAL: So, let me say that I've been working on this field of famine, food crisis and humanitarian action for more than 40 years, and there is no case, over those four decades, of such minutely engineered, closely monitored, precisely designed mass starvation of a population as is happening in Gaza today. So, we have known, from expert reports by the United Nations, by the independent Famine Review Committee, by many others, exactly how this situation would unfold. And in May, there were some authoritative reports that indicated two trajectories that starvation might take in Gaza. And if that siege were to be continued, Gaza would completely run out of food within weeks. We knew this was going to happen. There are decades of experience of how you design these operations to work in war zones, and the U.N. had had a system, 400 feeding stations, as Davide mentioned, all embedded within the community, so that you could use the support of the community, of families, to make sure there was minimal disruption. It's simply the rations are not enough. The essential food that children need is not there. And then, as this report documents, the only way in which people can get access to those centers is by putting themselves in harm's way, by risking death by shooting, in order to get — to try and get food to feed their children. So, it is entirely unsurprising, exactly as was predicted. AMY GOODMAN: Alex, you've referred to the ICJ — that's the International Court of Justice — provisional order, more than a year ago, in March of 2024, that instructed Israel to provide a full spectrum of humanitarian relief and essential services through the U.N. So, by definition, you can't wait until after a genocide has happened or after a famine has happened. We shouldn't wait and then count the graves of the children who have died, and then say, “Wasn't that terrible? All states that are signatory to the Genocide Convention — the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom — everyone is required to act to prevent genocide. And that decision, that instruction, that order by the International Court of Justice — and, as you say, the Israeli former chair of the high court, Aharon Barak, voted for it — was the most authoritative order that one can have. And it has not been acted upon. And I think we can all draw the logical conclusion from this shameful failure to prevent an utterly foreseeable disaster and crime. AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, and we'll link to your reports, your preliminary findings at democracynow.org, and also, again, Alex, your London Review of Books article that we interviewed you for in May, called “Starvation in Gaza.” Alex de Waal, executive director of World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine, he's working with Forensic Architecture on their forthcoming report on starvation in Gaza, and Davide Piscitelli, speaking to you in London, advanced researcher for Forensic Architecture. When we come back, we'll look at a new 972 report on Israeli soldiers saying they're dropping grenades from drones in Gaza “like a video game,” that the goal is for Palestinians to “learn through blood.” We'll speak with Meron Rapoport, editor at Local Call, columnist with 972 Magazine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine needs $6 billion to bridge its weapons production shortfall in 2025, Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal told allies during a virtual Ramstein format meeting on July 21, as cited by Radio Svoboda. Ukraine is determined to constantly increase its homegrown drone capabilities, with recent plans focusing on developing interceptor drones designed to counter Russia's frequent Shahed-type drone attacks on Ukrainian cities. "This would allow us to produce more FPV (first-person view) drones, more interceptor drones to repel Shahed attacks, and additional long-range weapons so that the war also continues on Russian territory," Shmyhal said during the meeting, Radio Svoboda reported. The U.S. was represented by its ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker rather than Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, despite earlier announcements by the British NATO mission. On June 24, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during the NATO summit that Ukraine has the capacity to produce over 8 million drones of various types each year, but lacks the financial backing to reach that potential. Zelensky urged allies to scale up investments in joint weapons production, including drone technologies, artillery, and interceptors. According to Zelensky, overall, domestically-produced weapons account for more than 40% of the arms used in Ukraine's defense against Russia's war. "I urge our European allies, who have talked a big game, to follow us if we implement these secondary tariffs," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. Trump's ultimatum to Russia, Ukraine's largest government reshuffle, and allegations launched against prominent anti-corruption activist that many claim are politically motivated. Ukraine needs $6 billion to bridge its weapons production shortfall in 2025, Defense Minister Denis Shmyhal told allies during a virtual Ramstein meeting on July 21, according to Radio Svoboda (Ukrainian service of RFE/RL). "It is clear to all that truly effective talks can only take place at the level of national leaders," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. "It is a great honor and at the same time an extraordinary responsibility for me to lead the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a difficult time for our country," Hennadii Shapovalov said in a statement. "In the morning, after briefings from military and interior officials, I met with the foreign minister and our (Presidential) Office team. We finalized the long process of selecting ambassadorial candidates," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram. The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia launched 450 aerial threats overnight, including 426 Shahed drones and various types of missiles, including Kinzhal, Kalibr, and Kh-101. Amid reported Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia, a fire broke out at a train station in the village of Kamenolomni in Rostov Oblast overnight July 21 as Moscow faced drones for the fifth straight night, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(CNN) – A Bangladesh Air Force jet crashed into a college in the capital Dhaka on Monday, killing at least 19 people, according to emergency officials, in the country's deadliest air incident in recent memory. The crash at Milestone School and College campus, in the Diabari neighborhood of northern Dhaka, injured more than 100 others, according to a spokesperson for the country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus. At least 83 of those survivors – mostly students – were being treated in hospitals in the capital, some “in critical condition,” the spokesperson added. The BAF F7 jet hit the campus around 1:18 p.m. local time (3:18 a.m. EST), according to state media BSS News, citing a Fire Service and Civil Defense official. The plane's pilot was among those killed, The Associated Press reported, citing regional officials. Scores of people rushed towards the crash site, where emergency crews could be seen trying to extinguish the smoking wreckage of the jet. The government has announced a day of mourning and special prayers, BSS News said. “I express my deep grief and sorrow over the tragic incident of casualties caused by the crash,” Yunus wrote in a post on X. “This is a moment of profound pain for the nation. Eyewitnesses, including the parents of students, recalled huge plumes of ash rising over the school – after a banging sound rang out following the deadly crash. “When I was picking (up) my kids and went to the gate, I realized something came from behind,” Masud Tarik, also a teacher at the school, told Reuters. Others watched the chaotic aftermath unfold on TV. “I was terrified watching videos,” Rafiqa Taha, a student at the facility, told The Associated Press. This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ruling in university's favor would reverse funding freezes that became cuts as Trump administration escalated fight US district judge Allison Burroughs heard arguments from Harvard and the Department of Justice. The cuts, imposed earlier this year, have halted major research efforts and Harvard argues they are a politically motivated attempt to pressure the school into adopting federal policies on student conduct, admissions, antisemitism and diversity. A ruling in favor of the university would revive Harvard's sprawling scientific and medical research operation and hundreds of projects that lost federal money. “All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: allow the government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution's ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions.” Monday's hearing will be closely watched by other universities that have seen their research funds axed by the administration, which has suspended or threatened billions in grants and contracts from several institutions. Harvard is the first – and so far only – university to sue. (Trump has also threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, but he has taken no action to that effect so far.) The letter demanded sweeping changes related to campus protests, academics and admissions. For example, the letter told Harvard to audit the viewpoints of students and faculty and admit more students or hire new professors if the campus was found to lack diverse points of view. The letter was meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment on campus. Alan Garber, Harvard's president, pledged to fight antisemitism but said no government “should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue”. Linda McMahon, the US education secretary, declared in May that Harvard would no longer be eligible for new grants, and weeks later the administration began canceling contracts with Harvard. As Harvard fought the funding freeze in court, individual agencies began sending letters announcing that the frozen research grants were being terminated. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel contracts for policy reasons. “It is the policy of the United States under the Trump administration not to fund institutions that fail to adequately address antisemitism in their programs,” it said in court documents. Finally, last month, the Trump administration formally issued a finding that the school tolerated antisemitism – a step that eventually could jeopardize all of Harvard's federal funding, including federal student loans or grants. The penalty is typically referred to as a “death sentence”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former top Ukrainian police official has been found dead under mysterious circumstances in the same Spanish residential complex where a Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine was assassinated last year, Spanish news outlet El Espanol reported on July 20. While initial findings suggest no signs of violence, witnesses noted he was bleeding from one ear, suggesting it might have been a cerebral hemorrhage or stroke. Despite efforts by bystanders and emergency personnel to revive Hrushevskyi, he was declared dead at the scene. El Espanol reports that Hrushevskyi was a senior official in Ukraine's Interior Ministry and later in the National Police, though he is largely absent from public records. These units were disbanded in 2015 as part of police reforms and replaced by the National Police and the SBU's anti-corruption directorate. The same residential complex was previously the site of another death — that of Russian pilot Maksim Kuzminov, who defected to Ukraine with a military helicopter in 2023. Kuzminov was found shot dead in a garage there in February 2024, with a burned-out car discovered nearby, believed to have been used by his killers. There was no direct connection confirmed between the two deaths. According to El Espanol, Hrushevskyi had recently purchased and begun renovating a unit in the complex. Hrushevskyi's age and his recent purchase of the apartment have led some neighbors to believe he may have simply retired to Villajoyosa for its sizable Ukrainian community, the news outlet reported. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial assaults on Ukraine in recent months, only hours before the U.K. and Germany chaired a meeting to discuss U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for NATO allies to provide Ukraine with weapons. The attack killed two people and wounded 15, including a 12-year-old, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Videos posted on social media showed the station platform engulfed by smoke, with dozens of people inside. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said the station had to be ventilated in what he called an “enhanced mode.” The heaviest strikes hit Kyiv's Darnytskyi district, where a kindergarten, supermarket and warehouse facilities caught fire. Russia launched a new barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine in an overnight attack on Monday, killing at least one person and causing multiple fires in the capital Kyiv, city officials said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot arrived in Kyiv on Monday and visited some of the damage. The hours-long drone and missile assault on Kyiv overnight into Monday underscored the urgency of Ukraine's need for further Western military aid, especially in air defence, a week after Trump said deliveries would arrive in Ukraine within days. The virtual meeting of high-level military officials Monday was led by British Defence Secretary John Healey and his German counterpart Boris Pistorius. Moscow has intensified its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate as Russian drone production expands. Ukraine's new Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal urged allies to speed up deliveries of American air defence systems under the plan put forward by Trump. Trump's arms plan, announced a week ago, involves European nations sending American weapons, including Patriot air defence missile systems, to Ukraine via NATO – either from existing stockpiles or buying and donating new ones. U.S.-Russia ties in ‘deplorable state,' but Trump sanctions threat has not ended talks, Kremlin says NATO's Grynkewich told The Associated Press on Thursday that “preparations are underway” for weapons transfers to Ukraine while U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said he couldn't give a time frame. But delivery could take time, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested, because “they have to be transported, they have to be set up; that is not a question of hours, it is a question of days, perhaps weeks.” Other Patriot systems could come thanks to Switzerland, whose defence ministry said Thursday it was informed by the U.S. Defense Department that it will “reprioritize the delivery” of five previously ordered systems to support Ukraine. Soldiers stand during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to a military training area to find out about the training of Ukrainian soldiers on the Patriot anti-aircraft missile system, at an undisclosed location, in Germany, in June, 2024.Jens Buttner/Reuters Zelensky said Saturday that his officials have proposed a new round of peace talks this week. The Kremlin spokesman said Sunday that Russia is open to peace with Ukraine, but achieving its goals remains a priority. The overnight Russian barrage of Kyiv began shortly after midnight and continued until around 6 a.m. Residents of the capital were kept awake by machine-gun fire, buzzing drone engines and multiple loud explosions. Russia's Ministry of Defence said its attack used drones and Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shigeru Ishiba on Monday vowed to stay in his role as Japan's Prime Minister, despite disappointing election results.PHILIP FONG/Reuters “It is difficult to see how an LDP Leader who has led the party to two consecutive national election defeats, lost control of both houses, and failed to fend off new challenges on the right will continue to enjoy the confidence of his own party,” political analyst Tobias Harris, founder of Japan Foresight, wrote in a newsletter Monday. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba vowed to remain in office on Monday after his ruling coalition suffered a bruising defeat in upper house elections, prompting some of his own party to deliberate his future as the opposition weighed a no-confidence motion. The previously fringe Sanseito – known for pushing conspiracy theories about vaccines and global elites during the COVID-19 pandemic – campaigned on an anti-immigration, “Japanese First” message, capitalizing on growing concerns around tourism and an increase in foreign-born workers at a time when the Japanese economy is struggling and the yen is weak. Speaking to Japanese TV after the election, Sanseito Leader Sohei Kamiya said his party has been mischaracterized, claiming “the phrase ‘Japanese First' was meant to express rebuilding Japanese people's livelihoods by resisting globalism.” “I am not saying that we should completely ban foreigners or that every foreigner should get out of Japan,” he added. Unlike in recent elections in Canada and Australia, where conservative parties suffered as a result of being seen as too close or similar to U.S. President Donald Trump, Mr. Kamiya revelled in the comparison and had already pushed the government to the right on immigration even before his victory Sunday. Other fringe conservative parties also added to their seat count, as did the left-wing Reiwa Shinsengumi, which has presented itself as an alternative to the staid CDP and the Communists, who have struggled to break through with mainstream liberal Japan in part due to the party's strict pacifism at a time when more and more Japanese support rearmament. Resisting calls to resign Monday, Mr. Ishiba said he has a “responsibility to the nation” to deal with the pressing issues facing Japan, not least trade negotiations with Mr. Trump, which have proven far tougher than Tokyo expected and increasingly left the country out in the cold with one of its previously most reliable allies. ‘Mutually beneficial' trade deal with Japan still possible, U.S. Treasury Secretary says He said the most important thing for the country at this time is “political stability,” adding he will seek to speak to Mr. Trump “at the earliest date possible to seek a solution on trade.” If he is removed, a leadership fight could prove bruising for the LDP, which has been racked by infighting and scandal since the resignation and subsequent death of former prime minister Shinzo Abe. In that race, he narrowly defeated a candidate from the party's hard-right, Sanae Takaichi, who would have been Japan's first female prime minister and is still widely seen as his most likely successor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Air defense systems intercepted 74 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) overnight, the Russian Defense Ministry reported. The fall of drone debris on an infrastructure facility at the Kamenolomny station in the Rostov Region has caused delays for 26 passenger trains. Overnight, from 11:20 p.m. Moscow time (8:20 p.m. GMT — TASS) on July 20 to 7 a.m. Moscow time on July 21, air defense systems on duty intercepted and eliminated 74 Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. At least 26 passenger trains have been delayed, the North Caucasus Railway reported in a Telegram post. Traffic through the Kamenolomny station is proceeding at reduced speed. An emergency response team is on site to manage the aftermath. Acting Rostov Region Governor Yury Slusar also stated on Telegram that a flower shop caught fire in the village of Kamenolomny, Oktyabrsky Rural District, which was later extinguished. According to Slusar, in the village of Rakovo, Krasnosulinsky District, drone fragments damaged a private home, a summer kitchen, and two cars. Temporary restrictions on arrivals and departures were imposed at Moscow's airports: Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky. These measures have since been lifted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. But the U.S. secretary of state, who also served as national security adviser, knew different when it came to dealing with major powers. It is an insight that appears to be lost on U.S. President Donald Trump. Since returning to office in January, Trump has called the United States' closest allies cheaters and freeloaders. Japan and other Asian trading partners, he insists, are “very spoiled”; immediate North American neighbors stand accused of exporting drugs and criminals. He freely and publicly labels the leaders of some of the United States' most important democratic partners as has-beens, weak, or dishonest, while heaping praise on autocrats he finds easier to deal with, such as Hungarian President Viktor Orban (“a very great leader”), Salvadoran strongman Nayib Bukele (“a great friend”), North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un (“a smart guy”), and—at least until very recently—Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he has called “a genius” and “very savvy” in attacking Ukraine. In what would have been unthinkable in previous administrations, including Trump's first, the United States in February even sided against its own democratic allies and with Russia and other authoritarian states, such as North Korea and Belarus, in voting against a UN resolution that condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine and upheld the latter's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Perhaps most baffling, at a time when Washington is trying to contain China and shore up U.S. defenses in the Indo-Pacific, the administration is preparing punitive tariffs on South Korea and Japan, the United States' closest Asian allies, as well as on a sweeping list of European partners it is trying to keep away from Beijing. Such is now the level of doubt that in July, France and the United Kingdom announced a new agreement to begin providing extended nuclear deterrence in Europe for themselves, and allies such as South Korea, Poland, and even Japan have begun to contemplate acquiring their own nuclear weapons. But it's hard to think of a case in which the leader of a major alliance has so casually and brutally cast aside allies that, for the most part, have been dependable and have accepted its writ. If the United States wants Canadian or Greenlandic resources, those have always been available. Threatening annexation is counterproductive, stirring up anti-Americanism as it has already done. Washington's NATO allies, it is true, have not been spending enough on defense but that is partly because the United States has insisted for decades on having the dominant role. And when pressed, as at the most recent NATO summit in June, members of the transatlantic alliance have increased their defense budgets, or pledged to do so, to levels that could not have been imagined only a few years ago. If the president is impatient with existing alliances, he has offered few alternatives beyond an apparent attachment to the old concept of spheres of influence, in which a handful of powers dominate their immediate neighbors, and multilateral organizations, if they survive at all, have little power or authority. Such a world offers greater threats in the future to the United States as the other spheres—presumably including a Chinese-dominated Asia and perhaps a Russian zone in eastern Europe and Central Asia—jostle against it and smaller powers within each sphere either accept their fate often resentfully or look for new hegemons. By trashing alliances that have served it well, the United States risks a general breakdown of stability and order that will, in the long run, prove highly costly, whether in military expenditure or unending trade wars, as each great power seeks advantage where their zones of interest meet. The striking lack of historical precedents for such behavior does not suggest a clever Machiavellian policy to enhance American power; rather, it shows a United States acting against its own interests in bewildering fashion, undermining one of the key sources of that power. For centuries, the value of alliances, even among highly disparate countries, has been accepted as a key element of international relations. As far back as history has been recorded, groups, whether clans or nations, have come together for protection against common enemies. Before the world became so interconnected and communication was more difficult, geography allowed some states to live without allies. Japan was able to remain in lonely isolation for two and a half centuries until it was confronted with a different and more expansive world when the U.S. naval officer Commodore Matthew Perry came calling in 1853. The United States, protected as it once was by two oceans and with no powerful enemies along its land borders, prided itself for much of its history on avoiding alliances. Even when it belatedly entered World War I on the Allied side, President Woodrow Wilson insisted that the United States was an “associated power” rather than an ally. Only after 1945 did it abandon this suspicion of alliances. Facing a hostile Soviet Union and communist China, the Soviets' then close partner, it entered peacetime defensive alliances, foremost among them NATO, for the first time in its history. As we see today, the isolationist strand in American foreign policy never entirely went away. As the Truman administration learned 80 years ago, even powerful states need allies, partly for reasons of prestige but also because great power has its limits and is costly to maintain. As the British experience demonstrates, global power cannot be measured in military resources alone. It is relatively easy to count guns, ships, aircraft, economic output, or scientific and technological strengths, but it is not so easy to gauge competencies, organizational capacity, effective government, or morale. Today, after three and a half years of unsuccessful war and heavy losses, Russia may be more of a liability. Despite being on the winning side in both world wars, the United Kingdom found its resources depleted and its empire melting away. And in an age of increasingly fast and long-range missiles, geography no longer provides the barrier to adversaries that it once did. All the more reason to nurture alliances with sympathetic powers rather than spurn them. Canada has never been a threat to the United States, except in hockey, and Canadians have long seen Americans as their close relatives. Yet what Trump has done with his talk of the 51st state, his imposition of punitive tariffs, and his threats that the United States will not defend Canada under the proposed Golden Dome missile defense system unless it pays up (and he keeps raising the putative bill), has enraged a normally mild-mannered people. In Ottawa, the mood is one of shock and disbelief. Like many other human relationships, alliances are hard work: their management requires patience, forbearance, skill, and, like a garden, repeated tending. Publicly chastising allies on their supposed faults, as Vice President JD Vance did with the Europeans at the Munich Security Conference in February, barking out orders and insults on social media, as the president does almost daily, or publicly releasing letters to other heads of state before they have been delivered to the recipients, only stores up resentments and makes future personal relations more difficult. If Kissinger had not been able to establish a rapport of mutual respect with his Chinese counterpart, Zhou Enlai, the opening of relations between the United States and China during the Nixon administration might have been delayed for years. The case of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt is perhaps even more telling. From the time that war broke out in Europe in 1939, Churchill worked on, as he put it, wooing Roosevelt like a suitor. He knew that, to prevail, the United Kingdom needed American resources, such as guns and money, and eventually, he fervently hoped, American forces. And for his part, Roosevelt did not want the British to fail. Without the strong personal relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt, the irritations and cross-purposes that exist in any alliance would have greatly hampered joint strategic planning and vital U.S. military aid under the Lend-Lease Act. The partnership between their two countries was amplified and strengthened by the thousands of experts, administrators, publicists, intellectuals, and serving military who learned, not always easily, to work with one another. Together, the two generals were able to reconcile what were often deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions among their colleagues and between their political masters. Alliances are also unlikely to last beyond their immediate purpose. Churchill and Roosevelt were far less successful in their effort to build a more lasting friendship with Stalin and his Soviet Union. While they are impossible to measure, emotions such as liking or hatred, admiration or contempt—the quotidian stuff of human relations—play a crucial part in making and unmaking alliances. In the absence of such chemistry, or at least some measure of trust between leaders, however, relations can deteriorate surprisingly quickly, as the world is witnessing again today._Alexander I of Russia chafed under Napoleon's patronage and gradually drifted toward his enemies. Since 1945, dozens of countries in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East have depended on their security relationships with Washington. This includes the 31 other members of NATO; Asian countries with formal U.S. military alliances, such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea; and those with less formal but far-reaching U.S. military partnerships, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. And then there are those countries around the world such as Chile and Vietnam that have tended to work with the United States on a friendly basis. This impressive variety of countries has welcomed U.S. protection and leadership over the decades since the end of World War II not just because the American superpower was strong but because it represented hope for a better and fairer world. Trump has always been uncomfortable with the give and take of alliance politics. In his first term, Trump seemed especially uneasy at multilateral meetings where he had to deal with other leaders as equals, such as the G-7 meeting in Canada in 2018 where he arrived late and left early but not before quarreling with the other leaders over their trade policies and tariffs. He further shocked allies when he unilaterally pulled out of important and painstakingly negotiated agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to limit Iran's capacity to develop nuclear weapons (an agreement that bears a distinct resemblance to the one the second Trump administration offered Iran, at least until it was drawn into bombing Iranian nuclear sites in June). Striking a note that became the leitmotif of his second term, he complained, “We're like the piggy bank that everybody's robbing.” Today, Trump is freer to act on his impulses because those established and respected advisers who stood up to him in his first term have been replaced by courtiers and sycophants. From time to time, Trump still has to deal with other democratic powers or even multilateral organizations, and he has made clear his impatience with them. With few exceptions, the Oval Office has become the stage set for a demonstration of Trump's dominance, and when he makes an appearance at international meetings, he keeps it as brief as possible. It is hard to make out an overall purpose beyond keeping him the center of attention. Trump prefers to treat international relations as a series of transactions, holding face-to-face meetings or long phone calls with only one other leader at a time, and seems distinctly more at ease with powerful autocrats than democratic statesmen. If necessary, he will bludgeon both friends and adversaries into submission, assuming they will abandon any opposition if the offer on the table is good enough or if Washington seems to hold the best hand. (“You don't have the cards right now,” he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the now infamous Oval Office dressing down.) Nations do not always act on what others assume are their best interests. Hitler thought in 1940 that the United Kingdom had little choice but to capitulate just as Putin believed that Ukraine would give up in a matter of days in the face of the Russian invasion. As Roosevelt had come to realize by the time he died in the spring of 1945, leaders can define interests in different ways. Stalin came out of a very different world and had very different experiences and goals than did the privileged son of an old American family. Parties will work together if it suits their interests and only until a better offer comes along. European allies will grumble but do what Washington wants or find themselves alone and friendless. China will negotiate on trade, promising for example to buy American agricultural products because it does not want to be shut out of U.S. markets. And if Beijing wants Taiwan, why not let it have it as long as the United States gets something in return? The president seems to assume that current and potential allies see international relations as he does. Yet nations, like individuals, have long memories of past wrongs or defeats, as Trump himself should know. Trust among individuals or nations is hard to measure, but lasting and productive relations cannot exist without it. By contrast, although there were certainly tensions between the United States and its allies, each generally assumed their counterparts were acting in good faith, and there was a willingness to discuss tricky matters and search for mutually acceptable solutions. That no longer exists today and cannot be easily or quickly rebuilt. Being the world's greatest military power is a heavy burden, and partly as a result, the U.S. debt continues to grow to staggering levels. Ambitious powers, China in particular, are pouring resources into an arms race that gets ever more expensive. And, as has happened many times before, other nations are tempted to abandon the old power for the new or group against it to take advantage of what they see as its decline. If Trump's current hostility to alliances continues and the administration keeps insulting, belittling, and even economically harming its long-standing partners, the United States is going to find the world an increasingly unfriendly place. Former allies or uncommitted powers may decide, as the Slovak Republic or Serbia have already done, that Putin's Russia is a better bet; others may bypass the United States with new trade arrangements or, as is happening with European nations and Canada, sharing in their own military production, planning, and mutual deterrence, on the assumption that the United States is no longer a dependable ally. In a harbinger of things to come, Canada has just shipped its first container of liquefied natural gas to Asia. Trump's United States may find that, in the dangerous twenty-first century, those splendors are overrated.

BEIRUT, July 21. /TASS/. 298 civilians have become victims of the armed clashes that have been ongoing in the province of Al-Suwayda in southern Syria since July 13, while the total number of deaths during the inter-communal conflict amounted to 1,119 people, Sky News Arabia TV channel reported, citing medical sources, which previously put death toll at 940.

According to the TV channel, 427 fighters of the Druze self-defense units were killed. The special forces of the Interior and Defense Ministries sent from Damascus to the southern regions to restore stability lost 354 soldiers, and the pro-government formations of the Arab tribes lost 21 militias. Another 19 members of the internal security forces were killed in Israeli airstrikes.

On July 19, Syrian President for the transitional period Ahmed al-Sharaa introduced a ceasefire in Al-Suwayda in accordance with the settlement plan developed with the participation of international mediators. The planned prisoner exchange on July 20 failed due to renewed clashes in several areas between Bedouins and supporters of radical leader of the Syrian Druze Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri.

Earlier, supporters of Sheikh al-Hijri, who opposes normalization of relations with Damascus, prevented the passage of a government delegation to the province, which was escorting a cargo of humanitarian aid. The Syrian authorities condemned these provocative actions.</p>
