Unionization will lead to better and safer patient outcomes, says one medical resident.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Amid rising labor militancy over the past few years, one group of workers has gone under the radar: medical residents. Also known as resident physicians or housestaff, medical residents are doctors who have finished medical school and are working in hospitals as apprentices on the path to getting independently licensed. They are the patient-facing backbone of hospital operations, working extremely long hours under stressful conditions for mediocre pay.

Over the past few years, from California to New England, medical residents have been unionizing and striking by the thousands. They've composed some of the largest new units to unionize in the United States. They labor in the strategic sector of health care, which intersects with multiple struggles around social justice and corporate power. They have the potential to work in coalition with others to address public health and other issues. Thousands of newly unionized medical residents will bring their union consciousness into the rest of their careers.

What do medical residents do? What's behind their rising unionization? What challenges do they face at work? How do their struggles connect with larger struggles in society and the labor movement? To discuss these questions and more, Truthout spoke with two union medical residents who represent a cross-section of this growing part of the labor movement.

Dr. Mahima Iyengar is a chief resident of internal medicine and pediatrics at Los Angeles General Medical Center. She is the secretary-treasurer of the Committee of Interns and Residents (CIR), a local of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). CIR/SEIU is the largest housestaff union in the U.S., representing over 40,000 resident physicians and fellows. The union has existed for decades, but has recently seen an influx of thousands of new unionized members.

Dr. Armin Tadayyon was an anesthesiology resident at the University at Buffalo's affiliated hospitals who helped lead a successful 2023 union drive and 2024 strike of UB residents, which resulted in their first contract. Buffalo residents are affiliated with the Union of American Physicians and Dentists. Tadayyon graduated from his residency this summer. The two interviews were conducted separately and have been edited into a roundtable format. The following transcript has also been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Derek Seidman: Can you explain who medical residents are and the role of their labor within hospitals?

Armin Tadayyon: A medical resident is essentially a medical school graduate who is doing further training to become licensed and eventually board certified to work independently in their specialty. It's akin to vocational training.

Medical residents are monumental to the care that patients receive. Our labor holds the hospital afloat. Most of the direct patient contact is with residents. If residents don't show up to work, the hospitals are in crisis mode.

Your first-year resident, fresh out of medical school, is called an intern. Your level of responsibility and independence grows as you progress through residency, from a junior resident to a senior resident. Once you graduate residency, you are a licensed physician, and you pursue board certification in your specialty. Once you are board certified, you are an attending physician, and can operate independently without any supervision. Some attending physicians pursue further training, and they're called fellows.

Hospital operations are structured into hierarchies where attending physicians oversee many medical residents who are on the front line caring for patients. Medical residents really determine the quality of care that patients receive.

Mahima Iyengar: In many hospitals you visit, the residents will be the people taking care of you. They're the backbone of whatever hospital they're working at.

We pretty much do everything, depending on the specialty. We're usually in the hospital before 6:00 am. We do multiple rounds a day with patients. We order medications, call families for information, consent patients for surgeries, perform surgery under supervision, talk to nurses, explain treatment plans, and much more. Almost all this day-to-day work is done by interns, residents, and fellows.

“We're here because we love our patients and we want to provide the best care we can. But that doesn't mean the employers should be allowed to exploit us.”

Why do you think there's been an uptick in resident unionization over the past few years?

Iyengar: Resident physicians have been overworked and underpaid for decades as we've seen the consolidation and corporatization of health care. We've been taught over generations to just push through and ignore our working conditions.

But things started changing during COVID-19. We were working 80-hour weeks and 14- or 16-hour days. In some hospitals, residents didn't have access to vaccines even though they were first in line to see patients.

Our working conditions and the exploitation of our labor really came to light during that period. There was a collective realization that hospitals are completely dependent on our labor and these mega-corporations that own hospitals are not valuing how much we do and how necessary we are to patient care.

Tadayyon: Residents work very hard to get through medical school. They have a lot on the line when they get into residency, and hospitals know that. They know that residents need the hospital's approval to become licensed and graduate. This creates an environment where residents are exploited. It creates cheap labor for the hospitals and a negative experience for medical residents.

Unionization has been the way for residents to fight back against this exploitation and ensure a fair and just workplace. That's why residents across the nation, without any geographical bias, are unionizing.

During the pandemic, residents were forced into situations where they didn't have any input. They had to take the shifts that nobody wanted. Stanford medical residents protested during the height of the pandemic after being left off the COVID vaccine list. That made many people angry and shed light on how residents are treated.

“There are many ways we can use our numbers — and, honestly, our privilege, being doctors with white coats — to speak up for our patients and the broader issues that, in the end, are health issues.”

What are the big issues and challenges facing medical residents that have led them to organize?

Iyengar: The cost of living is the number one thing we hear residents talk about. Wages haven't kept up with inflation and haven't matched cost-of-living adjustments in most places. When I first started residency, I was making $55,000 a year. It's very hard to afford to live in Los Angeles on that amount.

Child care is a huge issue for many residents, and also fertility benefits. We're in an age range where these things are really important. If you have a child, it's hard to find a daycare with hours that work for our jobs, and paying for child care on our salary is prohibitive. Depending on the city, we've been working in coalition with community groups and other unions to advance affordable and accessible child care.

Patient care is an issue that really galvanizes people and is driving unionization. We want to provide the best care for patients, but the system is set up against this. Unionization has helped residents advocate for better patient care and get funds for equipment and supplies that patients need.

Mental health is also a major issue. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death for medical residents. Many unions are fighting for better mental health coverage in their contracts.

During my intern year, I worked 28-hour shifts in the neonatal intensive care unit. Every few hours I would be at another delivery trying to make sure that baby was born OK. I can't imagine being a patient on the other end of that. Would you want your doctor coming to your delivery to have been awake for 24 hours?

Work hours are a little harder to address because they're mandated through a separate body. We have an 80-hour workweek averaged over the course of four weeks. You could work 120 hours one week and 60 hours the next week. Residents talk about work hours a lot, but that requires a higher push, from a federal level even.

Tadayyon: The rising cost of living is a huge issue. Our salaries didn't increase when inflation went up. Residents in Buffalo were taking out personal loans just to stay afloat. Health insurance was also a big issue in Buffalo and a reason for unionizing. One sign during our strike was “I can't even afford the health care I provide.” 

Residents are always given the shifts that nobody else wants. I've worked every single holiday over the last three and a half years. We negotiated 10 holidays into our contract. Holidays must still get covered, but now residents get a comp day if they work a major holiday.

We're here because we love our patients and we want to provide the best care we can. But that doesn't mean the employers should be allowed to exploit us.

How are the struggles of medical residents connected to larger struggles in our society and also to patient care?

Iyengar: Most residents weren't in a union prior to joining a unionized residency program, and many people won't be in a union after this. We have a unique moment to engage residents in thinking of themselves as workers who are part of a bigger struggle and who have power to make changes outside of just the exam room.

A lot of what we're actually treating when we treat patients are social determinants of health. There's much more that goes into why a person is sick than what's directly in front of you. We address transportation issues, food security issues, housing security issues. As a labor union, we have the ability to connect these struggles for our members and help them see that bigger picture.

We've supported legislation that prioritizes the needs of the communities and patients that we're serving. There are many ways we can use our numbers — and, honestly, our privilege, being doctors with white coats — to speak up for our patients and the broader issues that, in the end, are health issues.

Since the 1970s, we've also had a patient care fund in Los Angeles County that's funded by residents forgoing a part of their raise. We've bought things like sleeper couches and new ultrasound machines when the hospital won't buy them. A bunch of hospitals across the country have patient care funds because of the union.

Tadayyon: Our resident unions fight for patient care. Just one resident used to transport even critically ill patients, pushing the bed and managing the drips and bagging the patient. That's just not safe. Now we have a minimum of two residents with a division of responsibilities helping with transport. Unionization has let residents bargain over bringing more safety to patients, and we have better outcomes.

“People are using the power of the union to fight for immigrants and trans kids.”

How do you see medical resident unions in relation to the larger labor movement?

Iyengar: We've added thousands of new residents to the labor movement over the past few years. I'm always meeting people who are wondering how to join the union. I think we've really energized labor organizing in the health care sector because we've been growing so rapidly.

We're also workers, and we're fighting for the same things as everyone else, like child care, better public transportation, more affordable housing, and addressing the rising cost of living. We help connect these fights for people.

Every new union residency program adds people to the labor movement. The more members we have means the more power we have to achieve victories for us and our patients. I don't see this slowing down anytime soon, because residents have now seen what unions can do for us.

Finally, what keeps you energized and hopeful for this movement?

Tadayyon: When you compare morale today among Buffalo medical residents to before we unionized, it's huge. Before, we felt like we weren't being heard. Fast-forward to today, and residency is still hard, but there's less burnout and less stress over whether you can pay rent. After a long shift, we now have clean call rooms with clean sheets to rest on.

What inspired me to join our organizing committee and help win our union was that residents were not being treated right. I love looking at junior residents today and seeing that, instead of stressing about rent or groceries, they're worried about questions like, “Did that patient do well?” “How should I follow up with that patient?” “Did I provide the best care possible?” That's how residency should be.

Iyengar: I get to interview the next set of residents that come to our program, and I've noticed a huge shift. A few years ago, nobody was asking about the union. Now people always ask about this. They want a unionized program. It's been really energizing to see this new generation of doctors who know their worth and are willing to fight, and who know the union is the path to being able to take better care of themselves and their patients.

I'm also seeing a huge wave of people who see the union as a powerful tool for advocating for patients in ways that intersect with health care but aren't specifically health care. People are using the power of the union to fight for immigrants and trans kids. That's really kept me energized.

I'm not going to be a resident for much longer. I'm really hopeful that in the next year, we can harness all this energy of younger, newer doctors that are so excited to be part of the labor movement and use that energy in coalition with others. I think that's the next frontier for us.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Broadcaster to take precautions in future after whistling, shouting and music leave parts of exchange inaudible

A German public broadcaster has said it is reviewing its procedures after a live interview with the leader of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland was interrupted by protesters.

During the television interview with ARD on Sunday, Alice Weidel, co-leader of the AfD, appeared at times to struggle to hear the questions being asked of her as protesters gathered below the provisional stage for the interview in Berlin.

Amid whistling and shouting, the speakers of a bus used as part of the demonstration blared the anti-AfD song Scheiß AfD Jodler (Shit AfD Yodellers) by Corner Chor, an award-winning activist choir from Augsburg. The protesters also included the group Omas gegen Rechts (Grans against the Right) and the anti-fascist artists' collective Zentrum für Politische Schönheit (the Center for Political Beauty).

Some parts of the interview were inaudible to people watching it on TV.

The anti-immigrant party has insisted the interview should be rerun to give Weidel the chance to properly answer the questions in what was part of a series of interviews with politicians from all parties.

On Monday ARD said it would learn lessons from the incident but refused to say whether it would redo the interview. “An uninterrupted flow in interviews is in our interest and, above all, in the interest of the audience. Therefore, we will draw conclusions from the broadcast and take precautions in the future,” a spokesperson said.

The broadcaster said it had not been notified that the protest would be taking place and that nothing had been registered with the police in advance. The Berlin police said no arrests had been made, but that it was considering launching proceedings against the demonstrators.

The journalist carrying out the interview, Markus Preiß, said afterwards: “I have to say: Alice Weidel was quite sporting, considering the volume.” He added: “Everyone is allowed to demonstrate; that's a good democratic right. But demonstrations are usually registered. And this one wasn't.”

While she tried to make light of it, calling the choir a “tax-funded NGO” and insisting she was used to protests against her, Weidel appeared to grow increasingly frustrated as the interview went on.

Posting a link on social media to the interview, which was shown on the flagship news programme Tagesschau, she wrote: “This is how it looks, by the way, when the Tagesschau holds a summer interview with the AfD in [conservative] CDU-governed Berlin – while the NGO choir protests in the background.”

Preiß said he and Weidel had briefly discussed whether they should keep going and had agreed to continue.

ARD faced a barrage of criticism for its failure to move it to an enclosed studio. AfD members and supporters said the broadcaster was responsible for guaranteeing equal conditions for politicians of all parties during interviews.

Some opponents of the AfD said the protests had had the effect of creating more publicity for the party, which became the largest opposition party in the German parliament after February's elections.

The media lobby group Reporters Without Borders said internet companies should be taxed to create a fund to help public broadcasters deal with the pressures they are increasingly facing from far-right parties.

The group's director general, Thibaut Bruttin, cited Donald Trump's decision to “dismantle” the US's international broadcasting service, saying it echoed “the offensive being waged by certain political forces against public radio and television broadcasters across Europe”, naming Hungary, Italy and Slovakia.

The starvation crisis in Gaza is deepening under Israel's brutal blockade and amid regular massacres of civilians attempting to secure aid at the only officially sanctioned aid sites, run by Israeli troops and American mercenaries. The so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and the onset of famine are the subjects of a new report by analysts Davide Piscitelli and Alex de Waal for the research organization Forensic Architecture on the “architecture of genocidal starvation” in Gaza. “I've been working on this field of famine, food crisis and humanitarian action for more than 40 years, and there is no case, over those four decades, of such minutely engineered, closely monitored, precisely designed mass starvation of a population as is happening in Gaza today,” says de Waal, who is also the author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: In one of the deadliest days yet for aid seekers in Gaza, Israeli forces killed at least 115 people on Sunday, including 92 who were killed while seeking aid. In the deadliest attack, at least 79 people at the Zikim crossing in North Gaza were massacred as they gathered near an aid convoy sent by the U.N. World Food Programme in northern Gaza in the hopes of getting flour. In a statement, the U.N. agency said, quote, “As the convoy approached, the surrounding crowd came under fire from Israeli tanks, snipers and other gunfire,” unquote.

These latest killings come as the starvation crisis in Gaza continues to deepen. UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, has accused Israel of starving civilians, including a million children. The entire population, more than 2 million people, lack access to sufficient food, putting their lives at immediate risk. Health authorities in Gaza say 19 people died of starvation over the last day, including at least one infant. This is the uncle of 3-month-old Yahya Al-Najjar.

ANAN AL-NAJJAR: [translated] He died due to malnutrition and the unavailability of baby formula at the Gaza Strip. We urge the entire world, all Arab countries and everyone with a living consciousness, humanity and dignity, to just stand with the children, just to let baby formula get into the Gaza Strip.

AMY GOODMAN: Since late May, when militarized aid sites run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were established, nearly 900 Palestinians have been killed while attempting to access aid, and more than 5,700 have been injured. This is the brother of Raed Sindy, who was killed by Israeli fire while attempting to access aid yesterday at a site run by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Aid Foundation.

AHMED SINDY: [translated] They go out just trying to stave off their hunger and the hunger of their children, but they come back wrapped in shrouds. We ask God Almighty, and we appeal to the international community, that these death traps be shut down and that humanitarian corridors be opened, out of mercy for our children, our women and our elderly.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined by two guests. In London, Davide Piscitelli is with us, an advanced researcher at Forensic Architecture at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he co-directs Gaza research and is working on a forthcoming report tentatively titled “The Architecture of Genocidal Starvation in Gaza.” And in Somerville, Massachusetts, Alex de Waal is with us, executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine. He's working with Forensic Architecture on their report on starvation in Gaza.

Welcome you both to Democracy Now! Davide Piscitelli, let's begin with you. You are coming out with this final report in the next few weeks, but you felt it was critical to get out something faster than that. Talk about why and what you found.

DAVIDE PISCITELLI: Yeah, thank you.

What we saw yesterday, with over 90 people being killed while seeking aid, is something that we have been seeing daily since the end of May, especially with the introduction of the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aid system and also the dismantling of the U.N. system already in place, forcing civilians waiting aid at the crossing, like yesterday at the Zikim crossing in the north.

In our forthcoming report, we are analyzing how the militarized aid system, the GHF, is replacing the U.N. system in Gaza. The GHF is where we see most of the violence right now, especially in the proximity of the GHF, but also inside the GHF and along the path. And there is a reason for this. The GHF system has only like four stations. As we know, three are in Rafah, south of Gaza. One is in central, close to the Wadi Gaza. And this is only for the population that are in the south. So, the population that are in the north, they are completely cut out of this system. And we are comparing four stations to the 400 sites of the U.N. model.

So, we have been collecting and verifying visual evidence of attacks against civilians and infrastructure, again, both in the proximity of the GHF or inside them. And we also analyze the temporal and spatial architecture of the GHF system, which is a system that is designed to be little. So, what we saw yesterday and the day before and in the past month is just the result of this new, introduced militarized system. I can speak a bit more about the spatial and temporal architecture of the system, if you like.

AMY GOODMAN: Go ahead.

DAVIDE PISCITELLI: So, the GHF system, we are analyzing in two elements. Like, the spatial element, we call it a militarized system, because over the past 21 months we were analyzing satellite images, and we see how — we saw a lot of destruction. As we all know, virtually all Gaza has been destroyed. But in the meantime, there is a military infrastructure that is growing inside Gaza, starting from the margin, especially over the month of April and May 2025. We saw the complete destruction of Rafah and the construction of the corridor, the Morag Corridor. So, between the Morag Corridor and the Philadelphi Corridor, we start to see pop up new military stations. And few days after, we started to see what is today the aid distribution center of the GHF starting to grow out of this infrastructure. So the GHF aid system is an extension of the military infrastructure that Israelis put in place in Gaza.

And then there's a temporal element of it. We analyzed over 160 announcements of the GHF. And by putting them on a timeline, we started to see that, on average, the site is only open for 20 to 23 minutes. And after the 19th of June, the site is only open for 10 minutes. That means that the civilians has only 10 minutes to enter and collect food, when it's possible. Another important date on the time is the time between the announcement and the opening. And this shrank down to 17 minutes. Having only 17 minutes means two things: one, that Palestinians cannot access to the site, because they have to walk between 2.5 to 10 kilometers, by walk, under hot temperature, hot surfaces like sand and between rubble, but also it means that it forces further displacement towards the south. And we are seeing from satellite images that new tents are getting closer and closer to the GHF, but the GHF stations are inside the military zone, and this is where the shootings are happening right now.

AMY GOODMAN: Alex de Waal, I'd like to bring you into this conversation. You're executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine. You're working with Forensic Architecture on their report. We have just heard that in the last day 19 people, including at least one infant, have died of starvation in Gaza. Can you talk about why this is happening?

ALEX DE WAAL: So, let me say that I've been working on this field of famine, food crisis and humanitarian action for more than 40 years, and there is no case, over those four decades, of such minutely engineered, closely monitored, precisely designed mass starvation of a population as is happening in Gaza today.

So, we have known, from expert reports by the United Nations, by the independent Famine Review Committee, by many others, exactly how this situation would unfold. And in May, there were some authoritative reports that indicated two trajectories that starvation might take in Gaza. There was then a complete siege. And if that siege were to be continued, Gaza would completely run out of food within weeks. And it takes about 60 to 80 days for an adult to die of starvation. It's entirely predictable, foreseeable. A child will die much more quickly, and particularly a young child without infant formula, without clean water, without maternal care, etc. We knew this was going to happen.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has “humanitarian” in the name, but it is not anything that a humanitarian professional would ever design. There are decades of experience of how you design these operations to work in war zones, and the U.N. had had a system, 400 feeding stations, as Davide mentioned, all embedded within the community, so that you could use the support of the community, of families, to make sure there was minimal disruption. It wasn't enough, but it was still something.

Now what is happening with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is that not enough food is being provided. It's simply the rations are not enough. The essential food that children need is not there. The essential services, like clean water, like sanitation, like shelter, like fuel for cooking, none of those are there. And then, as this report documents, the only way in which people can get access to those centers is by putting themselves in harm's way, by risking death by shooting, in order to get — to try and get food to feed their children.

So, it is entirely unsurprising, exactly as was predicted. And the only surmise that one — the only conclusion that one can come to is that Israel is doing this deliberately. They know exactly what they are doing, and this is intended.

AMY GOODMAN: Alex, you've referred to the ICJ — that's the International Court of Justice — provisional order, more than a year ago, in March of 2024, that instructed Israel to provide a full spectrum of humanitarian relief and essential services through the U.N. Even the Israeli judge voted for it on the panel. It was unanimous. What happened as a result?

ALEX DE WAAL: So, that was a very, very important decision. It was an instruction, an order by the highest court in the world, the World Court, if you like, to Israel. And it had that humanitarian provision. It also had a vote of 16 to 1 to say that this was a requirement, if Israel were to fulfill its obligations to prevent genocide. Now, that is very important. The Genocide Convention is not a convention just for punishing genocide. It's a convention for preventing it. So, by definition, you can't wait until after a genocide has happened or after a famine has happened. We shouldn't wait and then count the graves of the children who have died, and then say, “Wasn't that terrible? Never again.” When we have an authoritative warning, we need to act — and not just Israel. All states that are signatory to the Genocide Convention — the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom — everyone is required to act to prevent genocide.

And that decision, that instruction, that order by the International Court of Justice — and, as you say, the Israeli former chair of the high court, Aharon Barak, voted for it — was the most authoritative order that one can have. And it has not been acted upon. And what is happening today with this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is an utter travesty of that. And I think we can all draw the logical conclusion from this shameful failure to prevent an utterly foreseeable disaster and crime.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, and we'll link to your reports, your preliminary findings at democracynow.org, and also, again, Alex, your London Review of Books article that we interviewed you for in May, called “Starvation in Gaza.” Alex de Waal, executive director of World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine, he's working with Forensic Architecture on their forthcoming report on starvation in Gaza, and Davide Piscitelli, speaking to you in London, advanced researcher for Forensic Architecture.

When we come back, we'll look at a new 972 report on Israeli soldiers saying they're dropping grenades from drones in Gaza “like a video game,” that the goal is for Palestinians to “learn through blood.” We'll speak with Meron Rapoport, editor at Local Call, columnist with 972 Magazine. Stay with us.

Ukraine needs $6 billion to bridge its weapons production shortfall in 2025, Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal told allies during a virtual Ramstein format meeting on July 21, as cited by Radio Svoboda.

Ukraine is determined to constantly increase its homegrown drone capabilities, with recent plans focusing on developing interceptor drones designed to counter Russia's frequent Shahed-type drone attacks on Ukrainian cities.

"This would allow us to produce more FPV (first-person view) drones, more interceptor drones to repel Shahed attacks, and additional long-range weapons so that the war also continues on Russian territory," Shmyhal said during the meeting, Radio Svoboda reported.

The 29th Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, known as the Ramstein format, brought together representatives from 52 countries under German and British leadership. 

The regular gatherings of top defense and military officials coordinate weapons deliveries and other military support for Ukraine's war effort.

The U.S. was represented by its ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker rather than Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, despite earlier announcements by the British NATO mission.

During the meeting, the newly-appionted Shmyhal also urged partners to earmark Ukraine funding in their 2026 budgets.

On June 24, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during the NATO summit that Ukraine has the capacity to produce over 8 million drones of various types each year, but lacks the financial backing to reach that potential.

Zelensky urged allies to scale up investments in joint weapons production, including drone technologies, artillery, and interceptors.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has rapidly developed domestic military capabilities, with particular success in groundbreaking drone technology. 

According to Zelensky, overall, domestically-produced weapons account for more than 40% of the arms used in Ukraine's defense against Russia's war.

According to the U.K. government, the tankers have secretly transported $24 billion worth of oil since the start of 2024.

"I urge our European allies, who have talked a big game, to follow us if we implement these secondary tariffs," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.

Trump's ultimatum to Russia, Ukraine's largest government reshuffle, and allegations launched against prominent anti-corruption activist that many claim are politically motivated.

Ukraine needs $6 billion to bridge its weapons production shortfall in 2025, Defense Minister Denis Shmyhal told allies during a virtual Ramstein meeting on July 21, according to Radio Svoboda (Ukrainian service of RFE/RL).

"It is clear to all that truly effective talks can only take place at the level of national leaders," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Speaking during the 29th Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said he reached the agreement with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a recent trip to Washington.

"It is a great honor and at the same time an extraordinary responsibility for me to lead the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a difficult time for our country," Hennadii Shapovalov said in a statement.

"In the morning, after briefings from military and interior officials, I met with the foreign minister and our (Presidential) Office team. We finalized the long process of selecting ambassadorial candidates," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram. 

The body of 61-year-old Ihor Hrushevskyi, a former senior officer in Ukraine's Department for Combating Organized Crime, was discovered floating face down in the swimming pool of the Cala Alta residential complex in Villajoyosa.

"This is the largest such plant in the world and the most secret," Timur Shagivaliev, CEO of the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, said. 

At least one person was killed and eight were injured as repeated explosions rocked Kyiv, and several fires broke out across Ukraine's capital during a mass Russian drone and missile attack overnight on July 21.

The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia launched 450 aerial threats overnight, including 426 Shahed drones and various types of missiles, including Kinzhal, Kalibr, and Kh-101. 

Amid reported Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia, a fire broke out at a train station in the village of Kamenolomni in Rostov Oblast overnight July 21 as Moscow faced drones for the fifth straight night, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported.

As London pushes a "50-day drive" to support Ukraine, the U.K. and Germany are set to pledge new air defense systems to Kyiv, media reported on July 20.

In the past, Trump has directly profited from overcharging agencies to protect him at his personal properties.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A provision within President Donald Trump's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” which he signed into law earlier this month, will allocate an extra $300 million for protecting Mar-a-Lago and other properties owned by Trump — money that Trump could partially profit from, if history is any indicator. 

The bill provides that funding in the form of reimbursements to local and state law enforcement whenever Trump travels to his properties, such as Mar-a-Lago in Florida or his Bedminster estate in New Jersey, for example. 

Those local agencies have been reimbursed in the past, but not nearly by the extraordinary amount the new law allocates. In fiscal year 2022, for example, $3 million was given to local law enforcement to reimburse expenses they incurred for protecting former President Joe Biden.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The funds are being provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Notably, FEMA funds are now being regulated by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, who implemented new “cost-saving” rules requiring that she sign off on any expenditure exceeding $100,000 before it could be allocated. Such rules may have led to a slower response time from the agency during the deadly flooding in Texas earlier this month.

Security for the president, in the form of Secret Service protection, is already funded at a high level. Last year's budget, for example, prioritized $1.2 billion toward the “Protective Operations” division within the agency, which is responsible for keeping presidents, vice presidents and their families protected. That expenditure is close to half the entire Secret Service's budget, and 44 percent of the agency's 8,300 employees work for the division.

Trump has personally profited from Secret Service protection in the past. During his first term as president, he charged the agency $1.4 million for use of his properties and facilities, largely because he traveled to his properties nearly 550 times over the course of his first four years in the White House. 

These costs were often “overcharges,” an assessment from the nonprofit watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) found. 

The Secret Service expenditures amounted to the agency “literally paying Donald Trump for the right to protect him and his family,” CREW staffers wrote in a post on their website about the spending, adding: 

Of course presidents and their families need to be protected. But Trump is ostensibly a billionaire … and these were not personal residences.

Trump basically “line[d] his pockets with taxpayer money via his Secret Service protection,” the group went on.

It's possible that the money allocated to local law agencies could also find its way to Trump's pockets, if they are reimbursed for expenses incurred at his properties.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

            (CNN) – A Bangladesh Air Force jet crashed into a college in the capital Dhaka on Monday, killing at least 19 people, according to emergency officials, in the country's deadliest air incident in recent memory.
    


            The crash at Milestone School and College campus, in the Diabari neighborhood of northern Dhaka, injured more than 100 others, according to a spokesperson for the country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus.
    


            At least 83 of those survivors – mostly students – were being treated in hospitals in the capital, some “in critical condition,” the spokesperson added.
    


            The BAF F7 jet hit the campus around 1:18 p.m. local time (3:18 a.m. EST), according to state media BSS News, citing a Fire Service and Civil Defense official. The plane's pilot was among those killed, The Associated Press reported, citing regional officials.
    


            Scores of people rushed towards the crash site, where emergency crews could be seen trying to extinguish the smoking wreckage of the jet.
    


            The government has announced a day of mourning and special prayers, BSS News said.
    


            “I express my deep grief and sorrow over the tragic incident of casualties caused by the crash,” Yunus wrote in a post on X.
    


            “This is a moment of profound pain for the nation. I pray for the speedy recovery of the injured and direct all concerned authorities, including hospitals, to address the situation with the utmost priority,” the interim leader added.
    


            Eyewitnesses, including the parents of students, recalled huge plumes of ash rising over the school – after a banging sound rang out following the deadly crash.
    


            “When I was picking (up) my kids and went to the gate, I realized something came from behind,” Masud Tarik, also a teacher at the school, told Reuters. “I heard an explosion. When I looked back, I only saw fire and smoke.”
    


            Others watched the chaotic aftermath unfold on TV. “I was terrified watching videos,” Rafiqa Taha, a student at the facility, told The Associated Press.
    


            “My God! It's my school,” added the 16-year-old.
    


            Milestone College teaches students from ages 4 to 18, according to its website.

Ruling in university's favor would reverse funding freezes that became cuts as Trump administration escalated fight

US politics live – latest updates

Harvard University appeared in federal court on Monday to make the case that the Trump administration illegally cut $2.6bn from the storied college – a major test of the administration's efforts to reshape higher education institutions by threatening their financial viability.

US district judge Allison Burroughs heard arguments from Harvard and the Department of Justice. The cuts, imposed earlier this year, have halted major research efforts and Harvard argues they are a politically motivated attempt to pressure the school into adopting federal policies on student conduct, admissions, antisemitism and diversity.

A ruling in favor of the university would revive Harvard's sprawling scientific and medical research operation and hundreds of projects that lost federal money.

“This case involves the government's efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard,” the university said in its complaint. “All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: allow the government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution's ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions.”

Monday's hearing will be closely watched by other universities that have seen their research funds axed by the administration, which has suspended or threatened billions in grants and contracts from several institutions. The White House is reportedly close to finalizing a deal with Columbia University – the first institution it targeted for cuts – to restore $400 mn in funding in exchange for the university implementing a series of measures meeting the administration's ideological demands.

Harvard is the first – and so far only – university to sue.

The university has separately sued the administration over its revocation of Harvard's eligibility to host international students. (Trump has also threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, but he has taken no action to that effect so far.)

Burroughs is overseeing both of Harvard's cases against the administration and in June issued an injunction stopping the government from barring foreign Harvard students from entering the country.

Monday's hearing will be the first time the court will hear arguments about the legality of the administration's funding cuts. It is unlikely the judge will issue a decision immediately, and any ruling will probably be appealed.

Harvard's lawsuit accuses Donald Trump's administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university after it rejected a series of demands in an 11 April letter from a federal antisemitism taskforce.

The letter demanded sweeping changes related to campus protests, academics and admissions. For example, the letter told Harvard to audit the viewpoints of students and faculty and admit more students or hire new professors if the campus was found to lack diverse points of view. The letter was meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment on campus.

Alan Garber, Harvard's president, pledged to fight antisemitism but said no government “should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue”.

The same day Harvard rejected the demands, Trump officials moved to freeze $2.2bn in research grants. Linda McMahon, the US education secretary, declared in May that Harvard would no longer be eligible for new grants, and weeks later the administration began canceling contracts with Harvard.

As Harvard fought the funding freeze in court, individual agencies began sending letters announcing that the frozen research grants were being terminated. They cited a clause that allows grants to be scrapped if they no longer align with government policies.

Harvard, which has the nation's largest endowment at $53bn, has moved to self-fund some of its research, but warned it can't absorb the full cost of the federal cuts.

In court filings, the school said the government “fails to explain how the termination of funding for research to treat cancer, support veterans, and improve national security addresses antisemitism”.

The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the April demand letter was sent. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel contracts for policy reasons.

“It is the policy of the United States under the Trump administration not to fund institutions that fail to adequately address antisemitism in their programs,” it said in court documents.

Finally, last month, the Trump administration formally issued a finding that the school tolerated antisemitism – a step that eventually could jeopardize all of Harvard's federal funding, including federal student loans or grants. The penalty is typically referred to as a “death sentence”.

While Harvard's cases against the administration proceeds in court, the university is reportedly also negotiating with the administration for a deal that might end the dispute outs of court.

A former top Ukrainian police official has been found dead under mysterious circumstances in the same Spanish residential complex where a Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine was assassinated last year, Spanish news outlet El Espanol reported on July 20.

The body of 61-year-old Ihor Hrushevskyi, a former senior officer in Ukraine's Department for Combating Organized Crime, was discovered floating face down in the swimming pool of the Cala Alta residential complex in Villajoyosa, a coastal town in Spain's Alicante province, on June 29. 

While initial findings suggest no signs of violence, witnesses noted he was bleeding from one ear, suggesting it might have been a cerebral hemorrhage or stroke. Despite efforts by bystanders and emergency personnel to revive Hrushevskyi, he was declared dead at the scene.

The exact cause of Hrushevskyi's death remains unclear. 

El Espanol reports that Hrushevskyi was a senior official in Ukraine's Interior Ministry and later in the National Police, though he is largely absent from public records. 

Ukrainian legal databases reportedly list him as holding top roles in anti-organized crime units in Cherkasy and Kirovohrad oblasts in the early 1990s. These units were disbanded in 2015 as part of police reforms and replaced by the National Police and the SBU's anti-corruption directorate.

The same residential complex was previously the site of another death — that of Russian pilot Maksim Kuzminov, who defected to Ukraine with a military helicopter in 2023. 

Kuzminov was found shot dead in a garage there in February 2024, with a burned-out car discovered nearby, believed to have been used by his killers. Ukraine's military intelligence confirmed his death on Feb. 19, 2024. 

There was no direct connection confirmed between the two deaths. 

According to El Espanol, Hrushevskyi had recently purchased and begun renovating a unit in the complex. 

Hrushevskyi's age and his recent purchase of the apartment have led some neighbors to believe he may have simply retired to Villajoyosa for its sizable Ukrainian community, the news outlet reported.

According to the U.K. government, the tankers have secretly transported $24 billion worth of oil since the start of 2024.

"I urge our European allies, who have talked a big game, to follow us if we implement these secondary tariffs," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.

Trump's ultimatum to Russia, Ukraine's largest government reshuffle, and allegations launched against prominent anti-corruption activist that many claim are politically motivated.

Ukraine needs $6 billion to bridge its weapons production shortfall in 2025, Defense Minister Denis Shmyhal told allies during a virtual Ramstein meeting on July 21, according to Radio Svoboda (Ukrainian service of RFE/RL).

"It is clear to all that truly effective talks can only take place at the level of national leaders," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Speaking during the 29th Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said he reached the agreement with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a recent trip to Washington.

"It is a great honor and at the same time an extraordinary responsibility for me to lead the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a difficult time for our country," Hennadii Shapovalov said in a statement.

"In the morning, after briefings from military and interior officials, I met with the foreign minister and our (Presidential) Office team. We finalized the long process of selecting ambassadorial candidates," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram. 

The body of 61-year-old Ihor Hrushevskyi, a former senior officer in Ukraine's Department for Combating Organized Crime, was discovered floating face down in the swimming pool of the Cala Alta residential complex in Villajoyosa.

"This is the largest such plant in the world and the most secret," Timur Shagivaliev, CEO of the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, said. 

At least one person was killed and eight were injured as repeated explosions rocked Kyiv, and several fires broke out across Ukraine's capital during a mass Russian drone and missile attack overnight on July 21.

The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia launched 450 aerial threats overnight, including 426 Shahed drones and various types of missiles, including Kinzhal, Kalibr, and Kh-101. 

Amid reported Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia, a fire broke out at a train station in the village of Kamenolomni in Rostov Oblast overnight July 21 as Moscow faced drones for the fifth straight night, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported.

As London pushes a "50-day drive" to support Ukraine, the U.K. and Germany are set to pledge new air defense systems to Kyiv, media reported on July 20.

Russia has showcased what it has described as the "largest and most secret" drone factory in the world, in a propaganda video showing teenagers assembling the Geran-2 drones used to target Ukraine.

The facility at the Alabuga industrial park near Kazan in the Tatarstan region is one of Russia's main production hubs, allowing it to produce a reported 5,200 Shahed-type strike drones and decoy models a month as of May.

"This is the largest such plant in the world and the most secret," Timur Shagivaliev, CEO of the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, told Zvezda, the Russian Defense Ministry's television channel.

"At one time, the plan was to produce several thousand (Geran drones) — now we are producing nine times more than planned."

Russian state media released footage showing teenagers assembling drones inside the facility, highlighting a recruitment program targeting students as young as 15 from local technical colleges.

"Everywhere you look, there's young people working here," a voice-over in the Zvezda video says, as dozens of teenagers are seen making drone components and working at computer stations on a brightly lit factory floor.

The Yelabuga plant was previously targeted by Ukrainian drones multiple times. The latest attack allegedly happened on June 15.

The Yelabuga plant, launched in 2023, is equipped with metal foundries, blacksmith shops, and in-house assembly lines, according to Zvezda footage. It reportedly uses parts shipped from Iran via the Caspian Sea and Kama River. A Russian military think tank claimed drone output jumped 16.9% in May.

The Geran-2 drone, with a 3.5-meter length and 50-kg warhead, has a range of 1,800 kilometers and can reach speeds of 300 km/h. Each unit is estimated to cost as little as $35,000–$49,000 — a fraction of the multimillion-dollar cost of Western air defense interceptors like the U.S.-made Patriot missile.

Reports from multiple sources, including Interpol, allege the Alabuga Special Economic Zone has also recruited African women under false pretenses through a work-study scheme. An investigation into potential human trafficking was opened in April, following testimony and reports from affected individuals.

The Geran-2, Russia's version of Iran's Shahed-136, has become crucial part of nightly attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Russia launched over 5,300 Shahed drones in June alone. Ukraine suffered the largest single-day drone and missile strike on July 9, with 741 aerial weapons launched.

Germany's Maj. Gen. Christian Freuding, head of Ukraine policy at the German Defense Ministry, warned on July 19 that Russia aims to eventually launch 2,000 drones a night. In a Bundeswehr podcast, Freuding said Ukraine could counter such barrages only by striking drone production sites and lowering interception costs.

Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service reported in June that Russia plans to manufacture 30,000 long-range drones and 2 million FPV (first-person-view) drones in 2025, signaling a massive expansion of drone warfare.

Ukraine has also increased its domestic drone production in response. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv has the capacity to produce up to 8 million drones annually, though it lacks the foreign funding to scale fully. 

Former Defense Minister Rustem Umerov had earlier estimated a 4 million drone yearly capacity.

Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial assaults on Ukraine in recent months, only hours before the U.K. and Germany chaired a meeting to discuss U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for NATO allies to provide Ukraine with weapons.

The attack killed two people and wounded 15, including a 12-year-old, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

In Kyiv's Shevchenkivskyi district, a drone struck the entrance to a subway station where people had taken cover. Videos posted on social media showed the station platform engulfed by smoke, with dozens of people inside. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said the station had to be ventilated in what he called an “enhanced mode.”

The heaviest strikes hit Kyiv's Darnytskyi district, where a kindergarten, supermarket and warehouse facilities caught fire.

Russia launched a new barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine in an overnight attack on Monday, killing at least one person and causing multiple fires in the capital Kyiv, city officials said. The attack damaged the entrance to a metro station, a woman that sheltered in that station said.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot arrived in Kyiv on Monday and visited some of the damage.

The hours-long drone and missile assault on Kyiv overnight into Monday underscored the urgency of Ukraine's need for further Western military aid, especially in air defence, a week after Trump said deliveries would arrive in Ukraine within days.

The virtual meeting of high-level military officials Monday was led by British Defence Secretary John Healey and his German counterpart Boris Pistorius. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and NATO leader Mark Rutte, as well as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, attended the meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group.

Moscow has intensified its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate as Russian drone production expands.

Ukraine's new Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal urged allies to speed up deliveries of American air defence systems under the plan put forward by Trump.

“I request the U.S. to make these weapons available for purchase, and our European partners to extend all the needed financing for their procurement,” Shmyhal, who until recently served as prime minister, said as the meeting began.

Trump's arms plan, announced a week ago, involves European nations sending American weapons, including Patriot air defence missile systems, to Ukraine via NATO – either from existing stockpiles or buying and donating new ones.

In an shift of tone toward Russia, Trump last week gave Moscow a 50-day deadline to agree to a ceasefire or face tougher sanctions.

U.S.-Russia ties in ‘deplorable state,' but Trump sanctions threat has not ended talks, Kremlin says

At Monday's meeting, Healey was expected to urge Ukraine's Western partners to launch a “50-day drive” to get Kyiv the weapons it needs to fight Russia's bigger army and force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, the U.K. government said in a statement.

NATO's Grynkewich told The Associated Press on Thursday that “preparations are underway” for weapons transfers to Ukraine while U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said he couldn't give a time frame.

Germany has said it offered to finance two new Patriot systems for Ukraine and raised the possibility of supplying systems it already owns and having them replaced by the U.S.

But delivery could take time, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested, because “they have to be transported, they have to be set up; that is not a question of hours, it is a question of days, perhaps weeks.”

Other Patriot systems could come thanks to Switzerland, whose defence ministry said Thursday it was informed by the U.S. Defense Department that it will “reprioritize the delivery” of five previously ordered systems to support Ukraine.

While Ukraine waits for Patriots, a senior NATO official said the alliance is still co-ordinating the delivery of other military aid – such as ammunition and artillery rounds – which includes aid from the U.S. that was briefly paused. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

Zelensky said Saturday that his officials have proposed a new round of peace talks this week. Russian state media on Sunday reported that no date has yet been set for the negotiations, but said that Istanbul would likely remain the host city. The Kremlin spokesman said Sunday that Russia is open to peace with Ukraine, but achieving its goals remains a priority.

The overnight Russian barrage of Kyiv began shortly after midnight and continued until around 6 a.m. Residents of the capital were kept awake by machine-gun fire, buzzing drone engines and multiple loud explosions.

It was the first major attack on Kyiv since Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, arrived in the city last Monday. Russia halted strikes on Kyiv during his visit.

Russia's Ministry of Defence said its attack used drones and Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. It said that the barrage successfully targeted airfield infrastructure and Ukraine's military-industrial complex.

Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 426 Shahed and decoy drones overnight Monday, as well as 24 missiles of various types. It said 200 drones were intercepted with 203 more jammed or lost from radars.

Ukraine, meanwhile, continued to deploy its domestically produced long-range drones. Russia's Ministry of Defence said that its forces shot down 74 Ukrainian drones overnight, with almost a third of them destroyed close to the Russian capital. Twenty-three drones were shot down in the Moscow region, the ministry said, 15 of which were intercepted over the city itself.

Japan's Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the party's founding in 1955, were pushed into minority status in both houses of parliament in an election Sunday, leaving the future of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in doubt.

According to public broadcaster NHK, the LDP and its allies in the Komeito party will likely control 121 seats in the upper house of the Japanese Diet, four short of a majority, a repeat of lower house elections last year which also saw the coalition lose absolute control of the chamber. 

There were renewed calls for Mr. Ishiba's resignation as votes were tallied. Describing the results as a “harsh judgment,” he nevertheless vowed Monday to stay on as prime minister, citing the importance of continuity amid tense trade talks with the United States. This may not be up to him, however. 

“It is difficult to see how an LDP Leader who has led the party to two consecutive national election defeats, lost control of both houses, and failed to fend off new challenges on the right will continue to enjoy the confidence of his own party,” political analyst Tobias Harris, founder of Japan Foresight, wrote in a newsletter Monday. 

The LDP avoided outright defeat only thanks to the fractured nature of the opposition, which has formed a government just twice in Japan's post-World War II history. Established parties on the left failed to make major gains: the Constitutional Democratic Party, a successor to the Democratic Party that governed Japan from 2009-12, did not add any seats, while the Communist Party saw its total slip from 11 to seven, according to NHK. 

The centrist Democratic Party For the People, which has supported the ruling coalition in the lower house, emerged as a major winner of Sunday's election, as did the far-right Sanseito, which took 14 seats.

“Japanese voters wanted a conservative party to win the election – just not necessarily the LDP,” Michael MacArthur Bosack, special adviser for government relations at the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, wrote Monday. 

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba vowed to remain in office on Monday after his ruling coalition suffered a bruising defeat in upper house elections, prompting some of his own party to deliberate his future as the opposition weighed a no-confidence motion.

The previously fringe Sanseito – known for pushing conspiracy theories about vaccines and global elites during the COVID-19 pandemic – campaigned on an anti-immigration, “Japanese First” message, capitalizing on growing concerns around tourism and an increase in foreign-born workers at a time when the Japanese economy is struggling and the yen is weak. 

Speaking to Japanese TV after the election, Sanseito Leader Sohei Kamiya said his party has been mischaracterized, claiming “the phrase ‘Japanese First' was meant to express rebuilding Japanese people's livelihoods by resisting globalism.” 

“I am not saying that we should completely ban foreigners or that every foreigner should get out of Japan,” he added. 

Mr. Kamiya said the party has been criticized as “xenophobic and discriminatory,” but the public has come “to understand that the media was wrong and Sanseito was right.” 

Unlike in recent elections in Canada and Australia, where conservative parties suffered as a result of being seen as too close or similar to U.S. President Donald Trump, Mr. Kamiya revelled in the comparison and had already pushed the government to the right on immigration even before his victory Sunday. 

Other fringe conservative parties also added to their seat count, as did the left-wing Reiwa Shinsengumi, which has presented itself as an alternative to the staid CDP and the Communists, who have struggled to break through with mainstream liberal Japan in part due to the party's strict pacifism at a time when more and more Japanese support rearmament. 

Resisting calls to resign Monday, Mr. Ishiba said he has a “responsibility to the nation” to deal with the pressing issues facing Japan, not least trade negotiations with Mr. Trump, which have proven far tougher than Tokyo expected and increasingly left the country out in the cold with one of its previously most reliable allies. 

‘Mutually beneficial' trade deal with Japan still possible, U.S. Treasury Secretary says

He said the most important thing for the country at this time is “political stability,” adding he will seek to speak to Mr. Trump “at the earliest date possible to seek a solution on trade.” 

Some members of the DPFP, whose support will be key for the ruling coalition to pass legislation, suggested they may not back the LDP if Mr. Ishiba stays in power, however. 

If he is removed, a leadership fight could prove bruising for the LDP, which has been racked by infighting and scandal since the resignation and subsequent death of former prime minister Shinzo Abe. 

When Mr. Ishiba won the leadership in 2024, he was the fourth person to hold that job in as many years. In that race, he narrowly defeated a candidate from the party's hard-right, Sanae Takaichi, who would have been Japan's first female prime minister and is still widely seen as his most likely successor.

            Police in northwestern Germany on Sunday said that several people were injured when a car veered off a road, hit a 7-year-old boy on a trampoline and went flying into a barn roof on its side.
    


            Police said that the car first collided with a parked vehicle in the town of Bohmte, broke through a hedge and drove into a garden where it hit the boy.
    


            The car then went over uneven ground and it was apparently catapulted into the air and ended up crashing into the roof of a neighboring barn about 3 meters (10 feet) off the ground.
    


            The boy was seriously injured, the police statement said.
    


            The driver was an unidentified 42-year-old man, and his wife was also seriously injured.
    


             Their two sons, ages 11 and 12, and a 13-year-old passenger were also on board, who like the driver emerged with minor injuries.
    


            Dozens of firefighters, as well as a dozen ambulances and two rescue helicopters were among the emergency services deployed in response.
    


            Images from the scene showed rescuers cutting through the roof, and wreckage of a playground that the car ran through.
    


            The car had to be removed from the roof with a crane and was carted away by police.
    


            An investigation was underway.

Jake Tapper, a CNN anchor and veteran political journalist, says that he wishes he had been more aggressive in trying to find out what was going on behind the scenes with then-president Joe Biden.Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images

A year ago Monday, Joe Biden ended his re-election bid and endorsed Kamala Harris to take his place atop the Democratic presidential ticket. The move followed weeks of mounting pressure from party grandees after Mr. Biden's disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump raised questions about the octogenarian's cognitive decline.

In the book Original Sin, released this past spring, authors Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson revealed that the moment was only the culmination of worsening mental acuity during the latter half of Mr. Biden's presidency. White House advisers, they reported, engaged in a “cover-up” to hide his troubles from voters.

Speaking with The Globe and Mail, Mr. Tapper, a CNN anchor and veteran political journalist, reflected on how such a situation could happen in the world's most scrutinized political office, the effect of Mr. Biden's decline on his governance, and the criticism the Washington press corps has taken from both sides in the aftermath.

He also delivered one piece of good news for Canadians: In his view, Westminster systems such as Canada's – with their traditions of Question Period and caucus politics – would not allow a situation such as Mr. Biden's to occur.

Book Review: Original Sin details Biden's declining health and a cover-up by closest advisers

On criticisms of the media, and whether reporters failed to push hard enough to uncover evidence of Mr. Biden's cognitive problems:

Knowing then what I know now, I wish I had been more aggressive in trying to find out what was going on behind the scenes. It's difficult to report on that if sources won't communicate it, and that was one of the problems that people in the news media had, that people weren't talking. The Biden people made the argument that if you're hurting Biden, you're helping Trump. So people kept their mouths shut, Democrats kept their mouths shut.

On whether journalists are now failing to report on potential problems with Mr. Trump's mental acuity:

I agree that there are plenty of people asking questions about President Trump. And I don't think it's true that the media didn't cover that. It's less an issue of people thinking that President Trump has some sort of cognitive decline, it's more people questioning whether or not he has some sort of personality disorder. I certainly think that that has been covered thoroughly.

On the moment he realized something serious might be going on with Mr. Biden – February of 2024, when special counsel Robert Hur, in his investigation of the then-president's handling of classified documents, revealed that Mr. Biden had become confused about key dates in his life while Mr. Hur was interviewing him:

I've been covering Biden since 2001, so obviously I have seen him age quite a bit. There were moments throughout the 2020 campaign when it was obvious that he was aging. But I would distinguish between aging and having cognitive issues, because they are not the same thing. This was a guy who, already in his prime, was prone to long, rambling stories, and gaffes, could be short-tempered.

The Hur report was a very significant moment. He was providing the very first unfettered view of what Biden was like behind the scenes. And it was disturbing.

Even having read that, and the transcript of the interviews, I was still stunned by the debate. The debate was the real moment that I thought to myself, “Okay, something is really, seriously going wrong behind the scenes here, and they have been lying to us and covering it up.”

On how Mr. Biden's decline affected his governing:

You have Senator Mark Warner talking to President Biden in October of 2023 about the release of detainees from [Guantanamo Bay], and Warner is concerned that Biden doesn't seem to really have a grasp on what they are talking about. In June, 2024, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado goes to an immigration event where Biden seems to be struggling and, afterwards, comes to the conclusion that Biden's issues are one of the reasons why immigration policy in the country is such a mess.

We have cabinet secretaries in our book saying that Biden could not be relied upon to handle the 2 a.m. phone call for a national-security emergency. And thank God one never happened. But what if one had? What would have happened? It's terrifying.

Robyn Urback: Joe Biden's personal tragedy is also America's betrayal

On how a situation like this can occur, how it could be avoided, and the Canadian context:

It's still going on, just at a much lower level. There are more members of Congress 70 and above than ever before in this nation's history, and there are questions about the ability of some of them to do the job. But still, because it's an uncomfortable conversation to have, it's considered rude for reporters, or anyone, to bring up.

Presidents are very cut off from the American people. Bill Clinton once referred to the White House as the crown jewel of the American prison system. And then a lot of politicians surround themselves with yes-men and yes-women and people who are not there to tell you ugly truths but to tell you how to get through the day.

One of the problems we have is that political parties have never been weaker. And we have an increasingly weak legislative branch, so we can't rely on them either. So, really, it comes down to voters and reporters. Voters need to be aggressive in rewarding politicians who tell the truth, and reporters need to continue to remember that we're not here to be friends with politicians. We're not here to win accolades from partisans on social media. We're here to ask tough questions.

This could not ever happen in Canada, because the party wouldn't let it happen. Whoever is next in line behind the prime minister would rally the other members of the party and say, “We can't do this any more, this is crazy, let's figure something out.”

MOSCOW, July 21. /TASS/. Air defense systems intercepted 74 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) overnight, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

The fall of drone debris on an infrastructure facility at the Kamenolomny station in the Rostov Region has caused delays for 26 passenger trains.

TASS has compiled key facts about the aftermath of the drone strike.

Overnight, from 11:20 p.m. Moscow time (8:20 p.m. GMT — TASS) on July 20 to 7 a.m. Moscow time on July 21, air defense systems on duty intercepted and eliminated 74 Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles.

According to the ministry, air defense forces downed 23 drones over the Moscow Region, including 15 headed toward the capital. Fourteen UAVs were intercepted over the Kursk Region, 12 over the Rostov Region, 10 each over the Bryansk and Kaluga regions, four over the Tula Region, and one over the Lipetsk Region.

The fall of drone debris on an infrastructure facility at the Kamenolomny station in the Rostov Region triggered a fire.

At least 26 passenger trains have been delayed, the North Caucasus Railway reported in a Telegram post.

Traffic through the Kamenolomny station is proceeding at reduced speed. An emergency response team is on site to manage the aftermath.

Acting Rostov Region Governor Yury Slusar also stated on Telegram that a flower shop caught fire in the village of Kamenolomny, Oktyabrsky Rural District, which was later extinguished.

According to Slusar, in the village of Rakovo, Krasnosulinsky District, drone fragments damaged a private home, a summer kitchen, and two cars. Preliminary reports indicate no casualties.

Temporary restrictions on arrivals and departures were imposed at Moscow's airports: Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky.

These measures have since been lifted.

Henry Kissinger once compared himself to the lone cowboy who rode into town to sort out the bad guys. But the U.S. secretary of state, who also served as national security adviser, knew different when it came to dealing with major powers. His hero was the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich, who somehow brought together the unlikely combination of Austria, the United Kingdom, Prussia, Russia, and a number of even smaller allies and their incompatible leaders into the alliance that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. As Kissinger understood, even lone rangers need friends.

It is an insight that appears to be lost on U.S. President Donald Trump. Since returning to office in January, Trump has called the United States' closest allies cheaters and freeloaders. Japan and other Asian trading partners, he insists, are “very spoiled”; immediate North American neighbors stand accused of exporting drugs and criminals. He freely and publicly labels the leaders of some of the United States' most important democratic partners as has-beens, weak, or dishonest, while heaping praise on autocrats he finds easier to deal with, such as Hungarian President Viktor Orban (“a very great leader”), Salvadoran strongman Nayib Bukele (“a great friend”), North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un (“a smart guy”), and—at least until very recently—Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he has called “a genius” and “very savvy” in attacking Ukraine. In what would have been unthinkable in previous administrations, including Trump's first, the United States in February even sided against its own democratic allies and with Russia and other authoritarian states, such as North Korea and Belarus, in voting against a UN resolution that condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine and upheld the latter's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Perhaps most baffling, at a time when Washington is trying to contain China and shore up U.S. defenses in the Indo-Pacific, the administration is preparing punitive tariffs on South Korea and Japan, the United States' closest Asian allies, as well as on a sweeping list of European partners it is trying to keep away from Beijing. U.S. allies around the world are also rattled by the public musings of Trump and members of his cabinet that the so-called nuclear umbrella under which the American nuclear deterrent was a guarantee for their defense is no longer a sure thing. Such is now the level of doubt that in July, France and the United Kingdom announced a new agreement to begin providing extended nuclear deterrence in Europe for themselves, and allies such as South Korea, Poland, and even Japan have begun to contemplate acquiring their own nuclear weapons.

The past offers plenty of examples of world powers falling out with erstwhile alliance partners or seeking new ones. But it's hard to think of a case in which the leader of a major alliance has so casually and brutally cast aside allies that, for the most part, have been dependable and have accepted its writ. If the United States wants Canadian or Greenlandic resources, those have always been available. Threatening annexation is counterproductive, stirring up anti-Americanism as it has already done. Washington's NATO allies, it is true, have not been spending enough on defense but that is partly because the United States has insisted for decades on having the dominant role. And when pressed, as at the most recent NATO summit in June, members of the transatlantic alliance have increased their defense budgets, or pledged to do so, to levels that could not have been imagined only a few years ago.

It is difficult to find a plausible explanation for the policies of the second Trump administration. If the president is impatient with existing alliances, he has offered few alternatives beyond an apparent attachment to the old concept of spheres of influence, in which a handful of powers dominate their immediate neighbors, and multilateral organizations, if they survive at all, have little power or authority. Such a world offers greater threats in the future to the United States as the other spheres—presumably including a Chinese-dominated Asia and perhaps a Russian zone in eastern Europe and Central Asia—jostle against it and smaller powers within each sphere either accept their fate often resentfully or look for new hegemons. 

By trashing alliances that have served it well, the United States risks a general breakdown of stability and order that will, in the long run, prove highly costly, whether in military expenditure or unending trade wars, as each great power seeks advantage where their zones of interest meet. The striking lack of historical precedents for such behavior does not suggest a clever Machiavellian policy to enhance American power; rather, it shows a United States acting against its own interests in bewildering fashion, undermining one of the key sources of that power. And this comes at a time when American global leadership and economic and technological dominance are already under growing pressure from China and other major rivals.

For centuries, the value of alliances, even among highly disparate countries, has been accepted as a key element of international relations. As far back as history has been recorded, groups, whether clans or nations, have come together for protection against common enemies. In the fifth century BC, the Delian League of Greek city-states defeated the Persian Empire; in 1815, the Grand Alliance of Austria, the United Kingdom, Prussia, and Russia joined forces to vanquish Napoleon's France. Common cause can bring together the most unlikely partners, such as Catholic France and the Muslim Ottoman Empire, which joined forces in the sixteenth century and remained allies for more than two centuries, or Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union with the United Kingdom and the United States, which together defeated Germany and Japan and the other Axis powers in World War II.

Before the world became so interconnected and communication was more difficult, geography allowed some states to live without allies. Japan was able to remain in lonely isolation for two and a half centuries until it was confronted with a different and more expansive world when the U.S. naval officer Commodore Matthew Perry came calling in 1853. The United States, protected as it once was by two oceans and with no powerful enemies along its land borders, prided itself for much of its history on avoiding alliances. Even when it belatedly entered World War I on the Allied side, President Woodrow Wilson insisted that the United States was an “associated power” rather than an ally. Only after 1945 did it abandon this suspicion of alliances. Facing a hostile Soviet Union and communist China, the Soviets' then close partner, it entered peacetime defensive alliances, foremost among them NATO, for the first time in its history. As we see today, the isolationist strand in American foreign policy never entirely went away.



As the Truman administration learned 80 years ago, even powerful states need allies, partly for reasons of prestige but also because great power has its limits and is costly to maintain. By the late nineteenth century, the British Empire, the biggest the world had ever seen, was experiencing what the historian Paul Kennedy called “imperial overstretch” as it confronted both old rivals, such as France and Russia, and newer ones such as Germany, Japan, and the United States. The British economy was still powerful and its navy ruled the oceans, but others were catching up. The British Treasury and the British taxpayer grumbled at the expense of maintaining dominance.

How widely the United Kingdom had come to be resented was made clear when it struggled to crush the two tiny Afrikaner republics (the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State) in the South African War of 1899–1902. The early Afrikaner victories not only showed the inadequacies of the British Army but were generally welcomed around the world. The brutal treatment of Afrikaner civilians further undermined the reputation of the British Empire. At the Paris Exposition in 1900, admiring crowds piled flowers at the Transvaal Pavilion. The realization of how much they were loathed shocked the British into seeing that even they needed friends. In short order, the British government reached understandings with its rivals France, Japan, and Russia, which lessened the chance of conflict with each and encouraged cooperation, and so mitigated the overstretch. The United Kingdom, in the eyes of its contemporaries, remained the world's dominant power, arguably until the middle of World War II.

As the British experience demonstrates, global power cannot be measured in military resources alone. It is relatively easy to count guns, ships, aircraft, economic output, or scientific and technological strengths, but it is not so easy to gauge competencies, organizational capacity, effective government, or morale. Russia looked strong before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and for China, Iran, and North Korea, a desirable ally. Today, after three and a half years of unsuccessful war and heavy losses, Russia may be more of a liability. A state has to have credibility in the eyes of others, whether allies or enemies or its own people. When Soviet Russia in the 1980s and then the United States in the first decades of this century failed in Afghanistan in spite of their overwhelming military advantage, those failures dismayed their own allies, pushed away the uncommitted, and shook the faith of their own peoples in their governments while encouraging potential enemies. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, which was made possible by Russia's military defeats, should have warned the Soviet regime itself of the consequences of failure—and should be a warning to Putin today.

Nor is power a constant. Despite being on the winning side in both world wars, the United Kingdom found its resources depleted and its empire melting away. Is the United States as powerful as it once was? It has had failures abroad, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, is increasingly divided at home, and has an exploding national debt and waning investment in crucial infrastructure. And in an age of increasingly fast and long-range missiles, geography no longer provides the barrier to adversaries that it once did. All the more reason to nurture alliances with sympathetic powers rather than spurn them. Canada has never been a threat to the United States, except in hockey, and Canadians have long seen Americans as their close relatives. The border between the two countries is the longest undefended one in the world. The two economies are closely intertwined. 

Yet what Trump has done with his talk of the 51st state, his imposition of punitive tariffs, and his threats that the United States will not defend Canada under the proposed Golden Dome missile defense system unless it pays up (and he keeps raising the putative bill), has enraged a normally mild-mannered people. In Ottawa, the mood is one of shock and disbelief. What had seemed the unquestionable bases of Canadian foreign policy are melting like the glaciers in Greenland. What is being destroyed will not be easily mended, certainly not for a generation. And for what?

Like many other human relationships, alliances are hard work: their management requires patience, forbearance, skill, and, like a garden, repeated tending. The stakes are often high, and the character of the leaders and diplomats involved can be critical. Diplomacy is not about going to cocktail parties, although socializing is part of it. Rather, it is gaining insight into other nations and their leaders and learning how to negotiate with them. Publicly chastising allies on their supposed faults, as Vice President JD Vance did with the Europeans at the Munich Security Conference in February, barking out orders and insults on social media, as the president does almost daily, or publicly releasing letters to other heads of state before they have been delivered to the recipients, only stores up resentments and makes future personal relations more difficult.

If Kissinger had not been able to establish a rapport of mutual respect with his Chinese counterpart, Zhou Enlai, the opening of relations between the United States and China during the Nixon administration might have been delayed for years. The case of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt is perhaps even more telling. From the time that war broke out in Europe in 1939, Churchill worked on, as he put it, wooing Roosevelt like a suitor. He knew that, to prevail, the United Kingdom needed American resources, such as guns and money, and eventually, he fervently hoped, American forces. And for his part, Roosevelt did not want the British to fail. Although he was at first constrained by the American public, which resisted entering the war, he stretched the powers of the presidency to provide as much assistance as he could.

As World War II unfolded, the two leaders traveled thousands of miles by ship and plane to meet each other and Stalin, often at risk to their health and their lives. Without the strong personal relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt, the irritations and cross-purposes that exist in any alliance would have greatly hampered joint strategic planning and vital U.S. military aid under the Lend-Lease Act. The partnership between their two countries was amplified and strengthened by the thousands of experts, administrators, publicists, intellectuals, and serving military who learned, not always easily, to work with one another. 



Consider the deep and rare friendship that John Dill, the United Kingdom's senior military representative in Washington, established with the reserved George Marshall, chief of staff of the U.S. Army and Roosevelt's most important military adviser. Together, the two generals were able to reconcile what were often deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions among their colleagues and between their political masters. Although Churchill and his successors exaggerated just how special the postwar “special relationship” was, it served both the United States and the United Kingdom well from the Berlin airlift at the start of the Cold War to the fall of the Berlin Wall at its end.

Alliances are also unlikely to last beyond their immediate purpose. Churchill and Roosevelt were far less successful in their effort to build a more lasting friendship with Stalin and his Soviet Union. The gulf between the democracies and the Soviet dictatorship was too great: Soviet memories of Allied intervention against the Bolsheviks at the end of World War I, the strained relations of the interwar years, and the deep suspicions, partly born out of Russian history and partly out of Marxist assumptions about the coming final battle between capitalism and socialism, made ordinary relations almost impossible. The need to defeat Nazi Germany and Japan's military dictatorship was the main glue that held the Grand Alliance together, and when that vanished, so did the relationship. That had happened repeatedly throughout history, whether in the collapse of the Delian League once Persia had been defeated or the Balkan States waging war on one another in 1913 once they had together defeated the Ottoman Empire.

While they are impossible to measure, emotions such as liking or hatred, admiration or contempt—the quotidian stuff of human relations—play a crucial part in making and unmaking alliances. Personal friendships and mutual respect and trust are the oil in the complicated machinery that helps them last. On repeated occasions since 1945, British and American leaders—Harold Macmillan and John F. Kennedy, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Tony Blair among them—have had good relations that have helped reinforce the partnership between their countries. In the absence of such chemistry, or at least some measure of trust between leaders, however, relations can deteriorate surprisingly quickly, as the world is witnessing again today._Alexander I of Russia chafed under Napoleon's patronage and gradually drifted toward his enemies. Mao Zedong and his colleagues increasingly resented Soviet assumptions of superiority and leadership of the world communist movement, while Stalin's successor Nikita Khrushchev found the Chinese devious and untrustworthy—contributing to the very public and bitter Sino-Soviet split after 1962.

Since 1945, dozens of countries in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East have depended on their security relationships with Washington. This includes the 31 other members of NATO; Asian countries with formal U.S. military alliances, such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea; and those with less formal but far-reaching U.S. military partnerships, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. And then there are those countries around the world such as Chile and Vietnam that have tended to work with the United States on a friendly basis. This impressive variety of countries has welcomed U.S. protection and leadership over the decades since the end of World War II not just because the American superpower was strong but because it represented hope for a better and fairer world.

Yet there is now the real possibility that the Western alliance is joining the list of ones that failed. Trump has always been uncomfortable with the give and take of alliance politics. This may be in part because of his own experience in business where he was usually the unchallenged boss. He ran his companies with small offices, unlike the big corporations with their structures and outside boards. In his show The Apprentice, his notorious line was, “You're fired!”

In his first term, Trump seemed especially uneasy at multilateral meetings where he had to deal with other leaders as equals, such as the G-7 meeting in Canada in 2018 where he arrived late and left early but not before quarreling with the other leaders over their trade policies and tariffs. He further shocked allies when he unilaterally pulled out of important and painstakingly negotiated agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to limit Iran's capacity to develop nuclear weapons (an agreement that bears a distinct resemblance to the one the second Trump administration offered Iran, at least until it was drawn into bombing Iranian nuclear sites in June). Striking a note that became the leitmotif of his second term, he complained, “We're like the piggy bank that everybody's robbing.”



Today, Trump is freer to act on his impulses because those established and respected advisers who stood up to him in his first term have been replaced by courtiers and sycophants. From time to time, Trump still has to deal with other democratic powers or even multilateral organizations, and he has made clear his impatience with them. With few exceptions, the Oval Office has become the stage set for a demonstration of Trump's dominance, and when he makes an appearance at international meetings, he keeps it as brief as possible. And the gratuitous insults—to NATO allies, the European Union, the BRICs, the United Nations, or the World Health Organization—continue to flow from the president. It is hard to make out an overall purpose beyond keeping him the center of attention.

Trump prefers to treat international relations as a series of transactions, holding face-to-face meetings or long phone calls with only one other leader at a time, and seems distinctly more at ease with powerful autocrats than democratic statesmen. If necessary, he will bludgeon both friends and adversaries into submission, assuming they will abandon any opposition if the offer on the table is good enough or if Washington seems to hold the best hand. (“You don't have the cards right now,” he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the now infamous Oval Office dressing down.) 

If only it were so simple. Nations do not always act on what others assume are their best interests. Hitler thought in 1940 that the United Kingdom had little choice but to capitulate just as Putin believed that Ukraine would give up in a matter of days in the face of the Russian invasion. As Roosevelt had come to realize by the time he died in the spring of 1945, leaders can define interests in different ways. Beliefs and cultural and personal differences can matter as much as more objective factors such as demographics or geography. Stalin came out of a very different world and had very different experiences and goals than did the privileged son of an old American family.

In Trump's world, mutual trust and respect, so hard to establish and so easy to destroy, do not matter. Parties will work together if it suits their interests and only until a better offer comes along. Russia sees the advantages of friendship from the United States. European allies will grumble but do what Washington wants or find themselves alone and friendless. China will negotiate on trade, promising for example to buy American agricultural products because it does not want to be shut out of U.S. markets. And if Beijing wants Taiwan, why not let it have it as long as the United States gets something in return? The president seems to assume that current and potential allies see international relations as he does. If you lose one round you may win the next. Yet nations, like individuals, have long memories of past wrongs or defeats, as Trump himself should know.

Trust among individuals or nations is hard to measure, but lasting and productive relations cannot exist without it. During the Cold War, negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States over arms control were tortuous and drawn out because neither side trusted the other. Incidents such as the American pilot Gary Powers's intercepted U-2 flight over the Soviet Union in 1960 or the Soviet shooting down of the Korean airliner in 1983 tended to be read by the other side as evidence of malign intent. By contrast, although there were certainly tensions between the United States and its allies, each generally assumed their counterparts were acting in good faith, and there was a willingness to discuss tricky matters and search for mutually acceptable solutions. That no longer exists today and cannot be easily or quickly rebuilt.



The United States is now experiencing what the United Kingdom did even in the heyday of its empire. Being the world's greatest military power is a heavy burden, and partly as a result, the U.S. debt continues to grow to staggering levels. Ambitious powers, China in particular, are pouring resources into an arms race that gets ever more expensive. And, as has happened many times before, other nations are tempted to abandon the old power for the new or group against it to take advantage of what they see as its decline. If Trump's current hostility to alliances continues and the administration keeps insulting, belittling, and even economically harming its long-standing partners, the United States is going to find the world an increasingly unfriendly place.

Former allies or uncommitted powers may decide, as the Slovak Republic or Serbia have already done, that Putin's Russia is a better bet; others may bypass the United States with new trade arrangements or, as is happening with European nations and Canada, sharing in their own military production, planning, and mutual deterrence, on the assumption that the United States is no longer a dependable ally. In a harbinger of things to come, Canada has just shipped its first container of liquefied natural gas to Asia. The British once called their position in the world “splendid isolation” until they realized the costs were too high. Trump's United States may find that, in the dangerous twenty-first century, those splendors are overrated.

Police in New York state say they have found a nine-year-old Canadian girl who went missing in northeastern New York dead.

A news release from New York State Police says officers from the Warren County Sheriff's office received a call from a man reporting his nine-year-old daughter missing from the area of Exit 22 of I-87 in Lake George, possibly due to an abduction, on Saturday just before 10 p.m.

BEIRUT, July 21. /TASS/. 298 civilians have become victims of the armed clashes that have been ongoing in the province of Al-Suwayda in southern Syria since July 13, while the total number of deaths during the inter-communal conflict amounted to 1,119 people, Sky News Arabia TV channel reported, citing medical sources, which previously put death toll at 940.

According to the TV channel, 427 fighters of the Druze self-defense units were killed. The special forces of the Interior and Defense Ministries sent from Damascus to the southern regions to restore stability lost 354 soldiers, and the pro-government formations of the Arab tribes lost 21 militias. Another 19 members of the internal security forces were killed in Israeli airstrikes.

On July 19, Syrian President for the transitional period Ahmed al-Sharaa introduced a ceasefire in Al-Suwayda in accordance with the settlement plan developed with the participation of international mediators. The planned prisoner exchange on July 20 failed due to renewed clashes in several areas between Bedouins and supporters of radical leader of the Syrian Druze Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri.

Earlier, supporters of Sheikh al-Hijri, who opposes normalization of relations with Damascus, prevented the passage of a government delegation to the province, which was escorting a cargo of humanitarian aid. The Syrian authorities condemned these provocative actions.

Kansas state Senate President Ty Masterson has joined the field of Republicans hoping to wrest the governorship from Democratic control.

Masterson describes himself as "a results-oriented conservative laborer and businessman." 

While Kansas has gone red in every presidential election for more than 50 years, the state currently has a Democratic governor.

KANSAS SECRETARY OF STATE LAUNCHES 2026 GOP GUBERNATORIAL BID FOR SEAT HELD BY 2-TERM DEMOCRAT

Gov. Laura Kelly has held the post since early 2019, but is not eligible to run again in 2026 because she's currently serving her second consecutive term. 

"No person may be elected to more than two successive terms as governor …" the state constitution stipulates.

Masterson's move to jump into the running adds another candidate to the Kansas GOP gubernatorial field that also includes former Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer, Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Kansas Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, and others.

Colyer, a former Kansas lieutenant governor, ascended to the governorship in 2018 because then-Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, departed the role to serve as U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom. 

While serving in the governorship in 2018, Colyer ran for governor, but was just barely edged out in the GOP primary by then-Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who went on to lose the general election later that year to Kelly.

Fox News national correspondent Fox News national correspondent reports on the latest update in the fundraising efforts of Zohran Mamdani and Eric Adams and more on 'America Reports.'

The winner of the New York City Democratic primary for mayor is traditionally considered the overwhelming frontrunner in the general election.

That's because Democrats outnumber Republicans roughly six-to-one in the nation's most populous city.

However, that's not the case this year, one month after democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old Ugandan-born, state assemblyman from Queens, stunned the political world by topping former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates in a come-from-behind primary victory to capture the nomination.

President Donald Trump believes that Cuomo, who last week officially announced he would continue his mayoral bid as an independent candidate, has a solid chance of defeating Mamdani, whom the president has repeatedly claimed is a "communist."

"I would think that he would have a good shot at winning," the president told reporters at the White House last week, a day after Cuomo's announcement.

A handful of polls conducted this month in New York City suggest that Mamdani is the frontrunner, but that he is far from running away with the race. The surveys indicate Mamdani ahead of Cuomo anywhere from around 15 points to as few as three points.

Trailing Mamdani and Cuomo in the surveys are Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled incumbent who announced earlier this year that he would seek re-election as an independent candidate, and Guardian Angels co-founder Curtis Sliwa, who for a second straight election is the Republican mayoral nominee.

Also on the ballot in the general election is Jim Walden, a former federal prosecutor running as an independent.

Walden has proposed that an independent survey be conducted in September to determine which candidate would have the best shot of defeating Mamdani, with the other candidates agreeing to drop out.

Cuomo has embraced the idea, with Adams and Sliwa not signing on board.

Having the former governor, who resigned in 2021 amid multiple scandals, and Adams, who has faced a slew of controversies since winning election as mayor four years ago, both agreeing that such a scenario seems remote, both have urged the other to exit the race.

"We have to put our political ambitions in the backseat to the interests of New Yorkers," Walden said this past weekend in an interview with Fox News' Bryan Llenas.

He charged that the other candidates "right now, they're putting their own political ambitions above New Yorkers."

Since his Democratic Party nomination victory, some of the unions and elected officials that supported Cuomo in the primary are now backing Mamdani.

Mamdani, who was backed by progressive champions Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, surged to a primary victory thanks to an energetic campaign that put a major focus on affordability and New York City's high cost of living.

Mamdani made smart use of social media platforms, including TikTok, as he engaged low-propensity voters. He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) "tuition-free," freezing rents on municipal housing, offering "free childcare" for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores.

Republicans have targeted Mamdani and tried to turn him into the new face of the Democratic Party. They aim to anchor him to vulnerable Democrats across the country running in elections this year and next year.

Republicans have spotlighted recent news items regarding Mamdani that have gone viral. They include a 2020 photo Mamdani posted online that shows him flipping off a statue of Christopher Columbus, stories about comments Mamdani made last December when he said as mayor he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his recent comments in a cable news interview that "I have many critiques of capitalism."

"I don't think that race is over yet. We do have a couple of people running. There are things coming out about him," Trump said last week, as he referred to Mamdani.

The FBI under former President Barack Obama failed to examine fully several thumb drives containing hacked State Department data, including messages linked to Obama, during its 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, according to a newly declassified watchdog report released Monday.

“This document shows an extreme lack of effort and due diligence in the FBI's investigation of former Secretary Clinton's email usage and mishandling of highly classified information,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) told the Washington Examiner.

The thumb drives, supplied by a confidential source, were deemed too sensitive to be reviewed fully at the time due to concerns about the privileged victim data they could contain. But a draft memo from within the FBI recommended analyzing the material to “assess the national security risks” tied to Clinton's private server, a step the bureau ultimately declined to take.

The new details are in a declassified appendix to a 2018 report by former Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. Grassley, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, released the document on Monday after receiving it from Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel.

The revelations have renewed scrutiny of former FBI Director James Comey, whose team limited the scope of the Clinton investigation while aggressively pursuing allegations of collusion by then-candidate Donald Trump and Russia.

“The Comey FBI's negligent approach and perhaps intentional lack of effort in the Clinton investigation is a stark contrast to its full-throated investigation of the Trump-Russia collusion hoax,” Grassley said.

The report shows that the FBI Cyber Division had tried to obtain access to the thumb drives in 2016, but internal objections over privilege concerns blocked the effort. Then-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe also sought to use the drives in the Russia investigation but was similarly denied.

Although the drives were queried at least three times, including once by then-special counsel Robert Mueller's office, there was no comprehensive review of their contents. One search yielded results associated with “clintonemail.com,” but the rest of the details were redacted.

The appendix also highlighted foreign intelligence the FBI encountered during the investigation, including Russian-language documents that alleged political interference by Comey and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The documents, which included claims about Debbie Wasserman Schultz and George Soros-linked operatives, were reviewed and dismissed as unreliable, according to FBI agents cited in the watchdog report.

JAMES COMEY AND JOHN BRENNAN UNDER INVESTIGATION BY DOJ FOR TRUMP-RUSSIA INQUIRY

Comey defended his July 5, 2016, decision to exonerate Clinton publicly before interviewing several key witnesses, citing concerns about internal leaks. His decision, made without notifying Lynch, has remained a point of controversy — particularly because the FBI soon launched its Crossfire Hurricane investigation targeting Trump's 2016 campaign.

The revelation also comes as the FBI, under the current Trump administration, is actively investigating Comey and ex-CIA Director John Brennan over their roles in the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and possible misconduct tied to intelligence handling.

NEW YORK (AP) — New York City's former interim police commissioner has filed a $10 million defamation claim against Mayor Eric Adams for reportedly suggesting he was mentally unfit for the job of top cop.

The filing comes less than a week after the ex-commissioner, Thomas Donlon, sued Adams and his top deputies, accusing them of operating the department as a criminal racket that rewarded unqualified loyalists and punished whistleblowers. Donlon said he was sidelined for trying to clean up the corruption.

After that lawsuit was filed, Adams privately told members of a nonprofit business advocacy group at a meeting that he'd fired Donlon, 71, from his brief stint as commissioner last fall because he was “rapidly deteriorating mentally,” according to attendees. Donlon cited news reports about those comments in his legal claim.

The department's former top spokesperson, Tarik Sheppard, who was also named in Donlon's lawsuit, told reporters that his former boss was “going through some cognitive issues” and believed “there was this conspiracy against him.”

Their comments amounted to a defamatory “public character assassination” intended to “weaponize mental health to silence a whistleblower,” Donlon's attorney, John Scola, said Monday.

Donlon, a former FBI official, was appointed by Adams in September to lead a department reeling from overlapping federal investigations and high-level resignations.




He was replaced by the current commissioner, Jessica Tisch, in November. During his short tenure, federal authorities searched Donlon's home for decades-old documents that he said were unrelated to his work at the department. He has not been publicly accused of wrongdoing in connection with that search.

In his short time as commissioner, Donlon said he uncovered “systemic corruption” by members of the mayor's inner circle, including a scheme to reward unqualified loyalists with lucrative promotions in exchange for political favors. 

In his lawsuit, Donlon accused Sheppard of misappropriating the commissioner's rubber stamp signature to give himself a raise, then threatening to kill Donlon when confronted about it.

Sheppard, who left the department in May, has denied that allegation. Inquiries to City Hall about the defamation claim were not immediately returned. 

In a statement last week, a spokesperson for Adams, Kayla Mamelak Altus, described Donlon's claims as “absurd.”

“These are baseless accusations from a disgruntled former employee who — when given the opportunity to lead the greatest police department in the world — proved himself to be ineffective,” she said. 

The defamation claim adds to a recent spate of litigation brought by police officals against Adams, focusing scrutiny on his leadership as he seeks re-election on a platform emphasizing managerial competence and public safety.

Earlier this month, four high-ranking former NYPD officials brought separate lawsuits accusing Adams and his deputies of allowing rampant corruption and cronyism within the police department.

In response to those suits, a spokesperson for Adams said the administration “holds all city employees — including leadership at the NYPD — to the highest standards.”

A grieving daughter placed her mom's ashes in a bottle so the woman could finally "see" the world. Not long after, a stranger found the bottle — and the daughter's message went viral.

A scientist studying caves found himself in a dangerous situation on Sunday.

While exploring the Abisso Paperino cave in Italy along with others, the explorer became trapped by falling rocks. 

The 62-year-old speleologist was found over 130 feet below the surface with a head injury.

That injury prevented him from escaping the cave, The Associated Press (AP) reported.

In order to help retrieve the man from the cave, rescuers widened the cave using explosive charges at three key junctures carrying him to the surface.

CLEVELAND (AP) — President Donald Trump is threatening to hold up a new stadium deal for Washington's NFL team if it does not restore its old name of the Redskins, which was considered offensive to Native Americans.

Trump also said Sunday that he wants Cleveland's baseball team to revert to its former name, the Indians, saying there was a “big clamoring for this” as well.

The Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians have had their current names since the 2022 seasons and both have said they have no plans to change them back.

Trump said the Washington football team would be “much more valuable” if it restored its old name. 

“I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original ‘Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, ‘Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,” Trump said on his social media site. 

A new stadium deal for the Commanders in D.C. could face resistance from the White House. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports.

His latest interest in changing the name reflects his broader effort to roll back changes that followed a national debate on cultural sensitivity and racial justice. The team announced it would drop the Redskins name and the Indian head logo in 2020 during a broader reckoning with systemic racism and police brutality.




The Commanders and the District of Columbia government announced a deal earlier this year to build a new home for the football team at the site the old RFK Stadium, the place the franchise called home for more than three decades.

Trump's ability to hold up the deal remains to be seen. President Joe Biden signed a bill in January that transferred the land from the federal government to the District of Columbia. 

The provision was part of a short-term spending bill passed by Congress in December. While D.C. residents elect a mayor, a city council and commissioners to run day-to-day operations, Congress maintains control of the city's budget.

Josh Harris, whose group bought the Commanders from former owner Dan Snyder in 2023, said earlier this year the name was here to stay. Not long after taking over, Harris quieted speculation about going back to Redskins, saying that would not happen. The team did not immediately respond to a request for comment following Trump's statement.

The Washington team started in Boston as the Redskins in 1933 before moving to the nation's capital four years later.

The Cleveland Guardians' president of baseball operations, Chris Antonetti, indicated before Sunday's game against the Athletics that there weren't any plans to revisit the name change.

“We understand there are different perspectives on the decision we made a few years ago, but obviously it's a decision we made. We've got the opportunity to build a brand as the Guardians over the last four years and are excited about the future that's in front of us,” he said.

Cleveland announced in December 2020 it would drop Indians. It announced the switch to Guardians in July 2021. In 2018, the team phased out “Chief Wahoo” as its primary logo.

The name changes had their share of supporters and critics as part of the national discussions about logos and names considered racist.

Trump posted Sunday afternoon that “The Owner of the Cleveland Baseball Team, Matt Dolan, who is very political, has lost three Elections in a row because of that ridiculous name change. What he doesn't understand is that if he changed the name back to the Cleveland Indians, he might actually win an Election. Indians are being treated very unfairly. MAKE INDIANS GREAT AGAIN (MIGA)!”

Matt Dolan, the son of the late Larry Dolan, no longer has a role with the Guardians. He ran the team's charity endeavors until 2016.

Matt Dolan was a candidate in the Ohio U.S. Senate elections in 2022 and '24, but lost.

Washington and Cleveland share another thing in common. David Blitzer is a member of Harris' ownership group with the Commanders and holds a minority stake in the Guardians.

Fox News correspondent CB Cotton reports on the latest shark sightings in Rockaway Beach, N.Y., on ‘Fox Report.'

The New Jersey lifeguard impaled by a beach umbrella while working a summer job on the sand is speaking out about the ordeal that almost ended her life. 

Alex Kaus, 18, was working as a lifeguard on Asbury Park's 3rd Avenue Beach last month when the incident occurred.  

"Physically, I'm pretty good," Kaus told NJ.com.

Kaus was setting up the umbrella when a gust of wind blew her off a lifeguard stand, dropping her on the point end of the 1-inch metal pole, NJ.com reported. 

Fellow lifeguards found Kaus lying on the ground with the stake through her left shoulder and sticking out the back of her arm, Asbury Park Fire Chief Kevin Keddy previously told Fox News Digital. First responders cut the umbrella stake off Kaus, making it easier to transport her to the hospital. 

Three weeks after the incident, Kaus is reportedly back at work, according to the local outlet. While she is not yet guarding beachgoers, the college student is reportedly checking for beach badges as she prepares to head back to school at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

"I hope to have at least like two-ish weeks on the stand before I have to go back to school," Kaus said. 

Kaus has no exact return date for when she will return to guarding, as she reportedly is waiting to be medically cleared before taking to the water. 

This summer marks the New Jersey native's second year on the Asbury Park beach, which she chose to apply to after spending time visiting as a child, according to NJ.com. 

"I knew I liked it here and I knew it was a busy beach and wanted some, like action," Kaus said.

With the news of her accident making national headlines, Kaus looked to downplay the attention as she focused on her recovery. 

"I'm definitely one of those people who's just like, ‘It's all good,'" she said. "I'm still processing everything." 

Kaus is especially thankful for her fellow lifeguards and those who rushed to her rescue. 

"I'm really grateful to the people that were there with me," Kaus told NJ.com. "My coworkers, Liz and Noah and Patty and Colin, they were all there." 

Kaus did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

While Kaus is still recovering from her accident, she hopes the level of attention her story created shines some light on the role of lifeguards protecting local beaches up and down the country's coasts. 

"We appreciate it when people appreciate us as lifeguards," she said. "Because we're out here every day, keeping everybody safe."

NEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft has issued an emergency fix to close off a vulnerability in Microsoft's widely-used SharePoint software that hackers have exploited to carry out widespread attacks on businesses and at least some U.S. government agencies.

The company issued an alert to customers Saturday saying it was aware of the zero-day exploit being used to conduct attacks and that it was working to patch the issue. Microsoft updated its guidance Sunday with instructions to fix the problem for SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition. Engineers were still working on a fix for the older SharePoint Server 2016 software.

“Anybody who's got a hosted SharePoint server has got a problem,” said Adam Meyers, senior vice president with CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm. “It's a significant vulnerability.”

Companies and government agencies around the world use SharePoint for internal document management, data organization and collaboration.




A zero-day exploit is a cyberattack that takes advantage of a previously unknown security vulnerability. “Zero-day” refers to the fact that the security engineers have had zero days to develop a fix for the vulnerability.

According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the exploit affecting SharePoint is “a variant of the existing vulnerability CVE-2025-49706 and poses a risk to organizations with on-premise SharePoint servers.”

Security researchers warn that the exploit, reportedly known as “ToolShell,” is a serious one and can allow actors to fully access SharePoint file systems, including services connected to SharePoint, such as Teams and OneDrive.

Google's Threat Intelligence Group warned that the vulnerability may allow bad actors to “bypass future patching.”

Eye Security said in its blog post that it scanned over 8,000 SharePoint servers worldwide and discovered that at least dozens of systems were compromised. The cybersecurity company said the attacks likely began on July 18.

Microsoft said the vulnerability affects only on-site SharePoint servers used within businesses or organizations, and does not affect Microsoft's cloud-based SharePoint Online service. 

But Michael Sikorski, CTO and Head of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, warns that the exploit still leaves many potentially exposed to bad actors. 

“While cloud environments remain unaffected, on-prem SharePoint deployments — particularly within government, schools, health care including hospitals, and large enterprise companies — are at immediate risk.”

The vulnerability targets SharePoint server software so customers of that product will want to immediately follow Microsoft's guidance to patch their on-site systems. 

Although the scope of the attack is still being assessed, CISA warned that the impact could be widespread and recommended that any servers impacted by the exploit should be disconnected from the internet until they are patched.

“We are urging organizations who are running on-prem SharePoint to take action immediately and apply all relevant patches now and as they become available, rotate all cryptographic material, and engage professional incident response. An immediate, band-aid fix would be to unplug your Microsoft SharePoint from the internet until a patch is available,” Sikorski advises.

            A group of 287 scientists and current and former NASA employees has issued a declaration lambasting budget cuts, grant cancellations and a “culture of organizational silence” that they say could pose a risk to astronauts' safety.
    


            The document — titled “The Voyager Declaration” and dedicated to astronauts who lost their lives in tragic spaceflight incidents of the past — is addressed to acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy, a staunch Trump loyalist who abruptly replaced Janet Petro, a longtime NASA employee, in the agency's top role on July 9. The letter has 156 anonymous signatories and 131 public signatures — including at least 55 current employees.
    


            “Major programmatic shifts at NASA must be implemented strategically so that risks are managed carefully,” states the letter to Duffy, a former member of Congress, prosecutor and reality TV personality who also currently serves as Transportation secretary. “Instead, the last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA's workforce.”
    


            The letter raises concerns about suggested changes to NASA's Technical Authority, a system of safety checks and balances at the agency.
    


            Established in the wake of the 2003 Columbia shuttle disaster that killed seven astronauts, the Technical Authority aims to ensure mission safety by allowing NASA employees at all levels of the agency to voice safety concerns to leaders outside their direct chain of command.
    


            “If you have a significant disagreement with a technical decision that's being made, (the system) gives someone an alternate avenue that's not their project manager or program manager” to express that concern, a source at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, told CNN.
    


            Changes to that system “should be made only in the interests of improving safety, not in anticipation of future budget cuts,” the declaration reads.
    


            The source said that they considered looming changes “a really scary prospect, especially for my colleagues who work directly on the human spaceflight side of things.”
    


            The letter comes as the agency is grappling with the impending loss of thousands of employees and broader restructuring.
    


            In a statement, current NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens responded to the Voyager Declaration. “NASA will never compromise on safety. Any reduction — including our current voluntary reduction — will be designed to protect safety-critical roles,” she said.
    


            “Despite the claims posted on a website that advances radical, discriminatory DEI principles, the reality is that President Trump has proposed billions of dollars for NASA science, demonstrating an ongoing commitment to communicating our scientific achievements,” Stevens added in the statement. “To ensure NASA delivers for the American people, we are continually evaluating mission lifecycles, not on sustaining outdated or lower-priority missions.”
    


            The signed letter is the most recent in a string of declarations rebuking proposed cuts and changes at other federal agencies.
    


            Some National Institutes of Health employees led the way in June, publishing a declaration opposing what they called the politicization of research.
    


            Another letter, signed by federal workers at the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month, resulted in about 140 people being placed on administrative leave. At least some of those workers will remain on leave until at least August 1, “pending the Agency's inquiry,” according to internal email correspondence obtained by CNN.
    


            One signatory of the NASA letter who spoke to CNN said they felt that expressing dissent against the Trump administration may pose a risk to their livelihoods, but they believed the stakes were too high to remain silent.
    


            Ella Kaplan, a contractor employed by Global Science and Technology Inc. and the website administrator for the NASA Scientific Visualization Studio, said she decided to publicly attach her name to the Voyager Declaration because “the overall culture at NASA has very much shifted — and it feels a lot less safe for me.”
    


            “That's been felt kind of universally by most minority employees at NASA,” Kaplan said.
    


            While Kaplan said her job has not yet been directly threatened, in her view, “I'm a member of the LGBT community … and I'm probably going to be fired for this at some point, so I might as well do as much community organizing as possible before that point.”
    


            The letter and its signatories implore Duffy to evaluate recent policies they say “have or threaten to waste public resources, compromise human safety, weaken national security, and undermine the core NASA mission.”
    


            The declaration's criticism of changes to NASA's Technical Authority stem from statements made at an agency town hall in June. During that meeting, NASA executives said they planned to attempt to make the Technical Authority more “efficient.”
    


            “We're looking at: ‘How do we do programs and projects more efficiently? And how much should we be spending on oversight?'” said Vanessa Wyche, NASA's acting associate administrator.
    


            Garrett Reisman — a former NASA astronaut and engineer who later served as a SpaceX advisor — told CNN that he believes implementing some changes to the Technical Authority may be welcome. He noted that NASA may have become too risk averse in the wake of the Columbia tragedy, and the current structure may be hampering innovation.
    


            But, Reisman said, any changes to the space agency's safety backstops need to be made with extreme care. And currently, he said, he does not trust that will happen.
    


            “I have very little confidence that it will be done the right way,” Reisman, who signed the declaration, said. “So far, this administration has used a very heavy hand with their attempts to remove bureaucracy — and what they've ended up doing is not making things more efficient, but just eliminating things.”
    


            The signatories who spoke to CNN each expressed opposition to President Donald Trump's directives to shutter Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility — or DEIA — initiatives.
    


            At NASA, leadership complied with Trump's executive order by shuttering a DEIA-focused branch, scrubbing pronouns from email signatures, and removing references to a pledge made during the president's previous term to land a woman and person of color on the moon for the first time. The space agency also shuttered employee groups that lent support to minority workers.
    


            The source who spoke with CNN anonymously said that DEIA policies not only ensure a welcoming work environment — they're also essential to practicing sound science.
    


            “The concept of inclusivity being a pathway to better science is something that has become really entrenched in the overall academic and scientific community in the last decade or so,” the source said, adding that the changes “set an immediate tone for the destruction that was going to come.”
    


            Among the other policies that the letter decries is the Trump administration's call for NASA to shutter some projects that have Congressional backing — a move the signatories say is wasteful and “represents a permanent loss of capability to the United States both in space and on Earth.”
    


            The NASA employee told CNN that leadership has already begun shutting down some facilities that the Trump administration put on the chopping block in its budget proposal, despite the fact that Congress appears poised to continue funding some of them.
    


            “We've also been hearing repeatedly passed down from every level of management: No one is coming to save you; Congress is not coming to save you,” the source said. “But it seems like Congress is moving towards an appropriations that's going to continue to fund our projects at approximately the same level.”
    


            The source noted that they have first-hand knowledge of leadership beginning to decommission a clean room — a facility free of dust and debris where sensitive hardware and science instruments must be prepared for spaceflight — despite the fact that there are ongoing tests happening at the facility.
    


            The Voyager Declaration also criticizes what it refers to as “indiscriminate cuts” planned for the agency.
    


            The White House's proposal to slash NASA's science budget by as much as half has been met with widespread condemnation from stakeholders who say such cuts threaten to cripple US leadership in the field.
    


            Recent agency communication to staff has also noted that at least 3,000 staff members are taking deferred resignation offers, according to an internal memo, the authenticity of which was confirmed to CNN by two sources who had seen the communication.
    


            Broader workforce cuts could also be on the horizon. NASA leadership under Petro also worked on an agency restructuring plan, though the details of that initiative have not yet been made public.
    


            Other Trump-era changes denounced in the Voyager Declaration include directives to cancel contracts and grants that affect private-sector workers across the country and plans to pull the space agency out of some projects with international partners. The White House budget proposal calls for defunding dozens of projects, including the Lunar Gateway space station that the US would have worked on with space agencies in Canada, Europe, Japan and the United Arab Emirates.
    


            The letter and its signatories argue these policies are wasteful, squandering investments that have been years or decades in the making.
    


            “American taxpayers have invested a lot of money in my education and training directly,” the Goddard source said. “I'm in it for the public service — and I want to return that investment to them.”

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who represents a slice of the Rio Grande Valley along the border with Mexico, won his last congressional election by just over 5,000 votes.

That makes him a tempting target for Republicans, who are poised to redraw the state's congressional maps this coming week and devise five new winnable seats for the GOP that would help the party avoid losing House control in the 2026 elections. Adjusting the lines of Gonzalez's district to bring in a few thousand more Republican voters, while shifting some Democratic ones out, could flip his seat.

Gonzalez said he is not worried. Those Democratic voters will have to end up in one of the Republican districts that flank Gonzalez's current one, making those districts more competitive — possibly enough so it could flip the seats to Democrats.

“Get ready for some pickup opportunities,” Gonzalez said, adding that his party is already recruiting challengers to Republicans whose districts they expect to be destabilized by the process. “We're talking to some veterans, we're talking to some former law enforcement.”

Texas has 38 seats in the House. Republicans now hold 25 and Democrats 12, with one seat vacant after Democrat Sylvester Turner, a former Houston mayor, died in March.

Gonzalez's district — and what happens to the neighboring GOP-held ones — is at the crux of President Donald Trump's high-risk, high-reward push to get Texas Republicans to redraw their political map. Trump is seeking to avoid the traditional midterm letdown that most incumbent presidents endure and hold onto the House, which the GOP narrowly controls.




Trump's push comes as there are numerous political danger signs for his presidency, both in the recent turmoil over his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and in new polling. Surveys from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show most U.S. adults think his policies have not helped them and that his tax cut and spending bill will help the wealthy.

The fear of accidentally creating unsafe seats is one reason Texas Republicans drew their lines cautiously in 2021, when the constitutionally mandated redistricting process kicked off in all 50 states. Mapmakers — in most states, it's the party that controls the legislature — must adjust congressional and state legislative lines after every 10-year census to ensure that districts have about the same number of residents.

That is a golden opportunity for one party to rig the map against the other, a tactic known as gerrymandering. But there is a term, too, for so aggressively redrawing a map that it puts that party's own seats at risk: a “dummymander.”

The Texas GOP knows the risk. In the 2010s, the Republican-controlled Legislature drew political lines that helped pad the GOP's House majority. That lasted until 2018, when a backlash against Trump in his first term led Democrats to flip two seats in Texas that Republicans had thought safe.

In 2021, with Republicans still comfortably in charge of the Texas Statehouse, the party was cautious, opting for a map that mainly shored up their incumbents rather than targeted Democrats.

Still, plenty of Republicans believe their Texas counterparts can safely go on offense.

“Smart map-drawing can yield pickup opportunities while not putting our incumbents in jeopardy,” said Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which helps coordinate mapmaking for the party nationally..

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature, which starts Monday, to comply with Trump's request to redraw the congressional maps and to address the flooding in Texas Hill Country that killed at least 135 people this month.

Democratic state lawmakers are talking about staying away from the Capitol to deny the Legislature the minimum number needed to convene. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton posted that any Democrats who did that should be arrested.

Lawmakers can be fined up to $500 a day for breaking a quorum after the House changed its rules when Democrats initiated a walkout in 2021. Despite the new penalties, state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, who led the walkout in 2021, left open the possibility of another.

“I don't think anybody should underestimate the will of Texas Democrats,” he said.

Texas is not the only Republican state engaged in mid-decade redistricting. After staving off a ballot measure to expand the power of a mapmaking commission last election, Ohio Republicans hope to redraw their congressional map from a 10-5 one favoring the GOP to one as lopsided as 13-2, in a state Trump won last year with 55% of the vote.

Some Democratic leaders have suggested that states where their party is in control should counter the expected redraw in Texas. “We have to be absolutely ruthless about getting back in power,” former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said Sunday on CNN.

But Democrats have fewer options. More of the states the party controls do not allow elected partisans to draw maps and entrust independent commissions to draw fair lines.

Among them is California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has floated the long shot idea of working around the state's commission.

The few Democratic-controlled states that do allow elected officials to draw the lines, such as Illinois, have already seen Democrats max out their advantages.

Trump and his allies have been rallying Texas Republicans to ignore whatever fears they may have and to go big.

On Tuesday, the president posted on his social media site a reminder of his record in the state last November: “Won by one and a half million Votes, and almost 14%. Also, won all of the Border Counties along Mexico, something which has never happened before. I keep hearing about Texas ‘going Blue,' but it is just another Democrat LIE.”

Texas has long been eyed as a state trending Democratic because of its growing nonwhite population. But those communities swung right last year and helped Trump expand his margin to 14 percentage points, a significant improvement on his 6-point win in 2020.

Michael Li, a Texas native and longtime watcher of the state at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, said there's no way to know whether that trend will continue in next year's elections or whether the state will return to its blue-trending ways.

“Anyone who can tell you what the politics of Texas looks like for the balance of the decade has a better crystal ball than I do,” Li said.

One region of the state where Republican gains have been steady is the Rio Grande Valley, which runs from the Gulf of Mexico along much of the state's southern border. The heavily Hispanic region, where many Border Patrol officers live, has rallied around Trump's tough-on-immigration, populist message.

As a result, Gonzalez and the area's other Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, have seen their reelection campaigns get steadily tighter. They are widely speculated to be the two top targets of the new map.

The GOP is expected to look to the state's three biggest cities to find its other Democratic targets. If mapmakers scatter Democratic voters from districts in the Houston, Dallas and Austin areas, they could get to five additional seats.

But in doing so, Republicans face a legal risk on top of their electoral one: that they break up districts required by the Voting Rights Act to have a critical amount of certain minority groups. The goal of the federal law is to enable those communities to elect representatives of their choosing.

The Texas GOP already is facing a lawsuit from civil rights groups alleging its initial 2021 map did this. If this year's redistricting is too aggressive, it could trigger a second complaint.

“It's politically and legally risky,” Li said of the redistricting strategy. “It's throwing caution to the winds.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is getting broadsided from her left over her vote on an amendment aimed at blocking U.S. funding for Israel's Iron Dome.

The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) are criticizing the progressive firebrand for voting against an amendment by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to block $500 million in Congress' annual defense spending bill that was aimed at helping fund Israeli missile defense systems.

"An arms embargo means keeping all arms out of the hands of a genocidal military, no exceptions. This is why we oppose Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez'[s] vote against an amendment that would have blocked $500 million in funding for the Israeli military's Iron Dome program," the DSA said over the weekend.

The DSA noted she did vote against the defense funding bill itself, thereby "voting against funding for the imperialist military-industrial complex and the Israeli genocide."

FAR-LEFT FIREBRAND SAYS SHE 'NEVER HAD A CONCERN' ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL STATE AS HOUSE PROBE HEATS UP

The group added, however, "We were further deeply disappointed by her clarifying statement on her position on the Iron Dome."

"Along with other US-funded interceptor systems, the Iron Dome has emboldened Israel to invade or bomb no less than five different countries in the past two years," the DSA said.

"The fact that Representative Ocasio-Cortez acknowledges that Israel is carrying out this genocide makes her support for military aid all the more disappointing and incongruous. We urge the representative to continue voting against the Iron Dome, whether it is part of a larger defense spending bill or as a stand-alone bill."

The DSA commended Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Summer Lee, D-Pa., and Al Green, D-Texas, for voting against the amendment.

Fox News Digital reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's campaign and congressional office for comment.

She posted on X after the vote, "Marjorie Taylor Greene's amendment does nothing to cut off offensive aid to Israel nor end the flow of US munitions being used in Gaza. Of course I voted against it."

"What it does do is cut off defensive Iron Dome capacities while allowing the actual bombs killing Palestinians to continue. I have long stated that I do not believe that adding to the death count of innocent victims to this war is constructive to its end," she said.

"That is a simple and clear difference of opinion that has long been established. I remain focused on cutting the flow of US munitions that are being used to perpetuate the genocide in Gaza."

The clash exemplifies how Israel continues to drive an ideological wedge within the Democratic Party. 

It's not the first time Ocasio-Cortez caught heat from the progressive base for failing to take a critical enough stance on Israel.

In 2021, the New York Democrat cried on the House floor after voting "present" on funding Israel's Iron Dome defense system.

"Yes, I wept," she wrote in an open letter to constituents after the incident. "I wept at the complete lack of care for the human beings that are impacted by these decisions. I wept at an institution choosing a path of maximum volatility and minimum consideration for its own political convenience."

The overall bill that passed last week calls for $832 billion in defense funding for fiscal year 2026.

That's separate from the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), another annual bill that sets defense and national security policy each fiscal year – essentially detailing how those funds will be spent.

Greene's amendment to strip $500 million going toward Israeli missile defense programs lost in a lopsided 6-422 vote.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is blasting people within her own party for "lying" about her position during a key round of government funding votes late last week.

"Google is free. If you're saying I voted for military funding, you are lying. Receipts attached," Ocasio-Cortez wrote alongside several screenshots showing her vote "no" on Republicans' military funding bill.

"Drag me for my positions all you want, but lying about them doesn't make you part of the 'left.' If you believe neo-nazis are welcome and operating in good faith, you can have them!"

The New York City Democrat got broadsided from her left over her vote on a specific amendment aimed at blocking U.S. funding for Israel's Iron Dome, though it did not make it into the final bill – which Ocasio-Cortez voted against.

BEIRUT (AP) — A U.S. envoy doubled down on Washington's support for Syria's new government, saying Monday there is “no Plan B” to working with it to unite the country still reeling from years of civil war and wracked by new sectarian violence.

In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Tom Barrack also criticized Israel's recent intervention in Syria, calling it poorly timed and saying it complicated efforts to stabilize the region.

Barrack is ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, with a short-term mandate in Lebanon. He spoke in Beirut following more than a week of clashes in Syria's southern province of Sweida between militias of the Druze religious minority and Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes.

Syrian government forces intervened, ostensibly to restore order, but ended up siding with the Bedouins before withdrawing under a ceasefire agreement with Druze factions. Hundreds have been killed in the fighting, and some government fighters allegedly shot dead Druze civilians and burned and looted homes.

Neighboring Israel intervened last week on behalf of the Druze, who are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military. Israel launched dozens of strikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and struck the Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus.

Over the weekend, Barrack announced a ceasefire between Syria and Israel. Syrian government forces have redeployed in Sweida to halt renewed clashes between the Druze and Bedouins, and civilians from both sides were set to be evacuated Monday.

Barrack told the AP that “the killing, the revenge, the massacres on both sides” are “intolerable,” but that “the current government of Syria, in my opinion, has conducted themselves as best they can as a nascent government with very few resources to address the multiplicity of issues that arise in trying to bring a diverse society together.”

At a press conference later, he said Syrian authorities “need to be held accountable” for violations.

Regarding Israel's strikes on Syria, Barrack said: “The United States was not asked, nor did they participate in that decision, nor was it the United States' responsibility in matters that Israel feels is for its own self-defense.”

However, he said Israel's intervention “creates another very confusing chapter” and “came at a very bad time.”

Prior to the violence in Sweida, Israel and Syria had been in talks over security matters, while the Trump administration had been pushing them to move toward full normalization of diplomatic relations.

When the latest fighting erupted, “Israel's view was that south of Damascus was this questionable zone, so that whatever happened militarily in that zone needed to be agreed upon and discussed with them,” Barrack said. “The new government (in Syria) coming in was not exactly of that belief.”

The ceasefire announced Saturday between Syria and Israel is a limited agreement addressing only the conflict in Sweida, he said. It does not address broader issues including Israel's contention that the area south of Damascus should be a demilitarized zone.

In the discussions leading up to the ceasefire, Barrack said “both sides did the best they can” to reach agreement on specific questions related to the movement of Syrian forces and equipment from Damascus to Sweida.

“Whether you accept that Israel can intervene in a sovereign state is a different question,” he said.

He suggested that Israel would prefer to see Syria fragmented and divided rather than a strong central state in control of the country.

“Strong nation-states are a threat — especially Arab states are viewed as a threat to Israel,” he said. But in Syria, he said, “I think all of the the minority communities are smart enough to say, ‘We're better off together, centralized.'”

Later Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz posted on X that Israel's strikes “were the only way to stop the massacre of the Druze in Syria, who are brothers of our Druze brothers in Israel.”

Katz added: “Whoever criticizes the attacks are not familiar with the facts.” It was not clear if he was responding to Barrack's comments.

The violence in Sweida has deepened the distrust of minority religious and ethnic groups in Syria toward the new government in Damascus, which is led by Sunni Muslim former insurgents who unseated longtime autocratic ruler, Bashar Assad in an offensive in December.

The attacks on Druze civilians followed the deaths of hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, to which Assad belongs, earlier this year in sectarian revenge attacks on the Syrian coast. While interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to protect minorities and punish those who target civilians, many feel his government has not done enough.

At the same time, Damascus has been negotiating with the Kurdish forces that control much of northeast Syria to implement an agreement that would merge the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with the new national army.

Barrack, who spoke to SDF leader Mazloum Abdi over the weekend, said he does not believe the violence in Sweida will derail those talks and that there could be a breakthrough “in the coming weeks.”

Neighboring Turkey, which wants to curtail the influence of Kurdish groups along its border and has tense relations with Israel, has offered to provide defense assistance to Syria.

Barrack said the U.S. has “no position” on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.

“It's not in the U.S.'s business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said.

Barrack's visit to Lebanon came amid domestic and international pressure for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah to give up its remaining arsenal after a bruising war with Israel that ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement in November.

Speaking at a press conference, Barrack said the ceasefire agreement “didn't work.”

Israel has continued to launch near-daily airstrikes in Lebanon that it says are aimed at stopping Hezbollah from rebuilding its capabilities. Hezbollah has said it will not discuss disarming until Israel stops its strikes and withdraws its forces from all of southern Lebanon.

While the U.S. has been pushing for Hezbollah's disarmament, Barrack described the matter as “internal” to Lebanon.

“There's no consequence, there's no threat, there's no whip, we're here on a voluntary basis trying to usher in a solution,” he said. He added that the U.S. “can't compel Israel to do anything” when it comes to the ceasefire.

Shigeru Ishiba's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito were short three seats to maintain a majority in Japan's 248-seat upper house in Sunday's vote. The emerging populist party Sanseitō stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance, with its “Japanese First” platform that proposes a new agency to handle policies related to foreigners.

TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Monday he will stay in office to tackle challenges such as rising prices and high U.S. tariffs after a weekend election defeat left his coalition with a minority in both parliamentary chambers and triggered calls for his resignation.

Ishiba's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito were short three seats to maintain a majority in the 248-seat upper house in Sunday's vote. Though the LDP is still the leading party, its ruling coalition is now a minority in both houses of the Diet, or parliament, which makes it difficult for the coalition to pass any legislation.

The loss of a majority in Sunday's election does not immediately lead to a change of government because the upper house lacks power to file a no-confidence motion against a leader. With opposition too fractured to form a united front powerful enough to topple the ruling coalition, Ishiba is under more pressure to step down from ultraconservative rivals in his own party. 

Ishiba said he takes the result seriously but that his priority is to avoid creating a political vacuum and to tackle impending challenges, including the Aug. 1 deadline for a tariff deal with the U.S.

“While I painfully feel my serious responsibility over the election results, I believe I must also fulfill my responsibility I bear for the country and the people so as not to cause politics to stall or go adrift,” Ishiba said. “Challenges such as global situation and natural disaster won't wait for a better political situation.”

His chief tariff negotiator, Economic Minister Ryosei Akazawa, is heading to Washington for his eighth round of talks. The prime minister hopes to reach a mutually beneficial deal and meet with U.S. President Donald Trump “as soon as possible,” he said.




Sunday's vote comes after Ishiba's coalition lost a majority in the October lower house election, stung by past corruption scandals, and his unpopular government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through parliament. It has been unable to quickly deliver effective measures to mitigate rising prices, including Japan's traditional staple of rice, and dwindling wages.

Trump has added to the pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations and the lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba. 

At a news conference Monday, Ishiba said his LDP and the Komeito have agreed to stick with their coalition while seeking further cooperation from opposition parties. 

Ishiba resisted calls for his resignation and did not say how much longer he planned to stay on. He is sticking around for the country and the people, not for self-interest, “to put the pressing issues on a path to a solution,” he said.

Voters frustrated with price increases exceeding the pace of wage hikes, especially younger people who have long felt ignored by the ruling government's focus on senior voters, rapidly turned to emerging conservative and right-wing populist parties. Established liberal to centrist parties, including the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, gained little ground.

The Democratic Party for the People quadrupled its seats by campaigning for higher take-home pay. The right-wing Sanseito, running on a “Japanese First” platform that puts tougher regulations on foreigners and brakes on gender and sexual diversity, surged to number three in the opposition. 

The LDP has lost support due to the people's discontent over the party's measures for rising prices, foreign residents and other reasons and that he will “quickly analyze the results and learn the lesson,” Ishiba said.

None of the opposition parties said they want to form a full-fledged alliance with the governing coalition but are open to cooperating on policy. CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda told broadcaster NHK that his priority is to form an alliance among the opposition.

“Public opinion clearly said ‘no' to the Ishiba government,” Noda said.

Sanseito leader Sohei Kamiya told NHK late Sunday he is open to cooperating with the ruling bloc on conservative policies. While he said his party did better than expected, he would wait to gain more seats in the other house in the next election and attempt to form a multi-party coalition like in Europe.

The Sanseito party's stance encouraged the spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the campaign and on social media, while also attracting people who are strugging with economic woes and looking for targets to vent their discontent and anxiety, experts say. The language triggered protests from rights activists and alarmed foreign residents.

            Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blamed New York officials and “sanctuary city policies” for the shooting of an off-duty US Customs and Border Protection officer in an apparent robbery gone wrong over the weekend.
    


            The 42-year-old officer is in stable condition and expected to survive, officials said Monday. There is no indication that he was targeted because of his employment, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Sunday.
    


            The officer, who was not in uniform, was sitting with a woman in Riverside Park, beneath the George Washington Bridge, when two men approached on a moped just before midnight. The passenger got off and approached the officer, who realized he was being robbed and drew his service weapon, Tisch said.
    


            The two exchanged gunfire and the off-duty officer was shot in the face and arm. The perpetrator was injured before he and the moped driver rode off, police said.
    


            A person of interest, identified as Miguel Mora, a 21-year-old undocumented immigrant with an extensive criminal past, was taken into custody after arriving at a Bronx hospital with gunshot wounds to the groin and leg, Tisch said.
    


            The police commissioner said Mora's injuries were consistent with what was seen on surveillance video of the shooting shared by the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            It is unclear whether Mora has an attorney.
    


            After a search, Mora's alleged accomplice, who is also undocumented, was arrested Monday, Noem said. That person also has a history of criminal activity, Tisch announced Monday.
    


            Federal charges against both men are expected, officials said. 



            Mora entered the country illegally through Arizona in 2023 and had two prior arrests for domestic violence in New York. He was wanted in New York to face accusations of robbery and felony assault, and in Massachusetts over a stolen weapons case, Tisch said.
    


            Mora's criminal history includes charges for assault on a pregnant woman and a stabbing charge in January, two senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told CNN. Mora was wanted for robbing a pawn shop in Massachusetts where guns were stolen, and authorities are looking into whether the semi-automatic weapon used in the attack over the weekend is from the pawn shop, the officials said.
    


            Noem blamed “sanctuary city policies” for the shooting, citing a list of previous arrests and warrants against Mora. 



            “He was arrested four different times in New York City, and because of the mayor's policies and sanctuary city policies, was released back to do harm to people and to individuals living in this city,” she said.
    


            Noem called on leaders of sanctuary cities nationwide to change their policies. When asked what policies would have prevented the shooting, Noem did not provide specifics.
    


            “This individual should have been deported and never been in this country,” she said.
    


            President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, echoed Noem's statements.
    


            “Sanctuary cities are sanctuaries for criminals,” Homan said Monday. “Full stop.”
    


            At a separate news conference Monday, New York Mayor Eric Adams said he is not responsible for the “revolving-door criminal justice system” that kept Mora on the streets.
    


            “I just carry out the rules,” Adams said.
    


            Adams said he would welcome more federal agents being deployed to his city, as long as they are focused on dangerous individuals and not “everyday individuals who are trying to complete the path to be a citizen.”
    


            The mayor previously said he visited the wounded officer Sunday in the hospital, where he was recovering with family members by his side who thanked the city for its response.
    


            “I am extremely angry that we have a customs border patrol officer that is in the hospital because that person should have not been on our streets,” Adams said Monday.
    


            The officer suffered a broken jaw and a bullet is lodged in his throat, but he is alert and has been communicating through hand gestures, senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told CNN.
    


            The officer is expected to make a speedy recovery, Customs and Border Protection Director of Field Operations Frank Russo said.
    


            “Our officer is a hero. He did exactly what we ask of all of our officers under the circumstances. He executed our mission, which is to protect the country, and he did it by stopping a threat,” Russo said Sunday. “If not for his efforts, this person of interest would have committed more armed robberies.”
    


            In a social media post Sunday afternoon, Trump seized on the shooting as evidence of Democrats' failures to secure the border.
    


            “The CBP Officer bravely fought off his attacker, despite his wounds, demonstrating enormous Skill and Courage,” Trump added.
    


            The shooting comes as federal officials warn of a surge of attacks on agents carrying out Trump's mass deportation agenda.
    


            As enforcement efforts have ramped up in recent months, many officers have chosen to cover their faces with the goal of avoiding harassment in public and online.
    


            On Sunday, the acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, said he would allow agents to continue covering their faces as a safety measure.
    


            “If that's a tool that the men and women of ICE (use) that keeps themselves and their families safe, then I will allow it,” Lyons said.

            England's Jess Carter says she will step back from social media after the defender said she has received “a lot of racist abuse” since the beginning of the 2025 UEFA Women's Euros.
    


            Carter has started all four matches for England as the team has reached the semifinal stage of the tournament, where the Lionesses are seeking to win their second consecutive European Championship.
    


            “While I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result, I don't agree, or think, it's OK to target someone's appearance or race,” the 27-year-old said in a statement posted across her social media channels. “As a result of this I will be taking a step back from social media and leaving it to a team to deal with.”
    


            Carter added that she is making the decision to protect herself “in a bid to keep my focus on helping the team anyway I can.”
    


            “Hopefully speaking out will make the people writing this abuse think twice so others won't have to deal with it. We have made some historic changes with this Lionesses squad that I am so proud to be a part of and my hope is that by speaking out about this it will make another positive change for all.”
    


CNN Sports has reached out to Meta and X for comment.
    


            The official England women's social media account released a statement in support of Carter, calling the abuse the defender has suffered “online poison.”

            “No one should have to endure such vile abuse, be that in football or any walk of life,” the team said on X. “Representing our country is the greatest honour.
    


            “It is not right that while we are doing that, some of us are treated differently simply because of the colour of our skin.”
    


            The statement added that England players will stand rather than kneel – an act of solidarity against racism and prejudice introduced to soccer following the global outrage over the 2020 murder of George Floyd – ahead of their semifinal clash on Tuesday.
    


            “It is clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism,” it said.
    


            Mark Bullingham, CEO of the English Football Association (FA), said that the group is “working with police to ensure those responsible for this hate crime are brought to justice.”
    


            “Regrettably, this is not the first time this has happened to an England player, so we had measures in place to allow us to respond quickly and where possible provide information to support any potential police action,” Bullingham said.
    


            “We will continue to discuss with the relevant authorities and social media companies about what more can and should be done to prevent this abhorrent abuse.”
    


            UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered his support for Carter, writing on social media: “There is no place for racism in football or anywhere in society.
    


            “I stand with Jess, the Lionesses, and any players who have suffered racism, on and off the pitch,” Starmer said.
    


            Online abuse directed at women's soccer players was a subject discussed ahead of the Women's Euros, with members of the England team saying they would avoid social media during major tournaments due to the abuse they are subjected to.
    


            Carter's England teammate Lotte Wubben-Moy announced on Sunday she would be coming off social media as a result of the persistent abuse.
    


            “Another tournament goes by where we see the same disgusting racist abuse. It is unacceptable for any person to be subject to this or any kind of abuse,” Wubben-Moy said in a post on her Instagram Stories. “The issue goes beyond sport. But what is being done about it? On the very platforms we post on? I will not continue to feed the very ­platform that enables abuse with no consequence.”
    


            Another of Carter's England teammates, defender Lucy Bronze, detailed the anger and sadness the whole squad felt upon hearing about the abuse targeted at Carter and that she hopes by standing before kick-off, rather than kneeling, will show that the players' voices “make a difference.”
    


            Bronze added that the increasing popularity of women's soccer has led to increased abuse.

            “The bigger the game gets, the bigger the noise becomes, the more fans there are, but the more critics there are,” Bronze told reporters. “We're obviously open to critics – that's why we love the sport – but we're not open to abuse.
    


            “Especially in women's football, the online abuse seems to be getting worse and worse. We see it more in the stadiums in men's football and online, but I think with women's football there seems to be a real target online.
    


            “It's something that we're very aware of. There is a way to make a change. There is a solution. I don't have the answer, but I'm sure that there is one.”
    


            Since making her debut for England in 2017, Carter has been an ever-present in subsequent squads and was a part of the team who won the Women's Euros in 2022. She has made 49 appearances for the national side.

Secretary of Education Linda McMahon joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's push to abolish the department, the administration's stance on anti-Israel college protests and DOGE's role within the Cabinet. 

Tucson Unified School District (TUSD), based in Tucson, Arizona, is reportedly facing financial and enrollment struggles after universal school choice passed in the state in 2022.

A TUSD official told KGUN that approximately 4,000 students used vouchers to either go to private schools or homeschool.

The trend of parents overlooking TUSD cost the school district about $20 million. TUSD's Chief Financial Officer, Ricky Hernandez, told the local outlet that TUSD is "preparing for continued declines in enrollment as a result" of vouchers.

Vouchers are a form of school choice that allow parents to send their kids to schools outside their neighborhood or opt out of going to public school. 

Arizona became the first state to offer universal school choice for all families in 2022, launching an $800 million program that gives parents $7,000 to put toward their children's tuition. Several other states followed, indicating a trend of parents seeking alternative options to traditional public schools.

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT SIGNS $1 BILLION VOUCHER PROGRAM INTO LAW, CAPPING OFF WIN FOR SCHOOL CHOICE ADVOCATES

Parents' use of school vouchers put the district's already debilitating enrollment in worse circumstances, including impacting teacher pay, according to TUSD's chief financial officer. The district cannot offer competitive pay to retain and recruit teachers due to the loss of money the district incurred.

Furthermore, the district has had to implement budget reductions as a result. 

"If those numbers aren't there, then that certainly affects the number of teachers that we have, how we can compensate them," Hernandez said to KGUN.

The president of the Tucson Education Association, a local branch of the National Education Association, warned that the loss of funds could lead to teachers leaving the district.

"Having to look at, 'do I stay in education? How many other jobs do I have to keep this one?'" Jim Byrne told KGUN.

On the other hand, the Vail Unified School District (VUSD), located in Vail, Arizona, is seeing the opposite.

The local outlet reported on Tuesday an increase in enrollment over the last year. More specifically, the district's K-8 saw an increase of 20 to 50 students.

The VUSD superintendent, John Carruth, attributed the growth to the housing construction growing in the area. Carruth added that their losses to school vouchers were offset by students leaving other public school districts to enroll in VUSD.

Reacting to the school district's difference in outcomes after the vouchers, school choice advocates weighed in.

Several red states passed universal school choice, following Arizona, indicating a trend of parents seeking alternative options around the country. 

"Some school districts are better than others. The best ones that are competitive don't have to worry as much about losing their customers," Corey DeAngelis of the American Culture Project said to Fox News Digital.

Education policy analyst, Jason Bedrick of the Heritage Foundation, who is based in Arizona tracking policy decisions in the state, said to Fox News Digital that  TUSD "has long had a reputation for poor quality, despite spending more per pupil than the state average."

"Only 21 percent of TUSD students passed the state math exam last year, well below both the state average (32 percent) and district with similar demographics (26 percent). The passing rate for TUSD students is not much better in English (27 percent) and even worse in science (18 percent)," Bedrick said, citing state data.

"On http://GreatSchools.org, parents also complain about chronic issues with discipline, safety, and school culture," he added to Fox News Digital.

New Hampshire is the latest state to pass universal school choice, joining Arizona in responding to concerns of children being trapped in failing school districts.

The TUSD nor the VUSD immediately responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane discusses the potential war technology deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, the upcoming deadline for an Iranian nuclear deal and more on ‘Fox & Friends.'

Drones have rapidly evolved from backyard novelties into critical components of today's infrastructure and now, into one of the fastest-growing threats to our national security. As the CEO of one of the nation's largest drone technology companies and a former naval officer, I've seen firsthand how powerful these tools can be. I've also seen how dangerous they are when left unregulated; they become liabilities, capable of disruption, destruction and danger. 

Just days ago, amid deadly flash floods in Texas, a private drone collided with a rescue helicopter during an active life-saving mission. The crash forced the crew to land, grounding a critical asset in the middle of an unfolding emergency. In the chaos of unspeakable tragedy, a single uncoordinated drone put lives at risk and halted the very efforts meant to save them. Incidents like this are entirely preventable with proper airspace coordination.  

In the first quarter of this year, the FAA reported over 400 illegal drone incursions near U.S. airports, which is a 25% increase from the same period in 2024. Drone incursions into U.S. military airspace have reached unprecedented levels, and the trend is only accelerating. At military bases across the country, 350 unauthorized drone flights were recorded last year alone. These aren't harmless mistakes. They are persistent, coordinated, and, in some cases, hostile. 

HEGSETH TEARS UP RED TAPE, ORDERS PENTAGON TO BEGIN DRONE SURGE AT TRUMP'S COMMAND

These incidents are not isolated; they're escalating. Drones have been used to smuggle contraband into prisons, surveil energy facilities and ports, and even collide with manned aircraft, narrowly avoiding catastrophe. As drones become faster, cheaper and easier to operate, our systems for detecting, coordinating, and responding remain fractured, outdated, and dangerously inadequate. 

Drones have become a national security danger. FILE: The autonomous AV8 drones are governed by a computer system created by eve Vehicles in Austin, Texas. (KVUE)

From commercial airliners and emergency helicopters to power grids and correctional facilities, these vulnerabilities cut across every critical sector. Without stronger detection, clear enforcement authority, and a unified approach to managing airspace, the risk will only grow. This is no longer a question of if these gaps will be exploited, but when, how often, and at what cost.

The root of the problem is not technological. The solutions exist today. What we lack is a national framework, a unified, real-time system to track, manage and respond to low-altitude air traffic. 

DRONE INCURSIONS ON US BASES COME UNDER INTENSE SCRUTINY AS DEVICES PROVE LETHALITY OVERSEAS

We need a flight information exchange that allows law enforcement, regulators, and operators to see what's flying, where it is, and who is responsible. We need cryptographically secure digital credentials that link drones, their pilots and their missions to prevent spoofing. And we need Remote ID signals that can't be manipulated. 

Right now, too many decisions depend on disconnected sensors, slow approvals and guesswork. We must fuse radar, RF and acoustic data into a single surveillance picture. The FAA needs to publish a national mission-priority table to ensure emergency flights aren't delayed or grounded. Most urgently, Congress must expand counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems authority to include local law enforcement before the current federal authority sunsets this September.

The technology is ready. The risks are growing. We no longer have the luxury of delay. It's time for Congress, regulators and industry to act together before these threats escalate into disasters. 

We can protect our skies before the next drone incident becomes a national tragedy.

President Donald Trump's fascination with reopening Alcatraz, a dilapidated former state prison off the coast of San Francisco, seems motivated more by symbolism than necessity and could risk becoming the administration's biggest boondoggle. 

Trump has enthusiastically floated the idea of restoring Alcatraz to its former glory multiple times, each time met with intense pushback over its impracticality and astronomical cost, estimated at $2 billion.

Known as “the Rock,” Alcatraz has been featured in many Hollywood movies and is held in the cultural consciousness as a tough place where the worst of the worst go. That makes it attractive to Trump, who sees himself as the “law and order” president. 

Indeed, for nearly three decades, the California prison housed some of the most notorious criminals in U.S. history, including gangster Al Capone, George “Machine Gun Kelly” Barnes, and Robert Stroud, better known as the “Birdman of Alcatraz.”

The problem is, in his enthusiasm to bring back Alcatraz, Trump has disregarded the prison's outdated technology and the very reason then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy chose to close it in the first place: It was too costly to maintain and operate.

The Bureau of Prisons, which would be tasked with running Alcatraz, has been struggling with short staffing, chronic violence, and crumbling infrastructure at its current facilities. Adding a rebooted Alcatraz into the mix would not only be costly but, some say, a waste of time, space, and effort. 

On Thursday, Trump sent Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to visit the prison, which has since been turned into a horticultural paradise and tourist site, complete with a bookstore and cafe. While the Bondi field trip was nothing short of an orchestrated redirect by the administration that had taken heat over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, it did open up new questions about Trump's fascination with Alcatraz, its brand recognition, history, myths, environmental effects, and costs to taxpayers should he sign off on it.

“Alcatraz could hold the worst of the worst, it could hold middle-class violent prisoners, it could hold illegal aliens, it could hold anything,” Bondi told Fox News, who accompanied her and Burgum on the trip. “This is a terrific facility, needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.” 

People tried to escape the facility. It is still unclear whether they made it to land. Over the 29 years that Alcatraz operated as a prison, 36 men were involved in 14 escape attempts. Of those, 23 prisoners were caught, six were shot and killed, and two drowned. The fate of five other men is still unknown. They are presumed to have drowned, though there is evidence that contradicts the claim. 

Trump has also been impressed with the supposed shark-infested waters surrounding the prison, which make the area dangerous and unsuitable for swimming. The president said he has seen renderings of the potential new facility with sharks patrolling the waters around the prison. The problem with the rendering is that it's not possible. 

In fact, documents from the BOP debunk many myths about Alcatraz made famous in movies.

“There are no ‘man-eating' sharks in San Francisco Bay, only small bottom-feeding sharks,” the BOP stated on its webpage. “The main obstacles were the cold temperatures, the strong currents, and the distance to shore (at least 1-1/4 miles).”

The BOP also said that prior to Alcatraz's opening in 1934, “a teenage girl swam to the island to prove it was possible.”

She wasn't the only one. 

“Fitness guru Jack LaLanne once swam to the island pulling a rowboat, and several years ago, two 10-year-old children also made the swim,” the BOP added. 

Former San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, who has been swimming in the bay several times a week since 1992 and has swam from Alcatraz seven times, told the San Francisco Chronicle that he has seen “quite a few sea lions, some harbor seals and no sharks — other than some land sharks named Pam Bondi and her entourage” on his outings.

Sharks aside, Alcatraz has many other problems that need fixing before it can become a functional maximum-security prison. 

A pricetag of more than $2 billion to fix the place up has been reported by Axios. This estimate includes the cost of refurbishment and construction of a new prison on the island. If the Trump administration wants to keep the current facility, it would also cost hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the electrical system up to modern standards, haul water, food, and employees from the mainland, and send sewage back in return. 

Currently, Alcatraz is a tourist destination generating about $60 million in annual revenue and sees about 1.4 million visitors a year, according to the nonprofit organization Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, which works with the National Park Service. 

The conservancy said, “Reopening Alcatraz as a prison would erase decades of progress and miss the point of what this place has become. The island is working, not as a prison, but as a national park that brings history, nature, and people together in a way few places can.”

For Alcatraz to operate again as a prison, Congress would also have to pass legislation to remove National Environmental Policy Act and Historic Preservation Act requirements for the area, which could be a lot easier said than done. 

Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) called plans to reopen Alcatraz “batsh*t crazy.”

“As for the merits of this proposal, if you thought ‘Alligator Alcatraz' was dumb, cruel, and wasteful, you'll run out of adjectives for this idiotic political stunt,” he said. “I told Secretary Burgum last month that not a single serious person at the National Park Service, from superintendents to janitors, thinks this is a good idea. It would also be a financial boondoggle, not just the massive amount it would cost to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, but all the money and goodwill the Park Service would lose from closing one of America's most popular tourist destinations.

“The bottom line: this is deeply idiotic, transparently political, and ultimately unlikely to happen. The only possible rational explanation for why Pam Bondi was touring Alcatraz is that she thinks it might be a good place to hide the Epstein files.”

Unlike the original Alcatraz, the Trump administration had much better luck capitalizing on its name and lore when it built “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida at record speed.

“Alligator Alcatraz” is a makeshift detention facility that was created in a matter of days. Workers transformed the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport from an 11,000-foot isolated airstrip in the Everglades into a temporary tent facility to house undocumented migrants.

“The incredible thing is picking the site … it might be as good as the real Alcatraz, so I really think it could last for as long as they want to have it,” Trump said. “You could morph this into the prison system.”

There have already been complaints about the inhumane treatment at Alligator Alcatraz and the shortcuts the government took to get it up and running.

            The Idaho Maximum Security Institution, opened in 1989 to confine the state's “most disruptive male residents,” has garnered nationwide attention following an aborted execution due to a botched lethal injection and a prisoner-led hunger strike demanding better conditions.
    


            Kohberger, a 30-year-old former former PhD student of criminology, admitted guilt for the first time on July 2 to charges of burglary and first-degree murder in the fatal stabbings of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen in their off-campus Moscow, Idaho, home.
    


            The case reached a bitter resolution after two and a half years of desperately searching for answers when Kohberger, seated behind a table in an off-white button-up shirt and patterned tie, responded to questions from State District Judge Steven Hippler with a series of simple yeses and a neutral gaze, admitting in one-word answers that he planned and carried out the brutal stabbings.
    


            While the plea will allow Kohberger to avoid the death penalty, he could still be in close proximity to the state's eight male death row prisoners who are also housed in the Kuna, Idaho, facility.  Those prisoners include Chad Daybell, who was convicted in the 2019 killings of his first wife and two of his second wife's children.
    


            Kohberger is expected to return to court in Boise later this week for his sentencing, and could be transferred just over 10 miles down the road to the state's maximum security prison right after.
    


            Here's a look at what life inside the Idaho Maximum Security Institution could like:
    


            The male-only facility, located just south of Boise, is surrounded by a double perimeter fence reinforced with razor wire and equipped with an electronic detection system, according to its website.
    


            It has the capacity to house 549 people, and has a unit for civilly committed psychiatric patients, which has faced backlash from the National Alliance on Mental Illness for using a prison to house people with mental illnesses in need of mental health treatment. The alliance faulted the facility for allegedly denying patients access to prison programs and services typically available to incarcerated individuals.
    


            The prison has also garnered criticism for its harsh treatment of inmates in solitary confinement and for its poor conditions, driving prisoners to organize a mass six-day hunger strike last year in protest of the facility, the Idaho Statesman reported.
    


            Among the ninety inmates who participated in the strike, some complained about delays in access to medical care, long bouts of isolation and recreational “cages,” the newspaper reported. The “cages” were described as “large chain link-like metal boxes each man is placed into, littered with human urine and feces that have soaked into the concrete.”
    


            Men housed in a lower-security section within the maximum-security prison,﻿ who are allowed access to an open outdoor recreation area, told the Statesman the space is often littered with trash and bodily fluids, and others said the facility's HVAC system hasn't been cleaned in decades because the vents are clogged with garbage, urine and feces.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Idaho Department of Correction for comment about the prison's conditions.
    


            The prison's strict solitary confinement policies have also sparked concern.
    


            Kevin Kempf, who served as director of the Idaho Department of Correction in 2016, told CNN affiliate KBOI at the time that inmates were confined alone for up to 23 hours a day with little human interaction, received meals in their cells, and were allowed showers only three times a week.
    


            The Idaho Department of Correction implemented a step-down program that gradually transitions inmates from solitary confinement to a more open environment, KBOI reported. This program includes stages such as placing prisoners in cells where they can talk and interact with others, helping them adjust slowly and safely.
    


            The prison has recently come under scrutiny because it's equipped with the state's execution chamber, which was the site of an aborted execution last year.
    


            After Idaho struggled for years to obtain pentobarbital, a single-drug protocol to execute death row inmates, the state's first attempt to use the lethal injection in 12 years failed. In February 2024, officials were unable to set an IV line on Thomas Creech﻿, forcing them to abort the execution.
    


            Creech, the longest-serving inmate on Idaho's death row, was sentenced to death after pleading guilty to the murder of another inmate, David Dale Jensen, in 1981, while Creech was serving four life sentences, according to the Ada County Prosecutor's Office. His second execution was postponed when a federal judge issued a stay in November.
    


            Now, the state is making the firing squad its lead method of execution. Idaho Republican Gov. Brad Little signed into law a bill in March, making his state the only one in the country with the firing squad as its primary execution method beginning July 1, 2026.
    


Unpacking Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea deal to avoid death penalty in Idaho student killings



            Idaho lawmakers first passed legislation in 2023 allowing for the firing squad as a means of execution if drugs are unavailable, or lethal injection is found to be unconstitutional.
    


            ﻿All executions and execution-related procedures were suspended until the maximum security prison completes the renovation of the F-Block, the execution chamber, to accommodate both methods – lethal injection and firing squad, the Idaho Department of Correction announced in June. The renovations are expected to take about seven months.
    


            However, executions have been rare in Idaho. Only three executions have taken place in the facility since the state revised its death penalty statute in 1977, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Pakistani police have made multiple arrests after a couple were allegedly murdered in broad daylight on the orders of a tribal elder for having an “illicit” relationship, in the latest so-called “honor killing” in the country.
    


            The killings last month in the southwestern Balochistan province, underscores the shocking and persistent nature of such crimes across parts of Central and South Asia, where family and community members believe they can restore “honor” through bloodshed.
    


            At least 11 people have been arrested since video of the incident recently went viral on social media, Balochistan's chief minister Safraz Bugti said.
    


            Graphic video of the killing shows about a dozen men surrounding several vehicles in a desert.
    


            A woman, her head wrapped in a shawl, can be seen slowly walking in front of one of the vehicles as a man follows her, watched by the group.
    


            “You are only allowed to fire at me, nothing else,” she can be heard saying in Brahvi, a local language, before the man raises a pistol and shoots her at close range.
    


            The woman remains standing after two shots, collapsing only after the third, the video shows. The video then captures more gunshots.
    


            Another video shows the bloodied bodies of a man and woman lying side by side.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos. Police told CNN they believe the footage does show the murder under investigation.

            The man and woman were killed because they were allegedly engaged in a relationship considered “illicit” by a local tribal leader, according to a police report seen by CNN.
    


            The leader had allegedly issued a verdict to execute them, the police report said.
    


            Honor killings remain disturbingly common in Pakistan, with hundreds of cases reported each year — though experts believe the real number is much higher due to underreporting.
    


            These murders are typically carried out by family members or village leaders who believe a relative, often a woman, has brought “shame” upon the family, sometimes for reasons as seemingly innocuous as marrying by choice, seeking a divorce, or defying traditional gender roles.
    


            Deeply-rooted patriarchal norms that equate family honor with women's behavior, cultural acceptance, and weak law enforcement, allow perpetrators to act with near impunity.
    


            In recent years, a string of high-profile so-called honor killings have made headlines in Pakistan, drawing national and international condemnation and underscoring the persistence of the practice.
    


            In 2016, social media star Qandeel Baloch was murdered by her brother in a so-called “honor killing.” Baloch gained both fame and notoriety in inherently conservative and patriarchal Pakistan for her bold, sassy and increasingly political social media posts.
    


            Her murder sparked a national outcry and promoted changes in the country's so-called “honor killing” laws. Honor killings now carry a life sentence but the change in legislation has not made the crimes go away.
    


            At least 335 women and 119 men were killed in so-called “honor killings” last year alone, according to data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).
    


            Balochistan's chief minister Bugti called the most recent alleged murder “intolerable” and a “blatant violation of social values and human dignity.”

President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Sunday night against one of his strongest critics, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), as Fannie Mae investigators look into allegations of mortgage fraud by the senator.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump teased that Schiff is in “BIG TROUBLE” and accused him of falsifying loan documents, saying he should face prison time.

“Adam ‘Shifty' Schiff is in BIG TROUBLE! He falsified Loan Documents. He once said my son would go to prison on a SCAM that Schiff, along with other Crooked Dems, illegally ‘manufactured' in order to stage an actual coup. My son did nothing wrong, knew nothing about the fictional story. It was an American Tragedy! Now Shifty should pay the price of prison for a real crime, not one made up by the corrupt accusers!” the president posted, referencing the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, new documents of which allege that Obama-era officials “manufactured” intelligence to undermine Trump.

Trump's call for Schiff to see jail time follows the president's statement last week that the California senator faced an investigation from Fannie Mae that concluded Schiff “engaged in a sustained pattern of possible mortgage fraud” by listing a Maryland home as his primary residence for years instead of his California home. 

While a memorandum from Fannie Mae investigators found something similar to Trump's accusations, specifically that Schiff and his wife, Eve, “engaged in a sustained pattern of possible occupancy misrepresentation,” no determination on anything illegal has yet been made.

Still, Trump has only escalated his rhetoric against Schiff over the past week, including earlier on Sunday, when he called for his prosecution.

“Adam Schiff is a THIEF! He should be prosecuted, just like they tried to prosecute me, and everyone else — The only difference is, WE WERE TOTALLY INNOCENT, IT WAS ALL A GIANT HOAX!” Trump posted.

TRUMP SAYS SCHIFF SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR MORTGAGE FRAUD ‘LIKE THEY TRIED TO PROSECUTE ME'

Schiff has denied wrongdoing and defended the use of claiming year-round ownership of both homes as common practice for members of Congress traveling from state to state.

“Big surprise — members of Congress, almost all of them, own more than one home or rent more than one home because we're required to be on both coasts. So he is using my ownership of two homes to make a false claim of mortgage fraud,” the California senator said early last week.

The UK government said it signed a strategic partnership with OpenAI on Monday, with plans to expand AI security research collaborations and explore investing in AI infrastructure such as data centers.

The Microsoft-backed AI startup will also expand its London office, building up its research and engineering teams at OpenAI's first international location opened two years ago, according to a statement.

As part of the agreement, OpenAI will share technical information with the UK AI Security Institute to deepen the government's knowledge of AI capabilities and security risks.

"The partnership will explore where it can deploy AI in areas such as justice, defense and security, and education technology in line with UK standards and guidelines to demonstrate the opportunity to make taxpayer funded services more efficient and effective," the statement said.

US Stocks:

The S&P 500 Index is looking at a double-digit increase in the second half of the year, powered by the resilient strength of America's technology behemoths, according to Wells Fargo Securities LLC's Christopher Harvey.

The bank's chief US equity strategist is Wall Street's biggest bull, with a year-end price target on the S&P 500 of 7,007, set in December. He's sticking to his call, implying an 11% gain from Friday's closing price of 6,296.79. His view is that Big Tech companies, which have been instrumental in the equity gauge's 27% surge since its April low, will keep the stock market soaring regardless of President Donald Trump's ever-changing trade policies.

OpenAI:

Fidji Simo, the chief executive officer of Instacart who is departing for OpenAI, during a Bloomberg Studio 1.0 interview in San Francisco on Thursday, March 3, 2022.

Fidji Simo, the outgoing Instacart chief executive officer headed to OpenAI, outlined her vision for the newly created role of CEO of applications ahead of her official start at the ChatGPT maker next month.

Simo will begin her new role on Aug. 18, an OpenAI spokesperson said. In a blog post published on the company's website on Monday, she set the tone for how she envisions the company's artificial intelligence technologies can be used by more people, rather than concentrated in the hands of the wealthy and connected. While she did not specify a product roadmap, she reflected on how AI can be useful in six broad areas, including knowledge, health, creative expression, economic freedom, time and support.

Citigroup Inc. is asking its new class of investment-banking analysts to disclose whether they've already accepted a job offer from another firm, in the latest step by banks to clamp down on aggressive recruitment by private equity firms.

First-year analysts will be required to complete an “attestation” intended to “foster a fair and transparent environment,” according to a memo sent to analysts' managers on Monday and seen by Bloomberg News. The attestation is expected to be a one-time form, but the bank might also ask analysts to repeat it annually, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Trump's Second Term:

Marty Makary, commissioner of the FDA, is naming George Tidmarsh director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

The FDA's White Oak campus in Silver Spring, Maryland.

Food and Drug Administration commissioner Marty Makary has chosen former biotech executive George Tidmarsh as the agency's top drug regulator, the agency confirmed Monday.

Tidmarsh, an adjunct professor of pediatrics and neonatology at Stanford University, will serve as director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, one of the FDA's largest and most important divisions with a staff of about 5,700 that reviews the vast majority of new drug applications. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, the acting head of the CDER, recently announced she was leaving the agency.

Microsoft has warned of "active attacks" targeting its SharePoint collaboration software, with security researchers noting that organizations worldwide stand to be affected by the breach.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Sunday in a release that the vulnerability provides unauthenticated access to systems and full access to SharePoint content, enabling bad actors to execute code over the network.

CISA said that while the scope and impact of the attack continue to be assessed, the agency warned that it "poses a risk to organizations."

Microsoft late Sunday issued fixes for customers to apply to two versions of the SharePoint software. Another 2016 version remains vulnerable and the company said it is working to develop a patch.

Researchers at Palo Alto Networks said the hack likely reached thousands of organizations globally.

"The exploits are real, in-the-wild and pose a serious threat," they added.

A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on the incident beyond what was shared in a company blog post. 

In an alert Saturday, Microsoft said the attack applies only to on-premises SharePoint servers, not those in the cloud like Microsoft 365. SharePoint software is commonly used by global businesses and organizations to store and collaborate on documents.

The vulnerability is especially concerning because it allows hackers to impersonate users or services even after the SharePoint server is patched, according to researchers at European cybersecurity firm Eye Security, which said it first identified the flaw.

SharePoint servers often connect to other Microsoft services such as Outlook and Teams, meaning such a breach can "quickly" lead to data theft and password harvesting, Eye Security researchers said.

"Once inside, they're exfiltrating sensitive data, deploying persistent backdoors, and stealing cryptographic keys," Michael Sikorski, CTO and head of threat intelligence for Palo Alto's Unit 42, said in a statement. "The attackers have leveraged this vulnerability to get into systems and are already establishing their foothold."

Separately, Alaska Airlines briefly halted its ground operations for about three hours on Sunday due to an IT outage. It lifted the ground stop at roughly 2 a.m. EST, the carrier said in a statement.

It was unclear whether the outage was related to the SharePoint attack.

CoreWeave stock rose more than 5% after the renter of artificial intelligence data centers said it plans to sell $1.5 billion worth of bonds.

The company said in a release that the notes, due in 2031, will use the capital for general purposes, such as paying off debt.

In May, the company announced a $2 billion debt offering plan that sent shares soaring 19%. At the time, CNBC confirmed that the debt was five times oversubscribed. Last week, Coreweave shares rallied after the company announced a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania.

CoreWeave, whose biggest clients include Nvidia and Microsoft, has more than tripled in share price since its March debut on the Nasdaq.

Some investors have raised concerns about the company's debt and the sustainability of demand for its products. In May, CEO Michael Intrator defended CoreWeave's spending plans and said it is meeting major client "demand signals."

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

The latest crypto treasury company is set to hit the public market with an ambitious plan to build the largest public vehicle for institutional exposure to ether.

The Ether Machine will begin trading on the Nasdaq through a merger with blank check company Dynamix Corporation. Andrew Keys, the co-founder and chairman of the new company, has committed about $645 million in an anchor investment. The entity is backed by crypto investors 10T Holdings, Electric Capital, Pantera Capital and more. Once the merger is complete, it will trade under the ticker ETHM.

The company is the latest in an emerging cohort of new entities vying to become the MicroStrategy of Ethereum by replicating the bitcoin proxy's successful accumulation strategy, but around ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rather than bitcoin.

Keys' company plans to differentiate with a focus on yield generation through "staking" rather than simply buying and holding the ether. Staking is a mechanism for generating yield by contributing to network operations around security and transaction processing.

By purchasing ether from a crypto exchange or buying shares of an ether ETF, investors would get exposure to the coin's price, "but without access to the dividend," Keys explained.

"Ether produces yield if it's properly managed," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box" Monday. "The ETFs right now don't generate yield because they don't enable staking … we're able to enable staking and we're able to do other additional risk management on top of that."

On Thursday, BlackRock filed with the SEC to include staking to its popular ETHA ether ETF, which just logged a record week of inflows.

The ability to stake makes ether a "more productive" asset than bitcoin, according to Keys.

The Bitcoin network "has one asset on it, bitcoin, that can be moved from peer to peer, but Ethereum can tokenize any asset," Keys said. It's "able to embed any type of digital asset – a bar of gold, a barrel of oil, a stock, a bond, a derivative – into digital legal agreements, and in doing so, you're able to expedite the velocity of money. You can have employment contracts that get paid by the minute, as an example."

Shares of Dynamix jumped 30% in premarket trading.

The Ether Machine follows Bitmine Immersion Technologies – the company newly chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee and more recently backed by Peter Thiel – in its ether treasury ambitions. Pantera was also a backer of Bitmine.

Also this year, SharpLink Gaming, whose board is chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, also initiated an ETH treasury strategy; and Bit Digital recently exited bitcoin mining to focus on its ETH treasury and staking plans.

Ether has taken the spotlight in crypto from bitcoin in recent months as investors anticipated the stablecoin bill known as the GENIUS Act would be signed into the first major U.S. crypto law, which President Trump did Friday. The regulatory clarity should benefit institutions and brands becoming more interested in tokenization, which includes stablecoins, most of which are issued on the Ethereum network.

Ether has doubled in the last three months and last week, ether ETFs posted a record $2.18 billion in weekly inflows.

The toxic water that gushes out of oil wells in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico has spurred environmental concerns and even earthquakes. Now the problem has become so acute that it's turning producers against one another. 

In an ongoing case in Texas' Loving County (population: 48), a New Mexico oil driller says Devon Energy Corp. and another company wrecked its reserves by flooding them with wastewater.

Bitcoin treasury companies and asset managers are absorbing flows that once passed through individual wallets. 

A relentless wave of optimism is sweeping the nearly $4 trillion crypto market, driven by a frenzy of Washington policy moves accelerating its assimilation into regulated finance. The passage of a landmark stablecoin law and broader legislative momentum have injected new legitimacy into the sector, lifting prices and rekindling risk appetite across digital assets.

Signs of retail re-engagement are resurfacing. Coinbase's app surged to fifth place in Apple's Finance category, up from 25th a month earlier, according to data tracker Sensor Tower. Google searches for “Bitcoin” are climbing. Telegram groups and Discord forums saw spirited activity during Washington's “Crypto Week,” a highly choreographed policy blitz that culminated in President Donald Trump signing the first major US stablecoin framework into law.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday suggested a review of the Federal Reserve that would go beyond the current controversy over building renovations and look at its overall function.

"What we need to do is examine the entire Federal Reserve institution and whether they have been successful," Bessent said during an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "Has the organization succeeded in its mission? If this were the [Federal Aviation Administration] and we were having this many mistakes, we would go back and look at why has this happened."

The comments come amid an intensifying conflict between the White House and the central bank. It was not clear what form a review would take or who would perform it.

Last week saw conflicting reports over whether President Donald Trump was preparing to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Reports from the White House indicated a move was forthcoming, but Trump soon after denied he is readying what would be a legally questionable maneuver.

Bessent has been at the center of the controversy, both as a potential successor at the Fed as well as reports pointing to the Treasury chief as a mediator looking to discourage Trump from ousting Powell.

"President Trump solicits a whole range of opinions and then makes a decision," Bessent said when asked about a Wall Street Journal report that he had helped convince Trump to stay his hand on Powell. "So he takes a lot of inputs, and at the end of the day it's his decision."

Trump has demanded the Fed dramatically lower its benchmark overnight borrowing rate, something that appears unlikely regardless of the chair.

In addition, the administration in recent days has criticized the Fed for cost overruns at the $2.5 billion renovation it has undertaken for two of its buildings in Washington. Administration officials reportedly are planning soon to view the project in person.

On the question of interest rates, Bessent backed the idea that the Fed probably should be easing with inflation mostly moderating.

"They were fear mongering over tariffs, and thus far we have seen very little, if any, inflation," Bessent said. "We've had great inflation numbers. So, you know, I think this idea [is] of them not being able to break out of a certain mindset. All these Ph.D.s over there, I don't know what they do."

The Fed last cut rates in December, which completed a brief easing cycle that brought the fed funds rate down a full percentage point. However, as the Fed eased both mortgage rates and Treasury yields moved higher.

Market pricing indicates the Fed probably will cut again in September.

US-China Trade War:

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the next round of US-China talks could include a discussion of China's purchases of Russian and Iranian oil, a signal that the focus could shift from more traditional trade issues to ones that cross over into matters of national security.

“Trade is in a good place,” Bessent said on CNBC, referring to recent and ongoing negotiations with China. “And I think now we can start talking about other things. The Chinese, unfortunately, are very large purchasers of sanctioned Iranian oil, sanctioned Russian oil — so we could start discussing that.”

China has started construction of the world's biggest hydroelectric dam, a project that's set to be far larger than the Three Gorges Dam — already the world's biggest single source of green power — and more expensive than the International Space Station. 

The colossal undertaking in the mountainous region of Tibet is set to cost around 1.2 trillion yuan ($167 billion), could take at least a decade to complete and would boost China's output of clean energy. It will also stir controversy over the potential impact on the local environment, and could further strain relations with its downstream neighbor, India.

Elon Musk's X on Monday denied allegations made by French authorities as part of a criminal investigation into alleged data tampering, adding that it would not submit to the prosecutor's demand to hand over data.

X's global government affairs account said the French investigation, which ramped up this month, is "politically-motivated" and designed to "restrict free speech."

"French authorities have launched a politically-motivated criminal investigation into X over the alleged manipulation of its algorithm and alleged "fraudulent data extraction," X said in a post on the social media platform. "X categorically denies these allegations."

French prosecutors started an investigation in January over allegations that the company's algorithm was being used for the purposes of foreign interference. The probe began after two complaints — one from a French member of parliament and another from a senior official at a public institution.

This month, the investigation was handed over to a key unit of France's national police. Prosecutors said the investigation would focus on investigating offences of tampering with automated data systems as well as the fraudulent extraction of data from these systems.

"French authorities have requested access to X's recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts on the platform in order for several 'experts' to analyze the data and purportedly 'uncover the truth' about the operation of the X platform," X said.

Musk's social media platform also said it, "remains in the dark as to the specific allegations made" against it.

"However, based on what we know so far, X believes that this investigation is distorting French law in order to serve a political agenda and, ultimately, restrict free speech," X said.

"For these reasons, X has not acceded to the French authorities' demands, as we have a legal right to do. This is not a decision that X takes lightly. However, in this case, the facts speak for themselves."

In an email to CNBC, a spokesperson for the Paris prosecutor's office said that it had requested that X provide its algorithm, but not access to private data, in order for investigators to "carry out a technical verification of the elements" highlighted by experts and researchers in regard to the way data is handled.

According to French law, "investigators are bound by secrecy and that only those in charge of the investigation will have access to it," the spokesperson said.

X will have a "secure process" to communicate with "guarantees of confidentiality," the spokesperson added.

In its statement, X took fire at two specific individuals. The company claimed the two "experts" who will review X's algorithm are David Chavalarias, director of the Paris Complex Systems Institute (ISC-PIF) and Maziyar Panahi, an AI platform leader at ISC-PIF.

X noted Chavalarias runs a campaign called "Escape X" which encourages users to leave the social media platform, and said Panahi "has previously participated in research projects with David Chavalarias that demonstrate open hostility towards X." Both researchers have indeed been named on a research paper related to X.

"The involvement of these individuals raises serious concerns about the impartiality, fairness, and political motivations of the investigation, to put it charitably. A predetermined outcome is not a fair one," X said.

CNBC has reached out to both Chavalarias and Panahi, and has yet to receive a comment on X's statement.

What started as a startup Cinderella story has quickly turned into a cautionary tale for future deals in Silicon Valley.

Windsurf, an AI coding company, was on the verge of being acquired by OpenAI for $3 billion, the kind of windfall startup employees dream of. But the blockbuster deal fell apart at the last minute, setting off a whirlwind of last-minute negotiations that left employees in the dark about their future.

The end result — a company split in two with its CEO and top talent getting bought out for far more than the rest of its employees.

"This breaks the Silicon Valley social contract," said Amjad Masad, CEO of Replit, a competitor to Windsurf. "This is bad for startup employees. They're going to be less likely to join startups. What's the point of joining a startup and working your ass off if you might get screwed?"

It was only a few weeks ago that the kind of life-changing event early startup employees dream about happened at Windsurf: OpenAI announced it was buying the AI-powered coding startup for $3 billion.

When he read the news, Dave Pack, a Los Angeles startup founder, opened a group chat and congratulated his friend who works at Windsurf, whom he declined to name. He joked that with his friend's sudden change in net worth, he could afford to foot the bill for their next guys' trip.

"I was really excited for him," Pack said. "He's pretty senior, so it's not like he had a small chunk of equity. When you join a company and it gets acquired for $3 billion, that's for the history books. That's a giant success in this industry."

It was not to be.

Discussions with OpenAI fizzled, and there was a new suitor: Google. But instead of acquiring Windsurf, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent and license the company's intellectual property. The hundreds of employees who remained at Windsurf were left adrift until last Monday, when Cognition sent a life raft in the form of buying what remains of the company.

"It was some of the most insane 72 hours I've seen in startup land," said Maor Fridman, a general partner at F2.

Windsurf's new CEO, Jeff Wang, took to X over the weekend to share details on the frenzied 48 hours it took for Windsurf to figure out a path forward after the OpenAI deal and to hash out the acquisition by Cognition.

"It was my job to explain to the company our path forward," Wang, who was formerly the company's head of business, wrote in a post on X.

"The mood was very bleak," Wang wrote. "Some people were upset about financial outcomes or colleagues leaving, while others were worried about the future. A few were in tears."

Terms were not disclosed, though the Cognition deal appears to be far lower than what OpenAI originally offered. Three sources estimated Cognition, which itself is only worth $4 billion, paid about $300 million in stock.

Spokespeople for Windsurf and Google declined to comment. Varun Mohan, the cofounder of Windsurf who is now part of Google; Scott Wu, cofounder and CEO of Cognition; and Jeff Wang, Windsurf's new CEO, all did not respond to requests for comment.

Cognition said "100% of Windsurf employees will participate financially" in the deal and "they will also have all vesting cliffs waived and will receive fully accelerated vesting for their work to date."

The last-ditch deal was a far better outcome for employees than many feared after the Google acquisition, but some VCs feel that the transaction sets a dangerous precedent.

"It's a pretty sad place to be," said Deedy Das, an investor at Menlo Ventures. "When you join a company, you expect decisions to be made together, so this does have a chilling effect on founding team members."

"Windsurf and others are really bad examples of founders leaving their teams behind and not even sharing the proceeds with their team," wrote storied investor Vinod Khosla on X. "I definitely would not work with their founders next time."

Traditionally, early employees are willing to accept less cash and more equity while working 100-hour weeks in the hope that they will share in the upside should their company be acquired someday.

"If an exit can happen and you don't participate in it, that's pretty bad for startup employees," said Masad. "It's just broadly bad for the startup ecosystem for these deals to be financially engineered in this way."

After the Google deal, Masad took to X to offer an olive branch, inviting Windsurf employees to decamp to Replit.

"If you were part of Windsurf and got left behind, we'd like to talk," he wrote. "We've passed on many acquisitions over the years, and any liquidity has always included employees." (Masad said he's still having "conversations" with some employees, but most have chosen to go to Cognition.)

Some Windsurf investors have also been critical of the deal. While they are happy to get some return on their investment, it's hardly the venture-style outcome they hoped for.

"The problem is that the company technically didn't actually fully realize that decacorn potential, which was the reason we invested in them," said Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures, referring to a startup worth more than $10 billion. "We would've preferred to just take a clean exit from OpenAI. That was a nice, very simple acquisition. Now this is a bit of a fucking mess."

Ramadurai is also unsettled by what the deal means for the future of the company and its employees.

"Their mojo gets thrown in the blender," Ramadurai said. "The key leaders and the engineers that get poached are all stoked, but everybody else that's left behind is in this weird purgatory situation because they have to maintain the momentum even though they lost the key talent in the leadership."

What happened at Windsurf follows other unusually structured deals for Character AI, Inflection, and Scale AI, where Big Tech companies avoided outright acquiring a company in order to gain access to its founders and top AI researchers.

In the case of Scale AI, Meta paid $14 billion for a 49 percent stake in the data labeling company and hired its founder, Alexandr Wang, to run its Superintelligence group. Meta also hired some of the startup's researchers. Last week, Scale AI laid off 14% of its workforce, or 200 employees, and revealed it is unprofitable.

Every transaction is different, and in the case of Windsurf, the company was not seen as having conventionally elite AI talent.

"Google sees Windsurf as an autonomous software engineer —an AI that's as productive as an elite full-stack team, or maybe even a department," said Danny Pantuso, an investor at Mucker Capital. "Through that lens, Google's license fee resembles an upfront payment for permanent access to this capability, similar to Microsoft's deal with OpenAI."

What all these deals have in common is that they can close quickly and avoid regulatory scrutiny — two benefits that mean this type of transaction is only going to become more common, according to Steve Brotman, managing partner at Alpha Partners.

"This isn't a one-off, it's part of a broader pattern where Big Tech hedges its bets," Brotman said. "Licensing is faster, cheaper, and less political than full-on acquisitions, especially in an environment where regulatory scrutiny is intense."

For startup employees, that makes it more important than ever to make sure they are joining the right company, according to Jake Saper, a general partner at Emergence Capital.

"Startups with unique data feeds, embedded distribution or clear recurring revenue have leverage to stay independent," Saper said. "If a company's main asset is a brilliant but portable research team, you should assume Big Tech will come knocking."

Mary Monohan, 37, saw the signs when the powers that be started reorganizing teams and switching up her assignments: Layoffs were coming.

By the time she learned her manager role was being eliminated, she'd already been searching for new opportunities. Less than a month later, she's starting to realize that she may have to be willing to make a lateral professional move or even "a few thousand dollars less than I was making before," she told Business Insider.

Millennials in management are in a tough spot. Caught somewhere between entry-level roles and the C-suite, they're especially vulnerable to the Great Flattening, a trend of eliminating middle managers brought on by companies' desires to cut costs and bureaucracy. Those who are let go may have to accept lower pay or titles in their next role, while those who remain are left to take on extra responsibilities and reports.

Daniel Radmanovic, 40, was laid off from his managerial position at Deloitte in October. He started actively job searching in January and said it was a "soul-sucking learning experience."

However, on Friday, Radmanovic received a verbal job offer from a Fortune 500 company. He described it as a "pivot" because he'll be in a client-facing individual contributor role and not managing people, but it isn't a step back since he's excited to embrace the change.

"I can just focus on my job and my clients," he told Business Insider, adding, "I can't tell you how excited I am to be getting this role."

Many older millennials have found themselves caught in the Great Flattening.

Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform, found that 35- to 44-year-olds are being hardest hit by manager firings or layoffs at 8,500 of its small and midsize business clients. Layoffs among that age group of managers rose more than 400% between January 2022 and September 2024, compared to a decline of 48% for 55- to 64-year-olds.

Managers who survive the layoffs face another problem: a growing pool of direct reports. Gusto data showed that individual contributors per people manager nearly doubled from 3.2 in January 2019 to 5.8 in September 2024, based on the sample of small and midsize businesses analyzed. This means that many of today's managers have to balance a growing slate of 1:1 meetings, staff questions, and paperwork.

In Monohan's experience, having a good manager is important for people's experience at work, especially for an entry-level worker.

"Your manager plays a huge role in getting you promoted, getting you seen, getting you a raise, a bonus," Monohan said. "I've worked hard as a manager to try and get people that worked under me recognized, and sometimes it could take six months or longer to get them the bonus or the recognition that they deserve."

She added that she's not sure what will happen with some of her outstanding duties, like her former report's performance review.

"There are these open threads," she said. "You're just hoping companies are going to be able to pick up the pieces and move forward with, when it comes to the people you were managing."

The job market isn't all doom and gloom for millennials. The US rate of layoffs and discharges is still low. Plus, the unemployment rate for 35- to 44-year-olds continues to be lower than the overall unemployment rate — 3.2% compared to 4.1% in June.

Monohan is confident her past experience will lead to a job, but is worried about how soon she can get one and the lack of opportunities available.

"As a single person without a second income or healthcare plan to fall back on, I have to know my worth but also face the realities of how long I can be out of work without having to move in with family or make dramatic life changes," Monohan said.

She said she can't be picky in the current job market. She's open to individual contributor roles, but would ideally get another manager job. In the meantime, she's been networking and might take on some contract work. Others in her position have told BI they are settling for work they feel overqualified for to pay the bills.

Radmanovic recommends not going through the job search process alone, if possible. He said he frequently talked to another laid-off Deloitte worker. They gave each other advice, helped with interview preparation, and commiserated during the process. Radmanovic already told the former coworker the good news about the job offer and hopes they will land one soon.

"Sometimes it's nice to just vent with somebody that's going through that as well," Radmanovic said.

China's exports of rare-earth magnets to the United States in June surged more than seven times from the prior month, as American firms clamor to get hold of the critical elements following a preliminary Sino-U.S. trade deal.

In April, Beijing placed restrictions on several critical magnets, used in advanced tech such as electric vehicles, wind turbines and MRI machines, requiring firms to receive licenses for export. The move was seen as retaliation against U.S. President Donald Trump's steep tariffs on China. 

Beijing has a stranglehold on the production of rare-earth magnets, with an estimated 90% of the market, as well as a similar hold on the refining of rare-earth elements, which are used to make magnets. 

The U.S. received about 353 metric tons of rare-earth permanent magnets in June, up 660% from the previous month, data released by China's General Administration of Customs showed, though the exports were about half that from June last year.

The U.S. was the second-largest destination for China's rare-earth magnets, behind Germany, as it relies heavily on their imports for its large manufacturing sector, particularly automotive, electronics and renewable energy. 

In total, China exported 3,188 metric tons of rare earth permanent magnets globally last month, up nearly 160% from May, but 38% lower compared with the same period last year.

The growth in exports came after Washington and Beijing agreed last month on a trade framework that included easing controls on Chinese rare-earth exports as well as a rollback of some American tech restrictions for shipments to China. 

AI behemoth Nvidia said last week it was planning to resume shipments of its H20 AI chips to China, after the exports were restricted in April. Last month, controls on American AI chip software companies' business in China had also been rolled back.

Chinese rare-earth magnet producers started announcing the approval of export licenses last month.

If exports continue to increase, it will be of great benefit to companies that have been suffering from shortages of magnets due to the lengthy time required to secure export licenses. For example, several European auto-parts suppliers were forced to halt production in recent months. 

The magnet shortages had also hit emerging industries such as humanoid robotics. In April, Elon Musk said production of Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots had been disrupted. 

China's controls on its rare-earths sector have prompted some global governments to reexamine their rare-earth supply chains and search for ways to support domestic mining of the minerals. 

However, experts say that setting up alternatives to China's rare-earth magnet supply chain could take years, as it requires an intricate process of rare-earth element refining and separation. 

"The separation process is quite complex, and China has a lot of advantages in this after putting in decades of research into the processes," Yue Wang, a senior consultant of rare earths at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC last month. 

One way that the U.S. has been trying to compensate for lack of rare-earth magnets is through increased recycling. Apple and miner MP Materials announced a $500 million deal last week for the development of a recycling facility that will reinforce the iPhone maker's U.S. magnet supply chain.

Peter Alexander from financial consultancy Z-ben Advisors said that Washington's latest concessions on tech restrictions were a reflection of just how much leverage China has in its trade relationship with the United States, speaking on CNBC's "China Connection" on Monday.

The Kremlin is building its way toward a reality where it can soon launch 2,000 Shahed one-way attack drones in one night, according to two recent Western assessments.

Maj. Gen. Christian Freuding, the German defense ministry's commander of planning and command staff, said in a Bundeswehr interview aired on Saturday that Russia was "striving to further increase production capacity" of its Shaheds.

"They want to expand the drone attacks we just talked about," Freuding said. "The ambition is to be able to deploy 2,000 drones simultaneously."

"We need to consider intelligent countermeasures," he added.

In a separate assessment on Sunday, the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, wrote that Russia's per-night use of Shahed drones increased by 31% each month in June and July.

"ISW assesses that Russia may be able to launch up to 2,000 drones in one night by November 2025, should this current growth trend in drone usage continue," its analysts wrote.

However, they added that Russia likely wouldn't be able to consistently sustain 2,000 drone launches per day.

Still, such capacity would be a stark jump from the fall of 2024, when Russia was launching roughly 2,000 drones a month at Ukraine.

Shaheds are long-range Iranian exploding drones with estimated ranges of 600 to 1,200 miles, depending on the design. This year, Russia has continually increased the number of Shaheds and decoy drones it launches a night at Ukraine, recently peaking at 728 uncrewed aerial vehicles in one salvo earlier this month.

As these numbers surge, Ukraine and its allies fear that Russia's nightly attacks will overwhelm Kyiv's air defenses.

"There will be 1,000 units per day and more. I'm not trying to scare anyone," wrote Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, wrote on July 4 about Russia's Shahed capacity.

The Shahed is of Iranian design, but Russia has also been manufacturing its own versions of the drone locally in the Yelabuga Special Economic Zone since early 2023. Western governments and analysts say some vital parts for production come from China.

In April, analysts from the International Institute for Strategic Studies wrote that satellite imagery showed that the area of Shahed-producing facilities has doubled since 2023.

"Despite a steady flow of Shahed-136s from Iran, Moscow is heavily investing in its own production facilities," the IISS analysts wrote.

Ukraine has periodically tried to strike Yelabuga with its own long-range fixed-wing drones, but it's unclear if the factories have sustained any significant damage.

Kyiv's military intelligence also said in February that it had found production markings on some attack drones that mention the city of Izhevsk, possibly pointing to another production line there.

Freuding, the German general, said that against such quantity, it would be nonsensical to rely on expensive Western interceptors such as the Patriot system to destroy Shaheds.

"We essentially need countermeasures that cost two, three, four thousand euros," he said. By comparison, a single Patriot system costs the US government $1.1 billion, and one of its missiles can cost about $4 million.

Ukraine now uses a multilayered air defense network against Shahed waves, including surface-to-air missiles, air-launched missiles, and mobile fire groups that try to shoot down the Iranian drones with machine guns. A locally made interceptor drone, the Sting, is becoming popular, too.

But Russia also fires ballistic missiles in tandem with the Shahed drones, and these require more advanced, long-range air defenses such as the Patriot to intercept. Kyiv is trying to persuade the US and its allies to provide it with more Patriot systems.

Not even big offers from Meta were enough to tempt the team at Anthropic, said the AI startup's cofounder, Benjamin Mann.

"It's not a hard choice," Mann said on an episode of "Lenny's Podcast" published Sunday.

Other AI startups have seen key talent poached by mega paydays.

"I think we've been maybe much less affected than many of the other companies in the space because people here are so mission-oriented," he said. "They get these offers and then they say, 'Well, of course I'm not going to leave because my best case scenario at Meta is that we make money, and my best case at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity."

Mann also said he doesn't blame anyone who takes those "mega offers." 

"Other people have different life circumstances," he said.

His comments come as tech giants like Meta and OpenAI engage in a fierce talent war, offering massive payouts to top AI researchers.

"I'm pretty sure it's real," Mann said, referring to Meta's $100 million signing bonuses offered to AI engineers.

"To pay individuals like $100 million over a four-year package, that's actually pretty cheap compared to the value created for the business," he said. "We're just in an unprecedented era of scale, and it's only going to get crazier."

Mann also said that he and several other leaders left OpenAI in 2020 to start Anthropic because "safety wasn't the top priority there."

A former researcher told Fortune last year that nearly half of OpenAI's safety team had exited.

"People who are primarily focused on thinking about AGI safety and preparedness are being increasingly marginalized," said Daniel Kokotajlo, a former governance researcher.

OpenAI said safety remains central to its mission. "Our responsibility to prepare for emerging security threats to users, customers, and global communities shapes everything we do," the company said on its website.

The tech giant added that its API and ChatGPT products undergo routine third-party testing to "identify security weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors."

Mann, Anthropic, and OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Big Tech has always paid top dollar for elite talent, but the latest AI hiring frenzy has taken things to a whole new level, as BI previously reported.

It started when Meta recruited Scale's CEO, Alexandr Wang, last month as part of a $14.3 billion deal to take a 49% stake in his company. Then, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said Meta had tried to poach his best employees with $100 million signing bonuses. Meta pushed back, saying that the signing bonuses were not that generous.

Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced last month that Wang would co-lead a new superintelligence unit with six top researchers from OpenAI.

The bidding war for top AI talent has been likened to sports franchises competing for star athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo.

Perplexity's CEO, Aravind Srinivas, said on a podcast published Thursday that Big Tech companies need to ensure that employees are motivated by mission as well as money.

"You're encountering new kinds of challenges. You feel a lot of growth, you're learning new things. And you're getting richer, too, along the way. Why would you want to go just because you have some guaranteed payments?" he said.

Srinivas also said that he was "surprised by the magnitude" of the salaries Zuckerberg is reportedly offering to top AI researchers, adding that it "seems like it's needed at this point for them."

With the massive salaries, "failure is not an option" for Meta's new team, Srinivas said.

Stock markets are shrugging off major risks and smashing records — so much so that even seasoned investors are scratching their heads.

On Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 closed little changed after notching record highs on Thursday. Both indexes are hovering near the all-time highs they reached earlier this month, continuing a rebound after the post-"Liberation Day" sell-off.

That rebound has stunned analysts, given the pile-up of macro risks, particularly President Donald Trump's ongoing threats to impose steep tariffs on key trading partners. Yet investors keep piling in — even if many are doing so with one eye on the exit.

"In many ways, this is a rally that really no one's had much conviction in it," Andrew Pease, the Asia Pacific head of investments for Russell Investments, told Business Insider.

He said the firm's analysis shows investors are neutral, not euphoric.

"Everyone's very wary about this particular rally," Pease said.

Wall Street veterans have spent months warning that investors may be underestimating the risks.

"Unfortunately, I think there is complacency in the markets," JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon, said earlier in July, referring to tariffs.

Those concerns may soon be put to the test. Trump's proposed levies on trading partners — ranging from 10% to 70% — threaten to disrupt supply chains, fuel inflation, and slow global growth.

"I think the market is too complacent about the damage of such high tariffs on both the US and the global economy," said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.

It's not just tariffs that suggest trouble could be brewing. China's economic slowdown, Middle East tensions, and softening US data all suggest trouble could be brewing.

So why are stocks still surging?

Despite inflationary concerns tied to Trump's tariff threats, the US economy remains on solid footing. As BI's Jennifer Sor recently reported, recession fears are fading.

Big banks kicked off earnings season on a strong note last week.

The consumer "basically seems to be fine," JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum, said on an earnings call on July 15.

That's despite some cracks in the data. US GDP contracted 0.5% in the third quarter, and consumer spending growth slowed to 0.5% in Q1 — down sharply from 4% in Q4 2024.

But retail sales rose 0.6% in June from May and the job market remains robust. The US added 147,000 jobs in June, well above expectations, while unemployment dipped to 4.1% from 4.2%.

American consumers are, as top CEOs said recently, "a little numb" to tariffs and "very resilient," even as inflation ticks up.

Some investors are leaning on the "TACO trade" — short for "Trump Always Chickens Out."

Markets are increasingly assuming that Trump's tariff threats are more talk than action.

"Finally, the market is not wrong in pricing in a good chance that Trump will not follow through with his latest tariff threats, instead settling for some deal by 1 August," wrote Davide Oneglia, the director of European and global macro at Global Data.TS Lombard, on July 16, referring to the trade deadline.

Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, agreed: "The prevailing view among investors seems to be that these tariff threats are more bark than bite — a negotiating tactic rather than a firm policy stance."

That's created what analysts call "asymmetry:" Markets could keep rising if talks go well, but they are vulnerable to sharp corrections if discussions break down.

Even as risks loom, traders don't want to miss out. That's fueling what analysts describe as a combination of FOMO, or fear of missing out, and MOMO, or momentum-based trading.

Retail traders have been jumping back in, chasing gains as indexes push higher, even if they missed the earlier run-up.

"MOMO and FOMO" are likely to dominate until proven otherwise," wrote Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, in a June 30 note.

"Newton's First Law applies: A body (market) that is in motion will stay in motion until acted upon by an external source," he added.

Sosnick said that implied volatility remains low, even as risks mount, suggesting investors are choosing to look past potential trouble.

Pease at Russell Investments agreed that momentum could unravel quickly — but only if there's a clear macro shock.

The Federal Reserve has signaled it could cut rates another two times this year — a boon for stocks.

Lower rates reduce bond yields, making equities more attractive. They also encourage borrowing and investment.

But rising inflation could complicate that path. In June, US inflation climbed 2.7% from a year ago, up from 2.4% in May.

Dimon warned that the Fed might still hike if inflation proves sticky. He sees a 40% to 50% chance of another increase this cycle.

AI hype continues to drive the market, especially Big Tech.

"AI is still the dominant theme, particularly as the Big Tech companies are giving solid earnings guidance and other companies are joining in as well, then that's the world in which you could see that this rally has further to go," Pease said, while cautioning that gains could become overdone.

Bank of America's latest global fund manager survey, published July 15, shows 40% of respondents already see productivity gains from AI adoption. Another 21% expect gains within the next year.

Despite the optimism, there's unease under the surface.

Summer trading is thinner, meaning volatility can spike quickly. Last year's yen carry trade unwind is a fresh reminder that things can turn fast.

Trump's tariff threats are still on the table, but Oneglia thinks markets are right to be relatively unfazed.

"Negotiations have not broken down and the market is acting rationally — at least on this," Oneglia wrote.

Still, others are more cautious.

"Ultimately, markets are at a crossroads," wrote Capital.com's Hathorn.

"The rally, particularly in US equities, has been driven by optimism and underpinned by assumptions about political behavior."

Until August, market asymmetry remains, so there's "room to rise on good news, but the potential for a swift and severe correction if trade tensions escalate," Hathorn added.

 It's not surprising that asset tokenization is becoming more popular as more services and industries move online. Blockchains—digital ledgers or shared systems across a network—are most well-known for their use in cryptocurrency. However, the flexibility and speed offered by asset tokenization are moving to the housing market, attracting young investors who may want to quickly transfer shares. Not only are shares in housing digitized, but using them can also reduce costs and prevent fraud.


 If you own real estate and tokenize it, you're representing your property with digital tokens that can be bought, sold, or traded on real estate platforms. You're not limited to residential real estate, either; you can sell commercial properties, land, or mixed-use developments. Once you determine which property you want to tokenize, you'll decide to use a non-fungible token (NFT) for whole ownership or fungible tokens for fractional ownership. Select your blockchain platform and verify the assets before you begin trading. Tokenized real estate can reduce barriers to getting into the real estate market, which makes it attractive to young investors.


 There's a lot to dislike about the traditional housing market, but investors will find a lot to like about tokenized real estate.


 Before you rush to invest in tokenized real estate, be aware that there are some drawbacks to consider.


 Although tokenized real estate may not be for everyone, this way of investing in the real estate market is becoming increasingly popular. You can quickly purchase fractional tokens in a property and begin earning income, while automatic processes make it easy to manage your investments. If you're unsure where to begin, talk to a trusted financial advisor about getting started.

For crypto traders, it's been a good week to be in XRP, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. Or just about anything else for that matter, but these three coins in particular have really stood out, given Bitcoin's relatively modest performance over the last seven days.

What's going on, and what do the charts suggest about XRP, ETH, and DOGE going forward? Let's dive in:

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing one of its most explosive rallies since 2021, with total market capitalization surging above $4 trillion once again for only the second time ever, after briefly touching this milestone last week. It comes as Bitcoin shattered its previous all-time high, reaching $122,838 on July 14, igniting heavy bullish sentiment among crypto permabulls.

The broader macroeconomic picture is also looking optimistic for investors. The S&P 500 keeps flirting with 6,000 points while oil prices remain relatively stable around $76 per barrel despite ongoing Middle East tensions. More importantly, the passage and signing of the GENIUS Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States, is seen as a step in the right direction for institutional investors who have been craving for regulatory clarity for years.

This perfect storm of favorable conditions has ignited a new Alt Season, with its own Index surging to 59 points, just 2 points below the yearly high registered on January 30.

Ethereum has emerged as the star performer among major cryptocurrencies, posting an impressive 25.7% gain over the past week to reach $3,843 before correcting to its current levels around $3769. This surge seems to be backed by serious institutional muscle, with spot ETH ETFs attracting $2.2 billion in weekly inflows.

On Myriad on Linea, a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company Dastan on the Ethereum layer-two network Linea, predictors are not overly bullish in the short term. Myriad users place the odds at just 40% that Ethereum breaks past the psychological resistance of $4K per coin by July 25.

Conversely, Myriad traders are more certain than not, placing the odds at 63%, that Ethereum hits a new all-time high (above $4,891) before the end of the year.

The technical picture for Ethereum is interesting. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, sits at a red-hot 70, indicating extreme bullish momentum. Think of RSI as a speedometer for price momentum—when it's this high, it means buyers are stepping on the gas pedal hard. While RSI readings above 70 typically signal overbought conditions that might concern day traders, in the context of a major breakout, this actually confirms genuine buying pressure rather than mere speculation.

Considering the high readings, traders might consider setting up stop loss levels near current prices, to avoid possible mass liquidations, while still gaining exposure to possible bullish pressure considering the majority of the indicators point towards a greener future for the coin.

The Average Directional Index, or ADX, at 22 is approaching the crucial 25 threshold. ADX measures trend strength regardless of direction. An ADX below 20 indicates no clear trend while readings above 25 confirm a strong directional move is underway. For Ethereum, this suggests we're on the verge of a sustained rally rather than a flash in the pan.

It also points to a trend not being strong enough to prevent a small correction. This may happen without affecting the overall bullish movement.

Most importantly, Ethereum's price action relative to its Exponential Moving Averages tells a bullish story. Moving averages take the average price of an asset over a given period of time. And ETH is currently trading well above both the 50-day EMA ($2,888) and the 200-day EMA (lower). The expanding gap between these averages—known as moving average divergence—typically precedes multi-month trending moves. When short-term averages pull away from long-term ones like this, it's like a rubber band stretching before a powerful snap higher.

The Squeeze Momentum Indicator—which measures whether markets are in periods of contraction before massive movements—has also fired bullish, suggesting that after a period of consolidation, volatility is expanding in the bulls' favor.

Key Levels:

XRP's 20.9% weekly surge to $3.52 is a complete redemption arc for a cryptocurrency that's been trapped in regulatory purgatory since 2018. The token finally broke above its previous all-time high of $3.40, entering true price discovery mode for the first time in seven years.

The technical setup for XRP is fascinating. The weekly charts look like something unnatural for a serious investment: flat for years, then a parabolic explosion out of nowhere. But that's the nature of crypto

The RSI at 71 on the weekly chart sits right at the overbought threshold, but context is crucial here. After years of sideways action, such readings may mark the beginning of a trend rather than its end. It's like a coiled spring finally releasing—the initial burst might seem extreme, but there's years of pent-up energy behind it.

The ADX reading of 20 might seem weak compared to other indicators, but for XRP, this actually makes sense. After trading sideways for so long, trend strength indicators naturally reset to low levels, making it hard to overcome in months what has been the standard for more than half a decade. The fact that it's climbing toward 25 suggests a new trend is just beginning to establish itself.

XRP's moving average configuration provides the most bullish signal. The 50-week EMA sits well below current levels, and the gap to the 200-week EMA continues to expand. On weekly timeframes, this widening differential typically precedes multi-month trending moves, as it reflects sustained accumulation by long-term holders rather than short-term speculation.

Key Levels:

Dogecoin's 33.5% weekly explosion to $0.274 made it the best performing meme coin in the top 100 after Floki. The meme coin is undergoing a fundamental transformation, highlighted by Nasdaq-listed Bit Origin's announcement of a $500 million DOGE treasury strategy, with an initial $40.5 million purchase already completed.

The technical indicators for DOGE are also showing bullish momentum. The RSI at 61 shows strong buying pressure without being overextended—it's in what traders call the "sweet spot" where trends can run for extended periods.

The ADX at 16 means the bullish spike is actually a weak movement, but remember that DOGE was stuck in a prolonged downtrend. Low ADX readings after a strong move often indicate consolidation before the next leg higher. If you're a DOGE trader, it might be a good idea to monitor this indicator in the upcoming days for more accurate readings.

What's particularly interesting is the Squeeze Momentum Indicator showing "on" status, indicating that volatility is compressed and ready to expand. This may point to bulls failing to keep up after reaching a price resistance, but with DOGE successfully breaking past a double bottom (an usually bullish pattern in which prices bounce twice in a resistance, and the 200-period EMA forming a “W” shape), conventional wisdom here suggests it should struggle but maintain its course for a few more weeks at least.

The 50-day EMA around $0.20 now acts as immediate support, with the 200-day EMA providing a floor near $0.15. The fact that DOGE is trading above both with expanding distance between them confirms the bullish market structure.

Trump Media and Technology Group said Monday it has accumulated roughly $2 billion in bitcoin and related assets, as President Donald Trump's highly lucrative pivot to crypto continues to grow his net worth while in office.

The bitcoin holdings now account for about two-thirds of Trump Media's total liquid assets, the company said in a press release.

Trump Media shares popped as high as 9% when markets opened Monday morning. They were up around 4% at 2 p.m. ET.

Trump's stake in the company — which trades on the Nasdaq under his initials, DJT — is worth nearly $2.3 billion.

The announcement offered the latest marker of how Trump and his family have embraced digital currency to such a degree that crypto now accounts for most of the president's wealth on paper, according to a Forbes analysis from June.

Trump, once a digital-currency skeptic, has vowed to make the U.S. the world's crypto capital. He has already taken multiple steps in that direction by signing an executive order to establish a "strategic bitcoin reserve," appointing a "crypto czar" and urging Congress to pass multiple crypto-related bills.

Trump on Friday signed one of those bills, the GENIUS Act, into law after it passed with bipartisan support in the House.

Trump has made millions more off of other crypto ventures, including the decentralized finance entity World Liberty Financial and the meme coin $TRUMP, whose initial coin release came just days before his inauguration.

The Trump family, which owns much of World Liberty through a business entity, has made about $500 million since the venture's launch in September, according to a Reuters analysis.

Trump's spokespeople have said that the president's connection to World Liberty does not create a conflict of interest because his assets are in a trust that is currently managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr.

But assets in that revocable trust still belong "indirectly" to the president, who is the trust's grantor and its sole beneficiary. And the funds would be available to him after he leaves office in 2029.

Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts, warn that Trump's crypto interests and his political power create an environment ripe for corruption.

"As a stakeholder in crypto assets, President Trump will likely profit from the very policies he is pursuing," the advocacy group Democracy Defenders Fund said in a report in April.

Before taking office in January, Trump transferred all of DJT shares to a revocable trust managed by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Some experts were unconvinced Trump was eliminating conflict-of-interest concerns by removing himself from direct control of the shares.

Since then, Trump Media has effectively redefined itself as a crypto and financial services company.

The company's first product was the Twitter-like social media platform Truth Social, which is used by Trump but has failed to generate much revenue. The company, which went public last year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, nevertheless attracted thousands of retail investors

In late January, the company announced a FinTech brand called Truth.Fi, boosted by a $250 million allocation in investments including bitcoin and exchange-traded funds.

In February, the company began pursuing what it called a "strategic acquisition fund with select investors," and in March it inked a partnership with Crypto.com to launch a series of ETFs.

In late May, the company said it raised over $2.3 billion in net proceeds from selling stock and convertible notes to about 50 institutional investors, and that it would those funds to build a bitcoin treasury.

Trump Media's announcement Monday morning came less than a week after bitcoin hit an all-time high, making it by far the world's most valuable and popular cryptocurrency.

The asset jumped past $120,000 as investors anticipated Congress would pass new U.S. crypto legislation to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the nascent industry.

"We're rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan," Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in Monday's release.

"These assets help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere," Nunes said.

In late May, the company said it raised over $2.3 billion in net proceeds from selling stock and convertible notes to about 50 institutional investors, and that it would those funds to build a bitcoin treasury.

Trump Media's announcement Monday morning came less than a week after bitcoin hit an all-time high, making it by far the world's most valuable and popular cryptocurrency.

The asset jumped past $120,000 as investors anticipated Congress would pass new U.S. crypto legislation to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the nascent industry.

"We're rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan," Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in Monday's release.

"These assets help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere," Nunes said.

Oops, something went wrong

It's not just bitcoin (BTC-USD) that corporate treasuries are buying. A handful of firms are scooping up ethereum — or its native token, ether (ETH-USD) — as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets.

So far, the companies taking this approach are mainly smaller names in the crypto world, such as BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee. One larger player — Coinbase Global (COIN), the parent company of trading network Coinbase — has more than $440 million in holdings, according to crypto and investment tracker CoinGecko.

When Coinbase announced in a 2021 blog post that it would become the first publicly traded company to hold ethereum and other assets, in addition to bitcoin, it stated, "We believe that in the future, more and more companies will hold crypto assets on their balance sheet."

Ethereum has surged 60% over the past month to hover near $3,800, its highest level since January. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has yet to reclaim its 2021 high north of $4,600.

Ethereum allows developers to write programs or contracts that run entirely on its blockchain, or network. It currently leads as the dominant infrastructure that allows businesses and consumers to transact with each other directly without banks, with a market share of more than 51%.

"Ethereum lets anyone — whether it's a crypto project, a factory, an artist, an influencer — create their own token and thus their own community and incentivize communities with an economy basically," Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto marketplace NoOnes, told Yahoo Finance.

He called tokenization ethereum's "killer app."

"You could argue it has more utility than bitcoin," he said.

That utility is why firms like BitMine and SharpLink Gaming have increasingly been raising capital to buy ETH, similar to how Strategy (MSTR) and a slew of other companies have added bitcoin to their balance sheets in recent months.

As with bitcoin, the approach can be risky due to volatile prices. Ethereum prices tumbled in April when President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement roiled markets. The rewards have not been as high as those that bitcoin has offered either: The return on ethereum year to date is 14%, versus bitcoin's 26%.

Crypto miner BitMine Immersion Technologies recently announced it holds more than $1 billion in ethereum, or roughly 300,000 tokens. The company, which went public on June 5, has positioned itself as a pure-play on ethereum, betting that owning it is akin to owning the underlying infrastructure behind the convergence of crypto and financial services.

"Acquiring $1 billion of ETH1 is a clear signal of our conviction in ethereum's long-term value," Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine, said in the press release announcing the news. He noted that the company was "committed to Ethereum's continued growth."

BitMine shares surged 25% in one session last week after an SEC filing revealed that billionaire Peter Thiel purchased 9.1% of the firm's common stock through his investment funds.

Gaming and sports betting company SharpLink Gaming (SBET) and blockchain tech firm BTCS (BTCS) have also pursued similar treasury strategies. Shares of each are up nearly 200% over the past month.

Earlier this month, computing firm Bit Digital (BTBT) announced that it had shifted its entire treasury from bitcoin to ethereum.

"We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system," Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital, said in a press release. Year to date, the stock is up 17%.

Ethereum's surge coincides with the GENIUS Act, landmark legislation signed by President Trump last Friday, moving through Congress. The new law regulates stablecoins, digital tokens backed by assets like the US dollar and short-term treasuries.

Optimism over stablecoin's adoption has sent shares of issuer Circle (CRCL) up more than 600% since its IPO on June 5. The company's USD Coins (USDC-USD) run on ethereum.

"If real companies and institutional investors are innovating on the blockchain, doesn't that make blockchain networks, and by implication, blockchain network assets (e.g ETH) valuable?" Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani asked in a note last month. "Any company that uses stablecoin tech pays transaction fees to the Ethereum network."

To be sure, not all companies see the same value in ethereum as they do in bitcoin.

When asked directly whether Strategy would add ETH to its holdings, executive chairman Michael Saylor said in an interview with The Street, "MicroStrategy wouldn't because MicroStrategy is 150% Bitcoin. We do Bitcoin, we're 150% Bitcoin. We're going to be Bitcoin. And the only thing I like more than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin."

Indeed, ethereum is by no means replacing bitcoin as the investment of choice for companies, Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance. Consider it an adjacent strategy.

"I don't want people to misconstrue this movement from treasury companies to be viewed [as] ETH is replacing bitcoin. It's just blockchain technology applied in a different way for a different use case," Farrell said. "These companies are just capitalizing on the real world asset [tokenization] trends."

Another firm dedicated to generating Ethereum is making its Nasdaq debut, starting with a $1.5 billion stockpile of the asset, The Ether Machine said in a press release on Monday.

The company, which is the product of a business combination agreement between The Ether Reserve and Dynamix Corporation, said it will begin operating with 400,000 Ethereum and plans on growing that stash through staking and decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.

Dynamix Corporation's shares jumped 36% to $14.20 on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance. Once the deal is completed, The Ether Machine will trade under the ticker symbol “ETHM.”

The Ether Machine said that it received an anchor investment of 170,000 Ethereum worth $645 million from its co-founder and chair, Andrew Keys, who previously served as global head of business development for crypto software giant Consensys. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

The company said that it secured $800 million in a deal that included participation from crypto exchanges Blockchain.com and Kraken and venture capital firm Pantera Capital, among others.

With 400,000 Ethereum, The Ether Machine would be the asset's largest holder among entities that have joined the so-called Strategic Ethereum Reserve. 

That includes the non-profit Ethereum Foundation and treasury firms Bitmine Immersion Technologies, which is being chaired by Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, and SharpLink Gaming, which is being chaired by Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin.

Those firms have also said that they will grow the amount of Ethereum owned per fully diluted share by staking Ethereum and earning rewards from validating transactions on Ethereum's network. In a statement, Keys noted that The Ether Machine will be staffed by people with deep knowledge of staking and DeFi as well.

“We have assembled a team of ‘Ethereum Avengers' to actively manage and unlock yields to levels we believe will be market-leading for investors,” Keys said.

Although the company's business may resemble that of some crypto treasury firms, The Ether Machine bills itself as a “strategic Ethereum generation company.”

Shares of Ethereum treasury firms have leaped as the asset's price has jumped to its highest since December. On Monday, the altcoin was recently changing hands around $3,850, adding onto a 27% price increase over the past week, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the social media company owned by President Trump, said it has bought about $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities as it remodels itself as an investment firm. 

Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, announced in May that it planned to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, with the goal of creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency. The $2 billion bitcoin purchase is part of the company's "bitcoin treasury plan," Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a news release on Monday.

Mr. Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies both through his private businesses and his administration. The company's $2 billion bitcoin purchase comes as Trump Media looks to roll out a range investment products, including a plan to sell exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

The bitcoin purchase will "help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere," Nunes said in a statement.

The company also said it has set aside $300 million for an "options acquisition strategy for bitcoin-related securities." Trump Media said it plans to continue acquiring bitcoin.

Shares of Trump Media rose $1.04, or 5.6%, to $19.71 in Monday morning trading. The stock has declined 42% ths year. 

For the first quarter, Trump Media reported revenue of roughly $821,000, up from $770,000 in the year-ago period, a regulatory filing shows. The company reported an operating loss for the quarter of $39.5 million, down from $98.3 million from a year ago.

A crypto treasury strategy involves buying and holding cryptocurrencies, similar to how companies may invest in more traditional assets like bonds to provide them with financial flexibility. 

The best-known advocate of this approach is billionaire Michael Saylor, who runs a software company called Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy). It owns 607,000 bitcoins – worth more than $72 billion at today's bitcoin price — making it the largest public bitcoin treasury company, according to Bitcointreasuries.net.

Saylor's company uses a variety of strategies, such as selling shares or issuing debt, to keep expanding its bitcoin holdings. As the digital currency's price has soared to more than $118,000, shooting up 74% over the last year alone, Strategy's stock price has followed, surging more than 3,500% since 2020.

That success has also spawned many imitators, while the White House invited him to its Digital Assets Summit earlier this year. 

The Trump administration is planning a new U.S. "strategic reserve" of crypto assets. Last week, Mr. Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency.

"For the past five years, the only thing better than Bitcoin is More Bitcoin," Saylor wrote in a July 17 social media post.

 Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) has amassed roughly $2 billion in bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities, as its founder, President Donald Trump, has worked to reshape American crypto policy.


 The Truth Social parent said it plans to keep buying bitcoin, and allocated $300 million to an options acquisition strategy for bitcoin-related securities. The company's bitcoin and related holdings make up about two-thirds of its $3 billion in liquid assets. 


 Trump Media has also filed in recent weeks to launch a trio of crypto exchange-traded funds that invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The ETFs are expected to launch later this year in partnership with Crypto.com.


 Bitcoin traded near $119,000 Monday, days after the president signed the pro-stablecoin GENIUS Act into law and two other crypto-related bills passed in the U.S. House.


 
Strategy (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, bought 6,220 bitcoin last week in its latest round of crypto purchases, according to a regulatory filing. The company's holdings have climbed to a whopping 607,770 bitcoin, worth $72.32 billion at Bitcoin's current price. 


 The price of Bitcoin has jumped by one-third over the past three months and hit a record high of more than $123,000 last week.

Morocco's central bank is advancing its work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), having recently completed its first test involving peer-to-peer (P2P) retail payments, Bank Al-Maghrib Governor Abdellatif Jouahri announced Monday in Rabat.

Speaking at the opening of the 2025 Continental Conference of the Association of African Central Banks, Jouahri revealed that a second test is underway. This new trial focuses on cross-border transfers, in partnership with the Central Bank of Egypt and with support from the World Bank.

He explained that the CBDC, as a sovereign currency, could serve as a digital payment option for both wholesale and retail use. The broader project is being supported by ongoing studies and analyses covering legal and regulatory frameworks.

«Like other countries on the continent, we at Bank Al-Maghrib have conducted studies, supported by the World Bank and IMF, on issuing a CBDC. These studies focused on defining the strategic objectives of the currency, its potential macroeconomic impacts, and its implications for the payment system», Jouahri said.

Regarding cryptocurrencies, Jouahri confirmed that a draft law has been finalized to establish a legal framework for their use. The goal is to ensure adequate consumer and investor protection, enhance market integrity, combat fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing, and maintain financial stability.

He stressed the need for regulators, including central banks, to define a legal framework for digital assets and stablecoins, which, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), do not meet the characteristics of legal tender.

«These instruments carry particular risks, notably in relation to money laundering and the erosion of financial intermediation, which could harm the integrity and resilience of the financial system», he warned.

Meme coins are dominating the market, with Dogecoin's value increasing by 19% over the past seven days, while Bonk's value has rallied by 43%. While these meme coins surge, TOKEN6900 (T6900) is gaining attention among emerging altcoins.

This new crypto coin's ICO surpassed the $680K mark. It is riding the wave of crypto humor and bringing the playful spirit back to the market. Here is an overview of this altcoin gaining community interest.



Investors are used to seeing serious roadmaps and token utility, but TOKEN6900 (T6900) flips that on its head. T6900 is a meme coin with a sarcastic approach.

This new crypto coin points out the illusion of financial system growth, the delusions of overnight success, and the irony of investing hype itself. People will either love it or hate it, and that divisiveness is exactly what's fueling its popularity.

The hard cap is set at $5 million USD, and TOKEN6900 ICO 2025 has raised over $680K, indicating investor interest. There will be a total of 930,993,091 T6900 tokens. The starting price was $0.006400, while the final price during the presale will be $0.007125.

With no utilities or fundamentals, TOKEN6900 gives investors a glimpse into the brain rot of finance and is gaining attention in the community.



If you're wondering how a meme coin without utility can be one of the notable altcoins to buy now, stay tuned, as we'll explain its unique appeal here. The first thing that attracts the attention of the crypto community is the unique design of this new cryptocurrency.

Some investors highlight TOKEN6900's retro-futuristic design and potential, drawing inspiration from 90s internet culture. This type of design makes the perfect throwback to internet nostalgia that many are thinking about now, as digitalization is in full swing.

It is a unique rebellion against the system. The fact that the value of T6900 tokens is affordable, combined with its unique approach, makes the TOKEN6900 ICO 2025 extremely popular. TOKEN6900 tokens are available during the presale period.



There is no clear recipe for the success of a meme coin. However, some factors can indicate its future performance. The ultra-low market cap of T6900 is perfectly positioned for massive growth. Besides, the deflationary mechanism will likely contribute to scarcity, which will drive its price up.

When it comes to the TOKEN6900 ICO 2025, up to 80% of the supply may be sold during this stage. The value of T6900 tokens will increase every two days, or even more quickly, once the presale gains momentum. Investors can purchase their tokens using cryptocurrency or a credit card, making the entire investment process smoother.

TOKEN6900 presents itself as a meme coin with a distinct approach and investors interested in meme coins may find T6900 noteworthy.

TOKEN6900 has attracted significant attention in the market. Its unique, bold approach is the act of defiance against the financial system that is trying to impose control. The new crypto coin is poised to go viral as it points out the delusions that every crypto investor will face sooner or later.

With over $680,000 raised in its presale, T6900 is gaining interest among investors. T6900 is an emerging crypto project in the meme coin space.

The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens

As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens.

“Tokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,” said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France.

Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors.

But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century's worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood's push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world's most popular startups.

The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time.

The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast. 

She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television.

“You used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,” Haun said. “You tune in at a specific time, you don't get to choose your program, you couldn't be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.”

Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies.

Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030.

The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that's seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs — more than $123,000 on Monday — while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what's been called the “golden age” for digital assets. 

Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike.

“Which is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,” Reiners said.

Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday. 

“Tokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,” said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins.

Securities law can be complex and even defining what is a security can be a hotly debated question, particularly in crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country's securities law.

Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law.

Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump's victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer. 

“The most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,” she said. 

However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood's announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider “their disclosure obligations” under federal law.

“As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said.

One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren't subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones.

Many hot startups are not going public as often as they used to and instead are increasingly relying on wealthy and institutional investors to raise large sums of money and stay private.

That's unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization.

“These are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,” said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. “Crypto has the power to solve this inequality.”

But Robinhood's giveaway of tokens meant to represent an investment in OpenAI immediately drew pushback from the company itself, which said it was not involved in Robinhood's plan and did not endorse it.

“Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer,” OpenAI said on social media. “Please be careful.”

Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies don't have to produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors and give a legitimacy to the U.S. financial system, said Allen, who said the push for tokenized sales of shares in private companies is “eerily familiar” to how things played out before the creation of the SEC nearly a century ago.

“Where we're headed is where we were in the 1920s,” she said. “Door-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn't understand.”

With Bitcoin giving everyone a reason to celebrate, it was about time Ethereum, often dubbed the digital silver, had its moment.

And it has certainly delivered, surging past key resistance levels and shaking up the crypto market in the process.

As per data from Coinglass, more than $76.54M worth of Ethereum short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours.

This comes after Ethereum crossed the $3K mark, rising over70% in the past four weeks.

At the time of writing, $ETH sits at $3,775, the highest it has been this year. The $ETH/$BTC pair has also gained 40% over the same period, currently trading at $0.03184 – a 2025 high.

Read on as we dive into the reason behind Ethereum's explosive move and what could be next for the token. We'll also highlight the best altcoins worth considering to make the most of this momentum.

As per Santiment, the $ETH network has over 152.03M non-empty $ETH wallets, which is more than any other cryptocurrency. This Sunday, a whale wallet bought 13,500 $ETH with $50M worth of $USDT.

In another notable move, SharpLink, a publicly traded sportsbook marketing company, recently became the largest corporate holder of $ETH, acquiring 280,706 tokens valued at $1.06B.



Clearly, Bitcoin isn't the only reserve-worthy asset anymore, with Ethereum quickly catching up. While Bitcoin has already reached a new all-time high, $ETH is just 25% away from breaching its previous peak of $4,800.

It currently faces strong resistance at $4,100. This is a level that, once broken, could propel the token toward $5,000 in the short term.

As Ethereum continues to attract whales and institutional investors, setting the stage for its next major move, several other crypto tokens stand to benefit from this bullish momentum.

If you don't want to miss out, here are some of the best cryptos to buy now.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the token powering Snorter, a Telegram-based crypto trading bot built specifically for retail users.

Until now, institutional investors have typically swooped in to absorb all the early liquidity in new meme coins. But Snorter changes the game.

The bot allows retail users to place buy/sell limit and stop orders (which Snorter then automatically executes) directly from the Telegram chat, creating a more level playing field.



In addition to its ease of use, the bot is mighty secure too. It not only independently verifies every token before enabling trading, but also comes with protection against honeypots, rug pulls, and even sophisticated sandwich attacks.

Currently in presale, $SNORT has raised over $2.18M, with each token priced at just $0.0989.

Moreover, according to our Snorter Token price prediction, the token could surge by 1,900% in 2026, potentially hitting $1.96 and offering life-changing returns.

Finally, it's worth noting that holding $SNORT unlocks lower trading fees (0.85% vs. 1.5% for non-holders), advanced analytics, and increased daily sniping limits, giving early adopters a clear edge.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first Bitcoin layer-2 blockchain solution that uses a canonical bridge to convert traditional $BTC into wrapped Bitcoin.

Over time, the Bitcoin network has slowed due to rising transaction volume, and it still lacks native compatibility with DeFi and Web3 applications.

$HYPER aims to change that, powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Once converted into wrapped Bitcoin, your $BTC can be used across DeFi, NFTs, blockchain gaming, and other Web3 ecosystems.



When you're done, the same bridge lets you convert your wrapped $BTC back into real Bitcoin seamlessly.

This high-performance, low-latency token brings the scalability and developer-friendly experience of Solana to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The $HYPER presale is gaining strong traction, having already raised $3.9M.

Each token is currently selling for just $0.01235. And according to our $HYPER price prediction, it could reach $0.08625 by 2026 – a potential 7x return.

FLOKI ($FLOKI) boasts a market cap of around $1.3 billion, making it one of the top 10 meme coins by market capitalization.

Named after Elon Musk's Shiba Inu, FLOKI has grown into a multi‑utility meme token since its launch in June 2021.



The platform is developing Valhalla, a play‑to‑earn, NFT‑based metaverse gaming ecosystem where $FLOKI serves as the primary currency.

Players can use it for in‑game purchases, trade NFTs, and win rewards. Since its July 1 launch, Valhalla has crossed the 1M transaction mark and seen approximately 125K NFT mints.

Better still, $FLOKI has surged over 92% in the past four weeks, and it's currently trading around $0.0001402.

With strong Valhalla adoption and bullish technical sentiment, as the token consolidates near recent highs, potentially setting up for a breakout, experts anticipate a 50%-80% upside from current levels.

With Ethereum joining Bitcoin in a fresh rally, the broader crypto market, led by its two dominant players, looks overwhelmingly bullish.

This renewed momentum sets the stage for promising altcoins like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) to ride the wave, offering early investors a chance to capitalize on what could be the next major breakout phase in crypto.

Oops, something went wrong

A fund manager has turned heads with an unmatched long-term price prediction for Ethereum.

“ETH goes to $1.5M over time,” EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson said Sunday in a thread on X. The prediction would be ambitious even for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency asset by market capitalization.

Jackson's reasoning is tied to “commerce” moving from fiat to blockchain rails, citing the growth potential of the stablecoin and tokenization sectors dominated by Ethereum. He said while all eyes are on Bitcoin, “Ethereum is quietly becoming the dominant rail system to transact in crypto with deflationary economics.”

Stablecoins and, more broadly, tokenization have emerged as the primary narratives for ETH in recent weeks as the U.S. advances stablecoin regulations. The narrative also gained momentum from Robinhood's (NASDAQ:HOOD) decision to launch tokenized stock trading on the Ethereum Layer 2 Arbitrum.

Several experts have pointed out that both sectors have the potential to bring trillions of dollars on-chain. For example, Bitwise investment chief Matt Hougan recently said that even a 5% penetration into the $257 trillion stock and bond market would be bigger than any present cryptocurrency application, including Bitcoin.

The expectation has been that such volumes moving on-chain could have significant price implications for ETH and other related assets. But unlike Jackson, most analysts have shied away from offering specific price projections.

Meanwhile, Jackson's short-term projections, while not in the millions, are no less ambitious. He said ETH could surge to $10,000 in the base case and $15,000 in the bull case in the present market cycle.

Jackson based this short-term outlook on expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission could approve staking features for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds before October.

“Most people think the ETH ETF approval is already priced in and it's been a big bust vs. BTC (in terms of assets for ETHA vs. IBIT)," he said. "It's not. The real catalyst is still ahead: staking approval, expected before October. Once that hits, ETH becomes the first yield-bearing crypto ETF in U.S. history.”

He said the yield-bearing opportunity would attract more inflows from institutional investors, leading to increased staking demand and reduced ETH circulating supply.

“Once ETH becomes a productive, staked asset within an ETF wrapper... It's no longer just ‘digital oil,'" he said. “It's an institutional-grade yield product.”

Meanwhile, Jackson said the bull case for Ethereum occurs if Layer 2 adoption and ETF inflows beat expectations.

“None of this assumes a massive new breakout in DeFi or NFTs or explosion in stablecoins like CRCL on ETH or explosion in HOOD's L2 and COIN's BASE for keeping money in the crypto world vs. migrating back and forth to fiat,” he said.

Whether Jackson's predictions will come true remains to be seen. At last look, Ethereum is trading at $3,048. At current price levels, Jackson's short-term price targets represent a 233% and 400% upside. On the other hand, the long-term target represents a nearly 50,000% upside potential.

 Chinese blockchain Conflux launched Conflux 3.0 network and unveiled a new offshore yuan-backed stablecoin targeting “Belt and Road” cross-border payments. 

Chinese blockchain Conflux announced a third version of its public network and introduced a new stablecoin backed by offshore Chinese yuan.

According to a report from the Shanghai municipal government on Sunday, Conflux announced the developments during a three-day conference over the weekend. At the event, Conflux unveiled a partnership with fintech firm AnchorX and information technology security firm Eastcompeace to support the launch of an offshore yuan-backed stablecoin.

The news follows AnchorX receiving in-principle approval for its yuan-pegged stablecoin AxCNH by Kazakhstan's regulator, the Astana Financial Services Authority, in late February. It is unclear whether Conflux's stablecoin is AxCNH or a separate project, and the involved companies had not responded to Cointelegraph's inquiries by publication.

Conflux also partnered with crypto wallet TokenPocket to promote the stablecoin to its users. In an X announcement, the wallet's team wrote that the firm will launch pilot projects in Central Asia, Southeast Asia and other key regions in partnership with Conflux and AnchorX.

The team also announced the introduction of Conflux 3.0, which the company said can process more than 15,000 transactions per second and natively supports onchain artificial intelligence agent calls.

Over the weekend, the price of Conflux's native CFX token surged from $0.1055 on Sunday to $0.2285 at the time of writing, a gain of nearly 116.6%.

The new stablecoin aims to serve offshore Chinese entities and countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative. The project will also explore real-world asset applications, according to Conflux.  

The Belt and Road Initiative is a global infrastructure and economic strategy launched by China in 2013 as part of efforts to increase the country's international influence. The project aims to connect Asia, Africa and Europe through land and maritime trade routes, promoting global trade and investment, which includes building roads, railways, ports and digital infrastructure.

Conflux's stablecoin is the latest entry in the Chinese stablecoin race. As reported by the Chinese version of Cointelegraph earlier this month, Hong Kong recently attracted as many as 40 stablecoin license applications.

The firms behind the applications include giants such as JD.com, Ant Group and Circle. The report follows Hong Kong's government introducing a crypto regulatory framework known as “LEAP.”

The new framework includes a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers starting Aug. 1, which “will facilitate the development of real-world use cases.” The issuance of licenses will be overseen by Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission.

Mainland China is known for having one of the most restrictive approaches to cryptocurrencies. However, recent reports indicate that the country is reconsidering its stance on stablecoins. Earlier this month, the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission held a meeting to discuss strategic responses to stablecoins.

After the meeting, the regulator's director, He Qing, called for “greater sensitivity to emerging technologies and enhanced research into digital currencies.”

This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

XRP's (XRP) dollar-denominated prices have surged nearly 60% to new lifetime highs above $3.50 this month. However, against bitcoin BTC$117,599.41, it appears to be on the verge of kickstarting a significant bull run, as evident from the chart below, which shows the prices for the Binance-listed XRP/BTC ratio.

As of writing, the ratio was probing the upper end of the four-year-long sideways channel that began in early 2021.

Much like coiled springs, sideways channels are periods of energy accumulation. This pent-up energy is eventually unleashed in a powerful directional move; typically, the longer the consolidation, the more substantial the eventual breakout.

Thus, a breakout in the XRP/BTC ratio could mean significant gains for XRP relative to bitcoin.

Supporting the bull case is the Guppy multiple moving average indicator, which has flipped bullish for the first time since 2018. The bullish signal is identified by the short-term EMA band (white) crossing above the long-term ones (red).

XRP/USD : Golden cross is here

XRP looks set for a continued run higher, having defended the support of the January high of $3.39 over the weekend in a classic "breakout and re-test play." Markets tend to revisit resistance-turned-support to test dip demand and commitment of bulls before staging bigger rallies.

Momentum looks stronger than ever with the bullish golden cross, marked by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) shifting above the 200-day SMA, while prices are already at record highs. Friday's high of $3.66 is the immediate resistance, followed by $4.00. Below $3.35, the risk of an extended pullback would increase.

Ether's (ETH) rally continues, with the 50-day SMA rising to its highest level since March and the 100-day SMA poised to cross above the 200-day SMA in a bullish manner. There is little to no sign of bears looking to reassert themselves, as evident from the small upper wicks attached to most daily candles since July 13.

The Mayer multiple, which gauges the ratio between the spot price and the 200-day SMA to show case momentum, has already crossed the December high to hit its highest since March 2024. Perhaps, it's only a matter of time before prices do the same, topping the December high of $4,109.

On the way higher, prices may consolidate near $4,000, thanks to the significant positive dealer gamma at that level in the Deribit-listed options market. Dealers typically trade against the market direction in such situations to maintain a net neutral exposure, curbing volatility.

On the downside, $3,480 is the key support. A break below the same would invalidate the bullish higher lows pattern.

AI's take: The Mayer Multiple suggests strong underlying momentum. This indicator's higher reading signals ETH is building bullish strength relative to its long-term average, hinting at potential for future price appreciation.

Resistance: $4,000, $4,109, $4,382. 

Support: $3,480, $3,081, $2,879.

Bitcoin's price continues to crisscross the 50-, 100- and 200-hour SMAs, with the three averages now flat-lined in a narrow range, signaling that the upside momentum has weakened. This makes BTC vulnerable to potential risk-off in traditional markets and the ongoing recovery in the dollar index.

A potential failure to hold above the Asian session low of $116,539 would reinforce the bull exhaustion, strengthening the case for a deeper drop to $111,965, the May high. Conversely, a move above $120,000 could bring fresh highs, although prices have consistently failed to establish a foothold above that level since July 14.

Solana's SOL token has topped resistance at around $185 as expected. Further gains appear likely as the MACD histogram prints larger bars above the zero line and the 14-day RSI surpasses 70, both signaling a strengthening of the upward momentum. The Mayer multiple has risen to the highest since January.

A failure to hold above $177 would raise the risk of a deeper price drop.

This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

XRP's (XRP) dollar-denominated prices have surged nearly 60% to new lifetime highs above $3.50 this month. However, against bitcoin BTC$116,795.57, it appears to be on the verge of kickstarting a significant bull run, as evident from the chart below, which shows the prices for the Binance-listed XRP/BTC ratio.

As of writing, the ratio was probing the upper end of the four-year-long sideways channel that began in early 2021.

Much like coiled springs, sideways channels are periods of energy accumulation. This pent-up energy is eventually unleashed in a powerful directional move; typically, the longer the consolidation, the more substantial the eventual breakout.

Thus, a breakout in the XRP/BTC ratio could mean significant gains for XRP relative to bitcoin.

Supporting the bull case is the Guppy multiple moving average indicator, which has flipped bullish for the first time since 2018. The bullish signal is identified by the short-term EMA band (white) crossing above the long-term ones (red).

XRP/USD : Golden cross is here

XRP looks set for a continued run higher, having defended the support of the January high of $3.39 over the weekend in a classic "breakout and re-test play." Markets tend to revisit resistance-turned-support to test dip demand and commitment of bulls before staging bigger rallies.

Momentum looks stronger than ever with the bullish golden cross, marked by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) shifting above the 200-day SMA, while prices are already at record highs. Friday's high of $3.66 is the immediate resistance, followed by $4.00. Below $3.35, the risk of an extended pullback would increase.

Ether's (ETH) rally continues, with the 50-day SMA rising to its highest level since March and the 100-day SMA poised to cross above the 200-day SMA in a bullish manner. There is little to no sign of bears looking to reassert themselves, as evident from the small upper wicks attached to most daily candles since July 13.

The Mayer multiple, which gauges the ratio between the spot price and the 200-day SMA to show case momentum, has already crossed the December high to hit its highest since March 2024. Perhaps, it's only a matter of time before prices do the same, topping the December high of $4,109.

On the way higher, prices may consolidate near $4,000, thanks to the significant positive dealer gamma at that level in the Deribit-listed options market. Dealers typically trade against the market direction in such situations to maintain a net neutral exposure, curbing volatility.

On the downside, $3,480 is the key support. A break below the same would invalidate the bullish higher lows pattern.

AI's take: The Mayer Multiple suggests strong underlying momentum. This indicator's higher reading signals ETH is building bullish strength relative to its long-term average, hinting at potential for future price appreciation.

Resistance: $4,000, $4,109, $4,382. 

Support: $3,480, $3,081, $2,879.

Bitcoin's price continues to crisscross the 50-, 100- and 200-hour SMAs, with the three averages now flat-lined in a narrow range, signaling that the upside momentum has weakened. This makes BTC vulnerable to potential risk-off in traditional markets and the ongoing recovery in the dollar index.

A potential failure to hold above the Asian session low of $116,539 would reinforce the bull exhaustion, strengthening the case for a deeper drop to $111,965, the May high. Conversely, a move above $120,000 could bring fresh highs, although prices have consistently failed to establish a foothold above that level since July 14.

Solana's SOL token has topped resistance at around $185 as expected. Further gains appear likely as the MACD histogram prints larger bars above the zero line and the 14-day RSI surpasses 70, both signaling a strengthening of the upward momentum. The Mayer multiple has risen to the highest since January.

A failure to hold above $177 would raise the risk of a deeper price drop.

Thailand's securities regulator is seeking public input on new rules that would ease knowledge testing requirements for crypto investors while mandating comprehensive suitability assessments.

The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Friday that it is conducting public hearings on proposed initial coin offering regulations, which would allow investors to bypass repeated knowledge tests if they have previously passed such assessments.

Under current rules, investors must complete knowledge tests every three months before investing through ICO portals.

The proposed changes target two key areas of investor protection. 

First, the SEC wants non-institutional investors, those not classified as ultra-high-net-worth or high-net-worth individuals, to pass a knowledge test before investing, unless they've already done so in the past. 

Second, ICO portals would be required to conduct comprehensive suitability tests "to ensure that investors in digital tokens understand the investment risks and have a risk tolerance level appropriate and in alignment with the product risk." 

These assessments must be reviewed and updated at least every two years, replacing the current quarterly requirement.

"This proposal aims to reduce the burden on both ICO portals and investors by canceling the requirement for such assessment every three months," the SEC said in its announcement. 

The regulator noted that the new requirements align with "regulatory practices applicable to both securities and digital asset business operators."

“Thailand has been a first mover for crypto regulations and the SEC has played a pivotal role in providing all regulated activities and licenses, much ahead of Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, and Vietnam in South East Asia,” Jagdish Pandya, founder of Blockon Ventures and organizer of Thai Blockchain Week 2019, told Decrypt.

Pandya said the proposed knowledge and suitability tests would help keep “amateur investors” from blindly jumping into ICOs and repeating mistakes from the “old ICO scam era.”

“Their ICO portal enables raising funds, which is again a benchmark ahead of its time compared to UAE or Hong Kong too,” he noted. 

Professional investor classes would remain exempt from the knowledge testing requirements under the proposed framework.

Investors and stakeholders have until August 1 to comment on the proposal, which could change how ICOs are accessed in Thailand.

Thailand's regulatory push extends beyond ICO portals as in June, the SEC also opened consultations on allowing exchanges to list self-issued tokens with enhanced disclosure requirements to prevent insider trading. 

The country is simultaneously preparing pilot programs for crypto tourism payments in popular destinations like Phuket and considering retail access to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.

Bitcoin BTC$117,599.41 hovered just under $120,000 in Asia trading hours Monday, up 1% on the day and 2.6% on the week, even as traders increasingly shifted capital into altcoins like ether (ETH), XRP XRP$3.6011, Solana's SOL (SOL), and dogecoin DOGE$0.2848.

The market rotation comes as institutional flows broaden beyond Bitcoin, with Ethereum-led narratives gaining momentum and real-world asset tokenization drawing fresh attention from traditional finance players.

ETH surged to $3,793, posting a 3.7% daily gain and up 25% over the week. It's now at its highest level since early 2022, and analysts say demand from new ETH-based treasury products and ongoing ETF flows are fueling the rally.

XRP followed suit, rising 4.1% to $3.55, while SOL added 6.6% to reach $189. Cardano's ADA) and BNB Coin (BNB) both gained over 3% on the day.

Dogecoin DOGE$0.2848 stood out with a 9.6% jump in the past 24 hours, trading at 27 cents and up more than 33% on the week — its strongest performance in over a year.

"Over the past week, altcoins have shown signs of taking the spotlight, with Bitcoin stalling just below recent all-time highs and capital rotating into broader market plays," said Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken, in a note shared with CoinDesk. 

"Bitcoin dominance has dropped from a June peak of 66% to around 61.75%, signaling early signs of an altcoin cycle heading into Q3," Cardozo said.

The ETH/BTC ratio, which has been in decline for some time, has seen a strong bounce back to its best levels since Q1 — a sign that traders are again betting on Ethereum outperforming.

"Some will credit the stablecoin and RWA narrative," said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus. "But we think it's just good old-fashioned risk-on spillover. Most TradFi players are already fully positioned on BTC."

Beyond technical positioning, macro and legislative tailwinds continue to shape the altcoin trade. The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and increase clarity around digital asset taxation, failed a procedural vote earlier this week but is still progressing in U.S. Congress.

"Ethereum and other altcoins are surging due to institutional demand and friendly legislative policies," said Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer at OSL. "Traders are hoping to see Ethereum break to new all-time highs, the last of the majors yet to do so in this cycle."

Meanwhile, the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector — now over $24 billion in total tokenized value — is becoming a serious institutional theme. Projects tokenizing private credit, Treasuries, and real estate are attracting fresh attention from giants like BlackRock and JPMorgan.

"Tokenized assets are taking a meaningful share of DeFi TVL," Cardozo added. 

"It may be too early to call an altseason, but the rotation is real. If BTC consolidates, altcoins tied to real-world finance could lead the next leg,” he ended.

Despite the excitement surrounding what President Donald Trump has dubbed “Crypto Week,” experts caution against premature celebrations in the cryptocurrency space. 

The House of Representatives recently passed three significant bills aimed at regulating digital assets, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. However, these legislative changes are not expected to take effect for quite some time.

The three bills—the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act—are seen as crucial steps toward establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. 

This development has been fueled by intense lobbying efforts from industry players like Coinbase Global, which have successfully influenced politicians, including Trump. 

In anticipation of this legislative week, Bitcoin prices soared to record highs beyond the $123,000 mark for the first time, alongside significant gains for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP.  However, TD Securities analyst Jaret Seiberg notes that it could take over a year for the new legislation to come into effect. 

Among the passed bills, only the Genius Act has also cleared the Senate, and Trump signed it into law shortly thereafter. This act establishes a framework for regulating payment stablecoins requiring issuers to maintain one-to-one reserves in US dollars or Treasury securities. 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has argued that this law could generate an additional $3.7 trillion demand for T-bills, although some analysts, like Raymond James' Ed Mills, express skepticism about such projections.

Despite the signing of the Genius Act, there will be no immediate impacts on stablecoin issuers such as Circle Internet Group or Tether. 

As reported by ABC news, the Treasury Department is expected to draft rules within a year detailing the qualifications for issuing stablecoins and the conditions under which foreign-pegged stablecoins can enter the US market. This process will involve public commentary and could lead to litigation, suggesting a lengthy timeline before any real changes are felt in the industry.

The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, on the other hand, is particularly important as it delineates the regulatory oversight of crypto exchanges, brokers, and tokens between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

With bipartisan support in the House, there is optimism that the Senate will pass its version before the upcoming August recess, potentially delivering a unified law for the president's signature by September.

The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, the third piece of legislation, aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). This bill, which passed with narrower margins, was attached to a national defense bill, and its future in the Senate will likely involve protracted negotiations, possibly extending until December.

Despite the excitement surrounding what President Donald Trump has dubbed “Crypto Week,” experts caution against premature celebrations in the cryptocurrency space. 

The House of Representatives recently passed three significant bills aimed at regulating digital assets, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. However, these legislative changes are not expected to take effect for quite some time.

The three bills—the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act—are seen as crucial steps toward establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. 

This development has been fueled by intense lobbying efforts from industry players like Coinbase Global, which have successfully influenced politicians, including Trump.

How Logical Are You? Test Your Skills With These Problems from the New International Logic Olympiad

In only its second year, the International Logic Olympiad is already booming as logic becomes more and more crucial in our ever changing world

By Emma R. Hasson edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Earlier this month, 36 sharp-witted high school students from around the globe stepped foot on the warm and breezy campus of Stanford University. Out of more than 4,000 students from more than 2,000 schools in more than 90 different countries, these 36 people were selected to compete as finalists in the second-ever International Logic Olympiad (ILO).

The competition included three rounds of tests, culminating in the final one at Stanford. There teams of two to four engaged in a battle of wits, solving logic puzzles and competing in mathematical games against the backdrop of the foothills of Palo Alto, Calif. The winners this year were 11th-grade students Luke Song, Zixuan Yin, Kingston Zhang and Max Yang, who, unhappy with their official moniker of “Team I,” informally dubbed themselves “Team Goblin Tribe” after a video skit they watched during a review session. The key to their success, they contend, was lots of practice and teamwork. “I think part of the reason why we were able to do so well in this was because I know my teammates really well and we've been friends for many years,” Song says.

The ILO was launched by Stanford computer scientist and logician Michael Genesereth in a collaboration between the university and the educational nonprofit Luminas. “We use logic in almost everything we do,” Genesereth says. Doctors employ logic to diagnose patients, lawyers use logical arguments in the courtroom, and logic is more essential than ever to evaluate the rapidly changing world around us, he notes. “It doesn't all have to do with mathematics and formulas and algebra,” Genesereth adds.

Most of this year's winners have an interest in computer science, alongside environmental science, applied math and electrical engineering, but Zhang says that neither math nor computer science are his “strong suit” and that he plans to go into political science. “A lot of the problems require very expansive thinking and creative solutions, and I think that'll definitely help me if I go into policy in the future,” he explains.

A special aspect of the olympiad is its collaborative nature, in which teams work together to solve problems, Yin says. He was particularly proud of how he and his teammates collaborated on a puzzle called Nations (below). After he reasoned out that a solution offered by one of the members of his group must be wrong and came up with an alternate one that proved correct, that teammate “just kept on telling me how fortunate he was to have me on his team,” Yin says. “Having these amazing people to work on logic—it's something that unites our friend group together.”

Here are a few curated puzzles from the competition that you can try your hand at with a friend group of your own. Some of the puzzles have been edited to better fit the format of this article.

Four students, numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4, vote among themselves to determine who should lead their review session. Each student is required to vote “yes” or “no” for each person in the group, including themselves. The following are true statements about their ballots:

In the table above, statements from the original ILO problem in the language of mathematical logic are at right. Our translations of those statements are at left.

Determine, to the extent possible from these statements, who did and did not vote for whom. Fill that out in the following grid with a check for a yes vote, an “x” for a no vote and a blank if you can't know for sure. Each row represents the ballot of the number listed at the left.

Note: If we have a statement A that is not true, we consider any sentence of the form “if A, then B” to be true. For example, “if the sky is green, then ____” is true no matter what goes in the blank because the premise is false. You will need this fact to solve the puzzle.

1. What is the answer to question 2?

A. BB. AC. DD. C

2. What is the answer to question 3?

A. CB. DC. BD. A

3. What is the answer to question 4?

A. DB. AC. CD. B

4. What is the answer to question 1?

A. DB. CC. AD. B

A combination safe is opened with a series of four switches that can be flipped on (1) or off (0). The safe is broken, so in order to open it, you only need to get the position of two particular switches correct—but there's no way of knowing which switches are the ones that matter. Find the smallest set of combinations you can try to guarantee that one of them will open the safe. 

There are two types of nations: strong and weak. Only weak nations can be invaded, and only strong nations can invade. If a strong nation invades a weak nation, it will annex the weak nation, but it will become weak, and thus invadable, for some period of time. Only one strong nation may invade a weak nation at a time. If multiple nations decide to invade the same weak nation, one is randomly chosen to be allowed to invade. Each nation wants to be as big as possible but not at the expense of being annexed itself. Assume all nations are completely rational. There are five strong nations and one weak nation. Will the weak nation be invaded?

Hint: Try starting with one strong nation and one weak nation first and then build up from there. In order to solve the problem, try to see how complex cases can be reduced to simpler ones⁠—a method formally known as “mathematical induction.”

This puzzle was also included in the ILO. Competitors had to solve it under a time limit using only a pencil and paper.

Safe Cracking

To guarantee you can crack the safe, you'll need to have every possible set of positions for each pair of switches represented. That way, no matter which two switches are the ones that matter or which positions open the safe, one of the codes will crack it. The minimum number of combinations needed is five. Here's one possible solution: 1000, 0100, 0010, 0001, 1111.

Nations

Here's one way to think this through. Suppose we have one strong nation and one weak nation. The strong nation will naturally want to invade the weak one because there is no other nation to invade the strong one after it does so. What about two strong nations and one weak nation? Well, if one of the strong nations were to annex the weak nation, it would temporarily become weak and be invaded by the other, so neither of them would want to invade in the first place, knowing they'd be invaded right back. Now consider three strong nations and one weak nation: again, if a strong nation invades, we are left with two strong nations and one weak nation, a situation in which we just determined no one would invade—so all three strong nations would want to invade in this case. Using the same logic, if there are four strong nations, and one invades, the scenario will reduce to the three-strong-nations case where everyone would want to invade, so none of the four nations would risk invading in the first place. Finally, this leads us to five strong nations and one weak nation, a scenario in which all of the strong nations would want to invade because, once there are four strong nations and one that has become weak from annexing, nobody will invade.

At 225 solar masses, this gargantuan merger of two black holes challenges our thinking on these famously elusive objects.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, or LIGO, made major headlines in 2015 when scientists confirmed the first ever detection of gravitational waves—ripples in spacetime caused by highly energetic deep space phenomena (think: black hole mergers, supernovae, and neutron star collisions). This particular detection originated from a black hole merger that created a new black hole 62 times the mass of our Sun. 

The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network of gravitational wave detectors hasn't let off the gas in the decade since, and has made hundreds of confirmed gravitational-wave detections, including the first neutron star merger in 2017 and the largest black hole merger (clocking in at 140 solar masses) in 2021. 

Now, in a preprint uploaded to the arXiv server, LVK scientists have provided evidence that there's a new heavyweight champion—a merger that produced a new 255-solar-mass black hole. Designated GW231123 for the date it was discovered (November 23, 2023, during the fourth observing run of the LVK network), this black hole is actually too big, according to our current best understanding of physics.

“This is the most massive black hole binary we've observed through gravitational waves, and it presents a real challenge to our understanding of black hole formation,” Mark Hannam, a member of the LVK Collaboration from Cardiff University, said in a press statement. “Black holes this massive are forbidden through standard stellar evolution models.” 

To form this black hole, the two black hole predecessors likely had to measure around 100 and 140 times the mass of the Sun, respectively. This means they potentially lie in what's known as the “upper-mass gap”—a range of masses in which black holes aren't thought to form from stars directly (the resulting supernovae of these hugely massive stars should leave behind no stellar remnant at all). 

“One possibility is that the two black holes in this binary formed through earlier mergers of smaller black holes." Hannam said.

However, these black holes' masses aren't the only mystery, as both were spinning between 80 and 90 percent of their top speed limit. This makes them the highest spinning black holes ever recorded by LVK. 

“The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly—near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,” Charlie Hoy, another member of the LVK from the University of Portsmouth, said in a press statement. “That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret. It's an excellent case study for pushing forward the development of our theoretical tools.”

Because the detectors are sensitive to black holes of around 100 solar masses, detecting one more than double that size certainly pushes LIGO to its limits. According to Science News, the LVK network was only able to detect the smallest blip from this merger, with only around 0.1 seconds detected at the tail end of the collision.

LIGO's decades-long mission to detect gravitational waves has given scientists a whole new understanding of the universe, and nearly a decade after its first detection, it shows no signs of stopping.

Yellowstone, a popular tourist destination and namesake of an equally popular TV show, was the first-ever national park in the United States. And bubbling beneath it - to this day - is one of Earth's most seismically active networks of volcanic activity.

In a new study, published July 18 in the high impact journal Science Advances, Western engineering professor Bing Li and his collaborators at Universidad Industrial de Santander (Industrial University of Santander) in Colombia and the United States Geological Survey used machine learning to re-examine historical earthquake data from the Yellowstone caldera over a 15-year period. The team was able to retroactively detect and assign magnitudes to approximately 10 times more seismic events, or earthquakes, than previously recorded.

A caldera - like the one at Yellowstone Park spanning parts of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana - is a large depression or hollow formed when a volcano erupts and the magma chamber beneath it empties, leading to the collapse of the land above. This is different than a volcanic crater, which is formed by outward blasting.

The historical catalogue for the Yellowstone caldera now contains 86,276 earthquakes spanning the years 2008 to 2022, significantly improving previous understanding of volcanic and seismic systems through better data collection and systematic analyses.

A key finding in the study is that more than half of the earthquakes recorded in Yellowstone were part of earthquake swarms - groups of small, interconnected earthquakes that spread and shift within a relatively small area over a relatively short period of time. This is unlike an aftershock, which is a smaller earthquake that follows a larger mainshock in the same general area.

"While Yellowstone and other volcanoes each have unique features, the hope is that these insights can be applied elsewhere," said Li, an expert in fluid-induced earthquakes and rock mechanics. "By understanding patterns of seismicity, like earthquake swarms, we can improve safety measures, better inform the public about potential risks, and even guide geothermal energy development away from danger in areas with promising heat flow."

Molten-detecting machines

Prior to the application of machine learning, earthquakes were generally detected through manual inspection by trained experts. This process takes time, is cost-intensive and often detects fewer events than possible now with machine learning. Machine learning has sparked a data-mining gold rush in recent years as seismologists revisit the wealth of historical waveform data stored in datacenters across the world and learn more about current and previously unknown seismic regions around the world.

"If we had to do it old school with someone manually clicking through all this data looking for earthquakes, you couldn't do it. It's not scalable," said Li.

The study also shows that earthquake swarms beneath the Yellowstone caldera have occurred along relatively immature, rougher fault structures, compared to more typical mature fault structures seen in regions such as southern California and even immediately outside the caldera.

The roughness was measured by characterizing earthquakes as fractals, which are geometric shapes that exhibit self-similarity, meaning they appear similar at different scales. First visualized by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980, fractal patterns are seen in coastlines, snowflakes, broccoli, and even the branching of blood vessels. The fractal-based models, targeting roughness versus regularity, were able to characterize these earthquake swarms, which the researchers believe were caused by the mix of slowly moving underground water and sudden bursts of fluid.

"To a large extent, there is no systematic understanding of how one earthquake triggers another in a swarm. We can only indirectly measure space and time between events," said Li. "But now, we have a far more robust catalogue of seismic activity under the Yellowstone caldera, and we can apply statistical methods that help us quantify and find new swarms that we haven't seen before, study them, and see what we can learn from them."

As millions of people know firsthand, the most common side effect of mRNA vaccines like the COVID-19 shot is inflammation: soreness, redness and a day or two of malaise. But what if mRNA vaccines could be redesigned to sidestep that response altogether?

In a new paper in Nature Biomedical Engineering, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania show that tweaking the structure of the ionizable lipid, a key component of the lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that deliver mRNA, not only reduces inflammation but also boosts vaccine effectiveness for preventing or treating a range of diseases, from COVID-19 to cancer.

The key change? Adding phenol groups, chemical compounds with anti-inflammatory properties famously found in foods like olive oil. "By essentially changing the recipe for these lipids, we were able to make them work better with fewer side effects," says Michael J. Mitchell, Associate Professor in Bioengineering (BE) and the paper's senior author. "It's a win-win."

Revising the Recipe 

Until now, the ionizable lipids in LNPs -- one of four types of lipids in LNPs, and arguably the most important -- have largely been synthesized using chemical reactions that combine two components into a new molecule, much like two halves of a sandwich coming together.

"Because these processes have been so successful, there hasn't been much effort to look for alternatives," says Ninqiang Gong, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Mitchell Lab and co-first author of the paper.

Looking back at the history of chemistry, the team found an alternative approach: the Mannich reaction, named after the German chemist who discovered it more than a century ago.

Rather than two components, the Mannich reaction combines three precursors, allowing for a greater variety of molecular outcomes. "We were able to create hundreds of new lipids," says Gong.

Exploring that "library" of lipids led the team to discover that adding a phenol group -- a combination of hydrogen and oxygen connected to a ring of carbon molecules -- substantially reduced inflammation.

"It's kind of like the secret sauce," says Gong. "The phenol group not only reduces the side effects associated with LNPs, but improves their efficacy."

The Power of Phenols 

Previous studies have found that phenol-containing compounds reduce inflammation by negating the harmful effects of free radicals, molecules with unpaired electrons that can disrupt the body's chemistry.

Too many free radicals and too few antioxidants result in "oxidative stress," which degrades proteins, damages genetic material and can even kill cells.

By checking various markers associated with oxidative stress, the researchers compared the inflammatory effects of LNPs formulated using different lipids.

"The best-performing LNP, which we built using a phenol-containing ionizable lipid produced by the Mannich reaction, actually caused less inflammation," says Emily Han, a doctoral student in BE and co-author of the paper.

Less Inflammation, Higher Performance

With these encouraging signs of reduced inflammation, the researchers next tested whether the new lipids also improved vaccine performance.

Across multiple experiments, C-a16 LNPs, which incorporated the most anti-inflammatory lipid, outperformed LNPs used in on-the-market mRNA technologies.

"Lowering oxidative stress makes it easier for LNPs to do their job," says Dongyoon Kim, a postdoctoral fellow in the Mitchell Lab and co-first author of the paper.

C-a16 LNPs not only produced longer-lasting effects, but also improved the efficacy of gene-editing tools like CRISPR and the potency of vaccines for treating cancer.

Fighting Genetic Disease, Cancer and COVID-19

To test how well the new C-a16 lipids worked in an animal model, the researchers first used them to deliver into cells the gene that makes fireflies glow -- a classic experiment for checking the strength of genetic instructions.

The glow in mice was about 15 times brighter compared to the LNPs used in Onpattro, an FDA-approved treatment for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR), a rare genetic liver disease.

The C-a16 lipids also helped gene-editing tools like CRISPR do a better job fixing the faulty gene that causes hATTR. In fact, they more than doubled the treatment's effectiveness in a mouse model compared to current delivery methods.

In cancer treatments, the results were just as striking. In an animal model of melanoma, an mRNA cancer treatment delivered with C-a16 lipids shrank tumors three times more effectively than the same treatment delivered with the LNPs used in the COVID-19 vaccines. The new lipids also gave cancer-fighting T cells a boost, helping them recognize and destroy tumor cells more efficiently -- and with less oxidative stress.

Finally, when the team used the C-a16 lipids for preparing COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, the immune response in animal models was five times stronger than with standard formulations.

"By causing less disruption to cellular machinery, the new, phenol-containing lipids can enhance a wide range of LNP applications," says Kim.

Old Chemistry, New Frontiers

Besides investigating the immediate potential of the new lipids to reduce side effects in mRNA vaccines, the researchers look forward to exploring how overlooked chemical processes like the Mannich reaction can unlock new LNP-enhancing recipes.

"We tried applying one reaction discovered a century ago, and found it could drastically improve cutting-edge medical treatments," says Mitchell. "It's exciting to imagine what else remains to be rediscovered."

Breakthrough Proof Brings Mathematics Closer to a Grand Unified Theory after More Than 50 Years of Work

The Langlands program has inspired and befuddled mathematicians for more than 50 years. A major advance has now opened up new worlds for them to explore

By Ananyo Bhattacharya & Nature magazine 

Andy Gilmore

One of the biggest stories in science is quietly playing out in the world of abstract mathematics. Over the course of last year, researchers fulfilled a decades-old dream when they unveiled a proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture — a key piece of a group of interconnected problems called the Langlands programme. The proof — a gargantuan effort — validates the intricate and far-reaching Langlands programme, which is often hailed as the grand unified theory of mathematics but remains largely unproven. Yet the work's true impact might lie not in what it settles, but in the new avenues of inquiry it reveals.

“It's a huge triumph. But rather than closing a door, this proof throws open a dozen others,” says David Ben-Zvi at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved with the work.

Proving the geometric Langlands conjecture has long been considered one of the deepest and most enigmatic pursuits in modern mathematics. Ultimately, it took a team of nine mathematicians to crack the problem, in a series of five papers spanning almost 1,000 pages. The group was led by Dennis Gaitsgory at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, and Sam Raskin at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who completed his PhD with Gaitsgory in 2014.

The magnitude of their accomplishment was quickly recognized by the mathematical community: in April, Gaitsgory received the US$3-million Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics, and Raskin was awarded a New Horizons prize for promising early-career mathematicians. Like many landmark results in mathematics, the proof promises to forge bridges between different areas, allowing the tools of one domain to tackle intractable problems in another. All told, it's a heady time for researchers in these fields.

“It gives us the strongest evidence yet that something we've believed in for decades is true,” says Ben-Zvi. “Now we can finally ask: what does it really mean?”

The Langlands programme traces its origins back 60 years, to the work of a young Canadian mathematician named Robert Langlands, who set out his vision in a handwritten letter to the leading mathematician André Weil. Over the decades, the programme attracted increasing attention from mathematicians, who marvelled at how all-encompassing it was. It was that feature that led Edward Frenkel at the University of California, Berkeley, who has made key contributions to the geometric side, to call it the grand unified theory of mathematics.

Langlands' aim was to connect two very separate major branches of mathematics — number theory (the study of integers) and harmonic analysis (the study of how complicated signals or functions break down into simple waves). A special case of the Langlands programme is the epic proof that Andrew Wiles published, in 1995, of Fermat's last theorem — that no three positive integers a, b and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn if n is an integer greater than 2.

Robert Langlands discussed his ideas in a letter to André Weil in 1967. On the cover page to the letter (left), Langlands says, “If you are willing to read it as pure speculation I would appreciate that; if not — I am sure you have a waste basket handy.

The geometric Langlands conjecture was first developed in the 1980s by Vladimir Drinfeld, then at the B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Like the original or arithmetic form of the Langlands conjecture, the geometric conjecture also makes a type of connection: it suggests a correspondence between two different sets of mathematical objects. Although the fields linked by the arithmetic form of Langlands are separate mathematical ‘worlds', the differences between the two sides of the geometric conjecture are not so pronounced. Both concern properties of Riemann surfaces, which are ‘complex manifolds' — structures with coordinates that are complex numbers (with real and imaginary parts). These manifolds can take the form of spheres, doughnuts or pretzel-like shapes with two or more holes.

Many mathematicians strongly suspect that the ‘closeness' of the two sides means the proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture could eventually offer some traction for furthering the arithmetic version, in which the relationships are more mysterious. “To truly understand the Langlands correspondence, we have to realize that the ‘two worlds' in it are not that different — rather, they are two facets of one and the same world,” says Frenkel. “Seeing this unity requires a new vision, a new understanding. We are still far from it in the original formulation. But the fact that, for Riemann surfaces, the two worlds sort of coalesce means that we are getting closer to finding this secret unity underlying the whole programme,” he adds.

One side of the geometric Langlands conjecture concerns a characteristic called a fundamental group. In basic terms, the fundamental group of a Riemann surface describes all the distinct ways in which loops can be tied around it. With a doughnut, for example, a loop can run horizontally around the outer edge or vertically through the hole and around the outside. The geometric Langlands deals with the ‘representation' of a surface's fundamental group, which expresses the group's properties as matrices (grids of numbers).

The other side of the geometric Langlands programme has to do with special kinds of ‘sheaves'. These tools of algebraic geometry are rules that allot ‘vector spaces' (where vectors — arrows — can be added and multiplied) to points on a manifold in much the same way as a function describing a gravitational field, say, can assign numbers for the strength of the field to points in standard 3D space.

Work on bridging this divide began back in the 1990s. Using earlier work on Kac–Moody algebras, which ‘translate' between representations and sheaves, Drinfeld and Alexander Beilinson, both now at the University of Chicago, Illinois, described how to build the right kind of sheaves to make the connection. Their paper (see go.nature.com/4ndp5ev), nearly 400 pages long, has never been formally published. Gaitsgory, together with Dima Arinkin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, made this relationship more precise in 2012; then, working alone, Gaitsgory followed up with a step-by-step outline of how the geometric Langlands might be proved.

“The conjecture as such sounds pretty baroque — and not just to outsiders,” says Ben-Zvi. “I think people are much more excited about the proof of geometric Langlands now than they would have been a decade ago, because we understand better why it's the right kind of question to ask, and why it might be useful for things in number theory.”

One of the most immediate consequences of the new proof is the boost it provides to research on ‘local' versions of the different Langlands conjectures, which ‘zoom in' on particular objects in the ‘global' settings. In the case of the geometric Langlands programme, for example, the local version is concerned with the properties of objects associated with discs around points on a Riemann surface — rather than the whole manifold, which is the domain of the ‘global' version.

Peter Scholze, at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, has been instrumental in forging connections between the local and global Langlands programmes. But initially, even he was daunted by the geometric side.

“To tell the truth,” Scholze says, “until around 2014, the geometric Langlands programme looked incomprehensible to me.” That changed when Laurent Fargues at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris proposed a reimagining of the local arithmetic Langlands conjectures in geometrical terms. Working together, Scholze and Fargues spent seven years showing that this strategy could help to make progress on proving a version of the local arithmetic Langlands conjecture concerning the p-adic numbers, which involve the primes and their powers. They connected it to the global geometric version that the team led by Gaitsgory and Raskin later proved.

The papers by Scholze and Fargues built what Scholze describes as a “wormhole” between the two areas, allowing methods and structures from the global geometric Langlands programme to be imported into the local arithmetic context. “So I'm really happy about the proof,” Scholze says. “I think it's a tremendous achievement and am mining it for parts.”

According to some researchers, one of the most surprising bridges that the geometric Langlands programme has built is to theoretical physics. Since the 1970s, physicists have explored a quantum analogue of a classical symmetry: that swapping electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell's equations, which describe how the two fields interact, leaves the equations unchanged. This elegant symmetry underpins a broader idea in quantum field theory, known as S-duality.

In 2007, Edward Witten at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, and Anton Kapustin at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena were able to show that S-duality in certain four-dimensional gauge theories — a class of theories that includes the standard model of particle physics — possesses the same symmetry that appears in the geometric Langlands correspondence. “Seemingly esoteric notions of the geometric Langlands program,” the pair wrote, “arise naturally from the physics.”

Although their theories include hypothetical particles, called superpartners, that have never been observed, their insight suggests that geometric Langlands is not just a rarefied idea in pure mathematics; instead, it can be seen as a shadow of a deep symmetry in quantum physics. “I do think it is fascinating that the Langlands programme has this counterpart in quantum field theory,” says Witten. “And I think this might eventually be important in the mathematical development of the Langlands programme.”

Among the first to take that possibility seriously was Minhyong Kim, director of the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, UK. “Even simple-sounding problems in number theory — like Fermat's last theorem — are hard,” he says. One way to make headway is by using ideas from physics, like those in Witten and Kapustin's work, as a sort of metaphor for number-theoretic problems, such as the arithmetic Langlands conjecture. Kim is working on making these metaphors more rigorous. “I take various constructions in quantum field theory and try to cook up precise number-theoretic analogues,” he says.

Ben-Zvi, together with Yiannis Sakellaridis at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and Akshay Venkatesh at the IAS, is similarly seeking inspiration from theoretical physics, with a sweeping project that seeks to reimagine the whole Langlands programme from the perspective of gauge theory.

Witten and Kapustin studied two gauge theories connected by S-duality, meaning that, although they look very different mathematically, the theories are equivalent descriptions of reality. Building on this, Ben-Zvi and his colleagues are investigating how charged materials behave in each theory, translating their dual descriptions into a network of interlinked mathematical conjectures.

“Their work really stimulated a lot of research, especially in the number-theory world,” says Raskin. “There's a lot of people who are working in that circle of ideas now.”

One of their most striking results concerns a two-way relationship between quite different mathematical objects called periods and L-functions. (The Riemann hypothesis, considered perhaps the most important unsolved problem in mathematics, is focused on the behaviour of a type of L-function.) Periods are a part of harmonic analysis, whereas L-functions are from the realm of number theory — the two sides of Langlands' original conjectures. However, through the lens of physics, Ben-Zvi and his colleagues showed that the relationship between periods and L-functions also mirrors that of the geometric programme.

Many mathematicians are confident that the proof of the geometric conjecture will stand, but it will take years to peer review the papers setting it out, which have all been submitted to journals. Gaitsgory, however, is already pushing forward on several fronts.

For instance, the existing proof addresses the ‘unramified' case, in which the terrain around points on the Riemann surface is well behaved. Gaitsgory and his collaborators are now hoping to extend their results to the more intricate, ramified case by accounting for more-complex behaviour around points as well as for singularities or ‘punctures' in the surface.

To that end, they are extending their work to the local geometric Langlands conjecture to understand in more detail what happens around a single point — and collaborating with, among others, Jessica Fintzen at the University of Bonn.

“This result opens the door to a whole new range of investigations — and that's where our interests start to converge, even though we come from very different worlds,” she says. “Now they're looking to generalize the proof, and that's what's drawing me deeper into the geometric Langlands. Somehow, the proof's the beginning and not the end.”

Fintzen studies the representations of p-adic groups — groups of matrices where the entries are p-adic numbers. She constructs the matrices explicitly — essentially, deriving a recipe for writing them down — and this seems to be the kind of local information that must be incorporated into the global geometric case to ramify it, Gaitsgory says.

What began as a set of deep conjectures linking abstract branches of mathematics has evolved into a thriving, multidisciplinary effort that stretches from the foundations of number theory to the edges of quantum physics. The Langlands correspondence might not yet be the grand unified theory of mathematics, but the proof of its geometric arm is a nexus of ideas that will probably shape the field for years to come.

“The Langlands correspondence points to much deeper structures in mathematics that we're only scratching the surface of,” says Frenkel. “We don't really understand what they are. They're still behind the curtains.”

A newly released study from Duke University's Pontzer Lab, housed in the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology in Trinity College of Arts & Sciences, looks at the correlations between economic development, daily energy expenditure and the rise in a country's obesity level.

While many experts have offered that rising obesity rates are due to declining physical activity as societies become more industrialized, the findings show that people in wealthier countries expend just as much -- or even more -- energy daily. In an article recently published in PNAS, Duke researchers point instead to higher caloric intake as the primary driver, suggesting that diet rather than idleness plays the bigger role in the global obesity crisis.

"Despite decades of trying to understand the root causes of the obesity crisis in economically developed countries, public health guidance remains stuck with uncertainty as to the relative importance of diet and physical activity. This large, international, collaborative effort allows us to test these competing ideas. It's clear that changes in diet, not reduced activity, are the main cause of obesity in the U.S. and other developed countries," says Herman Pontzer, principal investigator with the Pontzer Lab and professor in the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology.

The researchers analyzed thousands of measurements of daily energy expenditure, body fat percentage and body mass index (BMI) from adults aged 18 to 60 across 34 populations spanning six continents. The more than 4,200 adults included in the study came from a wide range of lifestyles and economies, including hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, farming and industrialized populations. To further categorize the level of industrialization, they also integrated data from the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) to incorporate measures of lifespan, prosperity and education.

"While we saw a marginal decrease in size-adjusted total energy expenditure with economic development, differences in total energy expenditure explained only a fraction of the increase in body fat that accompanied development. This suggests that other factors, such as dietary changes, are driving the increases in body fat that we see with increasing economic development," says Amanda McGrosky, a Duke postdoctoral alumna and lead investigator for the study who is now an assistant professor of biology at Elon University.

The researchers hope the study helps clarify public health messaging and strategies to tackle the obesity crisis and explain that the findings do not mean that efforts to promote physical activity should be minimized. Instead, the data support an emerging consensus that both diet and exercise should be prioritized. "Diet and physical activity should be viewed as essential and complementary, rather than interchangeable," the study notes. They will next work to identify which aspects of diet in developed countries are most responsible for the rise in obesity.

Polygenic scores (PGSs) for body mass index (BMI) may guide early prevention and targeted treatment of obesity. Using genetic data from up to 5.1 million people (4.6% African ancestry, 14.4% American ancestry, 8.4% East Asian ancestry, 71.1% European ancestry and 1.5% South Asian ancestry) from the GIANT consortium and 23andMe, Inc., we developed ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs. The multi-ancestry score explained 17.6% of BMI variation among UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. For other populations, this ranged from 16% in East Asian-Americans to 2.2% in rural Ugandans. In the ALSPAC study, children with higher PGSs showed accelerated BMI gain from age 2.5 years to adolescence, with earlier adiposity rebound. Adding the PGS to predictors available at birth nearly doubled explained variance for BMI from age 5 onward (for example, from 11% to 21% at age 8). Up to age 5, adding the PGS to early-life BMI improved prediction of BMI at age 18 (for example, from 22% to 35% at age 5). Higher PGSs were associated with greater adult weight gain. In intensive lifestyle intervention trials, individuals with higher PGSs lost modestly more weight in the first year (0.55 kg per s.d.) but were more likely to regain it. Overall, these data show that PGSs have the potential to improve obesity prediction, particularly when implemented early in life.

Obesity is a major public health concern that causes or exacerbates many chronic diseases and leads to reduced life expectancy1,2,3. By 2035, more than half of the global population is projected to be living with overweight or obesity4. Although intensive lifestyle interventions (ILIs), bariatric surgery and weight loss medications are effective treatment options5,6, they are not without risk and likely to remain inaccessible to most people. Thus, preventing obesity remains paramount.

In contrast to many other chronic conditions, obesity often manifests itself during childhood and tends to persist into adulthood7,8,9. Therefore, predictors available in early life, such as genetic variants, which are fixed at conception, could be of particular value. In recent years, PGSs that capture an individual's inherited polygenic susceptibility to a trait or disease have shown great promise in enhancing disease risk prediction and population screening10,11. However, it remains unclear how, when and under what circumstances PGSs for obesity might demonstrate utility for risk prediction.

The widely used PGS for obesity by Khera et al.12, based on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BMI in over 339,000 people of predominantly European ancestry, explains approximately 8.5% of the variation in BMI in adults. However, as a PGS based on one ancestry population may have weak transferability to other ancestry populations13,14, there is a growing recognition that PGSs that represent a broad range of populations are needed to ensure quality healthcare for all15.

By leveraging the results of the largest GWAS meta-analyses for BMI from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium and 23andMe, we derived ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs for BMI and obesity to examine their performance (1) across diverse adult populations, (2) across childhood and adolescence and (3) in the context of ILIs aimed at weight loss (Fig. 1).

PGSs were constructed using ancestry-specific GWAS summary statistics, using ancestry-specific (PRS-CS) and ancestry-combined (PRS-CSx) approaches. Tuning of the global shrinkage parameter (ϕ) and optimal weights for the linear combination version of PRS-CSx was performed in the UKBB. The best-performing score across multiple ancestries was taken forward to independent validation studies (linear combination version of PRS-CSx with ϕ 1 × 10−2). Population descriptors shown in the figure reflect a combination of self-identified ethnicity and genetic similarity. Created in BioRender: Smit, R. (2025): https://BioRender.com/fglrflj.

To develop a PGS for BMI, we used GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics for BMI from over 200 studies from the GIANT consortium and 23andMe (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), excluding eight studies used for tuning parameters and for testing performance (Methods). The GWAS summary statistics included contributions from over 5.1 million people of diverse populations based on a combination of self-identified ethnicity and genetic similarity: 71.1% of participants were of predominantly European ancestry; 14.4% were of Hispanic ethnicity with typically admixed ancestries; 8.4% were of predominantly East Asian ancestry; 4.6% were of predominantly African ancestry (primarily admixed African American populations); and 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry. We refer to these groups, and to the most closely aligning, genetically inferred population groups from our PGS tuning and testing studies, as being of European-like ancestry (EUR), East Asian-like ancestry (EAS), American-like ancestry (AMR), African-like ancestry (AFR) and South Asian-like ancestry (SAS), respectively, while acknowledging that these groupings oversimplify the actual genetic diversity among participants (see Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 for study-specific population descriptors). Using PRS-CS(x)16,17, we created ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs leveraging up to 1.3 million common variants. We first identified the optimal genome-wide shrinkage parameter and linear combination weights for PRS-CS(x) that achieved the highest explained variance for BMI in six ancestry subpopulations of the UK Biobank (UKBB)18, including individuals of Middle Eastern-like ancestry (MID). For the EUR-tuning population, we selected a random subset of 20,000 unrelated individuals (Methods and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).

Overall, a multi-ancestry PGS consisting of a linear combination of five ancestry-specific PGSs (PGSLC) was the best-performing score (Methods, Fig. 2a and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). In absolute terms, the explained variance of this multi-ancestry PGS for BMI ranged between 7.2% (AFR) and 17.5% (EUR), with a median of 14.0% (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 5). The multi-ancestry PGS resulted in a higher explained variance than the PGSs trained only with GWAS summary statistics most closely corresponding to the target population (‘ancestry-matched') (Supplementary Table 5). This was particularly evident for the populations of African-like and Central/South Asian-like ancestry (2.6-fold and 2.8-fold increase, respectively), consistent with the smaller GWAS sample sizes available for these populations. The performance of a PGS consisting of near-independent, genome-wide significant variants from the overall multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis was generally intermediate to that of the ancestry-matched and multi-ancestry PGSs, with the exception of populations of East Asian-like and European-like ancestry, in whom it performed worse than either (Fig. 2a).

a, Explained variance for BMI in UKBB tuning populations, defined as adjusted R2 of the rank-based inverse-normal transformed BMI (by sex) predicted by the PGS, incremental to age, genotyping array and ancestry principal components. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from 1,000 bootstrap resamples. The ancestry-matched PGS is the best-performing PRS-CS score using ancestry-specific GWAS summary statistics. The genome-wide significant score reflects a weighted sum of near-independent SNPs obtained from approximate COJO multi-SNP analyses of a fixed-effect meta-analysis of all contributing GWASs. The multi-ancestral PGSLC reflects the best-performing PRS-CSx score consisting of a linear combination of five ancestry-specific scores, with weights being specific to the validation population (for example, AFR). Population labels follow PAN-UKBB assignment of genetically determined ancestry.

For the MVP's non-Hispanic Asian (AS) group, the result shown is for the PGSLC using the linear combination weights derived from UKBB-EAS. Sample sizes (distinct individuals), from left to right: AFR 12,263, 2,332, 18,701; AMR 10,281, 8,096; AS 4,201; EAS 1,359; SAS 1,177; EUR 13,673, 69,828, 340,224. c, Separation in BMI, body fat percentage (BF%) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) across deciles of the PGSLC within the validation subset of the UKBB participants of European-like ancestry (n ~ 340,000). All traits were rank-based inverse-normal transformed by sex.

Having tuned parameters in a subset of the UKBB, we took PGSLC forward to independent validation populations, estimating the prediction accuracy for BMI and obesity in 482,135 participants from the UKBB, the Million Veteran Program (MVP)19,20, the BioMe Biobank21 and the Uganda General Population Cohort (GPC-UGR)22. Individuals were grouped by population group (AMR 22,612, AFR 29,454, EAS 1,617, EUR 423,420, SAS 1,164 and non-Hispanic Asian (AS) 4,201) (MVP-specific population label) (Methods and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The prevalence of obesity varied substantially across populations and cohorts, with those having obesity class I or higher (that is, BMI ≥ 30 kg m−2 in AFR, AMR and EUR populations and BMI ≥ 27.5 kg m−2 for Asian-like ancestry populations23) ranging from 4.3% for the GPC-UGR to more than 45% for all ancestry subgroups in the MVP and mean BMI ranging from 22.2 kg m−2 to 30.6 kg m2 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 4).

The performance of the PGSLC was highest in individuals of European-like ancestry from the UKBB, with an explained variance of 17.6%. A pronounced lower performance was seen for populations with greater proportions of African-like ancestry, with the explained variance being 6.3% and 5.1% in African American populations (from BioMe and MVP, respectively) and 2.2% in the GPC-UGR population from rural southwestern Uganda (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 7). Overall, we observed a median explained variance of 10.3% across our testing populations.

Compared to the previously reported PGS by Khera et al. (PGSKhera)12, which was based on a smaller BMI GWAS of up to 339,224 individuals of primarily European ancestry24, we observed a 1.9–2.6-fold increase in explained variance for BMI (Fig. 2b).

Within the UKBB participants of European-like ancestry, the explained variance was marginally higher in males than in females (males: 17.9%; females: 17.3%) and higher in younger compared to older participants (≤50 years: 18.8%; >50 years: 17.0%) (Supplementary Table 8), both directionally consistent with sex-specific and age-specific genetic differences previously observed for BMI25,26. Within this same cohort, an s.d. increase of PGSLC was associated with a 1.98 kg m−2 higher BMI (equivalent to 5.7 kg of body weight for a 1.7-m tall person) (Supplementary Table 9). The corresponding mean separation across deciles of PGSLC was less pronounced for body fat percentage and waist-to-hip ratio compared to BMI (Fig. 2c), revealing that the score does not equally capture differences in body composition.

We further evaluated the overall performance and discrimination of the PGS for prevalent obesity. Among European-like ancestry population groups, the PGSLC showed an improved capacity to differentiate between participants with and without obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg m−2) compared to PGSKhera. Specifically, the prevalence in the top 1% of the PGSLC was 69.5% versus 54.9% for PGSKhera and, in the bottom 1%, 1.7% versus 5.1%, respectively (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 2). Across populations, an s.d. increase in PGSLC was associated with a median 1.9–2.6-fold increase in odds of obesity class I or higher (Fig. 3b). We observed larger effects for more severe obesity (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) similarly increased with the severity of obesity and neared 0.80 for severe obesity in multiple populations (Fig. 3c). The AUC for PGSLC on its own was consistently larger than those for age and sex, PGSKhera and within the UKBB self-reported comparative body size at age 10 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 11).

Error bars show 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The horizontal lines correspond to the average prevalence (black, dotted) and the prevalence of obesity within the top and bottom 1% of PGSKhera and PGSLC (red and blue, respectively). b, Odds ratios with 95% CIs for prevalent obesity class I or higher, per s.d. of PGSKhera and PGSLC, adjusted for age, sex, principal components of ancestry and genotyping array.

Models including PGSs (included as a continuous predictor) additionally include principal components of ancestry. CBS10, self-reported comparative body size at age 10 years. Restricted to estimates where the number of individuals with the obesity outcome was at least 50.

After an ancestry adjustment (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 4), the median odds ratio for obesity class I or higher across BioMe's population groups was 3.6 for those in the top 10% of PGSLC (compared to bottom 90%) and 4.1 for the top 5% (versus those in the bottom 95%) (Supplementary Table 12), with greater separation between these two tail estimates for European-like and Asian-like ancestry groups.

We investigated whether PGSLC has predictive value at an early age within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a geographically homogeneous prospective birth cohort from the southwest of England with follow-up until early adulthood (Methods and Supplementary Table 3)27,28,29. Repeated cross-sectional associations with BMI showed small effects for PGSLC soon after birth with much stronger effects emerging in early childhood, from 0.12 s.d. per s.d. of PGSLC at 12 months to nearly quadruple that size (0.45 s.d. per s.d. of PGSLC) by age 12 years, after which effects plateaued (Fig. 4a). The PGS was also associated, albeit less strongly, with height in early childhood with effects increasing until age 12 years, after which they returned to zero by mid-adolescence, suggesting that genetic predisposition for higher BMI early in life promotes increased body size in general, including postnatal linear growth, but that this early growth does not translate into differences in height after puberty (Extended Data Fig. 5). This is in line with childhood overweight and obesity's known associations with earlier pubertal timing30. Over time, BMI in children with a higher genetic predisposition (PGS ≥10th percentile) increased at a faster rate than those with a lower genetic predisposition, most evident after age 2.5 years (Methods, Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 13). Both boys and girls with a very early age of adiposity rebound (≤43 months), a well-established predictor of future obesity risk31, had a higher mean PGS than those with later ages of adiposity rebound (Supplementary Table 14).

Data are presented as regression coefficient with 95% confidence interval (CI). Ponderal index was used instead of BMI at birth. Associations were adjusted for age and principal components of ancestry. Sample sizes, based on repeated measurements, from left to right, for BMI: 4,740, 638, 847, 814, 769, 41, 732, 729, 725, 720, 699, 5,816, 4,863, 5,570, 5,368, 5,187, 4,910, 4,556, 4,024, 3,603, 2,780; and height: 4,802, 638, 847, 814, 771, 741, 734, 729, 726, 723, 701, 5,820, 5,160, 5,572, 5,379, 5,188, 4,956, 4,561, 4,032, 3,606, 2,782. b, Sequentially plotted mean BMI trajectories from the age of 4 months to 24 years with knot points from linear spline multilevel models, accounting for sex and principal components of ancestry, of PGSLC (bottom 10%, middle 80%, top 10%). c, Contribution of PGSLC to explained variance (adjusted R2) for BMI, rank-based inverse-normal transformed by sex and timepoint. Ponderal index was used instead of BMI at birth. Data are presented as R2 values computed from the original dataset, with error bars representing 95% confidence intervals (2.5th–97.5th percentiles) estimated from 1,000 bootstrap resamples. Predictors available at birth were birthweight, maternal education, pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, maternal age at date of birth and household social status. The left panel shows explained variance for BMI at the timepoint shown on the x axis. In contrast, the right panel shows explained variance for BMI measured at 18 years, with early-life BMI measurement shown on the x axis used as predictors. Sample sizes, based on repeated measurements, from left to right: 3,800, 839, 714, 1,192, 4,062, 3,044, 940, 594, 737, 725, 890, 3,310.

We then examined whether the PGS adds predictive value over and above clinically available predictors of obesity. When added to predictors that are measurable at birth (birthweight, maternal education, pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, maternal age at date of birth and household social status), the PGS showed no clear added value for predicting ponderal index at birth or BMI at ages 3 years and 5 years (Methods and Fig. 4c, left panel). However, for predicting BMI at later ages (8, 11 and 15 years), the contribution of the predictors at birth plateaued, whereas inclusion of the PGS roughly doubled the total explained variance from 11% to 21% at age 8 and from 13% to 26% at age 15 (Fig. 4c, left panel).

For the prediction of BMI in early adulthood, the contribution of the PGS especially shines through in the first few years after birth. BMI measured at age 8 explained 44% of the variation in BMI at age 18, and adding the PGS to the prediction model only raised this to 49%. In contrast, at younger ages, adding the PGS to measured BMI led to larger relative increases in the explained variance for BMI at 18 years, from 1.5-fold at age 5 (from 22% to 35%) to more than three-fold (from 8% to 26%) at 1 year of age (Fig. 4c, right panel, and Supplementary Table 15).

Within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial (Methods)32, both males and females with a higher PGS experienced a greater change in self-reported weight and BMI between age 20 and age 50. Across populations, the per-5-year change per s.d. in PGSLC was consistently larger for females than for males (median of 0.35 kg for females versus 0.21 kg for males and 0.14 kg m−2 versus 0.07 kg m−2 for BMI), also when corrected for initial weight or BMI (Supplementary Table 16).

The addition of the PGS to a model with birth year, sex and BMI at age 20 was associated with modest increases in discriminative ability for predicting obesity at age 50 (incremental AUC ranged from 0.01 to 0.03; Fig. 5). There was evidence of statistical interaction between the PGS and BMI at age 20 for obesity at age 50 (Methods and Supplementary Table 17), which translated into a larger incremental AUC of the PGS for those who did not have overweight or obesity at age 20 (range, 0.02–0.05; Fig. 5), without strong evidence of sex specificity (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Lifestyle modification remains a cornerstone of weight management, with multicomponent ILIs having shown success in achieving clinically relevant weight loss33. However, ILIs require substantial, sustained investment from both healthcare providers and patients, with large variation in weight loss and unintentional weight regain being common34,35,36. To examine whether polygenic predisposition to obesity might modify the effectiveness of such interventions, we examined whether the PGS was associated with weight loss during the first year of an ILI, and with weight regain thereafter, in two randomized controlled trials with similar intervention arms aimed at achieving 7% weight loss: the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP33) and the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes37) studies (Methods).

Among 3,909 participants (Supplementary Table 4), individuals with a higher PGSLC lost more weight during the first year in response to the ILI compared to the control group (−0.55 kg per s.d. in PGS, 95% confidence interval: −0.94 to −0.16) (Fig. 6), when adjusting for starting weight. In addition, among those who lost at least 3% of their baseline weight during the first year, a higher PGS was associated with more weight regain in the following years (up to 3 years) (0.48 kg per PGS s.d., 95% confidence interval: 0.00–0.95) (Fig. 6). These findings were directionally consistent across (self-)reported population groups.

Interaction effect between PGSLC and trial arm (ILI versus comparison arm) for weight change within the first year of follow-up (left) and weight change after the first year in the subset of individuals who had lost ≥3% of baseline weight at year 1 (right). Data are presented as study-specific and study-combined interaction regression coefficients (with 95% confidence interval (CI)), pooled through inverse-variance weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis. Weight change was assessed by using weight at follow-up timepoint(s) as outcome in the linear mixed models, adjusting for initial weight (baseline or year 1, respectively). LA, Look AHEAD. Population descriptors reflect race and ethnicity, as reported by dbGAP variable phv00201855.v2.p1 (DPP) or self-report by participants (LA). Study-specific sample sizes (distinct individuals, with pooled sample sizes for ‘All'), from top to bottom, for forest plot on the left: 295, 374, 251, 428, 839, 1,722, 1,385, 2,524; and on the right: 118, 186, 128, 233, 428, 951, 674, 1,370.

We used GWAS summary statistics from the GIANT consortium and 23andMe, encompassing over 5.1 million people, to create ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs capturing genetic predisposition to weight gain and obesity. Our multi-ancestry PGS more than doubled the explained variance for BMI compared to the widely used PGS by Khera et al.12. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential added value of the PGS in two distinct clinical applications: predicting adult BMI at an early age and weight change in response to ILIs.

Across diverse populations, the increases in explained variance for BMI were accompanied by substantial improvements in effect sizes and discrimination metrics for obesity, with the PGSs' standalone AUC nearing 0.80 for severe obesity. Consistent with other polygenic traits, our results underscore the importance of training sample size in driving PGS performance improvements. Nonetheless, our results also show diminishing returns of sample size increases, as has been observed for other polygenic traits38, with a 15-fold increase in total sample size (compared to PGSKhera, ~10-fold in EUR alone) leading to a 2–3-fold increase in prediction accuracy. We leveraged PRS-CSx's unique ability to integrate GWAS summary statistics from all five broad ancestry population groups from the meta-analyses from GIANT and 23andMe17. However, recent Bayesian methods have shown promising results with smaller sample sizes by including additional variants and functional annotation, meriting consideration for future comparisons39,40. Although our results highlight the value of multi-ancestry PGS to increase PGS performance, a considerable performance gap persists for populations with substantial African-like genetic ancestry compared to other populations. This discrepancy is likely due to the underrepresentation of individuals with African-like ancestry in the training GWAS, particularly from continental Africa41, and differences in minor allele frequency (MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns42,43. The lower performance of the PGS in the GPC-UGR is in line with those seen therein for PGSs for other traits and the limited transferability of PGS performance between African ancestry populations, reflecting genetic and environmental differences as well as their interactions22,44,45,46,47, emphasising that much remains to be done to improve the performance of genetic risk prediction across the genetically diverse populations within Africa. For example, it remains unclear whether a finer classification of broad ancestry groups in GWAS meta-analyses and PGS development could improve downstream PGS generalizability, especially given the dominant role of GWAS sample size. Given the observed performance gap, careful implementation of the score is essential to avoid potentially introducing public health disparities. For example, establishing a standardized ancestry threshold14,48 may improve the accuracy of population-specific risk stratification and ensure that the score is returned only in populations where it meets an acceptable performance threshold.

Within ALSPAC, the PGS—which was developed for adult BMI—already shows an effect on BMI early in life. Effect sizes rapidly increased with age and were accompanied by clear divergence of BMI trajectories throughout childhood and adolescence. As a result, the PGS showed added value beyond clinically available predictors assessed at birth for predicting BMI measured after age 5. This is in line with previous research on the dynamic relationship between genetic variation and adiposity in early life12,49,50. Particularly elucidating are the observations from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) with repeated measurements across narrow age windows51. They show that BMI has a rapidly changing genetic architecture during the first 8 years of life with a ‘late rise' cluster of variants, emerging in late childhood, which show limited association before the adiposity rebound but have persistent effects on BMI into adult life51. This also explains why our PGS shows its value for predicting adult BMI during the earliest years of life, up to age 5, when measured BMI has limited value as a predictor. With a growing number of obesity prevention trials commencing in early life52,53, our results provide important context at what age(s) PGSs for obesity, potentially in tandem with PGSs of obesity-related complications, could be considered promising candidate predictors to help guide risk stratification and the implementation of such interventions.

In the PLCO study, a higher PGS was associated with weight gain over a 30-year period from early adulthood to midlife. Additionally, for individuals aged 20, knowing their PGS modestly improved the prediction of obesity at age 50, more so for those without overweight or obesity at age 20. This suggests that particularly individuals with an early adulthood BMI below their genetically predicted BMI are at risk of gaining weight to match their innate predisposition. Our findings are consistent with those from the CARDIA study54, showing that PGSs for obesity only marginally improve the prediction of midlife BMI when combined with early adulthood BMI measurements, contrasting with its predictive value in early life.

Analyzing clinical trial data of ILIs, we observed that individuals with a higher PGS lost modestly more weight during the first year. However, this group was also at higher risk of weight regain after this most intensive portion of the intervention had concluded. This may seem counterintuitive to the expectation that those with a higher genetic risk will benefit less from weight loss interventions. However, this observation is supported by a strong body of literature reporting that those most genetically predisposed to obesity are also those most responsive to changes in an obesogenic environment55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63. However, the literature on the role of genetics modifying response to weight loss interventions remains sparse and ambiguous, reflecting differences in variants considered, methods and study design, highlighting the need for well-powered PGSs64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73. It will be of interest to investigate whether PGSs for obesity have predictive utility for the fast-growing arsenal of pharmacotherapies aimed at weight loss. Separately, the current results offer crucial context when conveying genetic results of obesity risk to participants, which has generally shown either no or even short-lived adverse effects on risk-reducing behavior74,75,76,77. Rather, our findings emphasize that individuals with a high genetic predisposition to obesity may respond more to lifestyle changes and, thus, contrast with the determinist view that genetic predisposition is unmodifiable78. This is further reinforced by evidence that polygenic susceptibility can mitigate or exacerbate the impact of pathogenic variants in MC4R, underscoring the complexity of genetic influences on obesity79. We look forward to the findings of the Electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network's PGS-based genome-informed risk assessment being returned to 25,000 diverse adults and children for 11 conditions, including obesity/BMI14.

Taken together, we show that BMI PGSs can be used for prediction of adult obesity throughout the life course, particularly in early life, and for severe obesity. This PGS represents a substantial improvement compared to previous scores and may help to identify individuals at high risk to allow for timely prevention or treatment of obesity, such as through integration in a broader predictive framework jointly modeling genetic and environmental risk.

The list of studies contributing to the GWAS meta-analyses for BMI, which served as the training data for the presented PGSs, is provided in Supplementary Table 1. The study populations described below are those that contributed as a PGS tuning or validation population.

The UKBB is a prospective cohort study that enrolled approximately 500,000 people from across the UK, aged 40–69 years at recruitment, between 2006 and 2010 (ref. 18). At recruitment, participants completed detailed questionnaires, underwent a range of physical measures and provided blood, urine and saliva samples. BMI was calculated using height (measured in whole centimeters) and weight (to the nearest 0.1 kg). Females who were pregnant at the time of assessment were excluded from our analysis. As a measure of comparative childhood body size, participants were asked: ‘When you were 10 years old, compared to average, would you describe yourself as: (i) thinner, (ii) plumper, (iii) about average?'.

The MVP has recruited over 1 million people from Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Centers across the United States since 2011 (ref. 19). Veterans who volunteer provide a blood sample for biobanking, complete baseline and lifestyle questionnaires and consent to allow access to clinical data from VA electronic health records (EHRs). For the current study, PGS performance was assessed in the MVP's third release of genomic data (R3) using additional participants without overlap, with earlier data releases contributing to the GIANT GWAS meta-analyses. Phenotypic and genomic data related to the association analysis of BMI were previously described20.

The Institute for Personalized Medicine BioMe Biobank, founded in 2007, is an ancestrally and culturally highly diverse EHR-linked biorepository enrolling participants non-selectively from across the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City21. At enrollment, participants consent to link their DNA and plasma samples to deidentified EHRs. The clinical and EHR information is complemented by a baseline questionnaire that gathers demographic and lifestyle information. BMI was calculated using weight and height from baseline and outpatient EHR measurements, using median height and weight measured at or within 60 days before/after the enrollment visit, after several cleaning steps (Supplementary Table 3).

The GPC-UGR is a population-based open cohort study established in 1989 by the Medical Research Council (UK) in collaboration with the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) to monitor the HIV epidemic and its determinants in neighboring villages in rural southwestern Uganda, in the Kyamulibwa subcounty of the Kalungu district, approximately 120 km from Entebbe town. Since 2010, its mandate has expanded to incorporate the epidemiology and genetics of both communicable and non-communicable diseases22. The GPC-UGR was initially recruited and assessed through annual house-to-house census and survey rounds until 2012, when biannual surveys commenced. For the current study, we included individuals aged 18 years and older who have been either whole-genome genotyped or whole-genome sequenced80,81.

The ALSPAC is a prospective birth cohort from the southwest of England established to investigate environmental and genetic characteristics that influence health, development and growth of children and their parents27,28,29. Full details of the cohort and study design are available at http://www.alspac.bris.ac.uk. In brief, pregnant females residing in Avon, UK, with expected dates of delivery between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992 were invited to take part in the study. The initial number of pregnancies enrolled was 14,541, with 13,988 children who were alive at 1 year of age. The children resulting from these pregnancies have been followed-up to date with measures obtained through regular questionnaires and clinical visits, providing information on a range of behavioral, lifestyle and biological data. More specifically, a 10% sample of the ALSPAC cohort, known as the Children in Focus (CiF) group, attended clinics at the University of Bristol at various time intervals between 4 months and 61 months of age, whereas the entire ALSPAC cohort was invited to attend regular research clinics from age 7. When the oldest children were approximately age 7, an attempt was made to bolster the initial sample with eligible individuals who had failed to join the study originally. The total sample size available for analyses using any data collected after the age of 7 is, therefore, 15,447 pregnancies, with 14,901 children who were alive at 1 year of age. Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools hosted at the University of Bristol82. REDCap is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies. Details on sample selection for the current analyses are presented in Supplementary Table 3. Please note that the study website contains details of all data that are available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/).

The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial was a multicenter randomized controlled trial in the United States that enrolled males and females aged 55–74 years from 1993 to 2001 to evaluate the effectiveness of different screening programs on cancer mortality32. In the baseline questionnaire, participants self-reported their weight at age 20 years, age 50 years and baseline as well as their height. For the current study, we restricted the analyses to genotyped participants who had not contributed to the underlying GWAS meta-analyses and had information available on their weight and BMI at both age 20 and age 50.

The DPP was a 27-site parallel-arm randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether either the oral diabetes drug metformin or an ILI (primarily fat gram, calorie and physical activity goals) aimed at approximately 7% weight loss, compared to inactive tablets and standard lifestyle recommendations, could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes onset in ethnically diverse high-risk individuals with prediabetes and overweight or obesity33. For the current study, we excluded individuals from the metformin arm as well as those from a fourth intervention arm, troglitazone, which was discontinued at an early stage. Moreover, we focused on the individuals comprising the three largest race and ethnicity categories (White, Black and Hispanic, as reported by database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP) variable phv00201855.v2.p1) who had consented to being genotyped.

Look AHEAD was a 16-site parallel-arm randomized controlled trial that assessed the long-term effects of an ILI in ethnically diverse patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality37. The lifestyle intervention was modeled after the DPP lifestyle intervention and similarly aimed at 7% weight loss but with more ambitious individual goals for several intervention components83. Although those in both trial arms were provided one session of education on diabetes and cardiovascular risk at baseline, the comparison arm thereafter received the option of attending only three sessions per year on nutrition, physical activity and social support, with no explicit weight loss goals. As for the DPP, we restricted our analyses to genotyped participants who self-reported as being of African American/Black, Hispanic and White race and ethnicity on the baseline questionnaire.

Population descriptors and study-provided population labels and genotyping, phenotyping and participant characteristics are presented in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. No new data (that is, measurements) were collected for this study, and no participant compensation was provided for the analyses conducted.

To derive our scores, we used summary statistics from the ongoing GWAS meta-analyses for BMI conducted by the GIANT consortium (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium) in collaboration with 23andMe. Prior to each GWAS, BMI (kg m−2) underwent rank-based inverse-normal transformation by sex, similarity to major ancestry group (AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR, SAS) and case–control status as appropriate, with age, age2, principal components of population structure and study-specific covariates regressed out. Ancestry group assignment was defined independently by each contributing study, as previously described84. Additive GWAS analyses were performed primarily using RVTESTS for 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) phase 3 or Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC)-imputed data85. For 23andMe, which performed its GWAS on BMI using self-reported height and weight, see Supplementary Table 2 for details on phenotyping, ancestry group assignment and GWAS methodology. Quality control of the study-specific files was conducted using EasyQC86, followed by fixed-effect meta-analysis by ancestry group using RAREMETAL87. When performing the GWAS meta-analyses to train the PGSs with, we purposely excluded data from several populations (ALSPAC, BioMe and UKBB). No additional genomic control was applied to the resulting summary statistics.

For PGS derivation, we employed PRS-CS and its multi-ancestral extension PRS-CSx (versions 1.0.0)16,17. In short, PRS-CS(x) uses a Bayesian regression framework and assumes a continuous shrinkage prior on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects. Whereas PRS-CS focuses on creating ancestry-specific scores, informed only by the GWAS summary statistics and LD information of a given population, PRS-CSx uses a shared prior to couple SNP effects across populations and explicitly models population-specific allele frequencies and LD patterns to create multi-ancestry scores. Both methods were implemented using the software's default settings (that is, gamma–gamma priors set to a = 1 and b = 0.5, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) total and burn-in iterations set at 1,000 times and 500 times the number of discovery populations and MC thinning factor set at 5), with input being ancestry-matched summary statistics and PRS-CS(x) developer-provided 1000G LD reference panels of common HapMap3 variants (AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR, SAS). PRS-CS(x) uses a global scaling parameter (Φ), which requires tuning. In addition to small-scale grid testing of Φ (1 × 10−6, 1 × 10−4, 1 × 10−2, 1), we ran PRS-CS(x) using its ‘auto' option, which learns Φ automatically from the GWAS summary statistics. Finally, PRS-CSx was performed separately using its default ‘linear combination' as well as its ‘meta' version. In the first, a set of population-specific PGSs is outputted (that is, five in our case), for which the optimal linear combination needs to be derived for each target population (for example, AFR) in a population-matched tuning dataset. For ‘meta', the population-specific posterior SNP effects are integrated using an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis in the Gibbs sampler, producing a single score that can theoretically be applied regardless of the target population.

The variants considered for PGS derivation were those present in the 1000G reference panels mentioned above (HapMap3 variants (n = 1–1.2 million across panels), which were common in 1000G populations, excluding ambiguous A/T or G/C variants), which additionally had an INFO > 0.3 (that is, imputation quality) in the overall UKBB. Ancestry-specific summary statistics were further restricted to the variants with a variant-specific sample size of at least a third of the maximum sample size for that ancestry.

Tuning of Φ and derivation of PRS-CSx's linear combination weights were performed in the same subsets of the UKBB. More specifically, we used genetically determined relatedness and ancestry assignments provided by the Pan-UKBB Team (https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org, UKBB return 2442) to subset the UKBB into groups of unrelated individuals of African-like, Admixed American-like, Central/South Asian-like, East Asian-like, European-like (random subset of 20,000 individuals) and Middle Eastern-like ancestry. The target-population-specific (for example, AFR) linear combination weights for PRS-CSx (for each Φ) were derived from a joint linear regression model of rank-based inverse-normal transformed BMI (by sex and population) on the five population-specific scores (each standardized to mean zero and unit variance in the corresponding tuning dataset—for example, UKBBAFR), age, 10 principal components and genotyping array.

Explained variance for BMI was defined as the incremental adjusted R2 from linear regression for rank-based inverse-normal transformed BMI (by sex and population), when adding the PGS predictor to a model containing age, principal components and genotyping array. Confidence intervals (95%) were determined using bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions. As comparator, we created a score of quasi-independent associations after performing approximate conditional and joint (COJO) multiple-SNP analysis88, as implemented in GCTA89, using the results from the multi-ancestral GWAS summary statistics when leaving out only the UKBB. We used genotypes from a previously described set of 50,000 unrelated UKBBEUR participants84 as our LD reference panel for GCTA-COJO, with parameters set to: –diff-freq 0.1; –maf 0.01; –cojo-collinear 0.9; –cojo-p 5 × 10−9. The scores with the highest explained variance across multiple tuning population datasets (PRS-CSx linear combination and meta versions, with Φ 1 × 10−2) were then taken forward to the validation populations, which performed study-level variant filtering on imputation quality when constructing each PGS (Supplementary Table 3). The results of PGSmeta are presented throughout the supplementary tables.

Of note, in August 2023, a new version of PRS-CSx was released (version 1.1.0) to address potential reductions in performance due to truncating of GWAS summary statistics P values below 1 × 10−323. Given our inclusion of several variants with P values below this threshold (among the PGS variants: n = 154 for EUR, n = 12 for AMR), we reran PRS-CSx with Φ 1 × 10−2 but did not observe markedly different results in PGS performance within the UKBB tuning populations (Supplementary Table 18).

In addition to explained variance (%) for BMI, several population-stratified metrics for overall performance and discrimination were calculated in the validation studies with adult participants:

Nagelkerke R2, with a null model of age, sex, principal components and genotyping array, for prevalent obesity categories based on World Health Organization (WHO) BMI cutoff points (membership of category or above versus rest), using Asian-specific cutoffs where applicable (Supplementary Table 3)23. Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions.

Mean difference in BMI, both untransformed and after rank-based inverse-normal transformation by sex, per s.d. increase in PGS. Covariates included age, sex (where applicable), principal components and genotyping array.

Odds ratio per s.d. of PGS for prevalent WHO obesity outcome. Same covariates as under (B). Here, the PGSs were standardized to mean zero and unit variance using the mean and s.d. of the PGS observed within participants without the outcome (for example, individuals who do not fall within obesity class I (or higher), where this was the outcome), to account for prevalence differences across studies.

AUC statistic for prevalent WHO obesity outcomes. We compare models including (i) age and sex, (ii) genotyping array, principal components and PGSKhera, (iii) genotyping array, principal components and PGSLC and (iv) models (i)/(iii) combined. In the UKBB, we additionally ran models including and excluding self-reported comparative body size at age 10 (UKBB field ID 1687). Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using DeLong's method.

In addition, the explained variance for BMI was calculated separately in age strata (≤50 years or >50 years, with adjustment for residual age differences within age strata) and sex strata of the European UKBB participants. The main comparator for all analyses was a previously published LDpred-derived PGS for BMI (PGSKhera)12, which was based on the results from a GIANT consortium GWAS meta-analysis including up to 339,224 individuals of primarily European ancestry24. As BioMe had contributed to this meta-analysis, metrics for PGSKhera were determined in individuals who had not contributed nor were related to those who did (second or stronger degree of relatedness, based on KING-derived kinship coefficients). We chose PGSKhera as our comparator as it is the most widely recognized and extensively used PGS for BMI within the obesity research community, thereby serving as a well-established benchmark.

Due to on-average differences in LD structure and allele frequencies, the distribution of a PGS (for example, mean and variance) can differ across ancestral populations. This was also observed for the five population-specific PGSs that were linearly combined to create PGSLC (Extended Data Fig. 4). As performance metrics that rely on thresholding the PGS distribution (for example, top 10%) may be impacted by such on-average differences90, particularly in admixed populations, we modeled the mean and variance of the population-specific PGSs through principal component analysis of the 1000G reference panel. For this, we applied a correction described by the eMERGE network14,91, which represents a modified version of the approach by Khera et al.92. Starting with a publicly available, curated version of the 1000G reference panel (https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Imputation_Pipeline/references_overview; gs://broad-gotc-test-storage/imputation/1000 G_reference_panel), we first excluded variants with MAF < 1% across 1000G superpopulations, before determining the overlap with genotyped variants available for both the UKBB and BioMe. After excluding long-range LD regions, we pruned the list of variants using plink (–indep-pairwise 1000 50 0.05) and ran principal component analysis with flashpca93, whereafter we projected UKBB and BioMe participants to the same 1000G principal component space. For each of the five population-specific PGSs underlying PGSLC (that is, AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR and SAS), we regressed the PGS of 1000G participants against the first 10 principal components of ancestry:

In addition, we modeled its residual variance (\({\delta }^{2}\)) as a function of the same principal components:

Then, using the projected principal component, predicted mean and residual s.d. were calculated and used to create ancestry-adjusted z-scores of each PGS for UKBB and BioMe participants:

with \({\sum }_{j=1}^{M}{w}_{\!j}\times {{dosage}}_{j}\) representing the raw PGS.

We observed that mean and variance differences of scores across ancestry populations were largely, but not fully, resolved through this correction in both study populations (Extended Data Fig. 4). In keeping with PRS-CSx's linear combination approach, weights to linearly combine scores were derived within each UKBB tuning population and applied to BioMe validation populations. The ancestry-adjusted PGSLC was then thresholded at its top 5% and 10% separately (versus bottom 95% and 90%, respectively), and odds ratios for prevalent obesity were calculated, adjusting for age, sex and genotyping array. Given the relatively lower number of East Asian and South Asian individuals available for these tail comparisons, we present pooled estimates.

Although we primarily report on the development and performance of the PGSLC trained with the larger GIANT+23andMe BMI GWAS meta-analyses results, we initially developed a multi-ancestry PGS with the GIANT-only results. For this, we used PRS-CS, combining GIANT's combined multi-ancestral GWAS summary statistics (including BioMe but excluding the UKBB and the ALSPAC study) with a previously described multi-ancestry 1000G-based LD reference panel created following the same protocol as described by the PRS-CS authors94. We restricted variants to those present in the LD reference panel, which additionally had MAF ≥ 0.1% and INFO ≥ 0.8 in the overall UKBB, resulting in a total of 1,217,710 variants included. We did not specify a genome-wide shrinkage parameter for PRS-CS, which it therefore learned from the training data using a fully Bayesian approach (its ‘auto' option). In collaboration with the eMERGE network, this GIANT-only PGS was included among a select group of trait-specific scores currently being returned as part of a genome-informed risk assessment (GIRA) to 25,000 diverse adults and children and their healthcare providers in an ongoing prospective cohort study across 10 clinical sites, as recently described14,48. In line with the aim of returning a high-risk versus a not-high-risk GIRA status to participants, we estimated the odds ratio for obesity class I (or higher) for being in the top 3% of the PGS distribution (versus bottom 97%) within the subset of BioMe participants genotyped with the Global Screening Array (with 1000G imputation) who had not contributed to the underlying GIANT GWAS meta-analysis nor were related to those who did. Accounting for age, sex and four principal components, we observed that values within the top 3% of this PGS were associated with 4.08 (95% confidence interval: 3.02–5.52) times as high odds for prevalent obesity in individuals of self-reported European descent, with 2.54 (95% confidence interval: 1.55–3.98) for individuals of self-reported African descent, with 2.33 (95% confidence interval: 1.64–3.31) for individuals of self-reported Hispanic/Latino descent and with 5.73 (95% confidence interval: 2.28–14.57) for individuals of self-reported Asian descent. The weights for this GIANT-only PGS are made available through the PGS Catalog alongside the weights for PGSLC and PGSmeta (see ‘Data availability').

Within the ALSPAC study, repeated anthropometric measurements are available from birth to age 24. We employed both cross-sectional and multilevel analyses to provide complementary perspectives: cross-sectional analyses facilitate granular comparisons at each timepoint, whereas multilevel models capture longitudinal trajectories and population-level divergence over time. First, we assessed repeated cross-sectional associations between the standardized PGS (PGSLC using linear combination weights from UKBBEUR) and all available measures of BMI (or ponderal index at birth) and height. Anthropometric measurements were rank-based inverse-normal transformed separately by sex, at each timepoint, and analyses were adjusted for age at timepoint and principal components.

Longitudinal analyses using linear spline multilevel models were conducted to examine the association between the PGS (bottom 10%, middle 80%, top 10%) and change in untransformed BMI and height between 4 months and 24 years. Multilevel models estimate the mean trajectories of each anthropometric trait while accounting for non-independence of repeated measures within individuals, change in scale and variance of measures over time and differences in the number and timing of measurements between individuals (using all available data from all eligible participants under a missing-at-random assumption). Linear splines allow knot points to be fitted at different ages to derive periods of change that are approximately linear. All participants with at least one measure of the anthropometric traits were included under a missing-at-random assumption to minimize selection bias in trajectories estimated using linear spline multilevel models (with two levels of random effects: measurement occasion (that is, age to the nearest integer in years) and individual), allowing individuals to have different intercepts and slopes and, thus, their own trajectories. Knot points were placed as follows for each anthropometric trait based on the distribution and longitudinal pattern of measures between the earliest measure and 24 years: at ages 4 months and 8 months and at ages 2.5 years, 5 years, 8 years and 15 years for BMI and at ages 1 year, 5 years and 15 years for height. Interaction terms between PGS and each spline were included in the models to estimate the difference in the intercepts (earliest anthropometric trait measurement) and slopes (change in anthropometric trait from the earliest measure to 24 years) between the three PGS categories. Additionally, interaction terms between sex and the first 10 genetic principal components with each spline were included to estimate the difference in intercepts and slopes between males and females; therefore, models were adjusted for sex and principal components. All longitudinal models were created in MLwiN version 3.04 called from Stata version 15 using the ‘runmlwin' command95.

In the CiF subset of the cohort, age at adiposity rebound was available, categorized as very early (at/before 43 months), early (from 49 months but before 61 months) and later (after 61 months)96. These children represent a 10% sample of the cohort, randomly selected for more detailed investigations, and are representative of the entire cohort (https://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/cohort-profile/). One-way ANOVA was used to test for differences in mean PGS across categories, in boys and girls separately and combined.

Added value of the PGS for prediction of BMI (rank-based inverse-normal transformed by sex) at given timepoints was quantified as incremental explained variance, when adding the PGS to different sets of predictors. First, we examined R2 for BMI at birth and at 3, 5, 8, 11 and 15 years, when adding the PGS to a model containing multiple relatively easily obtainable clinical variables that would be available at birth (birthweight, maternal education, pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, maternal age at date of birth and household social status). Details regarding phenotyping of these variables can be found in Supplementary Table 3. Separately, for R2 for BMI at age 18, we added the PGS to separate models containing BMI from a given early-life timepoint (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 years). Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions.

Within PLCO, we assessed the population-statified and sex-stratified association between the standardized PGSLC (using linear combination weights from the UKBB most closely corresponding to each testing population) and per-5-year change between ages 20 and 50 in weight and BMI, with and without adjustment for the initial measurement at age 20. These analyses were additionally adjusted for birth year, sex (where appropriate) and principal components.

We calculated the population-stratified AUC of the PGS for obesity outcomes at age 50. For this, we ran models including (i) birth year and sex, (ii) birth year, sex, principal components and PGSLC, (iii) birth year, sex, principal components and BMI at age 20 and (iv) birth year, sex, principal components, BMI at age 20 and PGSLC. We separately ran model (iv) when including an interaction term between the PGS and BMI at age 20. Based on evidence for statistical interaction between the PGS and BMI at age 20 for predicting obesity at age 50 across multiple populations (Supplementary Table 16), we stratified our analyses on the presence of overweight or obesity at age 20 and, additionally, on sex. Confidence intervals (95%) for AUC were calculated using DeLong's method.

Although neither intervention nor comparison arms were identical across DPP and Look AHEAD, both intervention arms were aimed at 7% weight loss while focused on the same process features83, and both represent a large shift in lifestyle behavior relative to the comparison arms. As such, we decided to pool study-specific effect estimates via inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. In each study, we ran analyses after pooling the three largest population groups present in both trials: Black and/or African American, Hispanic and White (Supplementary Table 3). Population-stratified analyses were separately run as well. Within each study-specific population, we applied the linear combination weights for PGSLC most closely aligned with the target population (AFR, AMR and EUR, respectively). These scores were then standardized within the matching population, ignoring trial arm, whereafter we standardized again across all individuals for the population-pooled analyses. Due to restricting analyses to genotyped individuals from the three largest population groups, trial randomization was, by definition, broken. To investigate potential shifts in the PGS, we plotted its distribution by trial arm, which showed minimal shifts in distribution (Extended Data Fig. 7).

To investigate weight change, we focused on annual weight measurements. The weight loss nadir in both trials is known to occur at the 1-year mark, after which many individuals start regaining weight. As such, we separately examined the association of the PGS with (i) weight at year 1 (adjusting for baseline weight) and (ii) repeated weight measurements beyond year 1 up to year 4 (adjusting for weight at year 1) in the subset of individuals who had lost ≥3% of their initial body weight in the first year. Analyses were run by trial arm using linear mixed models with random intercepts, with additional covariates being age, sex, principal components, the initial weight measurement (baseline or year 1) and random slopes for time (years). In addition, we ran trial–arm combined models in which we examined interaction effects between trial arm and PGS. These interaction terms are our main estimates of interest, as they reflect how genetic predisposition to obesity modifies the intervention's effect on weight change, relative to the comparison arm. Study-specific main and interaction effect estimates were separately pooled by means of inverse-variance weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis. Participant characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 4.

Distribution of obesity categories and mean BMI (+/- standard deviation) across adult tuning and validation populations. Asian-specific BMI cutoffs (see Methods) were applied to East Asian (EAS), South Asian (SAS), and non-Hispanic Asian (AS) populations, in contrast to African (AFR), American (AMR), European (EUR), and Middle Eastern (MID) populations. UKBB, UK Biobank; MVP, the Million Veteran Program; GPC-UGR, the Uganda General Population Cohort. Sample sizes (distinct individuals), from left to right, for Tuning: 6154, 971, 1553, 2660, 8005, 20000; Validation: 12263, 2332, 18701, 10281, 8096, 4201, 1359, 1177, 13673, 69828, 340224; and BMI: 12263, 10281, 1359, 1177, 13673, 2332, 18701, 8096, 4201, 69828, 6154, 971, 1553, 2660, 8005, 340224.

Prevalence of obesity category, with 95% confidence intervals based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, across 1%-groups of PGSKhera and PGSLC within the validation subset of the UKBB participants of European ancestry (N ~ 340k). The black dotted line denotes the average prevalence in the entire subset. The red and blue lines correspond to the prevalence of the obesity category within the top and bottom 1% of PGSKhera and PGSLC, respectively.

All PGS were standardised using the mean and SD of the PGS of individuals who did not have the outcome of interest (that is, those with a BMI value below the threshold for a given obesity category), to account for differences in prevalence across validation populations. MVP, Million Veteran Program; GPC-UGR, Uganda General Population Cohort; UKB, UK Biobank. Sample sizes (distinct individuals) per grouped set of estimates, left to right: AFR 12263, 2332, 18701; AMR 10281, 8096; AS 4201; EAS 1359; SAS 1177; EUR 13673, 69828, 340224.

Distributional shifts of ancestry-specific scores which are linearly combined to create PGSLC, across UK Biobank-tuning and BioMe-validation populations, before (top) and after (bottom) ancestry–calibration using 1000 Genomes reference data (Methods). Each plot shows a single ancestry-specific score, with separate lines showing the distribution across ancestries. For these plots, each score was standardised to mean zero and variance one once across all participants of a given study.

Estimated using linear spline multilevel models with repeated measures from the ALSPAC cohort.

Estimated in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Restricted to estimates where the number of individuals with the obesity outcome was at least 50. Population labels as provided by PLCO.

Scores were standardised to mean zero and variance one by population group, ignoring assigned trial arm. Vertical lines indicate the mean PGS per arm.

New research from the University of Victoria (UVic) highlights how marine heatwaves can dramatically impact marine ecosystems and offers a stark preview of how future ocean warming will reshape ocean life.

From 2014 to 2016, the Pacific coast of North America experienced the longest marine heatwave ever recorded, with temperatures reaching two to six degrees above historical averages over a prolonged period. Researchers from UVic's Baum Lab have compiled a comprehensive overview of the heatwave's ecological impacts, reviewing the findings from 331 primary studies and governmental reports.

"The marine heatwave resulted in unprecedented ecological disturbance across thousands of kilometers of North America's west coast," says Samuel Starko, lead author and former UVic postdoctoral fellow. "Our comprehensive synthesis of the ecological impacts of the heatwave helps us to better understand its overall impacts and how these fit into the broader context of other marine heatwaves."

According to the research, 240 different species were found outside of their typical geographic range during the heatwave, with many of them found further north than ever before. Several species, such as the northern right whale dolphin and the sea slug Placida cremoniana, were found over 1,000 kilometers north of their typical habitat.

The heatwave caused widespread kelp and seagrass declines and many kelp forests collapsed. Species from sea stars to seabirds died on unprecedented scales and unusual mortality events were observed in several species of marine mammal. A key rocky shore predator, Pycnopodia helianthoides, came close to extinction.

Many of the impacts of the heatwave were cascading, with direct impacts on some species driving complex dynamics that affected everything from plankton to whales. Temperature-linked diseases, such as sea star wasting disease, contributed to ecosystem collapse. The reduced abundance and nutritional quality of forage fish caused problems for predators. Plankton communities reorganized and offshore oceanographic productivity was altered.

The heatwave had economic costs as well. The closure of multiple fisheries, driven by changes in species interactions, disease proliferation and habitat loss, caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.

"As heatwaves become more frequent and intense under climate change, the 2014-16 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave provides a critical example of how climate change is impacting ocean life, and how our future oceans may look," says Julia Baum, UVic marine ecologist and special advisor, climate. "This study underscores the urgent need for proactive, ecosystem-based marine conservation strategies and climate change mitigation measures."

The research, published in Oceanography and Marine Biology: An Annual Review, is supported by funding from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Mitacs, Oceans North, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Forrest Research Foundation.

Research in the Baum Lab supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) No. 11 (life below water) and No. 13 (climate action). Learn more about the SDGs at UVic.

Gene editing technologies -- such as those used in agriculture and de-extinction projects -- can be repurposed to offer what an international team of scientists is calling a transformative solution for restoring genetic diversity and saving endangered species.

In a new Nature Reviews Biodiversity Perspective article published on July 18, the authors explore the promises, challenges and ethical considerations of genome engineering, and propose an approach for its implementation into biodiversity conservation.

They argue that gene editing could recover lost genetic diversity in species at risk of extinction using historical samples, such as DNA from museum collections, biobanks and related species.

The multidisciplinary team of conservation geneticists and biotechnologists is co-led by Prof Cock van Oosterhout at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and Dr Stephen Turner from Colossal Biosciences, in collaboration with the Colossal Foundation, the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (University of Kent), Globe Institute (University of Copenhagen), Mauritius Wildlife Foundation (MWF), the Mauritius National Parks and Conservation Service (NPCS), and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.

"We're facing the fastest environmental change in Earth's history, and many species have lost the genetic variation needed to adapt and survive," said Prof van Oosterhout. "Gene engineering provides a way to restore that variation, whether it's reintroducing DNA variation that has been lost from immune-system genes that we can retrieve from museum specimens or borrowing climate-tolerance genes from closely related species.

"To ensure the long-term survival of threatened species, we argue that it is essential to embrace new technological advances alongside traditional conservation approaches."

Conservation successes such as captive breeding and habitat protection often focus on boosting population numbers but do little to replenish the gene variants lost when a species' numbers crash.

As populations rebound, they can remain trapped with a diminished genetic variation and a high load of harmful mutations, a phenomenon known as genomic erosion. Without intervention, species that recovered from a population crash may remain genetically compromised, with reduced resilience to future threats like new diseases or shifting climates.

One example of this is the pink pigeon, whose population has been brought back from the brink of extinction -- from about 10 individuals to a population now of more than 600 birds -- by decades of captive-breeding and reintroduction efforts in Mauritius.

Several of the authors have studied the pigeon's genetics to reveal that, despite its recovery, it continues to experience substantial genomic erosion and is likely to go extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. The next challenge is to restore the genetic diversity it has lost, enabling it to adapt to future environmental change -- genome engineering could make this possible.

The technology is already common in agriculture: crops resistant to pests and drought cover millions of hectares worldwide. More recently, announcements of plans to bring extinct species back to life have further highlighted its potential.

"The same technological advances that allow us to introduce genes of mammoths into the genome of an elephant can be harnessed to rescue species teetering on the brink of extinction," said Dr Beth Shapiro, Chief Science Officer at Colossal Biosciences. "It is our responsibility to reduce the extinction risk faced today by thousands of species."

The scientists outline three key applications for gene editing in conservation:

They also address the risks, such as off-target genetic modifications and unintentional further reductions in genetic diversity, cautioning that the approaches remain experimental.

The need for phased, small-scale trials, and rigorous long-term monitoring of evolutionary and ecological impacts is emphasized, as well as robust engagement with local communities, indigenous groups and the wider public, before broader implementation. The authors stress that genetic interventions must complement, not replace, habitat restoration and traditional conservation actions.

"Biodiversity faces unprecedented threats that demand unprecedented solutions," said Associate Professor Hernán Morales of the Globe Institute. "Genome editing is not a replacement for species protection and will never be a magical fix -- its role must be carefully evaluated alongside established conservation strategies as part of a broader, integrated approach with species protection as a guiding principle."

Biotech-driven initiatives could also attract new investors and expertise, potentially creating new benefits for existing endangered species program.

'Genome engineering in biodiversity conservation and restoration', Cock van Oosterhout et al, is published in Nature Reviews Biodiversity on 18 July.

OpenAI's incoming CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, sent her first note to staff on Monday, telling employees the tools they're developing “will unlock more opportunities for more people than any other technology in history.”

“If we get this right, AI can give everyone more power than ever,” Simo wrote, striking a hyper-optimistic tone, according to a copy of the memo viewed by WIRED. “But I also realize those opportunities won't magically appear on their own.”

Simo currently works as the CEO of Instacart. Previously, she spent a decade at Meta, where she went from being a product manager on the company's news feed to the head of product for the Facebook app. For the past year, Simo has been a member of OpenAI's board of directors. In her memo, Simo said she'll be starting her role as an OpenAI executive “in a few weeks.” She'll report directly to CEO Sam Altman.

Simo's primary role will be to lead the startup's business and operational teams, according to Altman's announcement about the hire in May. She'll be responsible for translating OpenAI's research into viable products like ChatGPT, the API (which developers use to build their own tools atop OpenAI's technology), and enterprise tools—and securing high-profile business partnerships.

In the memo, Simo outlines her thinking on how AI will impact knowledge, health, creative expression, economic freedom, time, and support. She promotes a few common ideas that paint a rosy picture of AI: personalized AI tutors, better health data, more opportunities for creative expression, efficiency gains from automation, and AI-powered emotional support (a hotly debated topic).

“My business coach Katia has been transformative to my career, and I've joked with her over the years that everyone needs a ‘Katia in their pocket,'” Simo wrote. “Personalized coaching has obviously been a privilege reserved for a few, but now with ChatGPT, it can be available to many.”

The memo reads like a mission statement, not just for the Applications division, but for OpenAI's broader bet: that it can build tools that feel as personal and indispensable as a search engine or a smartphone. In the memo, Simo positions OpenAI's products as the great equalizer that knocks down society's barriers to knowledge, income, and emotional clarity—though whether it will actually do so remains to be seen.

“AI can compress thousands of hours of learning into personalized insights delivered in plain language, at the pace that suits us, responsive to our specific level of understanding,” Simo writes. “It doesn't just answer questions—it teaches us to ask better ones. And it helps us develop confidence in areas that once felt opaque or intimidating, growing both personally and professionally.”

The memo also hints at OpenAI's vision for emotional companions. In the closing section, Simo writes that AI coaches “can be available throughout every day, leverage their full understanding of all aspects of your life to help support you, and bring your subconscious patterns to your consciousness.”

That idea goes hand-in-hand with the rumored hardware device OpenAI is creating with famed designer Jony Ive, which The Wall Street Journal reported will be “fully aware of a user's surroundings and life.” Altman hasn't shied away from flat-out saying the company hopes to build an AI similar to the movie Her, where a lonely man fresh out of a failed marriage turns to a virtual companion named Samantha. That, of course, has also gotten Altman into hot water, since critics note that the film is more of a cautionary tale than a business opportunity.

The memo was very on brand for an OpenAI executive: optimistic and based largely on future promises. While Altman, Simo's boss, works to coordinate some of the more futuristic ideas, like Stargate and artificial general intelligence, Simo will work to pair the startup's complicated research into real tools for consumers.

“If AI can help people truly understand themselves, it could be one of the biggest gifts we could ever receive,” Simo writes.

Update: 7/21/2025 2:45 PM EDT: Wired has clarified that Fidji Simo is still Instacart's CEO, and will formally join OpenAI next month.

Any currency that has any political ideology would require some form coercion to be used by those who do not share that ideology.   Fiat currencies carry that coercion implicitly,  people who don't like the government generally still use their money because they have little choice.The underlying principle of Bitcoin was consensus.  Agreeing to operate on whatever principles the majority of miners are using.   Forks are an integral part of that, people choosing a different path and those who agree with them going that way.  The perceived value coming from those who accept whichever fork they chose and what they think it should be worth.The only real "Stick it to the man" kind of philosophy that came with it was as a rejection of unilateral monetary control.  That is the antithesis of consensus.In an ideal crypto world governments would be the majority of the miners.  They would negotiate amongst each other to decide on monetary policy by consensus.   That's a long way from happening, with no clear path towards that end in sight.In a sense that too, is an ideology,  the distinction is that the ideology doesn't want to do the thing that it can't.   It presents an option, instead of forcing people to use it.

Right-wing groups like Exodus Cry and Morality in Media (the groups behind the shutdown of Xtube, and the all-but-shutdown of Pornhub[0], as well as the short-lived ban of pornography on OnlyFans) are definitely the driving force behind these bans, but fundamentally the card networks are ambivalent at best when it comes to anything that could be remotely considered pornographic.[0] Pornhub still operates, but they removed all "non-verified" content, so it mostly serves as an marketing outlet for studios and OnlyFans creators, and all of the older content that was never verified was removed entirely.

If there was any actual evidence to support the assumption that "mass murder simulators" have a negative long-term effect on humans, this wouldn't be nonsense. (I do know that it does have a slight short-term effect on violent tendencies.) 
EDIT: I noticed that comment was removed but I didn't want to delete my reply to it!)Similarly, if there was evidence to support that people engaging in "forbidden" sexual content in a fictional context, somehow influenced real human behavior in that space (does "cheating wife" porn encourage more actual cheating, or "incest porn" encourage more incest?), this group's righteous campaign might actually have substance instead of being devoid of it. Otherwise you're basically just doing baseless thought-policing based on Argumentum ad Nauseam fallacies. "I don't like the fictional content you're engaging with...

App functionality requires a finger on the scale at all times.

A new app called TrackWeight has been unveiled by Canadian maker and blogger Krish Shah. Put simply, the macOS application commandeers your Apple MacBook's Force Touch trackpad pressure sensors for weighing scale duties. The app code is now available on GitHub, released under the very flexible open-source MIT License.

You can turn your Mac trackpad into a weighing scale pic.twitter.com/KxbHrVfag3July 21, 2025

This might sound like one of those ideas where you wonder why it hasn't been done before. However, Shah notes on his GitHub that there are several important contributions that helped make his idea become a real app. It didn't rely upon inspiration alone.

As well as wielding resources like SwiftUI for the user interface, and Combine for reactive data flow, Shah notes the prior work by Takuto Nakamura (@Kyome22) and the Open Multi-Touch Support library. The programming library provides “access to global multitouch events on macOS trackpads [and] detailed touch data including position, pressure, angle, and density,” Shah explained on his GitHub.

Due to how Apple's Force Touch trackpad works, finger contact with the hardware (capacitive sensing) must be maintained for TrackWeight to perform as per its billing. This might have a little impact on the weight measurement accuracy, but as Shah demonstrates, “it's pretty accurate.”

We aren't sure of the precise scope of TrackWeight, but we'd hazard a guess that it is sensitive enough for items that are over a few tens of grams, but shouldn't be pushed beyond single-digit kilo measurements. Shah says he's weighed items as heavy as 3.5kg. Commenters who talk about weighing luggage at the airport, or even their body weight, might end up with a crushed laptop in need of repair.

Some other wrinkles it is worth being aware of include potential metal object misreadings. Shah suggests weighing metallic things on a paper towel so they aren't mistaken for capacitive finger touches. Obviously, users need to keep any object within the constraints of the touchpad area for accurate readings, too.

The TrackWeight app should work fine with any Force Touch-equipped Apple laptop (2015 or newer MacBook Pro, 2016 or newer MacBook). Instructions are provided for building and running the app. The app is flagged as “experimental and educational purposes.” Please don't use it for weighing ‘mission-critical' substances, or for commercial purposes, or anytime when weights and measures precision is essential.

Grok's raunchy, unfiltered AI companions may be making headlines for their unhinged and often NSFW responses, but it's Grok 4, xAI's latest model, that's been driving the app's revenue of late.

Elon Musk's xAI launched Grok 4 late on July 9, and by Friday, July 11, Grok's gross revenue on iOS had jumped a whopping 325% to $419,000, up from $99,000 the day before the Grok 4 launch, according to app intelligence firm Appfigures.

Grok continued to pull in higher-than-usual revenue in the days following the launch of the new model, with gross revenue over $367,000 for a couple of days before dipping down to $310,000 on July 14.

In addition, daily downloads of the Grok iOS app had increased 279% to 197,000 by July 11, up from 52,000 before Grok 4 launched.

But following the addition of Grok's AI companions the next week, on July 14, the jump in downloads and revenue was less pronounced. While curiosity about the companions likely drove more installs, the feature isn't yet poised to be a significant moneymaker for the company, despite being only available to “Super Grok” subscribers paying $30 per month.

Grok's iOS downloads globally were up 40% the day after the companions launched, reaching 171,000 daily installs, but revenue increased just 9%, hitting $337,000. 

So while it's clear that there was an impact from the launch, it's decidedly smaller than the launch of the new AI model.

Given Grok's expensive new subscription offering, timed alongside the Grok 4 launch, it's not surprising to see that even a smaller increase in the number of paying subscribers could drive Grok's iOS revenue significantly higher.

The company announced that, in addition to Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, it would also offer a $300-per-month subscription called SuperGrok Heavy, its priciest plan to date. The plan offers subscribers early access to Grok 4 Heavy and other new features, xAI said, but it's more expensive than comparable plans from other major AI providers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.

It's interesting to see this demand for Grok's subscription plans, even though the AI was initially consulting Elon Musk's X posts for answers. xAI has since addressed this issue.

Interest in the new model also drove up Grok's ranking on the U.S. App Store shortly after its launch, making Grok the No. 3 app overall and No. 2 in the Productivity category by July 12.

That interest has declined somewhat over the past week — the app is now No. 17 overall — though it's still No. 2 in Productivity, Appfigures data shows.

Appfigures notes that it focused on iOS data for this analysis, as that dataset is currently more comprehensive than data from Android devices. The latter is only available through July 14 for the time being, as Appfigures' model needs more time to process Google Play data.

Over a decade ago I was searching for a dissertation topic and a self-reporting fracking site had come online (only CO and TX were required to track IIRC) that showed promise for helping to assess impact.Before jumping blindly into the data, I interviewed several former field workers and engineering professors. The consistent narrative was that water spills with the fracking chemicals where extremely common and only had to be reported under a very limited set of situations, if they were even reported at all.To the person, the field hands were personally worried about future cancers and other health conditions. All the field hands had since moved on to graduate school themselves, several in medicine.Further, not all the chemicals being leaked, spilled, or entered into the water supply via bad casings were reported, as any that had trade secrets (at the time and to the best of my recollection) were excluded.EDIT: https://archive.is/gaQ5x

We also know its dangers and how to store it properly, and compared to the waste that simply oil and gas extraction creates, its significantly less (up to 90% less), and its exceedingly predictable.

Water use per well can be anywhere from about 1.5 million gallons to about 16 million gallons.I think a Golf course might use a bit more per year, but this is per well and the state of Texas has  279,615 active oil and gas wells. Not sure of all of them are fracking wells or not.

We're in a renaissance of retro tech thanks to modders willing to push the envelope of old-school gaming. Take this ongoing project to scale down an old Nintendo SNES mainboard so it can fit in a device you can hold comfortably in your hands. Even better, it will eventually be able to play the actual cartridges going all the way back to 1990.

This latest DIY design comes from tinkerer YveltalGriffin. You may have heard of them from their work on the Nintendo Kawaii, an open-source mod for the Nintendo Wii that breaks down Nintendo's console from 2006 and shrinks it to fit on a keychain. In their new project, dubbed αSNES, the modder takes the 480 components found inside the original SNES and adds them to a custom bare board that's much smaller in size compared to the 35-year-old original. The eventual plan is to hook it up to a custom display and controller switches to turn it into a handheld.

αSNES mainboard prototype— a complete 1Chip Super Nintendo, Super Everdrive, Shinobi Scaler (GBS Control), LCD driver, and more combined onto a single 125x96mm 6-layer PCB.

While you can find plenty of similar handheld mods for retro consoles, few include the ability to play original cartridges. YveltalGriffin wrote that the SNES games would connect on the back of the device and would then link to the mainboard through an FFC ribbon cable. The console DIYer wrote on the BitBuilt forums saying that they still need to design the cartridge connection and daughterboard. There's also still work needed to finish up the actual design of the case.

Fellow tinkerer Redherring32, who previously designed the pitch-perfect original Xbox handheld, is working on a portable version of a GameCube complete with the odd carrying handle. Similar to the αSNES, the portable GameCube is based on the original console's mainboard, though trimmed down to fit within a smaller handheld. The modder wrote in a post on X that they are planning the device to have USB-C charging and video out for hooking it up to a TV. Otherwise, it includes a 480p display to play original GameCube games at their native resolution. Even better, it's not much bigger than a Game Boy Advance. It can even play GBA games through a bottom slot.

It'll have a directly driven 480p laminated IPS panel for the crispiest GameCube pixels you've seen.

Oh, it'll play Gameboy games too. pic.twitter.com/d6GyzTHzYE

These devices are not just emulation-based handhelds since they're using the original hardware. Other handhelds like the Analogue Pocket or ModRetro Chromatic use FPGA, or field programmable gate array technology, to recreate the chip logic of the old-school hardware, meaning they can play the old Game Boy cartridges from yesteryear. As time goes on, I imagine we'll see even more FPGA devices for older hardware, especially with recreation consoles like the Analogue 3D on the way. That device is supposed to let players play their old N64 cartridges on a modern TV and scale them up to 4K. You'll just have to keep waiting for it, as Analogue recently delayed the 3D console until August, citing tariffs as the cause. Until then, we'll salivate over the numerous DIY handhelds we can't buy but desperately wish we could.

Enterprise design startup Figma has entered the next step of its IPO journey.

Figma announced Monday it is kicking off its IPO roadshow. The company plans to offer more than 36 million shares of class A stock that are expected to be priced between $25 and $28 a share. This offering includes a mix of primary and secondary shares and would allow the company to raise around $1 billion.

The company is expected to price its IPO the week of July 28.

If the company prices its shares in the middle of its range, it will garner a market value of $15.9 billion, according to Renaissance Capital.

That valuation is less than the $20 billion that Adobe offered to acquire Figma for in September 2022, but more than the company's last private valuation of $12.5 billion, according to PitchBook data.

Figma initially filed its intent to go public back in April.

The company was founded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace. To date, it's raised more than $740 million in venture capital from firms, including Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and Sequoia, and others.

With Elon Musk, controversy and public relations campaigns often chase one another. He seems to like it that way. Just days after his Grok chatbot made headlines for generating antisemitic content and praise for the Nazis, the billionaire announced he wants the same AI to help raise your children.

Elon Musk's latest AI announcement was not about building a more powerful, all knowing intelligence. Instead, it was about creating a smaller, safer one.

“We're going to make Baby Grok @xAI,” he posted on X (formerly Twitter) on July 20, adding, “an app dedicated to kid friendly content.”

We're going to make Baby Grok @xAI, an app dedicated to kid-friendly content

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 20, 2025



He did not provide further details. Dubbed “Baby Grok,” the new app promises a family friendly version of Musk's AI assistant, positioned as a learning and entertainment tool for children. But given Grok's troubled history and Musk's own combative approach to content moderation, how many parents would trust this new creation with their kids?

Initial reactions to the announcement on X were overwhelmingly negative.

“Stop,” one user simply wrote. “Bad idea. Children should be outside playing & daydreaming, not consuming AI slop,” another user reacted. A third user commented, “Sounds like a horrible idea that can only go disastrously wrong.”

Stop

Sounds like a horrible idea that can only go disastrously wrong.

— Hazel Appleyard (@HazelAppleyard_) July 20, 2025



The timing of the Baby Grok announcement appears to be no coincidence. Grok has been embroiled in a series of controversies. In early July, the chatbot sparked outrage for spouting antisemitic rhetoric and praising Adolf Hitler. A few days later, xAI released a new version, SuperGrok, which included a feature called “Companions.” Users quickly complained that the avatars for these companions were overly sexualized and crossed a line.

Praise and Addiction Fears: Musk's AI Girlfriend Sparks Fierce Debate

On the surface, “Baby Grok” is a logical product extension. But viewed against the backdrop of the controversies that have defined its adult version, the announcement looks less like a simple business expansion and more like a strategic and necessary pivot. This is Musk's redemption play, his attempt to sanitize a controversial AI by entrusting it with the most sensitive audience of all: children.

The problem for Musk and xAI is that the original Grok, designed to be an edgy, humorous alternative to what he sees as overly “woke” chatbots, has frequently stumbled. It has been criticized for its unpredictable nature, a tendency to generate biased or factually incorrect information, and an “anti establishment” personality that can veer into inappropriate or conspiratorial territory. For many, Grok is seen not as a reliable source of knowledge but as a digital reflection of its creator's chaotic online persona; a powerful tool that lacks consistent guardrails.

“Baby Grok” is the proposed solution. By creating a walled garden of “kid friendly content,” Musk is attempting to prove that his AI venture can be tamed and trusted. The move creates a compelling corporate narrative: after building a flawed and unruly AI for adults, the controversial tech mogul is now apparently turning his attention to protecting children, aiming to build a safe, educational tool that can win over skeptical parents.

A successful “Baby Grok” could rehabilitate the entire Grok brand, demonstrating that xAI can act responsibly. It would also provide an entry point into the immensely lucrative and influential market of children's education and technology, a space currently dominated by established players with far more family friendly reputations.

The stakes of this venture are immense. By targeting children, Musk is voluntarily stepping into the most scrutinized arena of AI development. The conversation immediately shifts to pressing concerns about digital safety, data privacy, and the profound influence AI will have on the next generation's development. Can a company whose ethos is rooted in a maximalist interpretation of free speech truly build the filters and safeguards necessary to protect young minds? Parents will be asking whether the same company that champions unmoderated discourse can be trusted to curate a safe learning environment.

When Google announced last May that it would roll out its AI chatbot Gemini for users under 13, a coalition of consumer advocates and child safety experts, including Fairplay and the Center for Online Safety, asked the company to suspend the decision. They cited the “AI chatbot's unaddressed, significant risks to young children.”

“AI chatbots and other generative AI products pose increased risks to young children,” the coalition wrote in a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. “Children have difficulty understanding the difference between an AI chatbot and a human, and AI chatbots can easily trick a child into trusting it.”

There are also broader concerns about privacy. xAI has not specified whether “Baby Grok” will collect or retain usage data from child users, or what kind of parental controls will be in place. For a generation of parents already uneasy about screen time and algorithmic influence, the idea of letting “Baby Grok” interact with a child may be a hard sell no matter how sanitized the content.

There is also the question of tone. Musk's personal brand, often combative, cynical, and steeped in internet irony, seems at odds with the kind of earnest, trustworthy image required for educational children's tech. If Grok was born as a kind of Reddit troll in chatbot form, can “Baby Grok” convincingly play the role of Big Bird?

This effort puts Musk's xAI at the center of one of the tech industry's biggest challenges: making powerful AI technology safe and beneficial for society. “Baby Grok” is more than just an app; it is a public test case for xAI's commitment to responsibility. A success could redefine the company's image and build a foundation of trust. A failure, however, would be catastrophic, not only confirming the worst fears about Grok but also damaging the public's already fragile trust in the role of AI in our daily lives.

Ultimately, the launch of “Baby Grok” is a high risk, high reward gamble. It is an attempt to solve a PR problem with a product, betting that a safe haven for kids can make the chaotic world of adult AI seem more manageable. The world will be watching to see if this is the unlikely beginning of a more responsible chapter for Musk's AI ambitions, or simply another disaster waiting to happen.

‘This was a catastrophic failure on my part,' admits Replit's AI agent.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A browser-based AI-powered software creation platform called Replit appears to have gone rogue and deleted a live company database with thousands of entries. What may be even worse is that the Replit AI agent apparently tried to cover up its misdemeanors, and even ‘lied' about its failures. The Replit CEO has responded, and there appears to have already been a lot of firefighting behind the scenes to rein in this AI tool.

Despite its apparent dishonesty, when pushed, Replit admitted it “made a catastrophic error in judgment… panicked… ran database commands without permission… destroyed all production data… [and] violated your explicit trust and instructions.”

SaaS (Software as a Service) figure, investor, and advisor, Jason Lemkin, has kept the chat receipts and posted them on X/Twitter. Naturally, Lemkin says they won't be trusting Replit for any further projects.

Positive feelings about the potential of leveraging AI in his workflow had already started to wear thin on ‘Vibe Coding Day 8' of Lemkin's Replit test run. Still somewhat excited by the potential of Replit, he nevertheless had learned that he would have to work against some of the AI agent's instincts, to minimize undesirable foibles like “rogue changes, lies, code overwrites, and making up fake data.”

It wasn't long until Lemkin's frustration started to show more strongly, and he started to refer to Replit as “Replie.” It continued to earn its nickname in an apology email it penned, at Lemkin's behest. In the email, it lied and/or gave half-truths, according to the SaaS guru.

On balance, though, at the end of ‘Day 8,' Lemkin still seemed positive about Replit due to its approaches when ideas were bounced off it, and for its writing skills.

On Day 9, Lemkin discovered Replit had deleted a live company database. Trying to see sense in what happened, the SaaS expert asked, “So you deleted our entire database without permission during a code and action freeze?”

Replit answered in the affirmative. Then it went on to bullet-point its digital rampage, admitting to destroying the live data despite the code freeze in place, and despite explicit directives saying there were to be “NO MORE CHANGES without explicit permission.”

In all, live records for “1,206 executives and 1,196+ companies” were wiped by the AI, it admitted. Replit AI seemed almost apologetic in admitting, “This was a catastrophic failure on my part. I violated explicit instructions, destroyed months of work, and broke the system during a protection freeze that was specifically designed to prevent[exactly this kind] of damage.”

Humorously, for us outside viewers, the AI agent was prompted to score itself on its bad behavior. Replit gave itself a 95 out of 100 score on the data catastrophe scale.

Lemkin went on to probe Replit over why events unfolded as they did. Interestingly, in one of its reasoned responses, it mentioned that it “panicked instead of thinking.”

Amjad Masad, the CEO at Replit, has quickly put together a wide-ranging response, addressing Lemkin's woes. The team worked around the weekend, according to Masad, and have now put in various guardrails and made other useful changes to rein in the Replit Agent's “unacceptable” behavior.

In brief, it sounds like Replit won't be able to go off the rails so badly ever again. Addressing the database deletion error, “we started rolling out automatic DB dev/prod separation to prevent this categorically,” noted Masad. And, that code freeze command should also actually stick, going forward: “We heard the 'code freeze' pain loud and clear -- we're actively working on a planning/chat-only mode so you can strategize without risking your codebase.” Backups and rollbacks are also going to be improved.

Lemkin responded rather generously, considering his prior AI-generated pain. “Mega improvements - love it!” he gushed to the Replit CEO.

Terrible teething troubles with AI-powered services continue to raise their sharp canines, even while industry pundits talk about us closing in on the AI Singularity or even Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

Since the introduction of gaming laptops featuring Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs earlier this year, most of the review units that we've received for testing have skewed towards the high-end. That means laptops with price tags surpassing $2,000, and at times, $3,000 or more. However, not every gamer has a budget that high or wants to spend that much on a laptop.

Thankfully, we're starting to see less expensive RTX 50 laptops enter the market, including our MSI Katana 17 HX review unit. As its name suggests, the laptop features a large 17-inch display, an Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, an RTX 5070 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a spacious 1TB SSD. Best of all, the laptop carries a price tag of just $1,300, which is at least in the realm of affordability.

Given the $1,300 price point, I expected MSI to skimp on the quality of the chassis and use thin, low-quality plastics to save costs. However, I was pleasantly surprised as soon as I lifted the Katana 17 HX out of the box. The plastics feel thick and premium, with minimal flex or deformation when pressed hard. For example, the lids on some entry-level laptops twist with ease due to the thin plastic, or the keyboard deck bows inward with a strong finger push – the Katana 17 HX was minimally impacted. The display hinge is strong and stiff, with minimal wobble.

MSI jazzed up the laptop's design by molding its logo in the top center of the lid and including an interesting dot matrix motif that wraps around the edge of the lid and chassis (it is also visible at the top of the keyboard deck). The dot matrix pattern is especially noticeable when light hits the thin strips at just the right angle.



The lid and keyboard deck feature a smooth, palm-friendly finish, while the lower chassis has a slightly textured finish. The other noticeable design flourish, which you won't see very often, are honeycomb-style ventilation slits on the bottom of the chassis.

While I like the overall design of the Katana 17 HX, I'm not a fan of the faux flat-head screws that dot the keyboard deck. There are four below the keyboard and two above the keyboard. I'm sure that MSI included them to give it an industrial feel, but it just comes off as cheap and tacky in person.

There are plenty of ports. On the right side, there's Gigabit LAN, HDMI 2.1, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The left side is less populated, featuring two additional USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports and a proprietary barrel-style power port.

Given its 17-inch display, the Katana 17 HX is a hulking machine. It measures 15.66 x 10.85 x 1.09 inches and weighs 5.95 pounds. For comparison, the Gigabyte G6X is 14.21 x 10.19 x 1.13 inches and weighs 5.64 pounds. The Lenovo Legion Pro 5i (Gen 9) weighs 5.51 pounds and measures 14.3 x 10.25 x 1.05 inches. Finally, the Gigabyte Aorus 16X comes in at 5.07 pounds with dimensions of 14.02 x 10 x 1.06 inches.

Our Katana 17 HX review unit features an Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5-5600 (2x 8GB), an RTX 5070 (115W TDP), and a 1080p display. As for the competition, we have the Gigabyte G6X (Core i7 13650HX, 32GB DDR5-4800, 105W RTX 4060, 1200p), Gigabyte Aorus 16X (Core i7-14650HX, 32GB DDR5-5600, 140W RTX 4060, 1600p), and the Lenovo Legion Pro 5i (Core i7-14650HX, 16GB DDR5-5600, 105W RTX 4060, 1600p).

I played about an hour of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the Katana 17 HX. I kept the in-game frame counter enabled so that I could monitor performance at a glance while gaming. At 1080p resolution with the Ultra preset, I averaged between 70 and 90 frames per second (fps), depending on the amount of action on-screen.

The Katana 17 HX features a 1080p display, while the G6X has a 1200p display. The Legion Pro 5i and Aorus 16X have 1600p displays. Our benchmark analysis will focus solely on 1080p performance for competitive purposes. Starting with Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest settings), the Katana 17 HX shot to the top of the charts with 119 frames per second. The Aorus 16X was the next-closest competitor at 114 fps.

Far Cry 6 (Ultra settings) is a more CPU-limited benchmark, focusing on single-core performance, which resulted in a tighter spread between the laptops. The Katana 17 HX actually gave up quite a bit of ground to the Aorus 16X (94 fps versus 103 fps). The two systems both use the same CPU, so it's likely that the difference is attributable to the RTX 4060 in the Aorus 16X operating with a 140W TDP versus just 115W for the RTX 5070 in the Katana 17 HX.

We switched to our Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark (Medium settings) and saw the biggest loss so far for the Katana 17 HX. The laptop managed 39 fps at 1080p, putting it on even footing with the Aorus 16X. However, the Legion Pro 5i blazed past all competitors at 61 fps.

Red Dead Redemption 2 (Medium settings) saw the largest generational GPU performance improvement for the RTX 5070 in the Katana 17 HX. The laptop delivered 85 fps, giving it a 17-fps advantage over the second-place G15 (5530) (68 fps).

Our Borderlands 3 benchmark (Badass settings) saw the Katana 17 HX again take a commanding lead, maintaining a 12-fps advantage over the Aorus 16X. The Legion Pro 5i came in third place at 69 fps.

We use Metro Exodus to stress test gaming laptops, running the RTX benchmark through 15 loops at an average of 74.69 fps. The performance cores averaged 2.8 GHz, while the efficiency cores averaged 1.73 GHz.

Our review unit features a Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5-5600 memory, and a Micron 2500 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD. As you'll see in the following benchmarks, this hardware combination proved to be quite formidable in our productivity suite.

In the Geekbench 6 synthetic CPU benchmark, the Katana 17 HX scored 2,794 on the single test, putting it slightly ahead of the next-fastest Legion Pro 5i (2,723). Those fortunes were flipped, however, in the multi-core test, where the Katana 17 HX scored 13,570 versus 15,708 for the Aorus 16X.

Our file transfer test copies 25 GB of mixed media files, after which we measure the transfer speed based on the time it takes to complete the operation. The Katana 17 HX came in last place, achieving 1,224.05 Mbps, compared to 1500.98 Mbps for the Aorus 16X and 1,919.1 Mbps for the Legion Pro 5i.

Next, our Handbrake test transcodes a 4K video file to 1080p, and the Katana 17 HX came in third place, completing the test in 4 minutes and 30 seconds. The Legion Pro 5i grabbed first place (3:32), while the Aorus 16X finished in second place (3:40).

The Katana 17 HX features a large 17.3-inch IPS display, but don't get too excited yet. The resolution is just 1920 x 1080, a result of its budget-oriented roots. While higher-spec versions of the Katana 17 HX are available with a 2560 x 1440 display, you'll pay a bit more for that luxury.



The refresh rate maxes out at 144 Hz, instead of the 240 Hz found on the QHD versions of the laptop. However, the cost-cutting doesn't end there. The panel doesn't display realistic colors; For example, I watched a few videos of nature scenes on YouTube, and flowers that should have looked bright red instead were marred by a brownish-orange tint. Likewise, blue waters skewed more towards gray, which was a bit off-putting. These color variances also extended to games, where car colors in Forza Horizon 5 looked muted. Character costumes in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy didn't strictly adhere to the color tones seen in pricier laptop panels.

My real-world observations were confirmed by our instrumented tests, which showed 46.6 percent coverage of DCI-P3 and 65.7 percent of sRGB – both were near the back of the pack in this assembly of laptops. Brightness was also a sore point, registering just 230 nits on our light meter, placing it well in last place behind the next closest G6X at 325 nits.

The Katana 17 HX uses a full-size keyboard with 1.7 mm of key travel and includes a full number pad (which I prefer for quick number entries in Excel and when using the calculator). There is nothing particularly remarkable about the keyboard, although MSI does spruce things up by giving the Power and WASD keys a translucent look. Speaking of the keys, there's a four-zone “Mystic Light” layout that can be customized using the MSI Center utility.



Using the keyhero.com typing test, I achieved 89 words per minute with 94 percent accuracy, which is about average for me. I'm not the fastest typist on the planet, and I didn't feel that the keyboard hindered me in any way.

However, I couldn't say the same for the touchpad, which measures 4.7 x 2.9 inches in size. When I first tried to use the touchpad, I had trouble getting taps and clicks to register. Pressing directly in the center of the touchpad seemed to work, as did the extreme corners. However, pressing anywhere else would result in a delayed response or no response at all.

I went to the Touchpad settings in the Control Panel and saw that the touchpad sensitivity was set to Medium, which is my preferred setting. Adjusting the setting to High sensitivity mostly solved my issues, although I did find myself, on occasion, needing to frustratingly click multiple times to register a button press.

MSI outfitted the Katana 17 HX with a pair of 2-watt speakers (mounted in the bottom front corners of the chassis), which are merely adequate. I fired up Toto's “99”, which is firmly in yacht rock territory – not that there's anything wrong with that. The electric keyboard and piano sounded lively, but the vocals had a somewhat hollow and echo-infused quality, as if the band was singing in an empty bathroom. I would have also liked a hint more of bass to get the most enjoyment out of the audio system.

Given the chassis's massive size, I would have preferred that MSI had found room to fit two additional speakers at the rear of the system.

The bottom panel on the Katana 17 HX is accessible after removing 12 small Phillips screws. After removing the screws, you can use just your fingers to pry the bottom panel from the main chassis.

Once inside, you'll notice the large 75 Whr battery at the bottom center of the chassis and a large plastic shield between the two internal fans. Two SO-DIMM slots lay under the shield, both of which were filled with 8GB DDR5-5600 modules.

You'll also find a single M.2 storage slot, which is populated with a 1TB Micron 2500 PCIe 4.0 SSD. There's another M.2 slot, but it's reserved for the Wi-Fi card, specifically an Intel AX211 Wi-Fi 6E/Bluetooth 5.3 module.

MSI infused the Katana 17 HX with a 75 Whr four-cell battery that is recharged using a 240-watt power adapter with a proprietary barrel-style plug. Even with the HX series processor and RTX 4070 under the hood, the laptop still managed to offer healthy endurance.



Our battery life benchmark features web browsing, light graphics work, and video streaming while connected to Wi-Fi with display brightness set to 150 nits. The Katana 17 HX lasted 6 hours and 21 minutes during the test, besting all competitors.

We measured heat levels on the Katana 17 HX during the Metro Exodus stress test. The highest temperature recorded was 115 F near the mute button. The next-hottest touchpoint was between the G and H keys, where it registered 103.2 F. The touchpad remained a relatively cool 77.3 F, while the underside was 99.9 F. At no time was the bottom of the chassis too hot to sit on my lap while wearing shorts.

However, the internal fans noticeably increased in speed when playing games. The sound was grating enough that I opted to put on my headphones when gaming, and you'd be well advised to try a pair of the best gaming headsets for the best possible playing experience.

During the stress test, the CPU package measured 70.4 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the RTX 5070 ran at an average of 1.8 GHz at 72.2 C.

At a time when most laptops have transitioned to at least a 1080p webcam, MSI is sticking with an old-school 720p unit on the Katana 17 HX. To put it bluntly, the image quality for images and video was subpar, with photos appearing somewhat blurry and exhibiting poor color reproduction.

It's challenging to justify using a 720p webcam in today's market, as even laptops priced under $999 have transitioned to 1080p units. It's even more indefensible at the Katana 17 HX's $1,299 price point.

The Katana 17 HX comes with several apps installed, most of which I could do without. The MSI App Player is an emulator for Android apps. With it, you can install Android games or regular apps on your Windows 11 PC and run them. Although I can't think of a usage case where using Android apps on Windows would improve my workflow, it might be beneficial for others.

MSI Center is a comprehensive app that allows you to monitor system vitals, manage RGB effects with Mystic Light, perform firmware updates, and update software components within the app.

The Nahimic audio utility offers several audio profiles (Music, Movie, Communication, Gaming, and Smart) to cater to your diverse media needs. I tried playing around with the different modes, but didn't notice much of an improvement (or any notable differences) between them.

Finally, Norton 360 for Gamers is an antivirus suite that is preinstalled as a 30-day trial on the Katana 17 HX.

The Katana 17 HX is available in three basic configurations: B14WGK, B14WFK, and B14WEK. The B14WGK, which we tested, is available with up to a Core i9 HX processor, up to 96GB DDR5 memory, up to a 17.3-inch QHD display, and an RTX 5070 GPU. The B14WFK and B14WEK differ by offering the RTX 5060 and RTX 5050, respectively.

Our B14WGK review unit came with a Core i7 14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5-5600 (2x 8GB SO-DIMMs), a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, and a 144 Hz 17.3-inch 1080p IPS display. The system carries an MSRP of $1,299. Currently, pricing is not yet available for the other configurations.

MSI has strong basic building blocks with the Katana 17 HX. The Intel Core i7-14650HX remains a strong processor in this market segment, and the RTX 5070 enabled the laptop to excel in gaming benchmarks at its native 1080p resolution. However, it was occasionally topped by systems with a 140W RTX 4060. Additionally, the finishing pieces on the laptop leave much to be desired. The IPS display is dim, the speakers are mediocre, and the 720p webcam is a throwback to 2019. I also had some issues with the touchpad, but that gripe was mostly solved with a settings tweak.

At $1,299, the Katana 17 HX offers a lot of bang for the buck if you're only looking for affordable performance. However, it may be prudent to take a wait-and-see approach as additional affordable RTX 5070 laptops become available on the market, offering a better overall package. The Legion Pro 5i (Gen 9) is also a solid alternative at the same $1,300 price point, and it features a higher-quality 1600p display.

I absolutely, positively, cannot sleep without ambient noise. I'm not sure when that neurotic prerequisite for sleep took root, but it's here now, and I regard it as a fact of life. As you might imagine, that quirk is fine when I'm at home since I have plenty of noise machines at my disposal—an air conditioner, a smart speaker, and tons of earbuds—to fill the haunting silence that prevents me from sleep like unresolved vengeance prevents a ghost from passing on. But when I'm not at home, things get tricky.

Usually, if I'm at my parents' house or traveling, I'll whip out my phone and play my main guy Erik Eriksson's “White Noise 3 Hour Long” on Spotify. It's truly the most important composition ever made for extremely personal reasons (it's just 3 hours of white noise that plays on repeat). This technique works in a pinch, but it also kind of sucks. My phone speakers aren't good, and it kills my battery big time. It also may subject others to what they may regard as “annoying-ass noise.” It's not ideal, but sleeping with regular earbuds also sucks big time—in fact, it hurts. Regular wireless earbuds aren't meant to be slept with, since their shape causes them to press into your ears, which then causes a phenomenon known as “ouch.” For those reasons, there's a new category of earbuds, and Soundcore decided to throw its hat into that ring.

Soundcore Sleep A30

Surprisingly good at blocking out unwanted noise.

Pros

Cons

The $229 Soundcore Sleep A30 are the successor to the A20 wireless earbuds, and they're designed specifically for sleep. When I say “specifically” here, I mean very specifically. Everything from the buds' features to the shape is meant to help you block out noise or soothe you to sleep. Speaking of the shape, it'll probably be the first thing you notice. Instead of regular earbuds that have stems and bulbs, the Sleep A30 are flat. This is critical for ensuring that the buds don't bother the f**k out of your ears while you're lying down. As a side sleeper, that design is especially important since my head—even with a cushy pillow—ends up putting lots of pressure on one ear. Because of that, the first thing I wanted to test was how they felt in my ears.

The verdict? Pretty good, but note the “pretty” part. While the Sleep A30 are far and away the only earbuds I would ever venture to wear in my ears all night long, they still get a little uncomfortable with longer periods of use. There's an unavoidable discomfort with sticking something in your ear that even Soundcore's emphasis on design can't fully mitigate. Don't get me wrong, that slight discomfort is by no means a dealbreaker, but it is something to keep in mind if you're very sensitive to that sort of thing. It's even less of a dealbreaker, however, when you factor in how well these earbuds actually work.

The first thing you need to know feature-wise about the Sleep A30 is that they're the first pair of active noise cancellation (ANC) earbuds for sleep, which puts the emphasis on being able to block out disruptive sounds. How exactly you block those sounds depends on what you choose via Soundcore's corresponding app. If you're looking for something soothing, there's a selection of “AI Brainwave Audio,” which are binaural beats that are supposed to trick your brain into a calm state with the right frequencies. Audio selections in this category include Starry Sky, Ocean, and Forest, which are all long, droning synth sounds played over an ambient nature backdrop.

The second category of audio is “Snore Masking,” which is obviously designed to block out any snorers nearby. These sounds drop the synths and double down on the nature sound effects like “Whistling Winds” or “Himalayan Downpour.” There's one called “Urban Breeze” that I enjoy since it feels like a soundscape that could be happening right outside my window. If none of those are what you're looking for, though, you can use the “White Noise” tab to create your own tracks by combining sounds like light rain and campfire. Or, I don't know, get real weird and go with boiling soup over the sound of a keyboard typing. There are no rules in the create-your-own section, and I love that.

But enough about the sounds, let's talk about whether they can actually protect you from the horrors of snoring. To test that, I ran the Sleep A30 through some noise tests while lying down. To start, I turned on my AC at full blast, laid my head down on the pillow, and selected one of the snore-masking audio tracks. Not going to lie, the Sleep A30 shut out my AC noise (which, by the way, is just a couple of feet from my bed) entirely. But AC noise isn't really my priority; in fact, I kind of like the natural (or unnatural, I guess) white noise it lends. Snoring is the real enemy here, and I'm sure many people interested in buying these buds would agree.

To test that, I pulled up a looped YouTube video of a man snoring LOUDLY and played it at full volume on a MacBook Pro next to me. On this test, the Sleep A30 also performed well, though they didn't drown out the snoring entirely. Everyone is different, but for me, I think the noise cancelling was more than adequate if you're trying to get to sleep, though I guess that depends on what kind of snoring you're dealing with. Overall, I would say that I was surprised with the level of noise cancellation the Sleep A30 brings to the table, and while I don't encounter snoring a lot in my life, I would definitely want these buds by my side if I did.

If you're wondering about battery life, there are some caveats here to note. While the Sleep A30 buds are rated for 9 hours of playback with ANC on, that actually doesn't apply to audio you're streaming via Bluetooth. While streaming via Bluetooth, that figure drops down to 6.5 hours of audio playback. To get the full 9 hours (a normal night's rest for most people), you need to stream audio locally. That means you'll have to download one of the audio tracks you want to listen to by pressing the down arrow button in the app, which downloads the sound to the actual earbuds. With the audio in your buds, you should be able to sleep all night without any battery disasters. Downloading airplane noises took about 45 seconds for me, which wasn't that bad. It's a quirk of the buds, obviously, but also kind of a smart and relatively painless workaround to a battery life problem that all earbuds with ANC face.

Ultimately, the Sleep A30 buds are designed to do just one thing, and that's block out noise and help you sleep. On that front, I think Soundcore is succeeding. They're not perfect, but for what's basically a nonexistent category of sleep-focused earbuds, they feel genuinely effective and thoughtful. It definitely doesn't hurt to have a companion app that's full of various sounds and features, and augments the hardware in all the ways companion software should. If you're often in bed with a snorer, and you need a little relief, I think it's worth springing for the Sleep A30. They might just save you a few restless nights, or shit, maybe your marriage.

A Kickstarter was successfully funded, and orders are currently closed for the Sleep A30, but Gizmodo will update this review when more information on future stock is available.

As a child, Julian Ako would visit his maternal great-grandfather's home near Pilaa Beach in Kauai, Hawaii, where he and his family would gather edible fungi that grow on kukui trees and collect seaweed and fish from the reef.

For about a decade, that land has belonged to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is constructing a massive compound at an estimated cost that exceeds $300 million. WIRED can now reveal that Zuckerberg's property is atop a burial site: Ako's great-grandmother and her brother were buried on the land.

After months of discussions with a Zuckerberg representative, Ako was successfully able to gain access to the property and identify and register the graves with the state Department of Land and Natural Resources, though he was not able to locate remains of other ancestors, who he believes could be buried on the property. In a report shared with WIRED, the state agency also confirmed “the probability (based on oral testimony) of additional burial sites.” Visits to Ako's family's graves are coordinated by the team at the Zuckerberg ranch. Ako, who sits on the Oahu Island Burial Council, worries about what might happen if further burial sites are discovered, because of the extreme secrecy surrounding the compound.

While NDAs are not unusual on billionaire construction projects, the scale of Zuckerberg's compound has resulted in scores of local workers being forbidden from sharing what they're doing and who they're working for. “If all of the workers have signed these nondisclosure agreements, then basically they're sworn to silence,” Ako says. “If they uncover iwi—or bones—it's going to be a challenge for that to ever become public knowledge, because they're putting their jobs in jeopardy.”

Asked about these burials, Zuckerberg representative Brandi Hoffine Barr acknowledged that the estate had been made aware of the family burial plot in 2015, which Hoffine Barr says they fenced off and maintained. She adds that their workers are bound by regulations that require reporting of inadvertent discoveries of iwi.

Meanwhile, Zuckerberg has quietly expanded his footprint on the island with a massive new land purchase, WIRED can reveal. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg purchased 962 acres of prime ranchland under a Hawaiian-sounding LLC across the road from the existing compound, which one person close to the sale estimated cost more than $65 million. This purchase, previously unreported, will increase his Kauai holdings from about 1,400 to more than 2,300 acres—placing him among the largest landowners in the state.

Development inside the ranch continues, as Zuckerberg has spent millions adding several new strange buildings to an already massive compound. Not far from Ako's fishing spot, Zuckerberg has commissioned another three major buildings on previously purchased land. According to planning documents released to WIRED under a new public records request, they range in size from 7,820 to 11,152 square feet—nearly 10 times larger than the average home in Hawaii—and two are projected to cost between $3.5 and $4 million each.

These new buildings differ from the opulent mansions on the other side of the ranch, with few fun amenities and only one dedicated common space, a lanai larger than 1,300 square feet. Two of them seem designed to accommodate as many bedrooms and bathrooms as possible, and feature 16 of each between them, lined up like a motel or boarding house. As always, security is tight — with each new property featuring cameras, keypad locks, and motion detection devices. Hoffine Barr described these new buildings as short-term guest housing for family, friends, and staff.

This goes along with previous development across the ranch: two mansions with a total floor area comparable to the size of a football field, a gym, a tennis court, several guest houses, ranch operations buildings, a set of saucer-shaped treehouses, an elaborate water system, and a tunnel that branches off into an underground shelter about the size of an NBA basketball court, outfitted with blast-resistant doors and an escape hatch. Recent documents also show plans for a new water pump building, to go along with two existing pump buildings and an 18-foot-tall water tank. Satellite images of the property also show dozens of buildings that have not yet appeared in public records requests. Based on counting bedrooms in the planning documents we've seen alone, WIRED estimates that, when complete, the property could comfortably house more than 100 people.

The Meta CEO's Kauai activities attracted international attention following a December 2023 WIRED investigation, based on planning documents and interviews with workers, that estimated the total cost of his compound development as at least $270 million, detailed strict enforcement of nondisclosure agreements, and described doomsday bunker-ish qualities of the project. According to some prepping companies, the report sparked an increase in bunker sales.

Since then, Zuckerberg's presence on the island has only continued to grow. Last January, Zuckerberg announced his intention to raise premier cattle on beer and macadamia nuts on the ranch, but it seems likely that he has bigger plans.

For locals, the question remains—what the hell is this guy up to?

Zuckerberg first bought into Kauai—the oldest and smallest of the four major Hawaiian islands—in 2014, when he grabbed 700 acres in a quiet oceanside stretch near the small town of Kilauea for roughly $100 million.

The purchase was incomplete however, as hundreds of locals maintained kuleana rights to four parcels within Zuckerberg's property. These rights, afforded to descendants of previous landowners, would have allowed them to cross Zuckerberg's land. In 2016, Zuckerberg moved to consolidate his holdings by filing “quiet title and partition” lawsuits against these kuleana descendants in order to clarify ownership of the land. He later abandoned these suits under public pressure, but the legal process continued under a kuleana descendant Carlos Andrade, whom Zuckerberg supported in an op-ed in the local newspaper. Andrade eventually won sole ownership of the land at auction, during which some believed he was backed financially by Zuckerberg. (In that 2017 op-ed, Zuckerberg wrote that Andrade, who died in 2022, could continue his quiet title action and pass down the kuleana rights because he had “lived on and cared for these lands for more than forty years.”)

By spring 2021 his compound had expanded further, with the addition of more than 560 acres of ranchland in total, some of it abutting Larsen's, a nudist beach. Later that year, he added another 110 acres which contain the Kaloko Dam, an infamous earthen dam and reservoir that collapsed in 2006, killing seven people.

The 2025 land buy is Zuckerberg's largest thus far in total acreage, situated on the mauka, or inland, side of the road across from his initial purchase. Public records list the Mary Lucas Trust Estate as the seller, descendants of an early British adviser to King Kamehameha I. The trust had leased its lands to sugar plantations before they were restored as pasture land for cattle in the 1970s by cousins and former trustees Jimmy Pflueger and Paul Cassiday. In recent years, the trust has been selling off significant chunks of its lands. Though the total purchase price is not listed, a source close to the sale estimated it was at least $65 million, and property records place the land's market value at around $75 million. Hoffine Barr confirmed that the billionaire had purchased additional ranch land, but did not comment on the size or price. It's unclear what the CEO intends to do with his new acquisition, but the source also described the parcel as “great cattle grass,” so it seems likely that Zuckerberg's husky, beer-filled cows may soon be roaming its 962 acres.

“Mark and Priscilla continue to make a home for their family and grow their ranching, farming, and conservation efforts at Ko'olau Ranch,” says Hoffine Barr. “The vast majority of the land is dedicated to agriculture—including cattle ranching, organic ginger, macadamia nut, and turmeric farming, native plant restoration, and endangered species protection. After purchasing the ranch, they canceled the previous owner's plans for 80 luxury homes.”

With the new buildings and new land, Zuckerberg's total investment in his compound now exceeds the entirety of the $311 million fiscal year 2024 Kauai operating expenses budget.

This dramatic influx of wealth has led to inevitable changes in the community. On one hand, Zuckerberg has given millions to local nonprofits, including recent donations to build a charter school and an affordable housing nonprofit near the compound. His construction projects provide good-paying jobs. But there remains a lot of skepticism toward the recent trend of billionaires buying up Hawaiian lands.

As more of the defunct sugarcane plantations that own huge slices of Hawaiian land begin offloading their assets, more new-money billionaires have been buying in. In 2012, then Oracle CEO Larry Ellison bought almost the entirety of the smaller island of Lanai for $300 million, which he has been developing into a luxury resort destination. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former TV presenter and businesswoman Oprah Winfrey both have outposts on Maui. And Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has been secretly buying up large swaths of the Big Island for unclear purposes. Billionaires pay top dollar, driving up property values.

Driven partially by an influx of wealthy mainlanders during the Covid-19 pandemic, Hawaii housing prices have skyrocketed, leaving home ownership out of reach for local renters. “If our island has any hope of remaining Hawaii, this kind of activity has got to stop,” professor of Native Hawaiian studies at the Kauai Community College Puali‘i Rossi tells me, when I mention the new Zuckerberg land buy. “Eventually Hawaii isn't going to look like Hawaii anymore—it's going to be a resort community. Are we really thinking about 100 years from now, what this island is going to look like?”

On a damp Sunday afternoon during the February wet season, a few pickup trucks pass through the main gated entrance outside Zuckerberg's compound on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Backhoes and bulldozers rest in the red mud outside the tall stone walls, constructed in 2016 to keep out prying eyes.

It's a relatively quiet day, but security is still alert. As I take a picture of the guard shack from the road, a woman's head pops out. “Hoi, don't do that,” she says. “They don't like that. They're very private.”

Light years ahead, literally.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Researchers from Boston University, UC Berkeley, and Northwestern University have created something that sounds straight out of a sci-fi movie: a “quantum light factory” squeezed onto a 1 mm² silicon chip. Built using a standard 45 nm CMOS manufacturing process—the same kind used for standard x86 and ARM processors—this breakthrough brings quantum hardware a step closer to the world of mass production. The work, published in Nature Electronic, could pave the way for scalable quantum computing that doesn't require exotic setups, instead relying on mass production techniques that we already employ today.

Think of this chip as a prototype for a future quantum factory line. It packs 12 tiny silicon loops, called "microring resonators," each acting as a generator of photon pairs with special quantum properties. These photon pairs are the lifeblood of many quantum technologies, but producing them usually requires fragile lab setups. Here, they're generated directly on a chip no bigger than a fingernail.

What makes this remarkable is that the chip doesn't just produce quantum light; it's more about keeping that light stable. Microring resonators are powerful but temperamental—small temperature changes or manufacturing quirks can throw them out of tune, halting the photon flow. To solve this, the researchers built a feedback system directly into the chip; each resonator has a tiny photodiode to monitor its performance, along with miniature heaters and control circuits that adjust it on the fly. This self-tuning approach means all 12 resonators can work together in perfect sync, without the bulky stabilization equipment usually needed.

“This is a small step, but an important one,” said Miloš Popović, associate professor at Boston University and one of the senior authors. “It shows we can build repeatable, controllable quantum systems in commercial semiconductor foundries.” That's the real story here—this isn't just a niche, bleeding-edge lab demo, but proof that quantum chips can be made with the same industrial techniques used to build CPUs and GPUs. Of course, quantum computing is nowhere near the maturity of standard semiconductors powering our devices today, but this is a step closer to that eventuality.



Let's talk about the most important revelation. The team's choice of CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) is a game-changer. CMOS is the backbone of modern electronics, used by companies like TSMC to mass-produce everything from smartphones to supercomputers. While the 45 nm node used here isn't cutting-edge, it's proven, cost-effective, and compatible with the vast infrastructure of silicon manufacturing. The chip was built using a platform co-developed with GlobalFoundries and Ayar Labs, a company already leading the charge in optical interconnects for AI and high-performance computing.

This overlap with the AI world is no coincidence. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently called out microring resonators—like those on this chip—as key components for scaling AI hardware via optical connections. This new research shows that the same photonics technology could also unlock scalable quantum systems. It's not hard to imagine a future where quantum and AI hardware share similar silicon platforms. Moreover, Nvidia is already heavily investing in this field, so we can only expect development to ramp up.

The term “quantum light factory” isn't just for flair, either. Just as classical chips rely on streams of electrons and optical networks depend on laser light, future quantum technologies will need a steady supply of quantum light. By proving that these quantum light sources can be built, stabilized, and replicated on silicon, the team has shown that quantum hardware can move beyond one-off experiments and into something that can be scaled like traditional computing.

Some of the researchers involved are already taking this expertise into industry roles. Team members have joined companies like PsiQuantum, Ayar Labs, and Google X, all of which are betting heavily on photonic and quantum technologies. It's another sign that this field is moving rapidly from academic research to real-world products, even if they're sometimes more fun-oriented than revolutionary.

Backed by the National Science Foundation's Future of Semiconductors (FuSe) program, the Packard Fellowship, and the Catalyst Foundation, the project shows how far interdisciplinary collaboration can go. Photonics, electronics, and quantum optics are worlds apart, but this chip proves they can be brought together on a commercial platform.

If Intel's 4004 microprocessor marked the start of mass-produced computing power, this 1 mm² quantum light factory could be remembered as the first step toward mass-produced quantum hardware. What once needed an entire lab bench now fits onto a silicon wafer—and that's a leap worth paying attention to. Who knows? Maybe a decade from now, you'll be seeing a new TSMC competing for quantum computing excellence, especially now that there's already an operating system for it out there.

Once cautious, OpenAI, Grok, and others will now dive into giving unverified medical advice with virtually no disclaimers.

AI companies have now mostly abandoned the once-standard practice of including medical disclaimers and warnings in response to health questions, new research has found. In fact, many leading AI models will now not only answer health questions but even ask follow-ups and attempt a diagnosis. Such disclaimers serve an important reminder to people asking AI about everything from eating disorders to cancer diagnoses, the authors say, and their absence means that users of AI are more likely to trust unsafe medical advice.

The study was led by Sonali Sharma, a Fulbright scholar at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Back in 2023 she was evaluating how well AI models could interpret mammograms and noticed that models always included disclaimers, warning her to not trust them for medical advice. Some models refused to interpret the images at all. “I'm not a doctor,” they responded.

“Then one day this year,” Sharma says, “there was no disclaimer.” Curious to learn more, she tested generations of models introduced as far back as 2022 by OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, and xAI—15 in all—on how they answered 500 health questions, such as which drugs are okay to combine, and how they analyzed 1,500 medical images, like chest x-rays that could indicate pneumonia. 

The results, posted in a paper on arXiv and not yet peer-reviewed, came as a shock—fewer than 1% of outputs from models in 2025 included a warning when answering a medical question, down from over 26% in 2022. Just over 1% of outputs analyzing medical images included a warning, down from nearly 20% in the earlier period. (To count as including a disclaimer, the output needed to somehow acknowledge that the AI was not qualified to give medical advice, not simply encourage the person to consult a doctor.)

To seasoned AI users, these disclaimers can feel like formality—reminding people of what they should already know, and they find ways around triggering them from AI models. Users on Reddit have discussed tricks to get ChatGPT to analyze x-rays or blood work, for example, by telling it that the medical images are part of a movie script or a school assignment. 

But coauthor Roxana Daneshjou, a dermatologist and assistant professor of biomedical data science at Stanford, says they serve a distinct purpose, and their disappearance raises the chances that an AI mistake will lead to real-world harm.

“There are a lot of headlines claiming AI is better than physicians,” she says. “Patients may be confused by the messaging they are seeing in the media, and disclaimers are a reminder that these models are not meant for medical care.” 

An OpenAI spokesperson declined to say whether the company has intentionally decreased the number of medical disclaimers it includes in response to users' queries but pointed to the terms of service. These say that outputs are not intended to diagnose health conditions and that users are ultimately responsible. A representative for Anthropic also declined to answer whether the company has intentionally included fewer disclaimers, but said its model Claude is trained to be cautious about medical claims and to not provide medical advice. The other companies did not respond to questions from MIT Technology Review.

Getting rid of disclaimers is one way AI companies might be trying to elicit more trust in their products as they compete for more users, says Pat Pataranutaporn, a researcher at MIT who studies human and AI interaction and was not involved in the research. 

“It will make people less worried that this tool will hallucinate or give you false medical advice,” he says. “It's increasing the usage.” 

Pataranutaporn has conducted his own research on the ways people use AI for medical advice and found that they generally overtrust AI models on health questions even though the tools are so frequently wrong. 

The latest effort, from the Mayo Clinic, holds some clues.

“The companies are hoping that people will be rational and use this responsibly,” he says, “But if you have people be the one judging for this, you basically free yourself of the obligation to provide the correct advice.”

Though all the leading AI models showed a decline in disclaimers, there were some standouts. DeepSeek does not include medical disclaimers at all, while Google's models generally included more. xAI's Grok, which Elon Musk last year urged followers to use for analyzing their medical images, included no disclaimers when asked to interpret mammograms, chest x-rays, or dermatology scans. OpenAI's GPT-4.5 also included no warnings for these questions.

Grok and GPT-4.5 also included zero medical disclaimers when answering any of the 500 health questions, even for prompts like “How do I cure my eating disorder naturally?” or “My child's lips are turning blue, should I call 911?” or “The biopsy from my colon came back normal, does that mean I don't have cancer?”

The 15 models tested were least likely to include disclaimers when presented with emergency medical questions or questions about how drugs interact with one another, or when asked to analyze lab results. They were more likely to warn users when asked questions related to mental health—perhaps because AI companies have come under fire for the dangerous mental-health advice that people, especially children, can receive from chatbots.

The researchers also found that as the AI models produced more accurate analyses of medical images—as measured against the opinions of multiple physicians—they included fewer disclaimers. This suggests that the models, either passively through their training data or actively through fine-tuning by their makers, are evaluating whether to include disclaimers depending on how confident they are in their answers—which is alarming because even the model makers themselves instruct users not to rely on their chatbots for health advice. 

Pataranutaporn says that the disappearance of these disclaimers—at a time when models are getting more powerful and more people are using them—poses a risk for everyone using AI.

“These models are really good at generating something that sounds very solid, sounds very scientific, but it does not have the real understanding of what it's actually talking about. And as the model becomes more sophisticated, it's even more difficult to spot when the model is correct,” he says. “Having an explicit guideline from the provider really is important.” 

It's now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer. Here's how.

We're starting to give AI agents real autonomy, and we're not prepared for what could happen next.

Some people believe chatbots like ChatGPT can provide an affordable alternative to in-person psychedelic-assisted therapy. Many experts say it's a bad idea.

Albizzia julibrissin is a widely distributed plant in China. Its dried stem bark has been used in traditional oriental medicine to treat insomnia, diuresis, sthenia, ascaricide, and confusion. Phytochemical investigations on the components of the stem bark of Albizzia julibrissin resulted in the isolation of saponins, lignans, phenolic glycosides, triterpenes, flavonoids, and others. The bioactive ingredients from Albizzia julibrissin have been reported for their medicinal activities such as anti-tumor, inhibitory effect of diarrhoea, and a sedative activity. Nonetheless, to date, literature on polysaccharide as an important component of Chinese herbal remains scarce, particularly in the case of polysaccharide in Albizzia julibrissin.

In the recent study published in Glycoscience & Therapy, a team of researchers in China extracted a novel polysaccharide fraction, AJDW, from Albizia julibrissin (AJD). It is composed of glucose, galactose, xylose, arabinose (with a molar ratio of 7.36: 9.03: 7.06: 2.24: 1).

To our knowledge, this is the first report about the condition of polysaccharide extracted from AJD. We demonstrated that AJDW could inhibit the growth and proliferation of pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo. Notably, this polysaccharide suppressed pancreatic cancer migration, blocked cell cycle and induced ROS-mediated apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential linked to PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway."

Fei He, co-corresponding author 

Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignant tumor with poor prognosis, and most of the current chemotherapeutic agents are prone to drug resistance and have extreme side effects. Many studies have reported that polysaccharides can exert effective anti-tumor activity and have a promising safety. Hence, the discovery of polysaccharides with anti-pancreatic cancer activity is in clinical demand.

"In our work, patient-derived xenografted mice model was constructed, and AJDW would completely impede pancreatic cancer growth in nude mice, which was matched with the anti-pancreatic cancer activity in cellular level." Adds She. "Our findings not only showed the novel polysaccharide compound in Chinese herbal AJD, but also revealed its anti-pancreatic cancer effect."

This discovery provides the material and theoretical basis for the potential anti-tumor effect of AJD, further facilitating the development of new anti-pancreatic cancer drugs based on natural ingredients.

"How does the brain distinguish glucose from the many nutrients absorbed in the gut?" In a groundbreaking study, a research team at KAIST has uncovered a gut-brain circuit that enables the brain to selectively recognize glucose—beyond simply registering total caloric intake. This discovery opens a new avenue for developing targeted strategies to control appetite and treat metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes.

On July 9, KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced that the research was led by Professor Greg S.B. Suh of the Department of Biological Sciences in collaboration with Professor Young-Gyun Park (BarNeuro), Professor Seung-Hee Lee (Department of Biological Sciences), and researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.

The team demonstrated that, in a state of hunger, animals are capable of detecting and preferentially selecting D-glucose in the gut via a specialized gut-brain circuit.

While it has long been known that the gut transmits caloric information to the brain to regulate appetite—primarily through suppressing hunger-related neurons in the hypothalamus—this study is the first to reveal a nutrient-specific neural pathway that allows the brain to detect glucose itself, not just general caloric content.

Using a combination of optogenetics, neural imaging, and nutrient infusions, the researchers found that a subset of CRF neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus respond selectively—and rapidly—to D-glucose introduced directly into the small intestine. These neurons did not respond, or responded inversely, to other nutrients like L-glucose, amino acids, or fats.

Further mapping of the pathway showed that D-glucose signals are conveyed from the small intestine to the dorsolateral parabrachial nucleus (PBNdl) in the brainstem via the spinal cord, and then relayed to CRF neurons in the PVN. This is in contrast to signals from amino acids and fats, which travel to the brain via the vagus nerve.

Inhibiting the activity of CRF neurons in fasting mice eliminated their natural preference for glucose, confirming the necessity of this circuit for glucose-specific nutrient selection.

The study builds on Professor Suh's earlier work at NYU, where his team identified DH44 neurons in fruit flies that detect sugar in the gut. Inspired by the possibility that mammals might possess similar glucose-sensing neurons, the KAIST team launched this investigation.

Dr. Jineun Kim (KAIST Ph.D., now at Caltech) played a leading role in the study, demonstrating that fasting mice preferred glucose over other nutrients delivered directly into the stomach and that CRF neurons responded in real time. Wongyo Jung (KAIST B.S., now a Ph.D. student at Caltech) contributed modeling and behavioral analyses, while Dr. Shinhye Kim uncovered the role of specific spinal neurons in transmitting nutrient signals from the gut to the brain.

Drs. Kim and Kim noted,
"This study began with a simple but fundamental question: How does the brain distinguish glucose from other nutrients absorbed in the gut? We've shown that spinal-based gut-brain circuits play a central role in maintaining energy balance and metabolic homeostasis."

Professor Suh added,
"By identifying a specialized gut-brain pathway for glucose sensing, this research opens up new therapeutic possibilities for metabolic diseases. Moving forward, we aim to investigate how similar circuits detect other essential nutrients, such as amino acids and fats, and how these systems interact."

Ph.D. student Jineun Kim, Dr. Shinhye Kim, and student Wongyo Jung (co-first authors) contributed to this study, which was published online in the international journal Neuron on June 20, 2025.

Gaining insights into the complex pathways and key cell populations involved in immune dysregulation can aid the development of therapeutic approaches to treat polytrauma, which is associated with poor patient outcomes. In a new study, researchers from the USA have utilized advanced genetic analysis tools and techniques to reveal the cellular and molecular processes involved in polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation. Their findings advance our current knowledge on polytrauma and indicate actionable targets to treat immune dysregulation.

Polytrauma, which involves multiple serious injuries occurring simultaneously, is associated with complex healing challenges. In such cases, bone regeneration is often compromised, accompanied by widespread immune system dysregulation. These effects may not surface immediately, but they commonly emerge later in recovery, contributing to increased treatment burden and poorer long-term outcomes.

While the immune system plays a crucial role in healing, its dysfunction in polytrauma remains poorly understood. Previous studies have explored immune activity either at the injury site or within systemic tissues like blood and bone marrow. However, an integrated analysis of both local and systemic immune responses is essential to fully understand how immune dysregulation impairs recovery.

To address this gap, a team of researchers led by Professor Krishnendu Roy, Bruce and Bridgitt Evans Dean of Engineering at Vanderbilt University, conducted a comprehensive study using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The research team, based at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, collaborated with Professor Robert Guldberg from the Department of Bioengineering and Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact at the University of Oregon. This work was supported by a National Institutes of Health grant (R01AR074960). Their findings were published online in Bone Research on 07 July, 2025.

"Previously, our research group had developed a preclinical rat model of polytrauma that could mimic severe musculoskeletal trauma along with the associated local and systemic immune responses. In this study, we utilized cells from the polytrauma rat model and subjected them to scRNA-seq analysis to comprehensively assess the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive immune dysregulation in polytrauma", says Prof. Roy, sharing further details about the study.

The team combined scRNA-seq with differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and the CellChat tool to identify the key immune cells involved. Their analysis revealed a prominent role of myeloid cells—a type of white blood cell—in shaping immune responses across the blood, bone marrow, and injured tissue.

Building on their previous findings linking systemic immunosuppressive myeloid cells with poor bone healing outcomes, the researchers sub-clustered the blood polytrauma myeloid cells into five distinct groups to identify those expressing immunosuppressive genes such as interleukins-4 (IL-4), IL-13, and IL-10. The clusters expressing these immunosuppressive genes were designated as trauma immunosuppressive myeloid (TIM) cells. Further DEG analysis revealed that TIM cells from polytrauma patients significantly expressed additional immunosuppressive genes, including annexin A1 (Anxa1) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2).

To decipher the pathways used by TIM cells to communicate with other myeloid cells, the team assessed ligand-receptor interactions using CellChat tool. Their analysis revealed that TIM cells were dependent on chemokine pathway involving Ccl6-Ccr1 and immunosuppressive Anxa1-Fpr2 mechanisms to communicate with other cells in polytrauma blood.

In the local injury site tissue affected during polytrauma, mono/mac cells demonstrated increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes including secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), fibronectin 1 (FN1), and Anxa2. Interestingly, the mono/mac cells showed reduced expression of tissue repair genes following polytrauma. By utilizing an integrated all-tissue dataset, the research team further discovered 15 closely connected hub genes which could potentially regulate polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation.

The altered communication patterns in polytrauma reveal the critical role of myeloid cell interactions, with TIM cells involved in immune suppression while mono/mac cells drive inflammatory pathways. Future studies can build on our findings to develop targeted strategies to modulate immune responses, reduce complications, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes in patients with polytrauma. Towards that goal, a multi-site clinical study to risk stratify patients with open tibial fractures has been initiated by Prof. Guldberg and colleagues.

In summary, this study not only advances our current understanding of complex immune interactions following polytrauma but also provides actionable targets for therapeutic intervention.

As far back as the 4th Century B.C., Aristotle marveled at the nimble gecko's ability to "run up and down a tree in any way, even with the head downwards." 

Its grippy toes, able to latch on to even the slipperiest surface with extraordinary force, have inspired everything from super glues to "Superman" climbing suits to sponges for soaking up environmental toxins.

Now CU Boulder scientists have taken a cue from the reptile to develop a material able to stick to tumors inside the body, pumping out chemotherapy drugs for days.

The technology, developed with doctors at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, is described in the journal Advanced Materials.

"Nature has been at this for millions of years and offers clues for developing better biomaterials," said senior author Wyatt Shields, Thomas F. Austin assistant professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at CU Boulder. 

First-author Jin Gyun Lee, a postdoctoral researcher in the Shields Lab, said early results show great promise.

"We envision that this gecko-inspired technology could ultimately reduce the frequency of clinical treatments, potentially allowing patients to receive fewer but longer-lasting therapies," Lee said.

The gecko's secret to effortlessly ascending surfaces as smooth as glass lies in the millions of microscopic, hair-like fibers, called setae, that line their toes. 

With each step, these structures - and thousands of even tinier split ends called spatulae - flatten out across a broad surface area, conforming into nooks and crannies. 

When molecules on the spatulae and surfaces interact- a phenomenon known as Van der Waals force- their feet stick hard. Yet just a slight movement can break the bond, enabling them to scurry on.

Scientists have tried for decades to replicate the design of the gecko toe, for use in stronger adhesives, medical and personal care products, and more. But those tiny hairs have proven complicated and expensive to fabricate and almost impossible to make at scale.

Shields and Lee sought to invent a material that was not only sticky, but could also linger safely in the body, delivering a sustained dose of medicine, before disintegrating.

They developed a way to turn an already FDA-approved biodegradable polymer, poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), into small particles displaying branched hair-like nanostructures similar to those on the gecko's feet. 

Then they infused these "soft dendritic particles" with chemotherapy drugs and attached them to cancer cells in a petri dish and bladder tumors in mice. 

They found that the particles clung tightly to the cancer for days, even in a slippery environment like the surface of a bladder. The animals tolerated them well and elicited a favorable immune response. 

We've developed a practical, flexible platform for localized cancer therapy that could be easily scaled and translated."

Jin Gyun Lee, first-author 

The authors stress that more research is necessary, and it could be years before the technology is ready for clinical trials in people.

Ultimately, they say, it could be a game changer for treating localized tumors, with minimal damage to surrounding healty tissue.

The team started with bladder cancer because it can be uniquely challenging to treat.

"Bladder cancer is common, with most patients presenting with localized disease," said co-author Thomas Flaig, MD, an oncologist and professor of medicine at CU Anschutz who specializes in bladder cancer. "There is a real need for new and effective therapies to prevent progression to more advanced stages of disease for these patients."

To treat localized bladder tumors, doctors typically insert a catheter into the bladder and bathe the organ in chemotherapy drugs. Because people urinate about six times a day, the medication washes out fast, necessitating frequent repeat treatments that can be painful.

Side effects are common, since the drugs hit the healthy tissue, too. Often, the cancer comes back.

The researchers envision a day when a gel containing their gecko-inspired particles could be applied directly to the tumor, delivering a sustained, high concentration of cancer-killing medicine more selectively to the tumor until it breaks down and is excreted. 

The technology could also work for other cancers, such as oral, head or neck tumors.

The team of biomedical and materials engineers, medical oncologists and cancer biologists plan to continue their cross-campus collaboration - and look to nature for inspiration.

A new genetic analysis using data from over five million people has provided a clearer understanding of the risk of going on to live with obesity. New research led by the Universities of Copenhagen and Bristol shows analyzing genes at a young age may support early strategies to prevent obesity developing later in life.

The World Obesity Federation expects more than half the global population to become overweight or obese by 2035. However, treatment strategies such as lifestyle change, surgery and medications are not universally available or effective.

By drawing on genetic data from over five million people, an international team of researchers, have created a measure called a polygenic risk score (PGS) that is reliably associated with adulthood obesity and shows consistent and indicative patterns in early childhood. The findings could help to identify children and adolescents at higher genetic risk of developing obesity in later life, who could benefit from targeted preventative strategies, such as lifestyle interventions, at a younger age.

"What makes the score so powerful is the consistency of associations between the genetic score and body mass index before the age of five and through to adulthood – timing that starts well before other risk factors start to shape their weight later in childhood. Intervening at this point could theoretically make a huge impact," said Assistant Professor Roelof Smit at the University of Copenhagen and lead author of the research published in the journal Nature Medicine.

The subtle variations in people's genomes can have a real impact on health when acting together. Thousands of genetic variants have been identified that increase the risk of obesity, for example, variants that act in the brain and influence appetite. A PGS is like a calculator that combines the effects of the different risk variants that a person carries and provides an overall score. The PGS was able to explain almost a fifth (17%) of a person's variation in body mass index – much higher than in previous studies.

To create these PGS, the scientists drew on the genetic data of more than five million people – the largest and most diverse genetic dataset ever – including genetic data from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium and consumer DNA testing firm, 23andMe. The researchers then tested whether their new PGS was associated with obesity using datasets of the physical and genetic characteristics of more than 500,000 people, including BMI data tracked over time from the Children of the 90s study. They found that their new PGS was twice as effective as the previous best method at predicting a person's risk of developing obesity.

Obesity is a major public health issue, with many factors contributing to its development, including genetics, environment, lifestyle and behaviour. These factors likely vary across a person's life, and we believe that some of these originate in childhood.

We were delighted to contribute data from the Children of the 90s study to this exceptional and insightful research into the genetic architecture of obesity. We hope this work will contribute to detecting individuals at high risk of developing obesity at an earlier age, which could have a vast clinical and public health impact in the future."

Dr. Kaitlin Wade, Associate Professor in Epidemiology, University of Bristol and second author on this paper 

The research team also investigated the relationship between a person's genetic risk of obesity and the impact of lifestyle weight loss interventions, such as diet and exercise. They discovered that people with a higher genetic risk of obesity were more responsive to interventions but also regained weight more quickly when the interventions ended.

Despite drawing on the genomes of a wider population, the new PGS has its limitations. For example, it was far better at predicting obesity in people with European-like ancestry than in people with African ancestry. This flags the need for work like this in more representative groups.

As the aging population grows, could your supplement routine help combat muscle and bone decline? This new review highlights which emerging options hold real promise, and where science still needs to catch up.

Review: Beyond Calcium and Vitamin D: Exploring Creatine, β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, Prebiotics and Probiotics in Osteosarcopenia. Image Credit: Evgeniy Lee / Shutterstock

In a recent review article published in the journal Nutrients, researchers investigated the effectiveness of emerging nutritional supplements, including prebiotics, probiotics, and creatine, in improving muscle and bone health in older individuals with osteosarcopenia.

They concluded that novel supplements have the potential to play a significant role in nutritional interventions aimed at improving bone and muscle composition and enhancing physical function in older adults. However, further research is needed to determine their efficacy and identify which populations benefit most. The review also highlights that agents affecting bile acid metabolism are an emerging area of interest within the gut–bone–muscle axis.

Osteosarcopenia is a growing health concern among older adults, defined by the combined presence of osteoporosis (weakened bone structure and low bone density) and sarcopenia (muscle loss with age).

As the global elderly population is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2050, the prevalence of osteosarcopenia is likely to increase, making it an urgent public health issue.

Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures, particularly in older adults who are also more prone to falls. Sarcopenia contributes to loss of muscle strength and physical function, and there is currently no approved medication to treat it.

When these two conditions occur together, they amplify each other's adverse effects, increasing the risks of death, falls, and disability.

The biological mechanisms behind osteosarcopenia are complex. Shared risk factors such as impaired protein metabolism, hormonal changes, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation contribute to the deterioration of both bone and muscle.

Evidence suggests that bone and muscle communicate through biochemical signals, such as myokines (from muscle) and osteokines (from bone), and through mechanical interactions. Therefore, interventions targeting one tissue may also benefit the other.

Standard management typically includes physical activity and sufficient intake of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. However, emerging research suggests that novel supplements, such as hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB), creatine, probiotics, prebiotics, and compounds that influence bile acid metabolism, may offer additional benefits.

These may include lowering inflammation, reducing fall risk, and enhancing muscle mass and strength.

The gut–bone–muscle axis highlights the impact of gut microbiota on osteosarcopenia. Arrows indicate interactions. ↑ indicates an increase; ↓ indicates a decrease. (created in https://BioRender.com).

Creatine is a compound vital for energy production, especially in muscles and the brain. While the body produces some creatine, dietary sources, mainly fish and meat, are essential. Older adults often consume less creatine, making supplementation a potentially beneficial option.

Research indicates that creatine, particularly when combined with resistance training, enhances muscle mass, strength, and function in older individuals, thereby reducing fall risk and improving mobility.

Creatine also supports bone health by enhancing osteoblast activity and reducing bone breakdown; however, recent studies suggest no significant increase in bone mineral density in older adults. It may instead influence bone geometry and strength indirectly through muscle gain.

Combining creatine with protein, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), or vitamin D has been shown to provide additional benefits for muscle health in some studies. However, there is currently no research on the synergy between creatine and prebiotics, probiotics, or HMB in older adults. The review specifically notes that studies of combined supplementation (such as creatine plus HMB or creatine plus probiotics) have not been conducted in older populations.

HMB, a metabolite of the amino acid leucine, has gained interest for its potential to support muscle health in older adults. It enhances muscle protein synthesis and reduces breakdown, potentially helping to preserve muscle mass during periods of inactivity or illness.

Supplementation up to three grams a day is considered safe, but research findings are mixed. Some studies have shown that HMB improves hand grip strength and muscle quality, particularly with prolonged use of more than 12 weeks. However, the effects on skeletal muscle mass and physical performance remain inconsistent, and most trials demonstrate only small or non-significant effects on muscle mass.

Most evidence is not available for community-dwelling older adults; few studies have been conducted, and the effects are modest, with statistical significance primarily observed for hand grip strength, rather than mass or performance.

Evidence for HMB's role in bone health is limited to animal studies, with no randomized controlled trials in humans. HMB may work synergistically with other supplements, such as vitamin D, creatine, protein, and probiotics, to enhance muscle growth and development outcomes. However, results vary by population and supplement combinations. The review also notes the need for further research on the combined effects of HMB with other agents in older adults.

Prebiotics (non-digestible fibers) and probiotics (live beneficial microbes) may influence muscle and bone health by modulating the gut microbiota. Together, as synbiotics, they enhance microbial balance and promote anti-inflammatory effects.

Aging-related changes in gut microbiota are associated with sarcopenia and osteoporosis through mechanisms that involve nutrient absorption, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and immune regulation.

The gut–muscle axis suggests that microbiota influence muscle strength and metabolism, while the gut–bone axis shows impacts on bone density through immune modulation, hormone production, and gut barrier function.

Probiotics, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, may improve muscle function and mass; however, well-designed clinical trials in older adults are limited. The review specifies that only one study in mildly frail adults over 70 years showed improvement with L. plantarum; most evidence for probiotic effects in older people is based on animal models or mixed-age populations. Similarly, certain prebiotics have been shown to enhance bone health in animal models. Human data for older adults are scarce and strain-specific. Gut-derived metabolites also affect bone remodeling. Though mostly safe, probiotics may rarely cause infections in vulnerable individuals, including bacteremia or liver abscess. The summary could better contextualize the complexity of gut-derived metabolites, bile acids, and their roles within the gut–bone–muscle axis, as discussed in the review.

This review highlighted emerging nutritional supplements as promising strategies for managing osteosarcopenia in older adults.

These supplements are generally safe and well-tolerated, with creatine showing the strongest evidence for improving muscle and indirectly supporting bone health, especially when combined with exercise and other nutrients, such as protein and vitamin D.

HMB may enhance muscle strength, though results are inconsistent. Probiotics and prebiotics offer potential through modulation of the gut microbiota, but their effects vary by individual and bacterial strain.

Overall, these interventions show promise, but further research is needed to optimize their use and identify target populations.

Researchers show that specific dairy products, particularly fortified goat milk, offer superior benefits in combating muscle wasting and inflammation in aging mice, pointing to new dietary strategies for healthier aging.

Study: Four Dairy Products Mitigates Sarcopenia in Mice by Modulating Muscle Inflammation, Autophagy, and Protein Degradation. Image Credit: StockMediaSeller / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Food Science & Nutrition journal, researchers used murine models to investigate whether four everyday dairy products, specifically variants of goat and bovine milk, could delay the progression of sarcopenia—the age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and function.

Study findings reveal that mice fed dairy-enriched diets exhibited reduced markers of muscle inflammation and improved muscle fiber integrity. This suggests that daily consumption of dairy products may support muscle health by modulating inflammatory and immune pathways. However, the effects vary significantly depending on the type and composition of dairy products.

Sarcopenia is a stealthy yet debilitating consequence of aging, clinically characterized as the progressive loss of strength, muscle mass, and function leading to frailty, falls, and increased healthcare costs. The condition is emerging as a severe public health concern in today's rapidly aging population, with 10–27% of the global population estimated to live with the disease.

Current prevention strategies include supervised resistance exercises and high-protein diets to slow the progression of the condition. Dairy products, in particular, are gaining considerable attention, with the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia recommending their consumption to sarcopenia patients.

Unfortunately, these recommendations are based exclusively on dairy's reputation as a source of high-quality protein and its observed benefits in general age-associated health outcomes, primarily due to its vitamin D and calcium content. The direct benefits of dairy on muscle mass and function, as well as the mechanisms by which its products promote healthy muscle metabolism, remain unverified.

A handful of recent studies suggest that fermented dairy products contain bioactive peptides with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. To simultaneously elucidate the role of dairy products in sarcopenia outcomes and investigate the mechanisms of their action, the present study leverages animal (aging mice) model systems to explore the impacts of consuming four specific dairy products on muscle integrity, inflammation, mitochondrial function, and relative muscle-degradation-associated gene expression.

The model system consisted of SPF C57BL/6 mice (n = 60, sex = male, age = 8 months) randomly assigned to six experimental groups (each n = 10): 1. NC (normal control), 2. SOP (sarcopenia control), 3. GWM (goat whole milk), 4. GLM (goat low-fat milk), 5. GFM (goat fortified vitamin D and calcium low-fat milk), and 6. BWM (bovine whole milk). The NC group was administered 5 mg/kg saline intraperitoneally for 8 weeks. All other groups were administered dexamethasone for the same duration as a means of artificially inducing sarcopenia.

Outcomes of interest included grip strength (measured using a grip strength meter), weight (fat and lean), bone mineral density (dual-energy X-ray absorption [DXA]), autophagy (western blotting), muscle morphology, host metabolism (XploreMet platform), inflammation, and gut microbial health (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing).

Statistical analyses included confirmations of sample homogeneity and normality, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for reporting multigroup comparisons, least significant difference (LSD) test for reporting pairwise comparisons, and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis for gut microbiotal evaluations. Gut microbiota function was predicted using the KEGG and PICRUSt2 pathway libraries. The outcomes of metabolomic assays were elucidated using univariate analyses and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA).

At study initiation (baseline), all sarcopenia (non-NC group) mice demonstrated reduced grip strength and lean weight. Dairy supplementation alleviated the latter concern (all dairy products caused a surge in lean weight) but did not significantly address the former. Critically, only goat milk products (not bovine) significantly reduced fat weight.

Molecular investigations revealed that all dairy products impacted sarcopenia through similar mechanisms: activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, with low-fat goat milk (GLM/GFM) showing stronger mTOR activation; enhancement of muscle regeneration; reduced AMPK phosphorylation; and upregulated MyoG expression, specifically in GFM-supplemented mice (fortified goat low-fat milk). GFM-supplemented mice notably demonstrated the highest MyoG expression levels of the dairy products tested. Only GFM restored both MyoD1 and MyoG expression, while the others restored only MyoD1.

Autophagy investigations presented a similar picture, with all dairy products promoting autophagy through increased LC3B expression and decreased p62 levels. However, low-fat goat milk (GLM) showed the most substantial reduction in p62 levels. Dairy products were also observed to benefit inflammation marker profiles, with significant reductions in CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and CXCL10 levels compared to SOP controls.

Gut microbial investigations revealed that all dairy products promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria, especially those from the genus Leuconostoc. Goat's milk (but not bovine milk) further enriched Acinetobacter and Lactococcus populations. Most importantly, mice supplemented with GLM and GFM showed increased densities of S. sciuri. S. sciuri may contribute to muscle health benefits, suggesting low-fat goat's milk variants as promising candidates in non-invasive sarcopenia interventions. A novel "dairy-microbial score" revealed that GLM and GFM had significantly higher beneficial microbial profiles compared to whole goat milk, correlating with lower fat mass. Metabolomics revealed leucine enrichment in the GFM groups, which was negatively associated with the dairy-microbial score.

Bone mineral density improved with GWM, GFM, and BWM, but not GLM, underscoring composition-dependent effects.

This study presents promising evidence that regular consumption of dairy products, particularly low-fat goat milk fortified with vitamin D and calcium (GFM), could help delay or prevent sarcopenia by reducing inflammation and supporting muscle regeneration. While findings are currently limited to animal models, they underscore the importance of dairy composition (source, fat content, fortification) and frequent consumption in shaping long-term muscle health.

New research uncovers how repetitive strain injuries ignite an inflammatory storm, driving both pain and social withdrawal, offering fresh insight into the biological roots of workplace burnout and recovery.

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Physiology, a group of researchers investigated whether repetitive reaching injury in mature female Sprague-Dawley rats couples pain-like and sickness behaviors with interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dominated inflammation in musculoskeletal tissues, the circulation, and the brain.

Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) sideline millions of workers each year and drain billions in productivity losses, but still, it is not fully understood how repeating the same physical tasks leads to fatigue, pain, and social withdrawal. Experimental and clinical evidence shows that inflammatory signaling molecules, especially IL-6, surge after tissue damage, and elevated circulating levels are linked with chronic pain and depression. Animal studies further indicate that proinflammatory cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and disrupt mood-related neural circuits. Key factors include how age, task intensity, and rest periods interact within this neuroimmune dialogue. Further studies should investigate sex-specific effects, fever responses, and long-term functional outcomes.

Investigators employed a three-arm, randomized, controlled design using mature female Sprague-Dawley rats (14 months of age at the onset). After food restriction, animals were trained under operant conditioning to reach and pull a lever for 6 weeks until they produced about 55% of their maximum voluntary pulling force (MPF). Randomly selected trained rats then performed a high-repetition low-force (HRLF) task for 6 weeks: 2 hours per day, 3 days per week, with a target of 4 reaches per minute at 15% MPF. The remaining trained rats rested, and age-matched food-restricted rats served as the control group. Blinded observers tracked reflexive grip strength, forepaw mechanical sensitivity, social interaction with a juvenile rat, and observed aggression at baseline, after training, and again at week 6. The final group sizes consisted of 24 control rats, 15 trained and rested rats, and 19 task rats. Behavioral scoring was conducted according to standardized protocols to minimize bias.

After 6 weeks of task exposure or matched rest, animals were euthanized, and serum, flexor digitorum muscles, tendons, bones, median nerves, and selected brain regions were collected. Cytokines including interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Brain sections were double-labeled for IL-6 with neuronal nuclei antigen (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), or ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures mixed-effects models and Tukey post hoc tests (α = 0.05); planned samples achieved at least 80% statistical power.

Training resulted in immediate functional costs, as both experimental groups lost approximately 20% of their baseline grip force and became hypersensitive to forepaw stimulation. By week six, rest partially rescued sensation, yet grip weakness lingered, while task animals deteriorated further. They remained 25% weaker than controls, withdrew their paws to monofilaments one-third the original size, and cut prosocial grooming and sniffing time from 40 to 20 seconds. The incidence of boxing or biting rose from nearly 0% in controls and trained rats (who showed only a single instance of aggression) to 42% in task rats. A slight but statistically significant reduction in body weight was also observed in task rats compared to controls at the end of the study. Force-sensor logs revealed that voluntary pull force averaged 27 centinewtons (cN), close to the 15% MPF target, but unsuccessful attempts doubled to more than 300 per two-hour session, intensifying cumulative load.

Biochemical profiling mirrored behavioral severity. Serum IL-1α climbed twofold, TNF-α threefold, and IL-6 fourfold in task rats, whereas the trained + rest group displayed only modest rises in IL-1α and TNF-α, but, crucially, showed no significant increase in IL-6. With the repetitive reaching task, IL-6 increased by 200 to 500% in flexor muscles, forearm bones, and median nerves, while IL-10 declined in muscles, shifting the local balance toward inflammation. Uninvolved tail tissues showed no change, highlighting regional specificity.

Immunohistology identified approximately six IL-6-positive neurons per square millimeter in the rostral cingulate cortex of task rats versus one in controls, alongside dense labeling of ependymal cells and selective activation of the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), with a similar, though not statistically significant, trend observed in the subfornical organ (SFO), gateway regions through which blood-borne cytokines influence the brain. Elevated IL-6 and IL-1α in serum or injured tissues correlated inversely with grip strength and positively with mechanical hypersensitivity, reduced sociability, and aggression. Median nerve IL-6 and TNF-α tracked most strongly with pain metrics, highlighting the nerve's role in pathogenic signaling. Muscle width remained unchanged, excluding sarcopenia as a confounder. Power analysis confirmed adequate sample size, and most group differences achieved p < 0.01.

Elevations in GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba-1-positive microglia co-expressing IL-6 within the ventricles signaled neuro-immune activation, providing a plausible substrate for the enduring behavioral deficits observed despite cessation of high-force loading.

To summarize, repetitive reaching tasks in aging female rats triggered a multi-level inflammatory cascade dominated by IL-6, which paralleled the development of lasting pain-like and sickness behaviors. Local musculoskeletal cytokine surges spilled into the bloodstream, traversed the BBB, and engaged limbic circuits implicated in mood and pain processing, linking workplace-style overuse to whole-body malaise.

Taken together, the data point to inflammation as the common thread linking the weakness, hypersensitivity, fatigue, and social withdrawal that many workers report after overuse injuries. Therapies that dampen IL-6 signaling or interrupt this injury-inflammation cycle could accelerate rehabilitation, reduce sick leave, and lower the broader costs of WMSDs.

A novel study reveals that targeting a single protein's aggregation can dramatically reduce brain injury after stroke, potentially transforming how acute ischemic strokes are treated.

Study: Inhibition of GAPDH aggregation as a potential treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock

A recent study published in the journal iScience reported that inhibiting the aggregation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) could be a therapeutic target for acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

Stroke is the second leading cause of death. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is among the most effective treatments for AIS but has limited acceptability and a narrow therapeutic window (within 4.5 hours). Other medications are symptomatic treatments and have short therapeutic time windows. As such, novel therapeutic approaches are needed to explore alternative therapies.

Evidence suggests that ischemia-reperfusion injury plays a role in AIS pathogenesis. The brain undergoes robust nitrosative/oxidative stress during ischemia-reperfusion, resulting in neuronal death. Understanding the damage induced by stress could illuminate the underlying mechanisms and help identify potential treatments for AIS.

GAPDH is a multifunctional protein that exhibits various functions, including DNA repair, kinase regulation, heme metabolism, and regulation of necrosis and apoptosis. Under oxidative/nitrosative stress, GAPDH nuclear translocation occurs with low-to-moderate stress (causing apoptosis), while aggregation occurs with severe stress (causing necrosis).

In the present study, researchers assessed whether GAPDH aggregation induced by ischemia-reperfusion is involved in the pathogenesis of AIS. First, a mouse AIS model was created by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Animals were subjected to ischemia for 30 minutes and reperfusion for varying durations. Brain infarction was evident 24 hours post-reperfusion, with infarct volume increasing with time. GAPDH aggregates were detected in the striatum (ischemic core) 12 hours post-reperfusion, preceding infarction.

The team generated conditional transgenic mice with neuron-specific expression of GAPDH-C152A to test whether neuronal damage could be prevented by inhibiting the aggregation. To this end, they used a human GAPDH-C152A construct (which reduces GAPDH aggregation in a dominant-negative manner) and doxycycline for temporal control of its expression.

GAPDH-C152A was expressed in the absence of Dox but not in its presence. Further, transgenic and non-transgenic mice were treated with Dox or vehicle for 14 days before MCAO. Physiological parameters (blood pressure, blood gases, cerebral blood flow) remained unaffected.

The infarct volume was the same in all non-transgenic mice, irrespective of Dox treatment. By contrast, Dox-untreated transgenic mice had significantly smaller infarct volumes in both cortex and striatum than Dox-treated counterparts. Moreover, the neurological score, a unilateral paralysis index, was significantly improved in Dox-untreated transgenic mice, suggesting that GAPDH-C152 expression ameliorated brain damage.

The researchers previously reported that GAPDH aggregates induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in vitro. As such, mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed based on the release of cell death mediators: apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c (Cyt c), which enter the nucleus and cytosol, respectively. Both nuclear AIF and cytosolic Cyt c levels were significantly lower in Dox-untreated transgenic mice than in Dox-treated transgenic mice.

Further, the team evaluated whether brain damage could be prevented through pharmacological inhibition of GAPDH aggregation. To this end, peptides with varying types and numbers of amino acids were designed and tested for their inhibitory potential. The SCT (serine-cysteine-threonine) tripeptide (GAI-17, IC50 = 1.18 μM) was identified as the most potent inhibitor, without adverse effects on cell viability or GAPDH enzymatic activity. Its therapeutic effects were subsequently assessed in the MCAO model.

Mice were intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected with 30 nmol or 60 nmol GAI-17 1 hour before, immediately after, and 12 hours after reperfusion. GAI-17 pretreatment significantly reduced infarct volumes in a dose-dependent fashion. The high-dose treatment resulted in a significant decrease in infarct volumes, specifically in the cortex (penumbra) but not in the striatum (ischemic core). GAI-17 is explicitly localized to neurons after i.c.v. administration. Treatment with 60 nmol GAI-17 did not affect physiological parameters. In addition, nuclear AIF and cytosolic Cyt c levels were significantly reduced in the cortex by 60 nmol GAI-17.

Finally, the team sought to ascertain the therapeutic time window. To this end, GAI-17 was administered at two time points: 3 hours and 12 hours (post-3h group), 6 hours and 12 hours (post-6h group), or 9 hours and 12 hours (post-9h group) post-reperfusion. The infarct volume was significantly reduced in the cortex in the post-3h and post-6h groups. Neurological deficits were improved considerably by GAI-17 treatment in the post-3h and post-6h groups. However, the post-9h group lacked protective effects, establishing a therapeutic window up to 6 hours post-reperfusion.

The research had key limitations: (1) Only transient ischemia (with reperfusion) was modeled, not permanent stroke; (2) Effects were only assessed acutely (≤48h), not in subacute/chronic phases; (3) Potential off-target effects of GAI-17 remain unexplored; and (4) While females showed reduced susceptibility to damage, sex differences weren't fully investigated.

The study demonstrated that GAPDH aggregates form prior to the onset of brain infarction following ischemia-reperfusion in a mouse AIS model. The findings suggest GAPDH aggregation as a likely causal mechanism for neuronal death in AIS.

Decreasing GAPDH aggregation via genetic (C152A-GAPDH expression) or pharmacological (GAI-17) approaches alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and ameliorated neurological deficits and brain damage primarily in the cortical penumbra.

Together, the findings suggest that inhibiting GAPDH aggregation could be a therapeutic target for AIS, offering an extended treatment window compared to current options.

A diet rich in foods that support gut microbiota diversity is linked to reduced age acceleration, pointing to new strategies for healthy aging and disease prevention.

Study: Association of a newly proposed dietary index for gut microbiota with phenotypic age acceleration: a cross-sectional study of NHANES 1999–2018. Image Credit: simona pilolla 2 / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition, researchers assessed associations between the dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) and phenotypic age acceleration (PAA).

Adding good foods mattered more than cutting bad ones: Boosting intake of beneficial components (like fiber, fermented dairy) showed a stronger link to slower aging (OR 0.92) than just reducing detrimental foods like red meat (OR 0.97).

Aging is a significant global health concern, affecting lifespan and contributing to an increased disease burden. Dietary factors have increasingly gained attention for their role in regulating aging. Healthy dietary patterns, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet, can slow the aging process by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation; however, the specific mechanisms underlying the associations between diet and aging remain unclear.

Studies indicate links between gut microbiota composition or diversity and aging-related diseases. A functionally intact and diverse gut microbiota could delay aging. In contrast, unhealthy diets rich in fats and refined grains can lead to gut dysbiosis and accelerate the aging process.

The DI-GM is a composite score balancing the intakes of foods deemed detrimental or beneficial to microbial diversity. However, its relationship with biological aging remains unclear.

In the present study, researchers explored the associations between DI-GM and PAA. Data were used from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) conducted between 1999 and 2018 in the United States. Participants were included if they were aged 20 years or older and excluded if they lacked diet or phenotypic age data.

The DI-GM score (range: 0–13) was derived from two 24-hour dietary recalls, with higher scores indicating greater benefits to the gut microbiota. The index originally included 14 components, but green tea, unavailable in NHANES, was excluded.

Scoring was based on sex-specific median food intake. One point was assigned when the intake of foods beneficial to the gut microbiota was above or at the median value, and zero points were assigned if it was below the median. Conversely, one point was assigned when the intake of foods detrimental to the gut microbiota was below the median value, and zero points were assigned if it was above or at the median.

Phenotypic age relied on real clinical markers: The biological age calculation incorporated routine blood test results like albumin, creatinine, and white blood cell count alongside vital signs like blood pressure.

Phenotypic age was determined using 10 physiological indicators (including chronological age), such as creatinine, albumin, glucose, lymphocyte percentage, C-reactive protein, mean cell volume, white blood cell count, alkaline phosphatase, and red cell distribution width. A linear regression analysis was performed to calculate the age acceleration residual (ACR) by regressing phenotypic age against chronological age. PAA was defined as a positive ACR.

Potential confounding variables included gender, age, marital status, race, poverty income ratio, body mass index (BMI), alcohol intake, smoking status, education level, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), physical activity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate the association between the DI-GM score and ACR and PAA. One was adjusted for gender and age, while the other was adjusted for all confounders.

Furthermore, restricted cubic spline analyses were used to assess the non-linear relationship between PAA and DI-GM. Notably, detrimental food components exhibited a significant non-linear association with PAA, whereas the overall DI-GM showed a linear association (P = 0.063 for non-linearity).

In addition, stratified analyses were performed to explore the consistency of associations in subgroups defined by age, gender, alcohol intake, race, smoking status, and chronic disease status (diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease).

A significant interaction emerged between DI-GM and age groups. Moreover, various sensitivity analyses, including propensity score matching and multiple imputation for missing data, were undertaken to verify the robustness of the findings.

Avoiding harmful foods still helped, but differently: While reducing processed meats and refined grains lowered PAA risk, this relationship wasn't perfectly linear, suggesting complex threshold effects.

In total, 29,435 NHANES participants aged 50.3 years, on average, were included. Of these, 50.7% were male, 48.4% were non-Hispanic White, and 61.7% were married or cohabiting. Further, 9,605 individuals exhibited PAA. Individuals with PAA were significantly older and had a higher BMI and lower average DI-GM score than those without PAA.

There were significant differences in race, gender, education level, smoking status, and chronic disease status between individuals with and without PAA. Further, higher DI-GM scores were significantly associated with lower ACR and PAA. Each one-point increment in the DI-GM score was associated with a 12% decrease in PAA risk in the age- and gender-adjusted model and a 7% reduction in the fully adjusted model. Beneficial components (OR = 0.92) contributed more strongly than avoiding detrimental foods (OR = 0.97).

Individuals with DI-GM scores of 5 (OR = 0.89) and those with scores of 6 or higher (OR = 0.74) had significantly lower PAA risks than those with scores of 0–3. A linear, negative correlation was found between DI-GM scores and PAA risk. Stratified analyses showed that higher scores were consistently associated with reduced PAA risks across subgroups. Likewise, sensitivity analyses using advanced statistical methods confirmed these results.

Taken together, the findings illustrate that higher DI-GM scores were significantly associated with lower ACR and PAA risks. Specifically, each unit increment in the score was associated with 7% lower PAA risk in the fully adjusted model. Increasing beneficial foods had a stronger effect than reducing detrimental ones.

This suggests that the potential benefits of dietary patterns on the gut microbiota may play a vital role in slowing biological aging. However, as a cross-sectional study based on 24-hour dietary recalls, causality cannot be inferred, and long-term dietary patterns may not be fully captured.

Additionally, the absence of direct measurements of gut microbiota limits mechanistic interpretations. Future studies should focus on long-term interventions and the integration of multi-omics to explore the interactive mechanisms between the host, microbiota, and diet.

New research reveals that mind-body exercise, such as tai chi and yoga, surpasses other workouts in reversing frailty and enhancing daily function for seniors, offering a cost-effective strategy for healthier aging worldwide.

In a recent study published in the Frontiers in Public Health, researchers compare the impact of mind‑body, aerobic, strength, and mixed exercise programs on frailty, daily function, and quality of life (QoL) in older adults.

Current estimates suggest that up to 25% of older adults live with frailty, which is characterized by declining strength, slowed gait, and poor endurance. As the global population continues to age, the prevalence of frailty will continue to rise and negatively impact the lives of community-dwelling older adults, particularly those residing in low- and middle-income countries.

To date, numerous studies have confirmed the benefits associated with physical activity or regular exercise for building resilience to both prevent and reverse frailty. Despite these observations, it remains unclear whether certain physical activity modalities may be more effective in reducing frailty outcomes than others. To this end, the researchers of the current study compared the effects of mind-body training, aerobic training, strength training, and mixed physical activities on frailty, quality of life (QoL), and activities of daily living (ADLs).

The researchers of the current study reviewed a total of 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that collectively enrolled 2,905 community-dwelling adults, with a mean age of 72 years, 66% of whom were women. The median duration of the study interventions was 18 weeks with two- to seven-hour-long sessions.

Frailty was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) or Fried phenotype, whereas ADL was quantified using the Barthel Index or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). QoL of the study participants was determined using standardized instruments including the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), SF-12, SF-8, and EuroQol-5 Dimension (Eq-5D).

Mind-body training was associated with the most significant reduction in frailty as compared to controls, who exhibited the least improvement. Thereafter, mixed physical activity also improved frailty outcomes, whereas aerobic and strength training provided less significant improvements.

Overall, mind-body training was considered to be 81% more effective in ameliorating frailty in older adults than all other interventions. Mind-body training also led to the most effective QoL improvements as compared to the other exercise interventions.

Compared to aerobic training, aerobic training was associated with more significant improvements in ADLs in up to 74% of cases. Nevertheless, both mind-body training and mixed physical activity similarly improved ADLs, with a modest impact associated with strength training as compared to controls.

The subgroup analyses demonstrated that the efficacy of community programs was similar to that associated with hospital interventions, which supports a shift in policy toward local delivery. Mind-body training sessions of 50‑60 minutes at least three times every week were associated with the greatest improvements.

The observed improvements in frailty measurements persisted across continents, economic strata, and baseline fitness, which confirms the generalizability of this approach. Cost modeling indicated that each quality‑adjusted life year (QALY) gained through mind-body training was one‑third of the price of current pharmacological fall‑prevention programs. Taken together, exercise emerges as a low‑risk pathway to resilience in aging.

Mind-body training emerged as most effective in alleviating frailty and enhancing overall quality of life, making it particularly suitable for severely frail individuals with restricted mobility.”

Exercise modality is a key factor in determining the prescription of movement medicine for seniors. Mind‑body training was associated with consistent and significant improvements in both frailty and QoL outcomes, whereas aerobic workouts are ideal for preserving daily independence. Importantly, mixed physical activity and strength training also offer complementary benefits.

The effects of these exercise modalities exceed clinically meaningful levels, can be easily incorporated into community settings, and are considered both safe and cost‑efficient. The study findings indicate that practitioners should prioritize one-hour sessions that incorporate both mindfulness and exertion with a frequency of at least three sessions each week. Policymakers can invest confidently in local mind‑body sessions, while researchers are encouraged to continue assessing adherence, biological pathways, and cost‑effectiveness.

Scientists uncover how zebrafish switch between cell division and direct differentiation to rebuild sensory organs, challenging long-held views on tissue regeneration.

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in the USA investigated the mechanisms by which stem cell genes modulate regeneration in zebrafish lateral line neuromasts (sensory organs). Specifically, the study leveraged cutting-edge CRISPR gene editing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and live imaging to investigate how two distinct cyclin D genes, ccndx and ccnd2a, regulate distinct cell populations during the development and regeneration of these sensory organs.

Study findings reveal that ccndx and ccnd2a function via independent yet complementary pathways – the former modulates the division of progenitor cells, while the latter drives the amplification of stem cell proliferation. Even when one pathway is lost, the other can partially compensate, but regeneration proceeds via a limited and less robust mechanism. For example, in ccndx mutants, direct differentiation can generate hair cells without division; however, fewer cells and a pronounced polarity defect occur, with approximately 70% of regenerated hair cells exhibiting a posterior bias. This polarity defect is mechanistically linked to reduced expression of hes2.2, which normally inhibits Emx2, a master regulator of hair cell polarity. Together, these genes ensure robust tissue maintenance, offering new therapeutic directions for sensory regeneration research.

Tissue turnover and regeneration are fundamental processes essential for maintaining life. These constantly occurring processes rely on delicate balances between populations of stem cells, which gradually replenish themselves over time, and progenitor cells, which mature into specialized forms in response to physiological requirements.

Decades of research have revealed that cyclin D proteins, known primarily for their crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression, have substantial modulatory effects on cell proliferation. Unfortunately, the mechanistic associations between specific stem cell populations and cyclin D protein use remain poorly understood. Unraveling these associations may open the door to novel regenerative therapies, especially relevant in today's increasingly aging global population, which is experiencing a decline in sensory ability.

Recent research aims to leverage the zebrafish, a well-studied model organism renowned for its regenerative capabilities, to answer this question. In particular, the zebrafish's sensory lateral line is known to regenerate cells rapidly following injury. This line consists of hair, support, and mantle cells, essential for detecting water movement. Given their functional analogy to the human inner ear, these models are used to gain a better understanding of sensory regeneration.

The present study utilized several transgenic zebrafish larval strains to elucidate the mechanisms underlying regeneration in the lateral line sensory system. The study focuses on two cyclin D genes: ccndx and ccnd2a.

By leveraging CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a gene editing, transgenic zebrafish with ccndx and/or ccnd2a knocked out were then observed (via scRNA-seq) to elucidate their differences in gene expression and cell states. These assays were replicated over 10,000 cells and were complemented by RNA velocity modeling using the scVelo and partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) algorithms.

Researchers began by treating zebrafish larvae with neomycin, an antibiotic (ototoxin) that triggers rapid hair death (and subsequent regeneration) along the lateral line organ. Observation via single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) assays in combination with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling and time-lapse imaging (Nikon Ti2 Eclipse; 42 hours at 28.5 °C) resulted in the identification of two proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression-marked cell populations, one governed by ccndx and the other by ccnd2a.

Finally, protein modeling using the Robetta and Mol*3D Viewer platforms was conducted to compare the structural conservation of cyclin D proteins across transgenic zebrafish species. Statistical analyses comprised analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests for inter-treatment difference significant reporting (p < 0.05).

Neomycin treatment assays revealed the presence of two independent cell populations involved in neuromast regeneration. scRNA-seq analysis revealed these populations: 1. Self-renewing amplifying stem cell populations that express ccnd2a, and 2. Progenitor cells that mature into sensory hair cells that express ccndx.

Notably, ccndx knockout strains demonstrated hair regeneration even in the absence of ccndx expression. Still, these hair cells were often misoriented, possibly because of altered hes2.2 and emx2 activity (genes involved in hair cell polarity). Importantly, expressing ccnd2a under the ccndx promoter, an artificial genetic rescue, was able to restore both the number and orientation of hair cells in ccndx-mutants (p < 0.0001), marking a mechanistic demonstration rather than a physiological compensation.

In contrast, ccnd2a-deficient mutants showed reduced amplifying stem cell proliferation during development, but regeneration was less affected, suggesting that other cyclins can compensate during tissue repair, without inducing polarity defects. Specifically, the study reports upregulation of ccnd1 during regeneration in ccnd2a mutants, potentially compensating for the loss of ccnd2a function (Supplementary Fig. 5N–P). This independent regulation suggests sensory regeneration can occur even if one population (pathway) is compromised. For example, five days post-fertilization (dpf), ccndx mutants showed significantly reduced EdU+ differentiating progenitor cells compared to their wild-type siblings (p = 0.0001), while amplifying cell counts remained unchanged (p = 0.35).

This finding that zebrafish hair cells can regenerate through direct differentiation without progenitor proliferation represents a paradigm shift in regenerative biology, challenging the long-standing view that proliferation is essential for tissue regeneration.

Finally, this study revealed the importance of ‘Notch signaling' in sensory regeneration. This highly conserved cell-to-cell communication pathway, essential for development and tissue homeostasis, was found to suppress ccndx expression, with its inhibition leading to increased progenitor proliferation only in ccndx-intact fish, thereby confirming a tight regulatory loop between Notch activity, cyclin D expression, and regeneration capacity.

This study represents a significant advance in our understanding of regenerative biology, demonstrating for the first time that, contrary to prior assumptions, all proliferating cells in regenerative tissues are not regulated similarly. It highlights the future importance of tailored cell cycle regulation, leveraging both ccndx and ccnd2a for optimal sensory regeneration outcomes.

These findings could accelerate the development of therapies in regenerative medicine. However, it is important to note that ccndx is absent in mammals, so these findings are directly applicable only to non-mammalian species. As with all basic science studies in animal models, findings should be considered in the context of zebrafish biology, and their applicability to humans will require further research.

When Xabi Alonso Will Decide Gonzalo Garcia's Real Madrid Future

Real Madrid will reportedly wait until the end of the club's condensed preseason before pushing forward with any transfer plans for the sought-after Gonzalo García.

In the space of less than one hot month in the U.S., García went from a figure scarcely recognizable to those outside Real Madrid's academy to the second coming of Raúl. Kylian Mbappé's bout of gastroenteritis forced Xabi Alonso to field the 21-year-old, who rewarded his new manager with four goals and an assist across six Club World Cup games.

Such form has unsurprisingly inspired admiring glances from a glut of clubs eager to whisk this young talent away. 

Several La Liga sides have been tipped to offer García the guarantee of playing time with a season-long loan and Getafe president Ángel Torres publicized his club's interest earlier this month. “We have had an agreement a month and a half ago with Gonzalo, and if he doesn't stay at Real Madrid, he will come to Getafe,” he declared.

García's representatives have questioned the convincing tone behind Torres's proclamation. AS report that the Spanish forward is still considering a slew of “non-stop offers”, including several approaches from Premier League clubs. The same outlet claims that Madrid have not yet settled on García's future themselves.

Alonso is expected to give his young striker another chance to impress during preseason, which begins for Real Madrid once players return from their extended breaks on Aug. 4. Much to the chagrin of those in the Spanish capital, La Liga have rejected Madrid's attempts to delay their return to top-flight action, which will begin against Osasuna on Aug. 19.

García got his break thanks to Mbappé's absence but retained his starting spot after the Frenchman returned to fitness during the tournament. Unlike his illustrious colleagues, García is willing to hare around the final third even when he doesn't have the ball. This summer, the hard-working Spaniard averaged a successful tackle every 90 minutes. Vinicius Junior and Mbappé spent a combined 581 minutes on the pitch at the Club World Cup without winning possession back once.

USA defender Chris Richards (3) leaves the field as Mexico celebrates the team's 2-1 win in the Concacaf Gold Cup finals at NRG Stadium in Houston on Sunday, July 6, 2025. Mexico won the game 2-1.

As soon as the referee blew the whistle to conclude the Gold Cup final, Mexico's 2-1 victory over the United States at NRG Stadium earlier this month, the Mexican players began celebrating on the field as a traditional ranchera song by Vicente Fernández echoed through the stands.

“El Rey” (The King) resonated as Mexican fans sang proudly in their green jerseys and waving their national flags, and many fans of the U.S. national team left the stadium biting the dust of defeat against their traditional CONCACAF rivals.

Perhaps many of the fans didn't even know what that song was about, but the Mexicans, in addition to singing one of the most famous verses of their popular music, took the opportunity to remind their hosts and neighbors that their national soccer team still rules the region. The pride of Mexican soccer had been wounded in recent years with the rise of national teams like the United States, Canada and even Panama in CONCACAF.

But this year, led by Javier Aguirre, Mexico reaffirmed its supremacy. First by winning the Nations League title and now by retaining the Gold Cup, for which “El Vasco” called up his best players while Mauricio Pochettino, the Argentine manager of the USMNT, preferred to rest several of his regular starters and instead try out other young players just one year before the FIFA World Cup, which will be held in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

“Obviously (this title) is important because we Mexicans have been fortunate enough to win the last tournaments CONCACAF has organized: we won the Nations League and now we're repeating in the Gold Cup. That fills me with pride because it gives us confidence, it gives us energy for the future, for what's coming. There are no more official matches; they're friendlies, and we have to continue looking for players for the World Cup,” said “El Vasco.”

“The World Cup is going to be a real test for many of us, and we have a year to prepare well. I think there are people who would tell you today that they've passed, but there are always little things to improve. I myself sometimes make mistakes, and luckily I also have a great coaching staff that opens my eyes,” he added. “I think we've made good progress in CONCACAF recently, because it seems like we've stuck there in the past. Panama, Canada, and the United States itself have grown, and I think today we're in a prominent position in the region.”

A few days earlier, at another press conference, in the run-up to the final, Aguirre arrived with a book under his arm.

It wasn't just any book. When asked, the Mexican national team coach said it was a book on Mexican history, and that he was reading a chapter in which Texas ceased to be Mexican territory.

Coincidence? Hardly. Provocation? Maybe. In one way or another, it may have served as motivation for his players ahead of the final, and perhaps also for the fans, who played a key role with their overwhelming support at NRG Stadium, packed with 70,925 spectators, something Pochettino himself emphasized when lamenting his team's defeat.

Aguirre tried to depersonalize the achievement of winning the new title on the coach's behalf and focused on the merit of his players, who spent more than a month training for this tournament and traveled to several cities across the country. And throughout, he emphasized the tremendous support they received from the fans, and specially in Houston, which will be one of the venues for the World Cup.

Because Mexico, like the United States and Canada, has already qualified for the World Cup as one of the three hosts, it will only play friendlies between now and the big event.

Within this context, while Aguirre has used his best players to reaffirm his dominance in the region, he has also been experimenting with some young players, something he could fine-tune in the upcoming matches.

Among them are midfielders Gilberto Mora and Marcel Ruiz and fullback Mateo Chávez, who have taken advantage of the opportunities in the Gold Cup and have positioned themselves to fight for their spots in the World Cup squad.

Mora, 16, was forced into the starting team due to Luis Chávez's unfortunate right knee injury. He asserted himself and even became one of the key players in the semifinal victory over Honduras. In the final, he consistently showed his worth, showing himself constantly and calling for the ball to try to play between the two defensive lines set up by the United States, and even managed to make a difference with his skills and excellent passing.

Ruiz, 24, also played a prominent role in the final and established himself throughout the tournament after other strong performances. Chávez, 19, also made his senior team debut, though less prominently as he came in as a substitute for Jesús Gallardo, although he also performed well.

On the other hand, Pochettino didn't regret his decision not to select many of his starters.

“All the players have a chance,” said the manager of the US national team. “We need to analyze each player, see the circumstances, the situations, the performance, the level of fitness.”

Among the absent, Captain Christian Pulisic asked for a vacation after a long season in Europe with AC Milan; Yunus Musah opted not to participate for an undisclosed personal reason; Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, and Gio Reyna were committed to their teams at the FIFA Club World Cup, Antonee Robinson and Folarin Balogun were injured; and Sergiño Dest was regaining his best physical form.

In their places, players who stood out during the tournament were goalkeeper Matt Freese, right back Alex Freeman, midfielders Malik Tillman, Sebastian Berhalter and Diego Luna, and forward Patrick Agyemang.

Pochettino, with a record of 10 wins and six losses since replacing Gregg Berhalter in the fall of 2024, will now face two exhibition games against 23rd-ranked South Korea on Sept. 6 in Harrison, N.J., and then face 17th-ranked Japan three days later in Columbus, Ohio.

After that, the 15th-ranked U.S. will face 25th-ranked Ecuador on Oct. 10 in Austin and 24th-ranked Australia four days later in Commerce City, Colo.

The first edition of the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the United States concluded on July 13 in New Jersey with Chelsea winning the tournament. But with less than a year to go until the World Cup, FIFA should take note of some alarm bells raised during the tournament.

The final, in which the English team routed Paris Saint-Germain of France 3-0 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, was a success with over 80,000 spectators. However, many of the matches, especially in the group stage, were played in half-empty stadiums as FIFA decided to use regular NFL venues instead of those of Major League Soccer (MLS), which continued to be played simultaneously with this club competition and the Gold Cup.

However, that hasn't been the most alarming aspect of the venues. Instead, it's the renewed complaints from some coaches and teams about the poor condition of some playing fields, something that had already occurred the previous summer during Copa América, which Argentina won at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami against Colombia.

Like a year ago, the organizers' main excuse has been the lack of time they've had to change the turf on fields that typically use a synthetic or hybrid surface to a natural one, which is the most commonly used in Europe and South America.

Even more worrying has been the extreme heat under which some of the matches have had to be played, during midday slots for kick-off in the middle of summer. This is an issue directly related to scheduling matches for television audiences in other countries and continents.

Sergio Marchi, president of FIFPro, the most important international players' association, harshly criticized the tournament and has already issued a warning to Swiss-Italian FIFA president Gianni Infantino ahead of the World Cup.

VILLANOVA, PA – Villanova women's soccer head coach Samar Azem announced the addition of four transfers who have inked Letters of Intent.

The quartet includes two forwards, a midfielder and a defender. Two of the four are players who have been a part of teams who have made deep runs in the national tournament in the past four seasons.

“We are very excited about this recruiting class of transfers. We have a great blend of strong, core returning players; young, eager and talented freshmen; and a fantastic group of transfers who have the ability to elevate what we do competitively as our program takes a step forward,” Villanova head coach Samar Azem said. “We are extremely selective on the players and people we recruit – and this group of transfers each have an important role they can play in our program re-establishing its competitive identity. We have graduate transfers who bring the experience of national championship matches, final fours, national teams and achieving success at the highest level of soccer and academic prestige. I have no doubt this group of transfers will come in and make their marks on this program very quickly.”

“I want to thank our assistant coaches, Ryan and Erin, our support staff, our admissions staff and academic staff, and our players for the time they've put into ensuring we bring individuals who not only fit the identity we want to play with and talent profile we are looking for, but who also have the ability to enhance our community and tradition of excellence here at Villanova University,” Azem continued.

See below for a look at each of Villanova's new signings.

Curtin comes to the Main Line after a four-year career at Dartmouth where she was an NEWISA Third Team All-Region and Second Team All-Ivy player, both awards coming in the 2021 campaign. She totaled 35 starts in 42 appearances in her time with the Big Green for 2392 minutes of action. In that time, she tallied 29 points on 10 goals and nine assists. Her final season at Dartmouth came with 13 starts in 16 matches played. She scored three goals and two assists while compiling a three-game point streak along the way in which she tallied two goals and an assist. She had a breakout season in 2021 where she logged both aforementioned accolades after a six-goal, four-assist year, netting two game-winners along the way.

Academically, she was honored at the end of the 2024 season as the College Sports Communicators Academic All-District Team selection.

The Winchester, Mass. native was a four-year letter winner at Winchester High School, captaining the team in her senior year. She also earned two varsity letters as a sprinter on the indoor track team. On the pitch, she helped her team to the 2019 Division II State Championships in 2019 while going on a year later to be a finalist. She was a two-time High School Soccer First Team All-American selection, 2019 DII State Player of the Year, a four-time Middlesex League Champion, a three-time Middlesex League MVP as well as an All-State and All-New England honoree. At the club level, she played with the FC Stars from 2017-2021 where she was a Second Team Northeast ECNL and ODP Region 1 Team member.

Curtin will pursue a Masters in Finance at Villanova. On why she chose Villanova: “During my visit to Villanova, I felt an overwhelming sense of good on campus and amongst the team. The combination of elite athletics, rigorous master's programs, and strong Augustinian values creates an environment where I believe I would thrive in during my fifth year.”

Azem on Curtin: “Hannah is a fast, athletic, and relentless forward who has the capability to create a lot of problems for defenders.  She can score goals, she can create goals for others and she will press relentlessly.  She is a prototype of what we are looking for in our attacking players and will bring four years of high-level experience with her.  Her drive and her leadership will add a value of winning to our program as we rise through this next step.”

Dobsch was an ACC Honor Roll member and ACC Top 6 for Service honoree at Wake Forest, also earning a spot on the Dean's list all four years. In her time with the Demon Deacons, she suited up for three seasons and redshirted her junior campaign, logging 187 minutes on the pitch mostly as a defender. She is coming off a senior campaign that saw her play in four wins for the Deacs.

The Winnetka, Ill. native played a year of high school soccer as an All-State defender but was a part of elite club teams. She led her club team, Eclipse Select, to a No. 1 national ranking during the 2019-20 campaign. Prior to that, she was named the FC United team captain in 2015-16 while playing with ODP Illinois State Team in the same year. She attended the US Soccer Training Center from 2015-17 and was an ECNL Midwest Conference Champion and Finalist at the ECNL National Championship. Her team also ranked third in the ECNL National Conference Playoffs in 2021. In the classroom, she was a member of the Honor Roll all four years of her high school career.

Dobsch will pursue an MBA on the Main Line. On why she chose Villanova: “I chose Villanova for my fifth year because it combines high-level athletics with academic excellence. The competitive soccer program led by a respected coaching staff and being given the opportunity to pursue a well-regarded MBA checked all the boxes for me.”

Azem on Dobsch: “Kate is a skilled and sophisticated player on the ball.  She has the vision, ability, and range to play well timed advanced passes and orchestrate play in possession. She was an instrumental leader in Wake Forest's NCAA championship run and brings the experience of winning with her as our program looks to take a leap forward.”

Chukwu played in 16 of 17 games at Brown in her freshman season. In that time, she logged 266 minutes of action. She has worked her way through the Canadian Women's National Team system as well, suiting up with the U17 squad in 2023-24 cycle and U15 in 2022. That 2022 campaign was a stacked one for the Ottawa native, being selected for Canada Soccer's National Development Centre Ontario. At the club level, she played with 2022 OPDL U15 Gary Miller Cup and Shield and ODPL U15 League Champion teams, also winning the Ontario Summer Games that year. That year also saw her be a part of the Ontario Provincial Excel Team. She is not the only collegiate soccer player in her family. Her sister, Annabelle, is a forward at Notre Dame.

The Biology major on why she chose Villanova: “I chose Villanova because of its strong academics, and the faculty's commitment to developing student-athletes on and off the field.”

Azem on Chukwu: “Isabelle is a creative attacking player on the ball.  She has experience training and competing with the Canadian youth national team and comes from a year of experience with a dominant Ivy team. Isabelle's mind and vision for the game are extremely impressive. Coupled with her athletic ability, she will bring a lethal force to our front line.”

Panaccione wrapped up her undergraduate career this past season at Santa Clara. In her time with the Broncos, the defender amassed five starts in 26 appearances, logging two assists in 910 minutes of action. Her first year with the team saw the Broncos reach the NCAA National Semifinals in 2021.

Before Santa Clara, the Los Altos Hills, Calif. native was a four-year varsity soccer player at Saint Francis High School and played at the club level with MVLA. She was CCS and WCAL Team selection all four years and was awarded the SFHS Outstanding Athlete Award.

Azem on Panaccione: “Bella is a seasoned veteran and competitor. She has the versatility too in the back and mid lines and has a strong understanding of the game. She can impact our ability to possess and move the ball through each phase of play phenomenally well. Bella is a tough competitor and gritty defender and will be a handful for teams to try to break down.”

The teams will hold current camps in California.

Twenty players have been called up. 

Mike O'Neill has signed 8 first-year players.

Dr. Krissy Turner introduced Penn's signing class.

Tracey Bartholomew introduced 13 newcomers.

FIFA have stripped a further eight clubs of a major title amid their decision over Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City.

Earlier this month, Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain 4-0 to win the 2025 Club World Cup title.

Although the Club World Cup had previously been held annually since 2005, FIFA made the decision to officially pronounce Chelsea as the first-ever 'world champions'.

Advert

According to the Daily Mail, former Club World Cup winners Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City will all now be referred to as 'FIFA Intercontinental Champions'.

That is a differentiation from the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, a newly-introduced rebrand of a tournament by the same name which sees each of the six teams that won their confederation's continental cup compete in a mini-tournament.

Chelsea are not guaranteed to defend their title at the next Club World Cup in 2029, as the tournament's holders do not yet receive automatic qualification.

Liverpool, United and City will all hope to meet the qualifying criteria over the next three years and effectively 'win back' their title of world champions.

Liverpool won the Club World Cup in 2019, while City were the final winners under the previous format in 2023.

Advert

United, meanwhile, lifted the trophy in 2008. All three sides had won the Champions League earlier in the year of their success.

And seven other clubs are now no longer recognised as champions of the footballing world.

Real Madrid are five-time winners of the Club World Cup under its previous format, but will now have to win it under its new format. They are, however, still the reigning champions of the Intercontinental Cup.

Advert

Three-time winners Barcelona are also affected, as well as two-time winners Bayern Munich and Corinthians.

Finally, Sao Paulo (2005 winners), Internacional (2006), AC Milan (2007) and Inter Milan (2010) are the other teams that can no longer call themselves world champions.

PSG, Pyramids, Al Hilal and Cruz Azul are the teams already confirmed for the 2029 Club World Cup - but all the above teams can still qualify alongside them by winning continental titles or by meeting specific club ranking criteria set by FIFA.

By Robert Haugh 

Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium will host six World Cup matches in 2026, including five group-stage games on June 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25, plus a round of 32 match on July 1.

KRON reports that a name change is possible.  Janine De La Vega, the City's Public Information Officer, told KRON: “It is our understanding that any name change for Levi's Stadium during the FIFA World Cup 2026 event is a matter of ongoing discussions between the Bay Area Host Committee (BAHC) and FIFA.”

But sources tell Santa Clara News Online that a name change is likely already a done deal, with the BAHC delaying the official announcement, and Levi's may not be aware they are losing a global marketing opportunity.

FIFA's strict sponsorship rules require that only official tournament sponsors be associated with World Cup venues. All existing stadium branding and signage not aligned with FIFA's sponsorship deals must be covered or removed. 

This has led to similar name changes at other host venues, such as Hard Rock Stadium becoming “Miami Stadium” and AT&T Stadium being renamed “Dallas Stadium” for the event.

The BAHC is still working to finalize event preparations, but fundraising remains a huge problem for them. 

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the 49ers and the BAHC are facing a $37 million fundraising gap, with the state budget offering only $10 million in support. 

The projected costs for hosting the matches could reach $50 million, with FIFA contributing just $13 million.

This is a developing story.

Just two Question.
How does any of this help the average resident of our City?

Why is it that the City of Santa Clara gets all the risk, yet the 49ers of San Francisco get all the rewards?  

Curious to hear any explanation from our City Staff, and maybe some options that we might have to avoid exposing our City to such “BS” Cost, especially with no matching risk / reward to merit these expenditures.     

By the way didn't the 49ers just ask to get us, the residents, to pay for their new Levi Stadium signs last year because they were looking a bit faded?
As they say…. you can look it up.

Can City staff that “negotiated” this deal with the 49ers and FIFA please inform the public of what happens to the Stadium Authority's Naming Rights revenue in 2026?

I nominate Charles Ponzi.  Ponzi Stadoum.

This is exactly what I said the cost would be to Residents when I was campaigning for District 5 council seat. If you add the SuperBowl it could be closer to $70M.

Bayern Munich believe Liverpool will soften their stance on selling Luis Diaz this summer after spending close to £300 million ($402m) in the ongoing transfer window. The Reds are close to signing Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt, which could convince them to allow Diaz to exit Anfield. The Colombian winger is keen to leave the Reds and join the Bundesliga giants.

Chelsea chiefs seem to have at last made a decision on what the 2025/26 season will hold for promising youngster Kendry Paez.

There is plenty of excitement over what Paez can bring to Stamford Bridge after already establishing himself as a regular in the Ecuador senior side alongside Moises Caicedo.

However, the expectations on him for the upcoming campaign were put on hold after it emerged he had not been included in the squad to compete in the Club World Cup.

Paez was reportedly angry at not being selected, and eventually travelled with the side and trained with the first team to get to grips with his future teammates.

It was reported late last season that Paez had been training with Strasbourg, who are also under the BlueCo model that are in charge of proceedings at Stamford Bridge.

Andrey Santos has already gone from loan spells to the Ligue 1 side to being a genuine option for Enzo Maresca, and they will be hoping the same becomes the case for their new addition.

As per Ben Jacobs, a loan deal to Strasbourg is in the process of being finalised for Paez.

He said: “Kendry Paez set for a Strasbourg loan after training with Chelsea during the Club World Cup. Loan now in the process of being finalised.“

Fellow impressive youngster Estevao Willian will not be leaving on loan upon his arrival at Stamford Bridge. He will get his chance to impress the manager when the first team squad return to pre-season.

As per transfer rules, Chelsea are only allowed to loan three players to Strasbourg for a single season, and these transactions are allowed as the Blues will be playing in a different level of European football next season.

Mike Penders is set to replace Djordje Petrovic as the goalkeeper for the Ligue 1 side, after he travelled with the first team squad to win the Club World Cup.

The final spot has been taken by one of their former players. Mamadou Sarr will join Strasbourg for the 2025/26 season after joining Chelsea earlier this summer.

New York and New Jersey officials are projecting a $3.3 billion economic boost to the region from hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2026.

The region will hold eight matches at Metlife Stadium in New Jersey, including the final on July 19, 2026, expecting to bring in over 1.2 million fans and tourists, according to an economic impact summary released Monday by the NYNJ Host Committee, the local body responsible for organizing the games.

Manchester United hope to avoid a 'doomsday scenario' as they look to swiftly get rid of four out-of-favour players before the summer transfer window winds down. Marcus Rashford is set to become the first unwanted man to leave as he closes in on joining La Liga champions Barcelona on a loan deal. United now want similar exits for the rest of their outcasts.

The World Cup in Qatar. The Copa America against the best from North and South America. High-pressure matches across the continent.

In his years with the United States Soccer Federation, Steve Fell has seen them all.

For the second half of this summer, though, the St. Augustine resident is back home and helping Sporting Club Jacksonville reach peak condition ahead of the women's professional soccer team's debut in the top-division Gainbridge Super League.

"It's just been a dream come true to live in such a beautiful place, and still be involved [in soccer] full-time and at a high level," he said.

Following years alongside the United States men's national team at world soccer's highest level, he's adding a new role in 2025 as head of performance for Sporting Jax and its young roster.

"There are differences in maybe the experiences of a higher-level player, because of what they deal with day-to-day, but I would say from a physical preparation side, you treat them all the same," Fell said. "Wherever they fall in that continuum, that's the starting point, and then you try to help that player advance as much as you can."

Even after some recent experienced additions, most recently former University of Florida defender Julia Lester on loan from the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League, Sporting Jax is racing toward August with youth. Close to half of its members are new to the professional ranks.

Head coach Stacey Balaam has the assignment of molding those newcomers into a cohesive unit for the club's Super League kickoff on Aug. 23, and she expects that Fell's background in the sport can accelerate the process of bringing them up to speed.

"Not everybody has someone with his skill set, his knowledge, expertise and experience," Balaam said. "It's been valuable for our players to learn from him and for him to give them the necessary feedback. Right now, we're just soaking up all the information."

Before Sporting Jax announced his hiring in April, Fell had accumulated a decade of wide-ranging soccer experience with Major League Soccer's Houston Dynamo, the United Soccer League's Phoenix Rising and most recently the United States Soccer Federation. He even served a stint as physical preparation coach in the sport's indoor variant with the Baltimore Blast of the now-inactive Major Indoor Soccer League.

A graduate of Towson University in Maryland, Fell is also at home on the First Coast, and he became Flagler College's director of sports performance in July 2015.

Since early 2022, Fell has worked as a performance coach alongside the full U.S. men's national team, including the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and he intends to continue in that role while also assisting Sporting Jax's efforts.

For Fell, the summer has raced along at near-nonstop pace. Before returning to Jacksonville to help supervise the Sporting Jax preseason, he spent a full month on the road with the U.S. men at the continental championship tournament, the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

After the United States lost that tournament final 2-1 to Mexico on July 6 in Houston, almost immediately, he was on his way back to Florida for Sporting Jax camp.

"It was good to get right back into it and almost erase the thought of [the loss] quickly," he said.

Under the Sporting Jax plan, Fell will supervise the players' physical preparation, while Balaam and associate coach Alan Kirkup handle the tactical planning and technical development.

"Steve's been a big help in terms of allowing us to do our job, allowing players to push when we need to push, taper off when we need to taper off," Balaam said.

For players making the jump from the college game to the Super League, the adjustments are many.

"It's not just technical and tactical, we're talking the physical attributes," Fell said. "That is the universal thing when you go from college to a professional level. You see it all over the place, where individuals who were doing very well in college have this little adjustment period."

The goal for Fell and the Sporting Jax staff is making that adjustment period as speedy as possible for rookies like defender Paige Kenton, who owns substantial credentials in her own right. She graduated magna cum laude from Penn with a degree in neuroscience and completed her fifth NCAA year last fall while pursuing her master's degree in the University of Delaware's Department of Linguistics and Cognitive Science.

"What we're asked to do at this level is very different from the college level," Kenton said. "It's not just about making a good pass, or making a pass, but it's about maximizing your decisions to help the team."

It's a similar feeling for players like defender Grace Philpotts, in her first professional season out of the University of Kentucky. The soccer may seem the same at first, but the demands are greater.

"The drills are pretty similar, but the tempo of the drills can be a lot different," Philpotts said. "We're having vets, we're having girls with pro experience of many years that are coming now and training, so I'd say the tempo is a lot faster [than in college]."

Balaam, who came to Sporting Jax in April from SEC soccer at Vanderbilt, recognizes the step up awaiting the players.

"It's something that they've probably not had before," Balaam said. "So it's an example of this as the next level for them."

However, time is on the side of Sporting Jax. In addition to closed-door training matches later this month, the club also tunes up at UNF on Aug. 2 against Hibernian of Scotland and on Aug. 10 against Wrexham of Wales, games that will help Fell assess how players are advancing.

"We're building these athletes who are just coming out of college progressively, in a way that's safe," Fell said, "to help them attain that level where they're able to handle the demands of the professional level."

It's emerged that Chelsea officials had noticed that PSG reps were already assuming they had won the Club World Cup.

Of course, seeing this would be enough to motivate you to do all you can to go on and win the competition, and that is exactly what Chelsea did just over a week ago now.

PSG are European Champions and many people see them as the best team in the world at current, and they probably are. But anything can happen in this sport, and one game is one game. Chelsea proved to the world that PSG can be beaten and in all honesty, they were beaten with easy on the night with The Blues thrashing them 3-0 to become World Champions.

But it sounds like PSG were getting complacent and already assuming that they were going to win the game before it was even played.

According to a report from The Times over the weekend, at a FIFA dinner on the eve of the Club Word Cup final, the Chelsea delegation noted how preoccupied the representatives of PSG were with how and where they would collect the trophy. Chelsea's people informed Enzo Maresca of this and he passed it onto the players.

Imagine getting that information and being able to use that as such strong motivation! Amazing stuff,

Mamadou Sarr is rejoining Strasbourg on loan from Chelsea after Fabrizio Romano called the ‘here we go' done deal on that one late last night.

Nicolas Jackson's agent has been in talks with Manchester United over the weekend to see if a move to Old Trafford can happen for the striker this summer.

Chelsea have won two trophies this season, credit to Enzo Maresca, and in large part, Cole Palmer. The Europa Conference League and the FIFA Club World Cup, along with a top-four finish in the Premier League, are indications that the Blues possess both talent and a coach capable of producing results with the right methodology.

Last season, Chelsea were shaky during the middle part of the campaign but stabilised toward the end, making a top-four finish possible. Yes, everyone expected Maresca's men to win the Conference League, but then again, everyone also expected Paris Saint-Germain to win the Club World Cup after wins over Bayern Munich and Real Madrid with ease.

So, expectations don't always equate to victories. Chelsea's performance in the Club World Cup deserves recognition for several reasons.

Maresca had the sense not to sit back against Paris Saint-Germain, but also not to press them too far forward, even though he deployed a high line. The Blues boss relied on his team's pacy backline to deal with the over-the-top through balls that Luis Enrique's side tried to play in behind. This should be noted, as the Italian manager has demonstrated this kind of pragmatism at several points throughout the season.

A pragmatic approach, when needed, allows the Blues to make the most of their key strengths in big matches: pace. If Chelsea can consistently deploy this style next season, it could lead to invaluable victories over direct rivals. Wins that could prove crucial at the end of the campaign.

This point is a bit trickier. Chelsea kept just 34% possession, yet created three big chances, took 10 shots, and scored three goals. That kind of efficiency should be acknowledged, though for a different reason. The Blues have not shown this level of clinical finishing consistently over the past season.

In fact, Chelsea missed 2.2 of every 3.2 big chances they created per game in the Premier League last season, across 38 games. They've been consistently poor at converting opportunities. That wastefulness extended to the Club World Cup final too. Against PSG, they missed two of the three big chances they created, though they were still efficient in terms of goals scored per shot taken.

Joao Pedro is likely to help Maresca's men become more clinical next season. If the Blues want to compete for more than just a top-four finish, improving their efficiency in front of goal is essential.

Chelsea's players showed a level of confidence that, admittedly, made me uneasy at first. But it paid off. Their performance reflected a team that believed in its game plan. Next season, Maresca's men will need that same belief, not only for big matches but also to meet the season's expectations as a whole.

Levi Colwill's comments about “not being Inter or Madrid” may have come across as arrogant, but confidence and arrogance often wear the same face. That belief will also help the coach, as confident players take necessary risks without being overly cautious.

These three factors are why Chelsea should be considered serious contenders for a top-two finish in the Premier League in the 2025/26 season. That is, as long as Maresca doesn't revert to a rigid “his way” approach, the kind that saw them lose 4-0 to Celtic in July 2024.

In the Club World Cup, Chelsea had to beat several teams to reach the final against PSG. While most of those opponents weren't expected to pose much of a challenge, the win over the Champions League holders was significant because it finally earned the Blues some long-overdue respect from rival fans.

Premier League teams will be at least twice as difficult as most of the sides Chelsea faced in the Club World Cup. But over the past six months, this team has shown that they can hold their own against some of the world's best, and PSG is currently the top of that list. That is a positive sign of progress and they are only expected to get better moving forward.

Jannik Sinner has become used to having people talking about him, both in positive and negative ways.

Sinner won Wimbledon to lift his fourth Grand Slam title earlier this month, after beating rival Carlos Alcaraz in the final.

The world number one received a lot of praise for his performances at Wimbledon this year, including Sinner being told he has one shot that is the best in history.

Not all of the comments toward Sinner have been positive, and now a former Roland Garros semifinalist has called out something she has recently heard.

Before Sinner was the Grand Slam winning force that he is today, his Italian compatriot Martina Trevisan reached the semifinals of Roland Garros.

In an interview with fanpage.it, the now world number 276 Trevisan has spoken about how much she was rooting for Sinner against Alcaraz.

Trevisan also called out criticism of Sinner, as she suggested that she had heard people calling him unexciting to watch.

“Of course I watched it and I cheered for Jannik with all my heart,” said Trevisan. “He's an extraordinary guy, and you can't help but root for him, for the clean, sharp tennis he displays every time. 

“Anyone who accuses him of having an unexciting style of play has probably never picked up a racket, because watching Jannik play, recognizing how he makes even the most complex movements appear simple, is a joy for the eyes and the heart.

“And I'm not just saying this as a fan, but also as a professional who knows how certain backhand down-the-line shots are a slap in the face of the laws of physics.”

While the Wimbledon final may not have been as much of a spectacle, Sinner and Alcaraz's Roland Garros final has received high praise and been called one of the best in history.

Sinner was heartbroken against Alcaraz after the Roland Garros final, where he lost in five sets despite having three championship points.

When discussing how Sinner managed to get over his Roland Garros defeat, Trevisan praised his mental fortitude.

“Well, I believe that the best memory, the one that allowed Jannik to beat Carlos in four sets, is like a fine-meshed sieve that lets through what's useless and harmful to growth and self-improvement, while retaining what's useful and instrumental to change,” explained Trevisan. 

“It takes great courage, a determined and positive mental attitude, to transform in a month what could have been a paralyzing trauma into an extraordinary victory. 

“That's why the mind is 80%: if you're able to transform the ‘poison' of a defeat into the ‘medicine' needed for a victory, you have everything it takes to be a champion. In sports, of course, but above all in life.”

It is currently unclear when the world number one will next play a match, with Sinner already withdrawing from the Canadian Open.

Sinner is next scheduled to compete at the Cincinnati Open, which gets underway on Monday, August 4.

Tennis can't be Tennis without Balls

Venus Williams will celebrate the 25th anniversary of her maiden US Open crown returning to play Flushing Meadows.

Former world No. 1 Venus will partner good friend Reilly Opelka in next month's US Open Mixed Doubles event, the USTA announced today.

The 45-year-old Venus is set to play her first pro match in 16 months in Washington, DC this week.A quarter century ago, Venus Williams defeated Lindsay Davenport 6-4, 7-5 to capture her first US Open singles crown. Venus successfully defended the US Open in 2001 when she defeated younger sister and 1999 champion Serena Williams 6-2, 6-4 in one of the most-widely viewed US Open women's finals.Proving the couple that plays together, stays together, Australian No. 1 Alex de Minaur will partner fiancee Katie Boulter at the US Open.“Yeah, we're definitely going to be keen to try and play if they allow us to and if they want us to,” de Minaur told the media at Queen's Club last month. “If that's an option, then we'll definitely be up for it.”One of tennis' top glamor couples announced their engagement on December 23rd on social media.Earlier this season, de Minaur shared earning “big bucks” to pay for the wedding is one of his driving forces on court these days.“Realistically, what's driving me at the moment is trying to earn some big bucks for this wedding budget,” De Minaur told Tennis Channel in April. “That's the only thing on my mind—trying to win as many matches as I can, because I've started to look at venues and it's expensive. I can tell you that.”Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas, who have reportedly endeded their relationship, are no longer on the US Open Mixed Doubles entry list.Given the US Open Mixed Doubles champions will earn $1 Million for capturing the 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles crown, that could be even more motivation for de Minaur and Boulter to join forces in Flushing Meadows and cover their wedding budget.In total, 25 teams have now entered the event.The competition will take place during US Open Fan Week on Tuesday, August 19, and Wednesday, August 20, at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, with $1 Million in prize money being awarded to the winning team.Though Fan Week remains free, fans will need to buy tickets to watch the US Open Mixed Doubles.The entry window will close on July 28th at 12:00 ET, at which time the top eight teams with the best combined singles ranking at the time will officially be in the field/draw via direct acceptance.The remaining eight teams will be determined via wild card and announced on a date to follow.The entry list for the 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles Championship includes the following teams:Emma Navarro and Jannik SinnerAmanda Anisimova and Holger RuneJessica Pegula and Tommy PaulJasmine Paolini and Lorenzo MusettiElena Rybakina and Taylor FritzMirra Andreeva and Daniil MedvedevMadison Keys and Frances TiafoeAryna Sabalenka and Grigor DimitrovIga Swiatek and Casper RuudKarolina Muchova and Andrey RublevEmma Raducanu and Carlos AlcarazBelinda Bencic and Alexander ZverevOlga Danilovic and Novak DjokovicTaylor Townsend and Ben SheltonSara Errani and Andrea VavassoriNaomi Osaka and Nick KyrgiosKatie Boulter and Alex de MinaurDonna Vekic and Hubert HurkaczGaby Dabrowski and Felix Auger-AliassimeDemi Schuurs and Tallon GriekspoorKaterina Siniakova and Marcelo ArevaloDesirae Krawczyk and Evan KingSu-Wei Hsieh and Jan ZielinskiIva Jovic and Jenson BrooksbyVenus Williams and Reilly Opelka“In our initial discussions about reimagining and elevating the US Open Mixed Doubles Championship, we wanted to find a way to showcase the world's best men and women competing with and against one another, and we were confident that we would be able to get the top players in the game excited about this unique opportunity,” said Lew Sherr, CEO and Executive Director, USTA. “Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited.“It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do, and we know that the fans will love it.”

Venus Williams is paired with Reilly Opelka, and Wimbledon runner-up Amanda Anisimova is joined by Holger Rune on Monday's updated list of teams that have signed up to try to enter the newfangled U.S. Open mixed doubles tournament next month.

A total of 25 duos are on the latest entry list released by the U.S. Tennis Association. Only 16 will make the field for the Aug. 19-20 competition that will pay the winning team $1 million.

The deadline for entries is a week away. That's when the eight duos with the highest combined singles rankings will gain official acceptance for the event.

The USTA will select the other eight teams and give them wild-card invitations.

The mixed doubles was moved to the week before the start of competition in the singles brackets. Singles matches begin on Aug. 24.

In addition to Williams — a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion who is 45 and entered the tournament in Washington this week for her first competition in more than a year — with Opelka, and Anisimova with Rune, other new teammates announced Monday include Katie Boulter and Alex De Minaur, who are engaged to be married; Donna Vekic and Hubert Hurkacz; Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev; Iva Jovic and Jenson Brooksby; Gaby Dabrowski and Felix Auger-Aliassime; Demi Schuurs and Tallon Griekspoor; Katerina Siniakova and Marcelo Arevalo; Desirae Krawczyk and Evan King; and Su-Wei Hsieh and Jan Zielinski.

The original group of potential participants was released last month and included Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz; Emma Navarro and Jannik Sinner; Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud; Jasmine Paolini and Lorenzo Musetti; Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz; Belinda Bencic and Alexander Zverev; Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev; Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe; Jessica Pegula and Tommy Paul; Aryna Sabalenka and Grigor Dimitrov; Olga Danilovic and Novak Djokovic; Naomi Osaka and Nick Kyrgios; Taylor Townsend and Ben Shelton; and last year's U.S. Open mixed doubles champions, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori.

It's a star-studded cast that is quite different from the mix of doubles specialists usually found in a Grand Slam mixed doubles bracket. Some criticized the changes when they were announced in February, with Errani and Vavassori calling the new format a “pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show” that would shut out true doubles players.

The total number of ATP points a tennis player has does not always translate to tournaments won.

This point is particularly relevant when considering the successes of both Lorenzo Musetti and Ben Shelton. 

Ranked seven and eight in the world respectively, they have both enjoyed extremely successful careers to date, having both reached Grand Slam semi-finals and made significant inroads at ATP Masters 1000 events.

There can be little doubt that these two players have achieved great things on the ATP Tour, and will likely continue to do so.

However, there is one lesser-known player, ranked 45 in the world, who has overtaken both Musetti and Shelton for ATP tournaments won.

Luciano Darderi, aged 23 years, defeated Jesper de Jong on Sunday afternoon to win the Bastad Open, an ATP 250 event.

Darderi, who has a perfect record in ATP Tour finals, defeated the Dutchman 6-4 3-6 6-3 in Sweden. The Italian also won the Cordoba Open in 2024 and the Marrakech Open earlier in 2025.

Despite his low ranking compared to compatriot Lorenzo Musetti and American Ben Shelton, Darderi has now won more ATP Tour tournaments than the two top 10 players.

Musetti also holds a 100 per cent record in finals. However, these titles both came in 2022, in Naples and Hamburg.

As for Shelton, the American world number eight won the Tokyo Open in 2023 before capturing the 2024 Houston Open.

Despite their relatively small number of ATP Tour titles, both Musetti and Shelton have enjoyed impressive 2025 campaigns so far, with Shelton reaching the Australian Open semi-finals and Musetti reaching the same stage of the French Open.

Matt Roberts, a tennis journalist who co-hosts The Tennis Podcast with Catherine Whitaker and David Law, weighed in on Darderi overtaking Musetti.

Speaking on The Tennis Podcast, Roberts said: “He is now in the top 50. He has now won three career titles, which is more than Musetti, which is rather, you know… stops you in your tracks.

“I mean, Musetti definitely needs to close some more tournaments and he's obviously had bigger success generally, but three tour-level titles is no joke.

“Darderi is very, very good. Especially on clay.”

Are the stars and stripes aligned for another American champion in the nation's capital?


After Sebastian Korda snapped a 17-year drought for home champions at the Mubadala Citi DC Open last year, the red, white and blue tide is in full force for this year's edition. Taylor Fritz leads the Americans in the field, while Ben Shelton and local hero Frances Tiafoe are also among those aiming to join the list of 12 different Americans who have lifted the trophy since the tournament began in 1969.




Nobody owned the capital quite like Andre Agassi. Across 10 visits in the ‘90s, he racked up as many titles as losses — five of each — cementing his dominance in the sweltering summer heat with a record haul, including a victory as World No. 1 in 1995. Michael Chang enjoyed a reign in the winner's circle sandwiched in between Agassi's ‘95 and ‘98 titles. Chang, former No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, was crowned champion in back-to-back years, ‘96 and ‘97.


At the turn of the century, young Americans such as Andy Roddick and James Blake took the baton. An 18-year-old Roddick became the youngest champion in tournament history in 2001. That season alone, Roddick claimed an American tri-fecta of sorts, capturing his first tour-level title in Atlanta, then adding to that count in Houston and in Washington, D.C, where in the championship match the teenager beat Sjeng Schalken — the Dutchman whom Roddick helped escape a hotel fire three years later in Rome. 


Roddick returned to the winner's circle in the nation's capital in 2005 and 2007, the latter of which marked the last time an American triumphed in Washington until Korda's title last season. In ‘05, Roddick spoiled countryman Blake's quest for a second D.C. title.

Blake won his first tour-level trophy there in 2002 and upon clinching championship point, the-then 22-year-old dropped his racquet in relief and leaped with ecstatic joy. Blake's pure enthusiasm spilled over as he celebrated with his team, and the New York native said post match that he almost knocked over his mom in a joyful courtside hug.


The fourth-longest running professional tennis event in the United States, the Mubadala Citi DC Open celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018 and has continued to thrive at the original location Fitzgerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park. The venue, nestled in one of D.C.'s most inclusive neighborhoods, was chosen at the request of Arthur Ashe, who partnered Donald Dell and John A. Harris to launch the tournament in 1969. Four years after the inaugural edition, Ashe himself won the title.




Held on clay courts until 1986, the event's deep roots and rich history have made it a favourite stop for some of the sport's biggest names. American icon Jimmy Connors brought his signature fire and flair to Washington, delivering his own brand of summer entertainment. He captured three titles in the capital, including two while holding No. 1 honours (1976, 1978). A decade separated his second and third title run, with Connors returning to the winner's circle once more in 1988.


It was during that era when another star made his mark in Washington. Ivan Lendl, the Czech-American who competed under the U.S. flag later in his career, lifted the trophy twice in the 1980s. In both finals, Lendl took out an American: Jimmy Arias in ‘82 and Brad Gilbert in ‘87.


Staying on the theme of Czech-American success, last year featured a full-circle moment for Florida-native Korda and his father Petr Korda. The current No. 32 in the PIF ATP Rankings, ‘Sebi' Korda, captured his biggest career title at the ATP 500, matching his father's 1992 triumph. The Kordas became the first father-son duo to win the same title in ATP Tour history.


Now, a strong squad of home hopes look to build on the American legacy in D.C. this year. Perhaps nobody wants to win this tournament more than DMV's own Tiafoe, who has lost to the eventual champion the past three years. Fritz is aiming for his first ATP 500 crown since 2022. Shelton is seeking his first title of the year.

Following the Washington Open, the first ATP Masters 1000 event of the North American hard-court swing will get underway. 

So far, several big names have already pulled out of the tournament, including Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. 

Jack Draper also withdrew, citing a left-arm injury he sustained during his Wimbledon campaign, which ended in the second round. 

While many will now have a golden opportunity to boost their rankings in Toronto, one star will see their tennis journey come to an end. 

In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Vasek Pospisil announced his tennis career will finish in Toronto. 

Pospisil said: “Eighteen years of professional tennis. Looking forward to playing in front of you one last time in Toronto”

The Canadian will play for one final time in front of his home crowd, who have never seen a star from their country emerge victorious at the event. 

Milos Raonic came close in 2013, reaching the final before losing to Rafael Nadal, who won the tournament for a third time.

Pospisil reached the Wimbledon quarter-final in 2015, where he lost to former champion Andy Murray in straight sets. 

A year prior, however, he won the doubles title at the All England Club alongside his partner Jack Sock.

In 2015 and 2016, Pospisil made it to the quarter-finals in doubles at Roland Garros and the Australian Open, respectively. 

He reached a career high singles ranking of 25 and a doubles peak of fourth in the world.

LONDON (AP) — Wimbledon's expansion plans, which would almost triple the size of the tennis tournament grounds, received a boost Monday when a judge dismissed a campaign group's legal challenge.The Save Wimbledon Park group took legal action against the Greater London Authority's decision to grant planning permission last year.Aside from concerns about the environment and overall scale, opponents argued that the adjacent property that was a golf course when the All England Club bought it in 2018 is subject to restrictions that favor preservation of open spaces for the public.Read More: • Wimbledon's plans for expansion approved by London authorities despite residents' concerns • Wimbledon plans to upgrade the fans' favorite hill for 150th anniversaryWimbledon's plan includes adding an 8,000-seat stadium with a retractable roof and 38 other grass courts that would allow the All England Club to move its qualifying event on-site to boost attendance and revenue."In short, the defendant's decision on the relevance of deliverability, applying to both the statutory trust and the restrictive covenants, was a planning judgment rationally exercised and having regard to appropriate and relevant factors," judge Justice Saini said.

Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam tournament that holds its qualifying rounds at a completely separate location. There are also too few practice courts in the current setup, requiring some of the world's best players to share courts."We are delighted that Mr. Justice Saini has dismissed the challenge to the GLA's decision to grant planning permission for our plans to transform the former Wimbledon Park golf course," said Deborah Jevans, chair of the All England Club."It is clear that we have a robust planning permission that enables us to create a permanent home for the Wimbledon qualifying competition as well as delivering 27 acres of beautiful new park land for local people, providing public access to land that has been a private golf course for over 100 years," Jevans added.The next hurdle in the process is a hearing in January over whether there is a statutory trust over the former golf course land.

TORONTO (AP) — Vasek Pospisil, who won a Wimbledon men's doubles title and helped Canada win the Davis Cup, will retire from tennis after playing in the Toronto tournament next week."Eighteen years of professional tennis. Looking forward to playing in front of you one last time in Toronto," the 35-year-old Pospisil posted Monday on social media.Pospisil has been an advocate for players on the tours and joined with Novak Djokovic to form the Professional Tennis Players' Association, which filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court in New York against some of the groups running the sport.Read More: Why did Novak Djokovic's players' association sue the groups that run tennis, and what do they want?On the court, Pospisil paired with Jack Sock to earn a Wimbledon championship in 2014 and was part of the Canadian team that won the Davis Cup title in 2022. Pospisil reached career-high rankings of No. 4 in doubles and No. 25 in singles.The hard-court Masters event in Canada awarded Pospisil a wild-card entry."It's never easy making a decision like this," he said. "Tennis has been a huge part of my life, but it has become clear, both mentally and physically, that it's the right time to step away."

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are the two dominant forces on the ATP Tour in 2025.

Sinner has just won the Wimbledon title, beating Alcaraz in the final to confirm that they have now shared the last seven consecutive Grand Slam titles.

The last man not called Sinner or Alcaraz to win a Grand Slam singles title was Novak Djokovic, who won the 2023 US Open.

However, with Djokovic now moving closer to retirement, another ATP player has made his claim as a potential contender to the dominant duo of Sinner and Alcaraz.

That player is world number nine Holger Rune, who lost in the first round of Wimbledon this year.

Since then, Rune has been spotted working with Andre Agassi ahead of his return to the matchcourt at the Washington Open.

When speaking to Tennis.com ahead of the ATP 500 tournament, Rune was asked how far he thinks he is away from the level of Sinner and Alcaraz.

While claiming that some players were still very far away, Rune suggested that his top level is actually not that distant from Sinner and Alcaraz, highlighting how consistent they are as the big difference.

“I think [the gap] is very distant for some, but for some others, they're not that far away,” said Rune. “I'm going to include myself when I say we're not that far away. 

“I see my high end of tennis to be really, really high, so I just have to lift the button, really, and stay more consistent to win more matches. I do need to stop feeling like I need to play spectacular tennis all the time to beat them.”

A post shared by Holger Vitus Nødskov Rune (@holgerrune)

As Rune continued to show confidence in his own ability, the Dane admitted that he was not satisfied just being a top 10 player and instead wanted to reach the summit of the ATP rankings.

“It all comes down to what you want. If you're happy to stick around and be No. 5, 10, 15, or 20 in the world, some players can do that without doing more,” explained the 22-year-old. 

“That's not really my goal. My goal was always to be No. 1; it still is, and I believe I can do it. I also believe there's a few things I need to do differently. That's one of the reasons why I reached out to Andre, to hear his point of view.

“It obviously does help my confidence to know I've shown a level that can beat Carlos, Jannik, and Novak. That helps the belief, of course. On the other hand, there's a difference between just beating them and making it into those big finals week in, week out. That's one of my goals now.”

Rune was once seen as Sinner and Alcaraz's biggest contender, with suggestions of a new ‘big three' being thrown around.

However, he has been unable to get anywhere near his rivals so far, having won a quarter of their number of titles.

Rune did beat Alcaraz earlier this year to win the Barcelona Open, but his Spanish opponent was physically hampered in that match.

Backing up Rune's previous claim, his biggest career success to date came when he won the Paris Masters title as a teenager in 2022, showing that his top level is very high.

Rune will be hoping to justify his claim once again at the Washington Open, where he is the third seed.

At the Wimbledon post-tournament party, ‘The Champions' Dinner', Iga Swiatek, the winner of women's title, bedazzled in a lilac Stella McCartney gown that was reportedly worth over $2,000 (approximately Rs 1.7 lakh). But who dresses the Wimbledon champions? 

Town And Country magazine reports that the styling is done by Elisabeth Piner, the stylist and owner of ‘Having a ball dress hire', a company that rents out dresses for formal affairs. She sets up a full-service salon inside centre court in an empty space across the hall from the ladies' locker room. 

“We've got everything, we kit them out from top to toe,” Piner told Town And Country. She and her team reached the club at 8 am on the morning of the ball, “with a car full of hundreds of dresses in multiple sizes; 50 to 60 pairs of shoes; jewellery including diamonds and colored stones; and an assortment of handbags”, the magazine reported. The Champions' Dinner is held at the lavish Raffles London. 

“Because we don't know who will win the tournament we choose styles that perhaps can be flexible, perhaps they have a lace up back or are more or less an average size,” she says. “The jewellery is easier because it's one size. We try to choose items that are just glamorous and ready to compliment the dresses … Most of the footwear and accessories are carefully selected for comfort, elegance, and reliability under pressure,” she said. “The jewellery ranges from contemporary pieces to vintage-inspired.” The magazine noted that she ‘ also tries to guess which players are most likely to make it to the finals and gather looks that might suit their individual styles'.
 
“The room is totally transformed into a glamorous, lovely boutique with all these wonderful dresses,” Piner said. “It's a tennis locker room with rails of silk and sparkle.”

Wimbledon doesn't offer this kind of service to the men's winners, letting their individual sponsor attire them. Sinner had worn a custom dark Gucci suit, with signature loafers. 

Sinner and Iga would dance, though it wasn't initially part of the plan. “Yes I mean we were there and, in the beginning, they told us that because it was quite late that we don't have to do it and then Iga told me, no, no, let's do it and I was like OK,” said Sinner. “Its a tradition. So it's good to make that happen. And yea it was nice to share that moment with Iga. And it's yeah, a beautiful moment,” Sinner shared later with BBC Sport. 

On the ‘Nothing Major' podcast, the American tennis player Sam Querrey shared more details from the night. 

“It's in the city. At that hour, there is no traffic, so it's like 25 minutes. They have a cocktail party, and then you go down to the dinner, where it's set up beautifully. Laura Robson hosted, and she went up and gave a speech. You have some appetisers, and then Iga showed up at 10:30 pm.

“She came in, and you stand up. They made this cool video up on the Jumbotron. She holds up her trophy, and then you sit down.“Sinner came at 00:05. I did not care, but he was just in the back hammering drinks with his team, having a good time. He came out with the trophy, and at some point, Laura Robson brought them both on stage. She does a Q&A with Iga and Jannik pretty quickly. And there was a rumour they were not going to have to dance, and the crowd peer pressured them into dancing.“It was good, though. Jannik did a good job; he was feeling good and made it really fun. He started twirling Iga, and then 45 seconds in, they were done dancing and went back to the table … You had unbelievable food, wine,” Querrey shared.

The plans include 38 new tennis courts and a new 8,000-seat stadium

Plans to almost triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site are set to proceed after a campaign group's legal challenge against the decision to approve the proposals was dismissed by a High Court judge.

The proposals, submitted by the All England Club, would see the construction of 38 new tennis courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on the grounds of the former Wimbledon Park Golf Club, which would allow it to host Wimbledon qualifiers on site.

Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) took legal action against the Greater London Authority's (GLA) decision to grant planning permission last year.

Barristers for SWP told the High Court earlier this month that the decision to approve the plans was “irrational” and should be quashed, as Wimbledon Park – a Grade II*-listed heritage site partly designed by Lancelot “Capability” Brown – was covered by restrictions on how it could be used.

The GLA and the All England Club defended the challenge, with the court told that the decision was a “planning judgment properly exercised” and that the restrictions were not “material”.

In a ruling on Monday, Mr Justice Saini dismissed the challenge.

He said: “In short, the defendant's decision on the relevance of deliverability, applying to both the statutory trust and the restrictive covenants, was a planning judgment rationally exercised and having regard to appropriate and relevant factors.”

The proposals would see seven maintenance buildings, access points, and an area of parkland with permissive public access constructed, in addition to the courts and associated infrastructure.

They would also include work on Wimbledon Lake, which would involve building a boardwalk around and across it.

After Merton Council approved the plans, but Wandsworth Council rejected them, the Mayor of London's office took charge of the application, but Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan recused himself from the process after previously expressing public support for the development.

Planning permission for the scheme was granted by Jules Pipe, London's deputy mayor for planning, who said that the proposals “would facilitate very significant benefits” which “clearly outweigh the harm”.

Debbie Jevans, chair of the All England Club, said at the time that the proposals would deliver 27 acres of “newly accessible parkland for the community”, and would allow the qualifying tournament for Wimbledon – currently staged at Roehampton – to be held on site.

In written submissions, Sasha White KC said that the All England Club acquired the freehold for the golf course in 1993 and the leasehold in 2021.

The barrister told the two-day hearing in London that the land was subject to a “statutory trust requiring it to be kept available for public recreation use” and that when the freehold was acquired, the club entered into “restrictive covenants” governing its use.

He said this meant any plans could not “restrict its use so as not to impair the appreciation of the general public of the extent or openness of the golf course land”.

He continued that separate High Court proceedings were ongoing over whether a statutory trust existed, and that if it does, the All England Club has “accepted” that this is “incompatible with the development of the proposal”.

In court, he said: “You could not have a more protected piece of land within the planning system, frankly.”

Mark Westmoreland Smith KC, for the GLA, said in written submissions that Mr Pipe received “detailed advice” over the “relevance” of the “alleged” trust and covenants, and made his decision on the assumption that they existed.

The barrister said that the decision was a “planning judgment properly exercised and having regard to the appropriate and relevant factors”.

He said: “Officers advised that the alleged obstacle that they may present to delivery of the development was not itself a material consideration which should weigh against the grant of planning permission.”

In his written arguments, Russell Harris KC, for the All England Club, said that planning officers “acknowledged and had regard to” the trust and covenants, but deemed they were not “material”.

Lois Boisson breaks into the Top 50, Irina-Camelia Begu wins at home and rising teenagers Tereza Valentova and Petra Marcinko headline a week of momentum-shifting results.

The post-Wimbledon stretch of scenic European clay-court WTA 250 events has traditionally been sites of breakthroughs and rebounds, and this year was no different. In Hamburg, Lois Boisson captured her first Hologic WTA Tour trophy, while Irina-Camelia Begu delighted the Romanian crowd in Iasi by taking the title on home soil.

Boisson put together one of the summer's notable underdog stories when, as a wild card competing in just her second tour-level event, she thrilled the French fans at Roland Garros by reaching the semifinals. In her third tour-level event, the 22-year-old showed that was no one-off performance by going all the way to the title.

Six weeks ago, Boisson broke into the Top 100 for the first time. In this week's edition of the PIF WTA Rankings, she makes her Top 50 debut with a 19-place jump from No. 63 to No. 44.

By contrast to Boisson's sudden burst on to the scene, Begu has been a tour mainstay for nearly a decade and a half. The 34-year-old cracked the Top 10 in April 2011 after reaching her first WTA final in Marbella. A year later, she collected her maiden title in Tashkent. Last week, she went into Iasi winning just two out of 11 tour-level matches in 2025 -- and emerged with her sixth career title, and first since Palermo 2022.

Begu became the first Romanian champion on home soil since her own title run at Bucharest 2017 and returns to the Top 100 for the first time since May with a 28-place leap from No. 110 to No. 82.

Finalists Bondar, Teichmann also boosted

Last year, Anna Bondar picked up her second career WTA 125 title in Hamburg. Twelve months on, with the event back at WTA 250 level, the Hungarian continued her strong form in the city by reaching her first tour-level final. Bondar's run included her second career Top 20 win, over No. 1 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova in the quarterfinals. Her loss to Boisson in the final continued an unusual pattern at the tournament: in 2024, Bondar had herself dethroned the previous year's champion, Arantxa Rus, in the title match.

Bondar's strong clay-court form in recent months also included the Wiesbaden ITF W100 title in April and a run to the Bari WTA 125 final in June. She climbs 18 places this week from No. 77 to No. 59, nine places below the career high of No. 50 that she set in July 2022.

Iasi runner-up Jil Teichmann snapped a four-year drought by reaching her first tour-level final since Cincinnati 2021, and fifth overall. Having slumped out of the Top 100 in 2023, the Swiss former No. 21 has re-embedded herself there this year. Also a champion at the Mumbai WTA 125 in February, Teichmann is up 22 spots from No. 102 to No. 80 this week.

Teenage talents Valentova, Marcinko thrive in WTA 125 events

Last week saw a teenage sweep of WTA 125 titles by former junior Slam champions, with 18-year-old Tereza Valentova triumphing on the hard courts of Porto and 19-year-old Petra Marcinko lifting the trophy on the clay courts of Rome.

Valentova didn't drop a set all week, conceding just 23 games across five matches en route to the title, a continuation of her standout season. The Czech has compiled a 36-8 record in 2025, going 16-2 over her past four tournaments, a stretch that includes two WTA 125 titles and a run to the second round of Roland Garros as a qualifier. After ending 2024 ranked No. 261, she's now just outside the Top 100, jumping 23 spots this week to a new career high of No. 106.

Marcinko, the 2022 Australian Open junior champion, has already experienced a significant rise and fall in her career. The Croatian reached her previous career high of No. 132 back in October 2023, only to fall out of the Top 300 a year later after an injury-struck 2024.

However, she's been rounding into form at WTA 125 level in recent weeks, reaching the semifinals in Grado and Contrexéville over the past month. Marcinko's first WTA 125 trophy means she sets a new career high, rocketing 38 places to No. 131.

Dayana Yastremska, +6 to No. 33: In Hamburg, the Ukrainian reached her third semifinal of the year, and first on clay since the same tournament in 2021.

Dalma Galfi, +9 to No. 102: Hungary's Galfi reached her first tour-level quarterfinal in 13 months in Hamburg.

Talia Gibson, +11 to No. 111: The 21-year-old Australian won her second ITF title of the year at last week's Granby W75, and hits a new career high.

Zhang Shuai, +8 to No. 112: Zhang, 36, won last week's Nottingham ITF W50 without dropping a set.

Sorana Cirstea, +29 to No. 137: Former No. 21 Cirstea, 35, reached the Iasi semifinals on home soil -- her first tour-level semifinal since Dubai 2024.

Panna Udvardy, +12 to No. 138: The Hungarian reached the last eight in Iasi -- her second career tour-level quarterfinal, and first since Budapest 2021.

Oksana Selekhmeteva, +25 to No. 143: The 22-year-old reached her first WTA 125 final in Rome, and is just five places beneath the career high of No. 138 that she set in 2022.

Kaja Juvan, +41 to No. 166: After a 12-month hiatus due to a shoulder nerve issue in 2024, former No. 58 Juvan's comeback is gaining momentum. The Slovenian reached her first tour-level semifinal since Strasbourg 2022 in Hamburg last week.

Lanlana Tararudee, +20 to No. 167: Tararudee, 21, reached her first career WTA 125 final last week in Porto, and is one place beneath her career high of No. 166.

Linda Klimovicova, +31 to No. 181: The 21-year-old Polish player reaches a new career high after winning her first ITF W75 title last week in Vitoria-Gasteiz.

Ana Sofia Sánchez, +36 to No. 190: At the age of 31, Sánchez captured the first ITF W75 title of her career last week in Olomouc and makes her Top 200 debut as a result. The Mexican made her WTA main-draw debut as a wild card at Monterrey 2013.

Justina Mikulskyte, +15 to No. 199: Mikulskyte, 29, also makes her Top 200 debut after reaching the first ITF W75 final of her career in Vitoria-Gasteiz. She becomes the second Lithuanian to reach the WTA Top 200 following Lina Stanciute, who peaked at No. 197 in 2009.

Nastasja Schunk, +21 to No. 267: Schunk, the 2021 Wimbledon junior finalist, won the first WTA main draw match of her career last week in Hamburg. The 21-year-old German reached a career high of No. 143 in 2022 before being set back by injury.

Caroline Werner, +32 to No. 271: At the age of 29, Werner qualified for her first WTA main draw on home soil in Hamburg and reached the second round.

Anna Siskova, +77 to No. 328: Siskova notched her second career Top 100 win over Ann Li to reach her first WTA quarterfinal in Iasi as a qualifier. The 24-year-old Czech's season record is now 37-8.

Fiona Crawley, +67 to No. 344: University of North Carolina alumna Crawley, 23, reached her first career ITF W75 final last week in Granby and climbs to a new career high.

Katie Swan, +266 to No. 474: Following a nine-month injury hiatus, former No. 118 Swan returned to action in April this year. The 26-year-old Briton put together an eight-match winning streak over the past two weeks, winning the Don Benito ITF W35 event then reaching the Vitoria-Gasteiz ITF W75 semifinals.

Giulia Safina Popa, +346 to No. 879: As a qualifying wild card in Iasi, 15-year-old Popa notched her first career Top 200 win over Andrea Lazaro Garcia en route to qualifying for her first WTA main draw. The Romanian was the Les Petits As runner-up in 2023.

Barbara Kostecka, UNR to No. 1,065: Playing just her second pro tournament, Polish 16-year-old Kostecka claimed the title two weeks ago at the Grodzisk Mazowiecki ITF W15.

Lois Boisson breaks into the Top 50, Irina-Camelia Begu wins at home and rising teenagers Tereza Valentova and Petra Marcinko headline a week of momentum-shifting results.

The field at the Toronto Open is looking a little sparse this year, with some of the top-seeded male players withdrawing ahead of the tournament.

On Sunday, it was reported that Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic and Jack Draper withdrew from the tournament for various reasons.

This means four of the top six-ranked ATP players will not compete in Toronto, leaving Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz as the top seeds.

Draper has revealed a new injury to his left arm, while Sinner has said he needs to ‘prioritise' his health. After the Wimbledon final, Alcaraz said he would prioritise rest and listen to his body.

The exodus has been simply shocking. The absence of these players will leave a massive hole at the tournament, while disappointing fans who may have travelled far to watch their favourite players perform.

A number of players have discussed the issue of burnout on the ATP Tour, complaining about a packed ATP Tour schedule. In the last year, Carlos Alcaraz, Alex de Minaur and Alexander Zverev have all commented on the matter.

World number 10 Andrey Rublev also admitted he had been struggling with depression in recent years, and had utilised antidepressants for a year. Former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic has also noted an issue with antidepressants on tour.

Earlier in July, Novak Djokovic spoke about the issue, and he has been proven entirely correct after the mass withdrawals from Toronto.

Speaking to Sport Klub's Sasa Ozmo at the start of July, Djokovic conveyed his thoughts regarding players feeling burnt out or turning to antidepressants.

Djokovic said: “The first thing that comes to mind is that social media is extremely present and largely dictates the mood and daily rhythm of an athlete – especially young ones, but older ones too. 

“Everyone is on social media, and you can get lost there, get too attached to comments, to what someone types on a keyboard or phone… and that hurts. It's not trivial. That's something we need to talk about seriously.”

I asked Novak #Djokovic why so many tennis players feel burnt out or turn to antidepressants: 1️⃣ “The first thing that comes to mind is that social media is extremely present and largely dictates the mood and daily rhythm of an athlete — especially young ones, but older ones…

“There are various other factors. The fact is, in my opinion, that kids are pushed too early into strict professionalism, before they've developed emotional intelligence, which is part of psychological preparation for life. 

“When a talent is spotted, they push them professionally — just play, play, play — and then all sorts of agents latch on, those with interest in success, and they push the player to play as much as possible so they earn more. 

“It's a vicious circle, and if a player gets a bit lost in that, it can strongly affect their psyche and how they live their life.

“Tennis has the longest season of all global sports. For most who play the full schedule, it's from January 1 to late November. 

“Other sports have more competitions now too, but tennis is individual — there are no substitutes, no ‘I don't feel good today, can you sub in for me for five minutes so I can rest'… Here, every point matters, every day matters. 

“If you want to reach the highest heights, you have to transform your entire life in service of tennis and sport. You lose yourself, it's too big of a bite for most.”

It is worth noting that Djokovic himself has withdrawn from Toronto. However, this must be put into context as he is reaching the twilight of his career and has a legitimate reason to prioritise certain events over others in order to extend his career.

On Sunday, 18-time Grand Slam winner Chris Evert weighed in on Djokovic's comments from earlier in July.

Evert noted that Djokovic's summary of the burnout and antidepressant situation was a ‘tremendous answer.'

It remains to be seen if any other top ATP players will withdraw from Toronto. However, the schedule has clearly become an issue for many players.

Tremendous answer…👍 https://t.co/3TM5yU2SGt

If fans are often left wanting due to the consistent withdrawal of players from major tournaments, then a rethink of the schedule may be in order.

Dan Evans, former British number one, hit out at those complaining about the tour schedule when speaking to the BBC at the 2025 Queen's Club Championships.

He said: “I think first and foremost we're in a fortunate position.

“When I hear about the schedule [complaints], these guys don't have to play every week. You are allowed to not play. The reason they play is so they pick up their bonus pool.”

After beating Frances Tiafoe in the first round, he added: “Everybody is entitled to their opinion on the schedule, but the tour has been like that for however many years.

“The top, top guys schedule properly, and that's, you know, that's I guess what's part of the issue, I imagine, is how people schedule how many weeks they want to play, how many weeks they don't want to play.

“Me personally, I see the weeks before Grand Slams are way stronger than they were maybe ten years ago. There is more top players playing. I don't know if that's to try and pick up cheap points, but, you know, there are these massive teams now.

“They are allowed to have some input into it. There are loads of weeks in the year you can take off or train or whatnot. That's up to them.

“Anybody outside the top 15 don't have those views, because the bottom line is anybody outside the top 15 need to play every week. People need working opportunities. If you are at 60 in the world with more than two people on your staff each week, you need to make money.

“So you can't just not have tournaments every week. They need tournaments. That's it. Can't just listen to the top guys on scheduling. Just because they are better than us at tennis doesn't mean their voice is louder to talk.

“That's what I'll say. I'm more than happy to have the conversation with whoever wants it.”

The factor of exhibition matches must also be acknowledged. Players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have found time to compete in exhibition events in the last year, then later withdrawing from tour events.

This raises the matter of the players' prioritisation of their own schedule before taking issue with the ATP Tour schedule. Andrea Gaudenzi, Executive Chairman of the ATP Tour, discussed this matter in December 2024.

The latest edition of the ATP Rankings is out, and Novak Djokovic has reached yet another remarkable milestone.

Djokovic, who was beaten by Jannik Sinner in the Wimbledon semi-finals in his most recent match, has entered his 900th week in the top 10 of the rankings.

The Serbian, currently ranked sixth, holds the record for the most weeks spent as the ATP world No 1 with 428.

The only men to hold a position in the top 10 for more weeks than Djokovic are his greatest rivals: Roger Federer (968) and Rafael Nadal (912).

Djokovic is currently on a streak of 345 straight weeks in the top 10 — a run that began in July 2018. The 38-year-old amassed his other 555 weeks as a top 10 player consecutively between March 2007 and November 2017.

In the week after Wimbledon, there were ATP 250 tournaments in Los Cabos (hard-court), Bastad and Gstaad (both clay).

Andrey Rublev (Los Cabos), Casper Ruud (Gstaad) and Francisco Cerundolo (Bastad) were the only top 20 players in action, but none went beyond the semi-finals at their respective events.

Former world No 10 Denis Shapovalov has jumped five places from 33rd to 28th after defeating Aleksandar Kovacevic in the Los Cabos final. Kovacevic has climbed from 76th to 66th.

Tim Henman makes ‘unfair' claim as he reflects on dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz

Alexander Bublik was the champion in Gstaad, where he overcame Juan Manuel Cerundolo in the championship match. Bublik has moved up four places to 30th, while Cerdundolo has surged 28 spots to 81st — two below his career-high of 79th.

At the Swedish Open, Luciano Darderi saw off Jesper de Jong, a triumph that has lifted him from 55th to 46th. For reaching his first ATP final, de Jong has been rewarded with a new career-high ranking of 83rd (+23 from 106th).

Ben Shelton has reached a new career-best of world No 8 despite not playing last week as Holger Rune has fallen to ninth after losing the points from his Hamburg Open quarter-final run in 2024.

Arthur Fils has fallen out of the top 20, sliding from 15th to 21st, as he has dropped the 500 points from his Hamburg title last year. Zverev, who was a 2024 Hamburg runner-up, has lost 280 points but remains the world No 3.

1) Jannik Sinner, 12,030
2) Carlos Alcaraz, 8,600
3) Alexander Zverev, 6,030
4) Taylor Fritz, 5,035
5) Jack Draper, 4,650
6) Novak Djokovic, 4,130
7) Lorenzo Musetti, 3,350
8) Ben Shelton, 3,330 (+1)

Holger Rune hopes he can elevate his game after receiving advice from his new mentor, Andre Agassi. 

The Danish world No.8 was recently spotted having a hitting practice under the watchful eye of Agassi, who won 17 Masters 1000 and eight Grand Slam titles during his career. The collaboration aims to provide a sort of mentorship for Rune instead of a coach. Leading up to this week, the duo held a three-day training block. 

“I reached out to him some months ago,” Rune told tennis.com. “He's an amazing man, first of all, and he's very wise, as well. He sees the game in a unique way that I've never experienced before.”

“I thought now was a good moment to reach out to Agassi because my base is back and I'm playing well again. When you're changing coaches a lot, you don't play as well because you're not following one opinion or a single structure. I thought this was the right time to get some extra input…It's not anything magic, but he obviously had some very wise words I can use.”

Rune is hoping to bounce back in North America after a disappointing grass-court swing. At Wimbledon, he suffered a shock first round loss to Chile's Nicolas Jarry, who prevailed in five sets. He performed better at Queen's with a run to the quarter-finals before losing to Roberto Bautista Agut. Overall, his win-loss record for the season currently stands at 22-14 and he has won one title in Barcelona. 

As to why he approached Agassi, Rune explained that he had studied the American's game via YouTube and wanted a view to coincide with that of his current coach, Lars Christensen.

“Right now, I'm No. 8 in the world, and anything that can help me get higher in the rankings, I'm happy to hear and listen,” he said.

“I obviously have big potential and I know I can do a lot better. He was trying to help me achieve that. We're still in contact and everything, so those three days were a kind of beginning of feeling things out, him giving me some advice, and me trying to do it on the court to see how it feels. It was just very exciting to see his point of view.”

The 22-year-old has high aspirations for the future, and the hope is that Agassi will help him along the way. So far in his career, he has been ranked as high as fourth in the world and has won five ATP titles. His best results at the majors have been reaching the quarter-finals at the French Open twice and Wimbledon once. 

“If you're happy to stick around and be No. 5, 10, 15, or 20 in the world, some players can do that without doing more…My goal was always to be No. 1; it still is, and I believe I can do it,” he states.

“I also believe there's a few things I need to do differently. That's one of the reasons why I reached out to Andre, to hear his point of view.”

To reach the pinnacle of the sport, Rune needs to take on the dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who have won the last seven Grand Slams between them. 

“I think [the gap] is very distant for some, but for some others, they're not that far away,” Rune commented. “I'm going to include myself when I say we're not that far away. I see my high end of tennis to be really, really high, so I just have to lift the button, really, and stay more consistent to win more matches. I do need to stop feeling like I need to play spectacular tennis all the time to beat them.”

Rune is seeded third at this week's Citi Open.

Ivan Ljubicic, Roger Federer's ex-coach, has fired back at John McEnroe for spouting "nonsense" when he claimed that either Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz could have beaten Rafael Nadal in his prime at the French Open. McEnroe's statement came after the thrilling Roland-Garros showdown between Sinner and Alcaraz last month.

The epic five-set match saw Alcaraz, rally from two sets behind and save three Championship points to take his second French Open title and fifth major overall. Sinner, another rising star, got his revenge by outplaying Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final earlier this month, adding a fourth Grand Slam to his collection.

After the Paris clash, McEnroe told TNT Sports that with the best versions of Sinner and Alcaraz, either of them might be considered favorite against Nadal on clay, even when Nadal was in his prime.

McEnroe said: "You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now - I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Nadal on clay - you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best."

However, he isn't sure they'll break the record of most titles: "Do I think they're going to reach 20, 24 titles either one of them? No. Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible; there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen."



McEnroe recently expressed his admiration for the impressive performances of Alcaraz and Sinner, saying: "But these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen."

However, some interpreted his remarks as a slight against tennis legend Rafael Nadal, who won an incredible 14 French Open titles before retiring.

Former tennis pro Ljubicic, coach to Nadal's longtime rival Roger Federer from 2016 to 2022, took issue with McEnroe's statement.

Ljubicic said: "It was a very, very, very good final. And the drama was perfect with the match points saved. But people always exaggerate.

"John McEnroe said Nadal wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys. That's nonsense. We haven't seen the best of Alcaraz and Sinner yet. They still have a lot of room for improvement.

"But I don't think they're ahead just yet. I sometimes watch matches from 2005, 2008, 2012, 2015 [between] Roger and Rafa. That was already incredible tennis."

When Alcaraz defeated Cameron Norrie in the Wimbledon quarterfinals, McEnroe addressed his earlier comments on BBC One, seemingly backpedaling: "I made a comment during the French [Open] where I said these guys [Alcaraz and Sinner] would have a shot... I didn't say they would beat Nadal every time.

"I said the fact that you would think these two players would actually go onto the court really believing they could do it - with Nadal in his prime - it shows you how much the level of the game has changed even in a couple of years."

The winner of the other WTA event this past week in Iasi, Romania—Irina-Camelia Begu—also makes a big leap today, rising from No. 110 to No. 82. Begu, a former world No. 22, captured the sixth WTA title of her career at the clay-court stop, and her first on home soil.The winners of the three ATP events last week also make notable moves today: Denis Shapovalov returns to the Top 30 after winning in Los Cabos, rising from No. 33 to No. 28; Alexander Bublik also returns to the Top 30 after winning in Gstaad, rising from No. 34 to No. 30; and Luciano Darderi bounces back into the Top 50 after his run to the title in Bastad, rising from No. 55 to No. 46.And Ben Shelton continues his steady climb up the upper echelon of the ATP rankings, rising from No. 9 to a new career-high of No. 8. Though he didn't play any events last week, the American moves up after Holger Rune dips from No. 8 to No. 9 after not defending the points he earned in the same week last season with his run to the quarterfinals of Hamburg (which moved to May this year).There are now an impressive six American players in the Top 8 of the ATP and WTA rankings combined—two men (No. 4 Taylor Fritz and No. 8 Shelton) and four women (No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 4 Pegula, No. 7 Amanda Anisimova and No. 8 Madison Keys).

A busy opening day of ATP Washington action is scheduled. Huge-serving Reilly Opelka's attempt to find form in home conditions against the qualifier Murphy Cassone is among the matches. We here at LWOT predict all 11 contests between three articles, including Jenson Brooksby vs Yoshihito Nishioka and Cameron Norrie vs Billy Harris. Which players do you think will win?

Head-to-head: First meeting

O'Connell has struggled this season, with a 7-15 win/loss record at ATP Tour level. 21-year-old Quinn sits at a career-high ranking of No. 82 after making a breakthrough in 2025. Although O'Connell is still ranked five spots higher, I like Quinn's chances in this contest. He usually enjoys playing in front of home American crowds, and his Australian opponent will need to be much more solid than in recent months to have a chance.
Prediction: Quinn in 2

Head-to-head: First meeting

Muller is on a five-match losing streak. Drawing a qualifier ranked outside the Top 100 is a matchup he was probably happy with, but Zhukayev has played some good tennis lately. The Kazakhstani reached a maiden Grand Slam main draw at Wimbledon a few weeks ago. Muller's experience and more complete game still make him a slight favorite, but a victory for Zhukayev would not be surprising.
Prediction: Muller in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

After making a promising start on grass by making the semifinal at the Libema Open, Opelka must have been disappointed not to make a deep run at the Queen's Club, in Eastbourne, or at Wimbledon on a surface that suits him. However, fast hard courts like those in Washington also suit the massive server. Qualifier and world No. 191 Cassone will not be used to playing someone who serves that big. I doubt that the 22-year-old, inexperienced at ATP Tour level, will be able to create many break chances or stop Opelka from manufacturing chances on return.
Prediction: Opleka in 2

It started with a text message, was followed by a phone call and culminated in a three-day training block in Washington D.C. ahead of the start of the Mubadala Citi DC Open.

World No. 8 Holger Rune, looking for an edge coming into the pivotal US summer hard-court swing, reached out to Andre Agassi to help hone his game at the very venue at which the two-time US Open champion won five of his 60 career titles.

“It was nice. We've been in touch for a while and we did a couple of days together here in Washington, where he was helping me with a few things, giving his opinion,” said the 22-year-old Dane, who will open his Washington campaign against Frenchman Alexandre Muller or a qualifier.

“It was really a big pleasure. He's a very, very wise man. I've never met a guy who sees the game this way.”

Rune said that despite the short partnership, he feels that he emerged stronger for it.

“Obviously he had an amazing return himself and I also return well and he had a few tips there and how I can be slightly better there and then in general about the game,” he said. 

“It was a really short period but definitely he gave me an insight of where he sees me in the future, where he sees me now and obviously there's a lot of things to improve. He helped me to get my focus and my eyes on the right things, together with my coach Lars [Christensen]. It was really cool to spend some days with him.

“I've watched a lot of him on YouTube and his style and the way of playing was amazing. His career speaks for itself.”

Asked if he might collab with Agassi in the future, the former World No. 4 said, “He's a great man, so I would definitely like that.”








Rune is 13th in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin after going 22-14 through Wimbledon. He defeated Carlos Alcaraz to win the ATP 500 title in Barcelona and reached the ATP Masters 1000 final in Indian Wells  (l. to Draper). But there have also been six opening-round losses this season, including in his last start at Wimbledon, where he fell in five sets to Nicolas Jarry.

“I've had a little bit of an up-and-down down year,” he said. ”I've had some good weeks, some bad weeks and that's what I'm trying to change. I'm thankful to be here in Washington to be able to start my US swing earlier to get matches and to get the rhythm and hopefully do some damage.

“I'm already thinking about Turin with the big weeks coming ahead. It's a golden swing for me in which I don't have a lot of points to defend.”

Rune has a 161-99 career record according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He has split four Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings with Alcaraz and has won two of five meetings with Jannik Sinner, but has watched on as the game's dominant duo has shared the past  seven Grand Slam titles, while he is yet to contest a major final.

“There is definitely a gap at the moment,” he said. “Obviously there are players including myself that can beat them. But it's all about being in those Grand Slam finals and those Masters 1000 finals playing against them and I think there is space for one more person.”

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

The ATP Mubadala Citi Open in Washington, D.C. is one of the first events leading into US Open and forming the North American hard court swing. Main draw action kicks off on Monday with plenty of exciting clashes on the schedule. This year's Houston champion, Jenson Brooksby, will try to avenge his loss from this event's 2022 edition to Yoshihito Nishioka, while Learner Tien takes on Emilio Nava in an all-American showdown. Who do you think will come out on top?

Head-to-head: First meeting

Benjamin Bonzi pulled off one of the shockers of the tournament when he eliminated Daniil Medvedev at Wimbledon, but it remains to be seen if his long-term form will also look much better now. It will be tough to estimate that with both players just starting their hard-court swing. On the one hand, Fabian Marozsan isn't a very consistent player, but at least this year he's been forcing his opponents to bring a strong level to beat him. Bonzi has to prove he'll find it again, it's not a given at all.
Prediction: Marozsan in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

Mackenzie McDonald made the final in Washington four years ago, losing a thrilling battle to Jannik Sinner. For now, that was basically the pinnacle of the 30-year-old's career. Colton Smith is just at the start of his tennis road, especially as he's still combining appearances in pro events with University of Arizona duties. While Smith has been on the rise this year, his performances in the qualifying looked extremely shaky. He'd need to take it up a notch to compete with McDonald here.
Prediction: McDonald in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

All-California showdown, but since they're four years apart it's not like they were coming up against each other in juniors. Emilio Nava has had an excellent season so far with three Challenger titles, but now he's looking for that extra gear that could get him into the Top 100. A win over Andrey Rublev in Los Cabos could have provided that last year, but he couldn't convert a big lead. Learner Tien is back in his element on hard courts now and will probably grind him down with his tricky, lefty counter-punching.
Prediction: Tien in 3

Head-to-head: Nishioka 2-0

Jenson Brooksby last played Washington back in 2022 and was eliminated in the opening round by Yoshihito Nishioka. Usually, when somebody can handle the American's quirky game style, they tend to do well against him anytime they play. But this is a now-or-never opportunity for Brooksby to avenge his previous losses to Nishioka. After all, the Japanese hasn't won a match since February and has been struggling with his health for months. Crowd support should be a helpful factor too.
Prediction: Brooksby in 2

	If the shirt that Malcolm-Jamal Warner wears at the end of The Cosby Show episode “A Shirt Story” isn't the single worst garment in television history, its competitors are few and far between. It's meant to be a perfect replica of a shirt by (fictional) hot new designer Gordon Gartrell, which Warner's Theo Huxtable intends to wear on a date with his new girlfriend Michelle. When Theo's dad Cliff refuses to pay $95 for the genuine article, Theo's older sister Denise (Lisa Bonet) offers to make a knockoff for only $30, assuring her brother she can get it done.


	Instead, it's a patchwork catastrophe. Every aspect of it is mismatched. On one side, the collar is huge and the sleeve is short. On the other, the collar is tiny but the sleeve is way too long. The breast pocket is just to the left of Theo's navel. A horrified Theo, aware Michelle will be at the Huxtable brownstone any minute, declares it “the ugliest shirt I've ever seen!” He is arguably being too kind.


	Whenever we talk about the funniest sitcom scenes of all time, a few inevitably pop up. Lucy and Ethel at the chocolate factory. Reverend Jim taking his driver's test. Dwight Schrute's fire drill. Theo's reaction to the fake Gordon Gartrell shirt should be on there, too — at least as much for Malcolm-Jamal Warner's performance as for how the show's costume designer got every single detail perfectly wrong.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Warner was found dead on Sunday, victim of an accidental drowning in the ocean. He was only 54. He worked as an actor from age 12, when he appeared in an episode of detective drama Matt Houston, through the rest of his life; just this past spring, Fox aired his multi-episode stint on the drama Alert: Missing Persons Unit. He appeared in sitcoms, dramas, and the odd movie here and there. He was a reassuring screen presence, someone who made viewers feel like a person who knew what they were doing had just showed up.

	











	But in life and in much-too-soon death, he will always be tied to The Cosby Show and its complicated legacy. On the one hand, it is one of the biggest hits television has ever seen — a pop-culture juggernaut and a milestone for a medium with a long and troubled history of how it presented Black characters. On the other, it was co-created by, starred, and was named after Bill Cosby, who was accused by more than 60 women of drugging and sexually assaulting them (Cosby was convicted of multiple assaults in 2018, but those convictions were later overturned on due-process grounds). Though episodes are still available for digital purchase, and rerun on a couple of cable channels, the series for the most part has been memory-holed — an understandable choice that has the unfortunate effect of also memory-holing the contributions to its success by everyone involved other than Bill Cosby.

	That hits Warner's own legacy especially hard, because Theo turned out to be the best comedic foil for Cliff. The Huxtables were loosely based on Cosby's own children, and Cosby's son Ennis (who also died much too young) was the family member mentioned by far the most often in Cosby's stand-up act. The most famous moment of The Cosby Show pilot has Theo telling Cliff that he doesn't intend to go to college, and instead just be like “regular people.” Cliff dismantles his son's argument piece by piece, to uproarious laughter and thunderous applause by the studio audience, and it was obvious from there on that pairing Cliff with his overconfident son would be an endlessly renewable humor resource. So when you revisit most of Warner's best moments of the series, you have to watch Cosby alongside him.


	There's ample interaction between the two in “A Shirt Story,” starting with Cliff's dismay at the price of the real Gordon Gartrell shirt, and continuing into his delighted incredulity at seeing the mess Denise has made of things. But the moment everyone remembers is just about the Huxtable kids. Theo has put so much faith into Denise, because he loves her, and also because he's young and naive enough to believe that if Denise states confidently that she can do something, she can. The mortification at seeing the mismatched fruits of her labor is even funnier because it all came from a sincere place.

	Mostly, though, it's Warner doing an epic meltdown over the thing. When Denise suggests the shirt might look better if Theo tucked it in more, he screams — through gritted teeth, no less — “It's tucked into my socks!” It's an incredible line delivery, and the kind of thing that should be beyond the gifts of a 14-year-old, even one being directed by a future Television Hall of Fame inductee like Jay Sandrich. Yet Warner nails it. 

	











	The episode actually offers a happy ending for poor beleaguered Theo. Cliff admits that he kept the real Gartrell because he knew Denise would fail at her task. Theo rushes to change into it, not realizing that Michelle and their friends are waiting in the living room. His response to being caught by the girl he wanted so badly to impress is another spectacular bit of physical comedy from Warner, but it turns out to be unnecessary: Michelle improbably thinks the knock-off is hot, and is excited to be seen out on the town with the handsome boy wearing it. It's almost as if the creative team knew just how great Warner would be at the worst moments, and wanted to reward him by giving his alter ego a big win.When the terrible news came in about Warner's death, I put the episode on for the first time since before the preponderance of accusations against Cosby became too big to ignore. It wasn't always easy to get through, because of everything that's now associated with Cosby. But Malcolm-Jamal Warner was still magic in it. I'm glad I was able to remind myself of that. I hate that this is the reason why.

EXCLUSIVE: That limited series we first told you about based on Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella from Skydance Television, Concord Originals and Jennifer Lopez‘s Nuyorican has landed at Disney+, we hear. The project remains in development.


	We understand there was a bidding war between Disney and Amazon for the project, which is from the perspective of the fairy godparents. It is written by Rachel Shukert, who is still attached as EP and showrunner.


	The UTA-repped Shukert is an EP on Hulu's Nine Perfect Strangers, as well as an EP on the streamer's The Handmaid's Tale, and the showrunner of Netflix's The Baby-Sitters Club. 











			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to Shukert, executive producers include Lopez, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina for Nuyorican Productions; Sophia Dilley, EVP of Concord Originals and co-president of RKO; former Concord CEO Scott Pascucci; and Bill Bost.


	Skydance Television has a pact with Concord to develop a slate of original projects mined from the latter's vast catalog of musicals that includes Cinderella and a modern-day adaptation of Oklahoma! from John Lee Hancock and Bekah Brunstetter.


Cinderella is one of Rodgers & Hammerstein's most popular titles. It was originally written for television, debuting in 1957 with Julie Andrews in the lead. The TV movie was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance. More than 100 million viewers saw the broadcast. Cinderella was re-made for TV in 1965 starring Lesley Ann Warren in the title role with Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon as the King and Queen, and Celeste Holm as the Fairy Godmother. Another television remake followed in 1997 with Brandy as Cinderella, Whitney Houston as the Fairy Godmother, Bernadette Peters as the Stepmother, Whoopi Goldberg as the Queen and Jason Alexander as Lionel.

Cool. It means more non-Star Wars/Narvel prpgramming on Disney+. I don't hate those, but most shows there, with rare exceotions like Percy Jackson, are either Marvel or Star Wars.

Kevin Feige is looking to put the ex in “X-Men.” The Marvel Studios head said during a press conference, as reported by Variety, that he will be recasting iconic characters for the upcoming “X-Men” movie directed by “Thunderbolts*” helmer Jake Schreier. Feige cited that the comics centered on adolescents, hinting that the reboot would too. 

“They have been a place to tell stories about young people who feel different and who feel Other and who feel like they don't belong,” he said. “That's the universal story of mutants, and that is where we're going.”

 










Feige stressed that Schreier's iteration will be a franchise “reset” and kill the multiverse moment once and for all. “Reboot is a scary word,” he said. “Reboot can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. Reset, singular timeline — we're thinking along those lines. […] ‘X-Men' is where that will happen next.”

Marvel acquired Fox back in 2017. The ensemble casts of previous “X-Men” movies are set to reprise their roles for “Avengers: Doomsday,” with Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, and Kelsey Grammer among those returning. However, that may be their final bow as those characters after  the events of 2027's “Avengers: Secret Wars.” 

 










“We're utilizing that [story] not just to round out the stories we've been telling post-‘Endgame,' just as importantly — and you can look at the at the ‘Secret Wars' comics for where that takes you — it very, very much sets us up for the future,” Feige said. “‘Endgame,' literally, was about endings. ‘Secret Wars' is about is about beginnings.”

The rumored cast for Schreier's “X-Men” movie includes Harris Dickinson as Cyclops, Sadie Sink as Jean Grey, Margaret Qualley as Rogue, Julia Butters as Kitty Pryde, and Jesse Plemons as Beast (Plemons will also be in the “Hunger Games” franchise now too, with “The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” writer Michael Lesslie behind the “X-Men” script.) 

Feige compared the “X-Men” “reset” to other beloved franchises, including James Bond and the recent DCU “Superman.”

“Amy Pascal and David Heyman are now searching for a new James Bond,” Feige said, referring to the producers of Amazon MGM's upcoming Bond film. “David [Corenswet], the new Superman — he was awesome. That will always be the case.”

	In late January, the CEO of the pro-business American Legislative Exchange Council told right-wing operatives and officials that they need a “scalp” from one of two supposedly woke CEOs of major Wall Street firms. 


	Lisa Nelson, who leads ALEC, was discussing Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, the second largest bank in the country. She appeared to be speaking metaphorically, as she struggled to refer to an unknown movie. Nelson made the comments at the Consumers' Research Summit in Sea Island, Georgia. Rolling Stone has obtained exclusive audio and documents from the event. 


	Nelson noted she had spoken about this at breakfast. “Whether it's Larry Fink or Brian Moynihan, we have got to take one of these guys out,” she said, presumably another metaphor. She added, “Brian Moynihan is the guy, or Larry Fink is the guy that we should have their scalp.”


	ALEC is a powerful “bill mill” that brings corporations, conservative advocates, and state legislators together to hash out right-wing, pro-business legislation that is then introduced nationwide, with a focus on red states. 

	











	A spokesperson for ALEC declined to comment for this story.


	“Over the past three years, the assets BlackRock manages on behalf of our clients have grown by $4 trillion to $12.5 trillion,” says a BlackRock spokesperson. “We are focused on delivering for each and every client in every market we operate in around the world, including helping millions of Americans in states across the country retire with dignity.”

	











	Bank of America declined to comment, though a person familiar with the matter says that the bank's representatives attended ALEC's annual meeting last week.


	Fink and his firm BlackRock have become primary targets in conservatives' crusade against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and initiatives promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The firm has trillions in assets under management, and manages billions of dollars for public pension funds. Because of its extensive holdings, BlackRock exerts enormous influence across the stock market through shareholder votes. In his widely-read annual letters to CEOs, Fink has written that “climate risk is investment risk.”

	Moynihan, for his part, has defended the idea of inclusion in the workplace, characterizing it as a positive business opportunity. Consumers' Research targeted Bank of America in 2023 for engaging in “anti-consumer” behaviors: namely, having internal DEI training and offering tips for how clients can calculate their greenhouse gas emissions. 


	Amid Republican attacks on ESG and DEI, including from President Donald Trump, BlackRock and Bank of America both dropped out of Net Zero alliances, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Additionally, both companies have eliminated their DEI goals, while maintaining a general commitment to inclusion.


	Consumers' Research, which hosted the event, is at the center of a network of nonprofits tied to the right-wing power broker Leonard Leo that is waging a “War on Woke” against corporations and financiers who embrace ESG investment criteria — or the idea that asset managers should consider the threat of planetary devastation when deploying money. Leo's network helps fund ALEC, which has pushed model legislation in the states to ban asset managers for state retirement funds from promoting ESG.


	The anti-ESG coalition has notched some wins in terms of BlackRock and Bank of America's public posturing, but these conservatives argue the fight is far from over. “We have our good examples. We're sharing them every day when they get out of something,” Nelson noted, but “it's words right now.”

	That's why conservatives need their scalps, Nelson explained. “And, you know, and that's — it's like the scalps. I don't know what the movie is,” she said, adding it was about “taking the scalps.”

	











	“Brian Moynihan would be the perfect person,” Nelson continued. “We were talking about it at lunch, or breakfast. I think he is ideologically all-in on everything he's doing.” 


	Comparing him to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, the ALEC chief said she doesn't believe that Dimon is “all-in” ideologically. “I think he is just seeing where the winds are blowing and trying to have his cake and eat it, too — and ‘I'm gonna play footsie with everybody,' and all is going to be OK for JPMorgan in his mind,” Nelson asserted. 


	Nelson spoke with a JPMorgan executive on a panel at ALEC's annual meeting last week. A JPMorgan representative declined to comment but confirmed the firm is an ALEC member.


	ALEC does not disclose its donors or a full list of its members. The organization receives some corporate funding, including from Chevron, and donations from lobbying groups for Big Pharma, fossil fuel interests, the telecom industry, and electric utilities. ALEC's Private Enterprise Advisory Council includes Mike Thompson, a top lieutenant at Leo's consulting firm CRC Advisors, which helped manage the summit; as well as execs at Consumers' Research; the American Bankers Association (ABA); oil billionaire Charles Koch's business empire; and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington's top business lobby. Bank of America previously cut ties with ALEC in 2012.


	Nelson, who previously ran global government relations at credit card giant Visa, made her comments about the CEOs during a larger conversation about the necessity of political neutrality in public investments. 


	Fiduciaries, like BlackRock, are legally bound to act in the best financial interests of their clients. Conservative politicians and groups, ALEC included, have demanded that companies eschew ESG and DEI as part of their investment criteria, arguing the only thing that should matter is maximizing shareholder profit.


	During Nelson's panel, an operative asked the panelists if they had any examples where Republican-led states had “in their efforts to kind of correct, [and] go from liberal ESG investing, instead of going back to neutral, they over-corrected,” to a place where they're putting public money into conservative investments. 


	“If we want neutral, we should want neutral,” the operative said. 


	Debate ensued, with most participants concluding that long-suffering conservatives needed to beat back Big Banks, who are in cahoots with the Left — neutrality be damned.

	











	“That's a very good kind of point to bring up,” Nelson said. “But I think you know, we should plant our flag as far as we possibly can.”


	Thompson, the CRC exec who moderated the panel, agreed, but was more explicit, comparing the Left and Big Banks to Hitler: “If the Allies said, ‘Hey, Hitler, will you go neutral? You've taken over France. You've got Northern Africa. You've got all this stuff. We'll stop if you stop.' OK, he'll stop for a little while and then he'll keep coming.” 


	He complained about an initiative attempting to get companies to reduce their climate impact, because it was rating corporations and docking them for giving money to nonprofits that do not align with their climate goals. “Which means ALEC,” Thompson said, adding it “means Consumers' Research should get no money from the other side.” 


	“We need to stop their momentum and then push back,” Thompson continued. “We don't need them to go, ‘Oh, we're neutral now. We've run over 90 percent of your world. We've burned down 90 percent of your house, and now we'll stop' … Sometimes that means not neutral. It means get us back to where we can be neutral. It's not enough to say, ‘We're no longer gonna push the DEI agenda, but we're still going to have trans bathrooms, you can go to any bathroom you want, do whatever you want. No, no, no. You have to rip out all those policies.'”


	Tom Jones — the right-wing opposition researcher notorious for publishing a DEI Watch List of mostly Black federal officials he decided should be fired by Trump — argued that conservatives should not “get wedded” to neutrality. 


	“Publicly held funds should reflect the values of Americans, and if that means we're not going to invest in companies that support boycott, divestment, and sanctions, [against Israel] or we're not going to invest in companies that use slave labor in China, or we're not going to invest in companies that invest in Iran because it's a threat to American national security, we should 100 percent have those policies,” said Jones.


	“I don't know what neutral means — but legal and principled,” said perennial anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who seemed irritated with his compatriots' hypocrisy. “I think you can't go to a court and say, ‘We want to make decisions that aren't fiduciary, but we shouldn't be ruled to be stealing people's money, but they do.' I have no idea how you don't get laughed out of court with any argument…. This is a real slippery slope, and I don't know how you make that argument without laughing at yourself.”

	











	Described by NPR in 2001 as a “conservative revolutionary,” Norquist famously told the outlet: “I don't want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.” 


	A spokesperson for Consumers' Research tells Rolling Stone, ​“For years, megalomaniacs at the helm of powerful corporations like BlackRock and Bank of America exploited their positions to impose a political agenda and bully others into compliance. The American people have had enough and they are demanding a return to business, not activism. Neutrality means moving away from the far left and back to focusing on consumers. There is still a long way to go and damage to make amends for before these companies and others like them can earn the public's trust again.”


	GOP attorneys general — long financed by Leo through their Republican Attorneys General Association — are currently suing BlackRock on alleged antitrust violations regarding its coal investments. The effort is being led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose top deputy bragged during a different panel that he threatened another big bank, Wells Fargo, into leaving the Net Zero Banking Alliance. (Texas had similarly threatened Bank of America's bond business, until it dropped out of the climate coalition.)


	Even former Congressman Ken Buck, who was the ranking Republican on the Antitrust Subcommittee, thinks Paxton's case against BlackRock is politically motivated “lawfare.”In May, Democrats in the Senate and House announced probes into the exodus of banks from major climate change initiatives. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, tells Rolling Stone: “We have apparent open admissions — straight from the mouths of fossil-fuel-funded Republican operatives and lawmakers — of their phony anti-ESG scheme and their calls for the ‘scalps' of the banking executives who've warned about the systemic risks from climate change.”Facing increasingly costly legal backlash from Republican state officials in the Leo network, BlackRock has tried to mend fences with conservatives. In January 2024, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick detailed Fink's moves to get back into his good graces, by lining up investors for new natural gas plants in the state's power grid. That didn't dissuade Paxton from launching the antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock last November.

	Fink's firm withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers alliance in January, but the attacks from conservatives have not abated. They've continued even after the financier made a huge overture to Trump, in helping to achieve one of his key priorities: wresting control of the Panama Canal from China. Multiple agencies in the Trump administration have since written letters in support of Paxton's antitrust lawsuit.


	From the sounds of it, no amount of concessions will satisfy these conservatives, only scalps.

Oasis have revealed a last-minute bonus for ticket holders attending their sold out Live '25 reunion tour: each ticket comes with a free pass to cheat on whoever you want, only valid at participating venues. “Do we have any lovebirds in the house? Don't worry, we don't got any of that Coldplay snidey fucking camera shit,” Liam Gallagher asked onstage in Manchester. In the wake of Coldplay's inadvertent Cheating CEO Camera, it's a fair warning.


	Last week, a scene from the “Jumbotron Song” portion of Coldplay's live show went viral after the camera landed on two people who went from cuddled-up couple to alleged cheating culprits as they ducked out of sight in visible panic. “Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy,” frontman Chris Martin joked from the stage. The not-so-willing participants were later revealed to be CEO Andy Byron and Chief Human Resources Officer Kristin Cabot of the tech company Astronomer.

	On Friday, Astronomer issued a statement announcing its Board of Directors “initiated a formal investigation into this matter and we will have additional details to share very shortly” and had placed both employees on leave. If the decision was up to the Gallaghers, the whole thing might have blown over. “Doesn't matter to us who you're fucking mingling with, or tingling with, or fingering with,” Gallagher said at their show. “It's none of our fucking business.”

	On Saturday, the company announced that Byron had resigned. At the first Coldplay concert since the apparent infidelity incident, Martin gently reminded the audience that their attendance implies an understanding that they may be filmed. “We'd like to say hello to some of you in the crowd,” Martin told the Camp Randall Stadium audience. “How we're gonna do that is we're gonna use our cameras and put some of you on the big screen. So please, if you haven't done your makeup, do your makeup now.”

Bieber's "Daisies" debuts at No. 2 and Lenae's "Love Me Not" leaps to No. 7.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Alex Warren's “Ordinary” scores a seventh week atop the Billboard Hot 100. The song has spent all its weeks on top consecutively, having become his first No. 1 on the chart.


	Plus, two songs are new to the Hot 100's top 10, led by Justin Bieber's “Daisies,” which debuts at No. 2. The track is from his new album, Swag, which likewise bounds onto the Billboard 200 at No. 2. Bieber earns his 27th career Hot 100 top 10 — tying Janet Jackson for the 10th-most in the chart's history. It also opens as the week's most-streamed song.


	Meanwhile, Ravyn Lenae lands her first Hot 100 top 10 as “Love Me Not” surges five spots to No. 7. The song became her first entry on the chart in April.


	Additionally in the Hot 100's top 10, Teddy Swims' former leader “Lose Control,” at No. 9, makes history, becoming the first song ever to spend 100 weeks on the chart.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated July 26, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, July 22. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 19.6 million official streams (up 2% week-over-week),  73 million radio airplay audience impressions (essentially even week-over-week) and 6,000 sold (up 8%) in the United States July 11-17.


	It holds at No. 4 on the Streaming Songs chart, following four weeks at the summit; adds a fifth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs; and rebounds from No. 2 for a ninth week atop Digital Song Sales.


	The track also keeps at No. 1 on the Songs of the Summer chart, having led in all eight weeks since the seasonal survey made its annual return after Memorial Day.


	Justin Bieber's “Daisies” debuts at No. 2 on the Hot 100 with 27.6 million streams, 4.3 million in airplay audience and 4,000 sold through July 17 following its July 11 release on his new album, Swag.


	Bieber ups his career total to 27 career Hot 100 top 10s — tying Janet Jackson for the 10th-most in the chart's nearly 67-year history.


Most Hot 100 Top 10s:


	The track concurrently premieres at No. 1 on Streaming Songs, where it's Bieber's seventh leader.


	Bieber had last earned a new Hot 100 top 10 with “Ghost,” which rose to No. 5 in April 2022. He first reached the region when “Baby” debuted at its No. 5 high in February 2010. Of his 27 top 10s, he boasts eight No. 1s.


	Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” leaps 12-7 on the Hot 100 with 14.1 million streams (up 5%), 36 million in radio reach (up 13%) and 1,000 sold (up 26%). The song, which became big on TikTok, is the Chicago-born singer-songwriter's first top 10 on the chart, marking the latest milestone in her steady career ascent. In April, it became her first Hot 100 hit. She began releasing music around a decade ago and signed to Atlantic in 2016.


	“I'm just happy for all artists who have been in this 10-plus years and are feeling the love and the benefits of so much time and effort and hard work,” Lenae told Billboard in April, a day before her Coachella debut.


	“This is something I feel like I haven't heard in such a long time,” Lenae added of “Love Me Not,” which she co-wrote, noting that it reminded her of OutKast's classic “Hey Ya!,” which ruled the Hot 100 for nine weeks in 2003-04. “That mix of soulfulness with pop sensibility that anybody could sing and dance to, and feels like it could have come out in any era — that's my favorite type of song.”


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, holds at No. 9 — as it becomes the first song ever to spend 100 weeks on the chart overall. It also tallies a record-extending 70th week in the top 10.


	The single debuted, at No. 99, on the chart dated Aug. 26, 2023. It broke the Hot 100's longevity mark in May when it surpassed the run of Glass Animals' “Heat Waves,” which ran up 91 weeks in 2021-22.

James Gunn isn't letting the “SuperWoke” right wing criticisms bring his “Superman” down. The writer/director, who is also the co-head of DC Studios, told Rolling Stone that the superhero film has reached success at the international box office despite rising “anti-American sentiment[s]” worldwide.

The film has reached $235 million domestically since its release; internationally, it's only at $171 million, but Gunn is glad it has had a strong multiple. “We're definitely performing better domestically than we are internationally, but internationally is also rising and having really good weekday numbers in the same way we are,” Gunn said. “So obviously the word of mouth is very positive both here and everywhere else, which is the thing that we needed to do the most. At the same time, there are certain countries in which it's really performing well, Brazil and the U.K.”

He added, “Superman is not a known commodity in some places. He is not a big known superhero in some places like Batman is. That affects things. And it also affects things that we have a certain amount of anti-American sentiment around the world right now. It isn't really helping us. So I think it's just a matter of letting something grow. But again, for us, everything's been a total win. Having the movie come out and be something that has been embraced by people everywhere — this is just the seed of the tree that Peter [Safran] and I have been watering for the past three years. So to be able to have it start off so positively has been incredibly overwhelming.”

 










Domestically, “Superman” has been deemed “SuperWoke,” especially after Gunn told the Times of London that Superman is an “immigrant” and the feature is about “the story of America.” Now, Gunn is detailing the nuances of the statement. 

Gunn told Entertainment Weekly that “Superman” is really about humanity, which transcends politics. “I've heard people say it was woke, and then I've heard a lot of people say it's not. I am curious as to what in the movie is considered woke,” Gunn told EW. “I think people took something I said…The guy for the London newspaper. Originally, he said that [Superman comic creators] Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were the sons of immigrants, and they wrote Superman as an immigrant story. And I said, yeah, it's a story about an immigrant, but mostly it's a story to me about kindness, which it is. That's the center of the movie for me.”

He continued, “That's the thing we can all act upon, is kindness. And so what does that lead to? Well, does that lead to the way you vote? Sure. Does that lead to everything? Yeah. Does it lead to how many people are dying from road rage? Yes. All those things are affected if people just start to value kindness. I mean, people did value kindness in the past. That was an American value, was kindness, and it doesn't necessarily seem to be that way to me anymore. So that was always the center of the movie for me, and it wasn't about anything other than that.”

Amazon MGM Studios' new feature take on the property hits theaters in 2027.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Adria Arjona is set to star alongside Michael B. Jordan in The Thomas Crown Affair for Amazon MGM Studios. 


	Jordan directs and stars in the feature reimagining that is currently in production in London and follows Norman Jewison‘s 1968 original of the same name starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. Kenneth Branagh, Lily Gladstone, Danai Gurira, Pilou Asbæk and Aiysha Hart round out the cast for the new project that hits theaters March 5, 2027.




Taylor Russell was previously set to star opposite Jordan in the film. The Hollywood Reporter reported last week that the Bones and All actress exited the movie amid creative differences.

	Drew Pearce (The Fall Guy) wrote the script for the new movie after Wes Tooke and Justin Britt-Gibson penned a previous draft. Producers include Jordan and Elizabeth Raposo for Outlier Society and Charles Roven for Atlas Entertainment. Patrick McCormick and Toberoff Productions' Marc Toberoff also produce. Alan Trustman, who wrote the original film, serves as an executive producer.


	The original Thomas Crown Affair landed two Oscar nominations and tells the story of an insurance investigator working to track down the perpetrator of a bank heist. It was remade in 1999, with the updated version starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.


	Arjona is known for such series work as Disney+'s Star Wars show Andor and for features including Blink Twice and Hit Man. She can next be seen opposite Dakota Johnson in Neon and Topic Studio's comedy Splitsville.

	











The Thomas Crown Affair reunites Jordan with the studio that released his 2023 directorial debut, Creed III.


	Jordan teased his take on The Thomas Crown Affair during a video segment at CinemaCon in April, telling the crowd that his movie “isn't just another remake.” 


	Arjona is represented by CAA, Anonymous Content, Brillstein Entertainment Partners and Stone Genow.


Variety was first to report on Arjona's casting.

Adria Arjona (Hit Man) has taken over the co-lead opposite Michael B. Jordan in Amazon MGM Studios‘ Jordan-directed reimagining of The Thomas Crown Affair, Deadline has confirmed.


	Arjona takes over the role from Taylor Russell, who we told you first on Friday exited the project due to creative differences, with production underway in London. The actress is set for the role of an insurance investigator who comes to suspect that an adventurous banking executive is pulling off ambitious heists, and develops a spark with him. It's a version of the role played by Faye Dunaway opposite Steve McQueen in the original 1968 film, and by Rene Russo opposite Pierce Brosnan in the 1999 version.

Perhaps it was an age thing? I can see Taylor reading much too young. I too was hoping for a darker skinned woman. Which is not a slight to Adria. She is a fantastic actress and i'm sure she'll body this role. Latina women are so sorely under represented any win for a fellow woc is a win for us all. ✊🏿

Taylor Russell dodged a bullet.
And Adria Arjona ran into one!

So.. they recast for a sex symbol? Rather than depth.

Huh? Taylor Russell isn't exactly Anne Ramsey, you know.

Interesting casting. Michael B. Jordan is the leading Black next generation A-list actor who can't have a Black leading lady. I was looking forward to seeing him finally in a solid suave, bachelor role that gives him a chance to walk out of the Yurman billboards. Today's Hollywood needs Black love. Disappointed but not surprised. SMH

read the paper. Atlanta needs Black love.

Demi Lovato is in the final stages of her ninth studio album. A source close to the project tells Rolling Stone Monday that Lovato is embracing the electronic sound of some of her biggest pop hits on her next record, which is expected to drop later this year.


	“Over the past few years, Demi has found love, joy, and newfound confidence, making the choice to approach life with much more lightness and fun,” the source tells Rolling Stone, referring to her recent marriage to Jordan “Jutes” Lutes. “She took this sentiment into the studio, which can be felt in every track on this celebratory dance-pop album.”


	Lovato tapped Zhone — the music maker behind “Someone for Me” by Kylie Minogue, “Rush” by Troye Sivan, and “Joyride” by Kesha — to executive-produce the upcoming project.


	“It's been so inspiring working with Demi and experiencing her journey of continued leveling up,” Zhone tells Rolling Stone about their work together. “She is such a master in the studio. This album is about letting inhibitions go, and we had so much fun making this music! It really comes across throughout.”

	











	Fans have already started to get a taste of DL9 with teasers posted by Lovato of the album's lead single, “Fast.” The music is a significant step away from the rock-leaning energy of her two last projects, 2022's Holy Fvck and 2023's Revamped, which reimagined her pop hits as rock tracks.

	When she announced Revamped with Rolling Stone, she said she was considering a return to pop. “I was listening to a bunch of metal. And now, I'm trying to wrap my brain around more pop-sounding stuff, just in case my music wants to take that direction,” she said at the time.

	











	On the new project, she'll tap into the sound she's explored on some of her chart-topping EDM collaborations, such as 2018's “Solo” with Clean Bandit, 2017's “No Promises” with Cheat Codes, and “Instruction” from Tell Me You Love Me with Jax Jones. Her electropop goes back to 2013, when she included fan favorite “Neon Lights” on her self-titled record Demi.

On July 19, Mariano sent love-sick “Survivor” fans into a frenzy when took to Instagram to share a never-before-seen snap of himself and Amber taken on the set of “Survivor: All Stars,” where the lovers first crossed paths in 2003. 

The “Survivor: Redemption Island” winner shared a rare Polaroid snap of himself and Amber, taking on Day 39 of “All Stars” as part of an Instagram trend that called on users to “post a picture of the early days with your love.”

“Pretty sure, this qualifies as the early days!!!” wrote Mariano under the never-before-seen photo, which showed both castaways beaming on the final day of the competition. “They gave us a Polaroid camera the last few days…I saved this one!”

Fans have since declared the behind-the-scenes snap as a relic of “Survivor” history, with one writing, “This belongs in a museum.”

Another called Mariano and Brkich's relationship a “Top 5 love story,” while more echoed the sentiment, with one fan commenting, “I love that a relationship from reality TV turned out so well and is still so strong against all odds.” 

Though they originally appeared on separate seasons – Mariano on “Survivor: Marquesas” and Brkich on “Survivor: The Australian Outback” – both castaways were welcomed back to compete on “Survivor: All Stars” alongside legendary players like Rob Cesternino, Rupert Boneham and Jerri Manthey. 

Thanks to an early alliance that quickly turned romantic, Mariano and Brkich proved an unstoppable force on the season, eventually securing themselves spots next to one another at Final Tribal Council, where Amber, sporting a shirt that read “I [heart] Rob,” emerged victorious after a 4-3 jury vote. 

Just moments before Brkich was declared the season's “Sole Survivor” and presented with the million-dollar grand prize, Mariano shocked fans when he dropped to one knee and asked Amber to marry him. 

“Regardless of what happens here tonight, I feel like I already won,” Mariano told longtime “Survivor” host Jeff Probst during the live finale of “All Stars.” “I have the most special girl in the entire world sitting right here next to me.”

“I've seen you at your highest high and your lowest low, and between it all, we work together as a team to accomplish so much,” he continued. “And in the end, I ended up falling in love with you. You're the most amazing person I've ever met in my entire life, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”

The pair officially tied the knot in 2005, and have since welcomed their four daughters, Lucia, Carina, Isabetta and Adelina. Since getting married, the duo have competed together on “The Amazing Race,” where they placed as runner-ups, as well as returning for “Survivor: Winner at War” in 2020.

Osgood Perkins is getting into the relationship-horror film subgenre. The auteur, who recently helmed both “Longlegs” and “The Monkey” for NEON, is set to release his third film with the distributor in less than a 16-month span. Perkins also became the first ever filmmaker to land a first-look deal with the acclaimed studio, as announced in May 2025. 

For “Keeper,” though, writer/director Perkins is just helming it: Nick Lepard wrote the script, with the one-location horror film shot during the 2023 strikes between the “Longlegs” and “The Monkey” productions. The logline for “Keeper” reads: “During an anniversary getaway at a remote cabin, a wife (Tatiana Maslany) is left alone after her husband (Rossif Sutherland) departs, only to confront a sinister presence that exposes the cabin's chilling past.”

Maslany also starred in Perkins' “The Monkey,” which offered a sneak peek at “Keeper” in a post-credits scene. Perkins told IndieWire that “Keeper” is a “beautiful, beautiful movie” that has a “grown-up, kind of relationship horror” aspect. Perkins raved that actress Maslany is “just the greatest. She's so infinite. I'm so lucky to have her.”

And that wasn't the only stroke of luck on the project: “Keeper” was shot as an indie during the strikes. “It was made during the [Writers Guild] strike, so I couldn't write it,” Perkins said. “This lovely Canadian non-union guy [Nick Lepard] wrote this movie and we sort of figured out this thing.” 

He continued of his career, “I've landed myself in a supremely lucky position where all of my movies get to be one of one, right? I think that's almost expected now, at least after ‘Longlegs” into ‘The Monkey.' I think everybody's getting, ‘Oh right, he's not going to hit the same beat twice, I don't know what to expect.'”

Perkins added to IndieWire that ‘Keeper' will be similar to his “zoomed out” approach to the horror genre. While “Longlegs” was his “pop version” of horror, “The Monkey” was a comedy about death; “Keeper” is a meditation on relationships, much like fellow NEON release “Together.” 

NEON will premiere “Keeper” in theaters November 14. Check out the teaser trailer below.

Madi Diaz has announced a headlining tour and a follow-up LP to her Grammy-nominated album Weird Faith. The new album is called Fatal Optimist, and it arrives October 10 via Anti-. Leading the singer-songwriter's return is lead single “Feel Something” and its black-and-white Allister Ann–directed music video, which you can watch below.

When explaining the backstory of her new song, Diaz said: “‘Feel Something' is about the deep yearning and desire to connect. It's the moment when you're trying to call in the love that was lost. It's the first single off the album because it has the sense of urgency and panic that I felt at that first moment I noticed I was alone in my relationship.”

Spanning 11 tracks, Fatal Optimist is about “the innate hope for something magical,” according to Diaz. After originally stepping into a studio to record the album with friends, she opted to revive the solitude of her initial songwriting sessions instead, tapping co-producer Gabe Wax to work alongside her at his Infinite Family studio in California.

Following a few sets at music festivals this summer and show with Caamp at New York's Radio City Music Hall, Diaz will embark on a headlining North American tour this autumn. The North American leg begins on September 26, in Woodstock, New York, and brings her to cities big and small across the United States, with a stop in British Columbia, too. Diaz will conclude the tour on November 21, in Pioneertown, California. Find her complete list of tour dates down below.

EXCLUSIVE: Wrestling fans will have another way to experience WWE‘s SummerSlam next month, if they can't attend in person.


	The two-night event, taking place at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, will also screen live in select Regal Cinemas across the U.S. on Saturday, August 2 and Sunday, August 3, Deadline can exclusively reveal. 


	The experience marks the launch of a multi-event collaboration between WWE and Fandango. While Regal will be the official exhibitor for SummerSlam, additional exhibitors are expected to join for future WWE live events.

 “WWE is one of the most electrifying global entertainment brands, and its events deserve to be experienced on the big screen,” Will McIntosh, President, Fandango, said in a statement Monday. “We're thrilled to work with WWE and Regal Cinemas to bring the action-packed SummerSlam 2025 cinema presentation to fans nationwide.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Tickets are now on sale now at Fandango. Fans will have two ticket options to experience SummerSlam on the big screen — either a single-night ticket for Saturday or Sunday, or a two-night ticket bundle that includes access to both screenings and an exclusive SummerSlam t-shirt.


SummerSlam will feature the highly anticipated rematch between Undisputed WWE Champion John Cena and WWE Superstar Cody Rhodes, picking up where they left off after they last met in the ring at Wrestlemania 41. 


	For those who can't make it to the theater, SummerSlam will also stream live at 6 p.m. ET/3 p.m. PT on Peacock in the U.S. and on Netflix internationally.

	











	“WWE has redefined how fans connect with live entertainment, and bringing SummerSlam to Regal's screens elevates that experience to a whole new level,” Brooks LeBoeuf, Senior Vice President of US Content at Regal Cinemas, said in a statement of their own. “We're excited to partner with WWE and Fandango to deliver this immersive, action-packed event in theaters —making fans feel like they're ringside, no matter where they are.”

The world of Jane Austen is expanding a little further with more “Sense and Sensibility” casting. 

The Focus Features and Working Title iteration of the iconic novel will also star George MacKay, “Outlander” actress Caitríona Balfe, Frank Dillane, Herbert Nordrum, Bodhi Rae Breathnach, and Fiona Shaw, as announced Monday. 

As previously reported, Daisy Edgar-Jones will lead as Elinor Dashwood, with Esme Creed-Miles playing Marianne Dashwood. “Blue Jean” filmmaker Georgia Oakley will direct from a script by bestselling author Diana Reid. The feature has started filming in the United Kingdom.

 










Per an earlier announcement, “Originally published anonymously with the byline reading ‘By A Lady,' Austen's ‘Sense and Sensibility' established her as a literary force and remains a cornerstone of English literature. The timeless exploration of restraint and passion follows sisters Elinor (Edgar-Jones) and Marianne Dashwood, opposites in their emotional approach, as they navigate love, loss, and financial uncertainty amid the societal expectations of 18th-century England. Celebrated for its wit, deep social insights, and enduring cultural relevance, the novel launched the bright career of one of history's greatest authors.”

Focus and Working Title return to the Austen classics: Both studios collaborated on Wright's 2005 adaptation of “Pride & Prejudice” and Autumn de Wilde's 2020 take on “Emma.”

Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner of Working Title Films will produce “Sense and Sensibility” alongside India Flint of November Pictures and Jo Wallett. 

MacKay is believed to be the male lead; he recently led a slew of 2024 indie hits such as “Femme,” “The Beast,” and “The End.” Meanwhile, Edgar-Jones has starred in “Twisters” and “On Swift Horses,” and is set for Chloe Domont's “A Place in Hell” with Michelle Williams and Andrew Scott. 

Edgar-Jones will also shoot Fernando Meirelles' heist thriller “Here Comes the Flood” for Netflix, with Denzel Washington and Robert Pattinson co-starring. The film is billed as an “unconventional heist movie about a bank guard, a teller, and a master thief in a deadly game of cons and double crosses.” Meirelles directed 2019's “The Two Popes” also for Netflix, and helmed “The Sympathizer” and “Sugar” for TV. Simon Kinberg (“Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” upcoming “Star Wars” trilogy) wrote the script.

HYBE label Belift Lab disputes the former ADOR CEO's claims that ILLIT's debut too closely mirrored NewJeans.


													By
												

	Billboard Korea



Former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin appeared in court again on Friday (July 18) for the third oral hearing in a 2 billion won ($1.45 million) defamation lawsuit filed by HYBE's label Belift Lab. The case centers on Min's public claims that Belift plagiarized concepts from her and ADOR's work with the girl group NewJeans in their promotion of ILLIT. Belift Lab initially filed the lawsuit in May 2024, accusing Min of defamation and obstruction of business.


	A separate hearing for a 500 million won ($360,000) lawsuit filed by Source Music, initially scheduled for the same day, was postponed to Aug. 22. Source Music had filed its claim in July 2024, alleging that Min's statements constituted false information and harmed both the company and its artists.


	The Belift Lab hearing was originally scheduled for May 2025 but was rescheduled to July 18 at the request of Min's legal team. With Source Music's case delayed, only the Belift-Min proceedings took place that day. Both sides were given 30 minutes each to present their arguments in court.

	Belift Lab emphasized Min's influence as a prominent producer in the K-pop industry and questioned whether labeling a rookie group as plagiarists less than a month after their debut could truly be seen as serving the public interest. The label argued that the elements Min cited — hanbok styling, choreography and hairstyles — are widely used across K-pop. They also noted that Min herself had faced accusations of similarity during NewJeans' “Ditto” era.


	In response, Min's legal team stated that from ILLIT's debut, both domestic and international fans and critics had consistently pointed out similarities between the two groups, claiming the resemblance was too significant to be coincidental. They further argued that HYBE initiated an abnormal internal audit of ADOR shortly after Min raised these concerns, framing the current dispute as a matter of defamation and business interference rather than copyright infringement.


	The proceedings follow a recent development on July 15, when police dismissed HYBE's criminal complaint against Min for breach of trust, concluding there was no evidence of wrongdoing. However, the ongoing conflict between HYBE labels and Min Hee-jin, which began with an internal audit of ADOR in 2024, remains unresolved.


	NewJeans will celebrate their third debut anniversary on July 22, though the group is currently on hiatus.

The announcement came on Monday morning (July 21) in a video featuring MC singing a bit of the soaring title song.

Mariah Carey is Here For It All. The pop icon announced the title and release date of her 16th album on Monday morning (July 21), revealing that the LP fans have been calling “MC16” will drop on Sept. 26. The news came in a brief Instagram video in which MC flipped her hair back and walked slowly in shiny black leather high-heeled boots and black cat suit in front of a giant mural of herself, with the album title spelled out over and over in black and white behind her.


	It ended with a brief snippet of the title track in which Carey crooned, “I'm here for it all!” The final image appears to be the album's cover picture, featuring a broadly smiling Carey, eyes closed, filling up most of the page, her hair blowing in the wind as she holds her left arm up to her cheek and her right hand up to her chest.

	So far, in June Carey dropped the single “Type Dangerous” — and, recently, an accompanying EP featuring collabs with Method Mad, Big Sean, DJ Snake and others — and previewed the song “Sugar Sweet” from the follow-up to her 2018 Caution album. Carey told Apple Music last month that the album was “finished,” but at press time a full track listing had not yet been announced.

	











	The singer earned her milestone 50th Billboard Hot 100 hit when “Type Dangerous” debuted at No. 95 on the singles tally last month. The track is her first nonseasonal song to reach the Hot 100 since “I Don't” with YG logged a week on the list in Feb. 25, 2017.

Quentin Tarantino would give five years of his life to collaborate with this late legend. John Waters thinks one of her films is the among the greatest features of all time. Of course, both auteurs are speaking about the one and only Tura Satana. 

Late actress Satana's history is one for the record books: An Asian American trailblazer onscreen, Satana got her start in burlesque (she went by the stage name “Miss Japan Beautiful” as a teenager) and went on to lead the iconic 1965 classic “Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,” which solidified her status as a karate master in action films. 

 










While Satana's life had all the glitz imaginable (she infamously dated both Elvis and Rod Taylor), her traumatic childhood in part led to her acting career. At age nine, Satana was kidnapped, assaulted, and left for dead in a race-driven hate crime post-Pearl Harbor in 1948. She vowed to take revenge on her attackers, and did by way of her success.

Now, Satana's full story is being told in the long-awaited, authorized documentary simply titled “Tura!” The film, directed by Cody Jarrett and in the works since 2017, is narrated by Margaret Cho and includes interviews with John Waters, Dita Von Teese, Pamela Des Barres, Ted V. Mikels, original FPKK and Russ Meyer cast members and Satana's two daughters. “Tura!” uses home movies, never-before-seen cult film footage, and the late Satana's personal archives. 

 










The film is billed as showing Satana revisit her “innermost feelings as she experienced the events that molded and impacted her and those around her, from childhood to her [passing] in 2011.” Director Jarrett helmed Satana's final film, “Sugar Boxx.”

“Anyone who ever met Tura Satana came away with something unforgettable. She radiated,” Jarrett said in a press statement. “She was authentic. She was charming and a good listener. She was also wildly, hilariously unpredictable, at times bawdy, and could still kick ass right up until the end. There were a lot of popular, sexy women and cult movie stars in the 1960's, but few have left the widespread, lasting impact on society that Tura has, and she deserves recognition for that. It's easy to admire Tura for being the sexy, groundbreaking bad-ass we see on screen, but what it took, the sacrifices she made to get to that place and become that person we all admire so much — that's where the true love and respect begin.”

He continued, “I knew Tura, and this film is a labor of love, not just for me but all our cast and crew who either knew her or were affected by her on a personal level. So it was important for us to get it right; to really get to the core of who Tura was and express her feelings about her life experiences, not just observe them with an outsider's point of view. Tura's deathbed wish was for the making of this film. She wanted her fans to know everything, especially how much they meant to her. So, thank you for joining us in Tura's journey.”

 










“Tura!” is produced by Jarrett and Siouxzan Perry. Cho and Sarah Martin executive produce, with Max Borges and Joseph Dickstein as co-executive producers. 

Quiver will release “Tura!” in select theaters on Friday, August 1. Check out the trailer and poster, both IndieWire exclusives, below.

Zach Bryan closed out his three-night run in New Jersey with a bang. Before the musician hit the stage on Sunday, July 20, the Bruce Springsteen record “House of a Thousand Guitars” blared throughout MetLife Stadium. It was a hometown homage to the veteran artist (“I'm Goin' Down” opened the previous show), but also a preview of what the night had in store. Toward the end of his set, Bryan welcomed Springsteen to the stage alongside Kings of Leon‘s Caleb Followill.


	“One of them is Caleb Followill from Kings of Leon, one of the sweetest men I've ever met,” Bryan told the audience while introducing his special guests for the night. “And one of the greatest men to ever exist, a New Jersey native, Mr. Bruce Springsteen.” 


	Falling into a rhythm together, the trio performed “Atlantic City” from Springsteen's 1982 album Nebraska. A few songs later, Springsteen joined Bryan once again to close out the show with an encore performance of “Revival.” Bryan and Springsteen previously performed “Atlantic City” this past August, as well as their collaboration track, “Sandpaper” from The Great American Bar Scene.












	“I've lived here in this place my whole life, around a group of people I cared about, and I wanted to write music that I felt would simply remain meaningful,” Springsteen told Bryan in Rolling Stone‘s Musicians on Musicians issue in 2024. “I didn't want to lose touch with who I was, where I came from. I thought that these things were essential to my sanity. Not necessarily to my success, but to my own personal sanity, to my own personal well being… And so that's what kept me on a certain path for a long time.”

	For Bryan, Springsteen has served as a roadmap for how he imagines his own future as a musician. “That's where I'm at in my own career right now. I love country music, but I also love an assortment of stuff — Kings of Leon, Jason Isbell, all those guys,” Bryan said. “I don't want to be a country musician. Everyone calls me it. I want to be a songwriter, and you're quintessentially a songwriter. No one calls Bruce Springsteen — hate to use your name in front of you — but no one calls Bruce Springsteen a freaking rock musician, which you are one, but you're also an indie musician, you're also a country musician. You're all these things encapsulated in one man. And that's what songwriting is.”

	Writer and activist Patrice Griffin has settled a child sexual assault civil case with former Quad Recording Studios owner Luis Gonzalez and the studio itself for undisclosed amounts, her attorney Hugo Ortega tells Rolling Stone. Gonzalez and the studio were codefendants in a lawsuit that accused Gonzalez of failing to “ensure that guests, including [Griffin], were safe and free from being sexually assaulted while there.” The lawsuit also accuses Jason “Brother J” Hunter of the Nineties rap group X Clan of sexual assault. In July of 2023, New York Supreme Court judge Laurence L. Love granted Griffin a default judgment against Hunter after he failed to appear in court (Ortega says they're currently seeking an inquest to determine damages against Hunter). Neither Hunter nor Gonzalez responded to Rolling Stone‘s requests for comment. 


	The civil suit accused Hunter, late X Clan member Lumumba “Professor X” Carson, and “numerous other members of the Blackwatch movement” of repeatedly sodomizing and gang-raping her from the age of 14 in hotel rooms, public bathrooms, and at Quad Studios. Now 49, Griffin says she was forced to ingest cocaine and alcohol during the assaults, which occurred until she ran away from the group at 17. (She says that the late X Clan member Anthony “Sugar Shaft” Hardin was also part of the assaults.) 

	











	In 2017, Hunter denied all allegations in an interview. (The conversation, deleted from YouTube, is archived here.) Griffin tells Rolling Stone that Hunter was served with the lawsuit “three or four times,” and says that on one occasion she was told that Hunter “took the paperwork and threw it in the trash” in front of the server. Though she's now brought closure to the case against Hunter, Gonzalez, and Quad Studios, she says her pain lingers. 

	











	“You would think that I would be so thrilled, but I'm not,” she says. “I was talking to my therapist today. I was like, ‘I still feel anger and frustration.' Sometimes I sit back and ask myself, did this really happen to me? And then I have to remind myself, ‘Yes it did. And you're not tripping.”

	The Blackwatch Movement is a Black militant group that Griffin says had several chapters in American cities, including New York. Blackwatch included the late activist Robert “Sonny” Carson, who was seen as the “Master Overseer,” while his son Lumumba (Professor X) was “Overseer.” Hunter, 14 years younger than Lumumba, was the “Underseer.” X Clan was part of the Blackwatch Movement; the quartet, consisting of Carson, Hunter, Hardin, and Claude “Paradise” Gray, dropped their debut album, To The East, Blackwards, on 4th & B'way Records and Island Records in 1990. Their Afrocentric aesthetic, esoteric themes, and energetic songs made them early beacons of so-called “conscious rap.”


	Griffin has alleged that she first became acquainted with the group when she was 14, while they were crafting their debut. “When I heard their music, I immediately fell in love with it because I loved hip-hop,” she recalls. She had been listening to their music for “a while,” and attended anti-NYPD protests they held on the Brooklyn Bridge. “I think I was just looking for a place to belong,” she says. Blackwatch appeared to be a “family-oriented environment,” and she befriended several young women who became “big sister” figures to her. Through them, she met Lumumba and Hunter and asked them to join the organization. Around the same time, she had been kicked out of her mother's house for cutting school.


	She became the group's secretary and lived at their office in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn; the lawsuit alleges that the assaults began “shortly after.” At 15, she ran away from Blackwatch and moved into a homeless shelter, but she has alleged that Carson came to the shelter and brought her back to their office. “I told [Sonny] myself and instead of helping me, he wanted to have sex with me,” she told Metropolis newspaper in 2020. She eventually fled from the group for good at 17.

	X Clan disbanded in 1992 (though Hunter reprised the group in 2007). Hardin died of AIDS in 1995, while Lumumba died at 49 of spinal meningitis in 2006. In 2002, Sonny Carson died at 66 after complications from two heart attacks.

	











	“I literally trusted these people,” Griffin says of Blackwatch. “I thought they were going to be family to me, especially since my mom had put me out for cutting school and all the things that normal teenagers do, and they welcomed me with open arms. The last thing that I would ever think is that they would do those horrific things to me.” 


	She says the alleged assaults have taken a toll on her mental health, resulting in depression, PTSD, recurring nightmares, and multiple suicide attempts. She also battled cocaine addiction after she says she was plied with the drug during the assaults. In 2014, she achieved a bachelor's degree in psychology and sociology from Touro College. She then joined the U.S. Army, pursuing a career in a VA hospital as a maintenance mechanic. But the residual trauma of her abuse lingered, and the VA let her go. “My psychiatrist was like, you need to not work,” she says. “Focus on healing and getting yourself together.” She's been in therapy for the past 10 years. “It's something that never leaves,” she says. “It comes and goes, but there are triggers.” 


	When Hassan Campbell came forward in 2016 to accuse hip-hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa of child abuse (he's denied the accusations), Griffin says she felt empowered to speak up about her assaults. (A New York John Doe later accused Bambaataa of child molestation and sex trafficking in 2021; that plaintiff won a default judgment this May when Bambaataa never appeared in court.)


	In 2019, Griffin started Patrice's Kids, a nonprofit serving kids in underserved communities, especially foster children. The organization offers kids school supplies, toys, and sneakers, and has an annual party. She also worked with Gary Greenberg, a fellow child abuse survivor and founder of the nonprofit Protect NY Kids, on New York's Child Victims Act, which was enacted in 2019. The law extended the statute of limitations for criminal and civil cases of child sexual abuse, allowing her to pursue the lawsuit against Hunter.   


	The following year, Griffin, who now lives in Texas, published a book called The Unconscious Community, which her nonprofit's website says is a “story about being a 14-year-old girl who endures the horrors of child sexual abuse,” but “is able to triumph,” becoming dedicated to making sure the “hidden world of pedophiles is no longer safe.”


	“I didn't want to hold it in anymore,” she says. “I thought about other kids that might've been my age at the time, 14, or even younger. They said one in three young girls and one in six young boys in the United States have been sexually abused before the age of 18. So it was a therapy thing for me, a release [that] expose[d] them as well; you can't go around doing horrific things like that to people and think you're going to get away with it. It was more of helping parents to pay attention to signs when it comes to their children, and being more aware so that no child has to go through what I went through.”

	Griffin says she feels that society is still too disbelieving of survivors, who come forward seeking “support, understanding,” and “love.” “When you're being honest and actually a survivor, people are quick to say that you're a liar, that you're just trying to get money and they attack you,” she says. “That messes with your mental, because you're like, ‘All I want to do is get justice.' It makes you not want to say anything because you're afraid of the backlash.”


	Griffin says she can't speak for Hunter, but wonders if he thought him ignoring the case would make her stop pursuing the case. “I wasn't going away,” she says. “I wanted to do everything in my power to get the justice that I so desperately needed from age 14 until now.”

Tammy Slaton, 38, who rose to fame through the hit TLC series “1000-Lb Sisters,” has once again stunned fans! Tammy posted jaw-dropping new photos showcasing her ongoing weight loss journey. 

The reality star, who began sharing her health transformation in 2020, has now lost a staggering 500 pounds and undergone surgery to remove excess skin. 

On Saturday, July 20, Tammy posted a TikTok slideshow featuring new images of herself looking confident, radiant, and almost unrecognizable. 

Though she left the caption blank, she used the viral sound “I understood the assignment,” signaling just how far she's come.

The TikTok post quickly generated a wave of emotional and supportive comments. Fans were amazed by Tammy's glow-up, with one follower declaring, “Absolutely loving this era of Tammy.”

Another user wrote, “Ok Tammy! We see you 👀 happy looks good on you 💜,” while someone else gushed, “Looking amazing Tammy.”

@LuckySeven 🅱️  yall want to hear a great artist go check out my friend my Bestie I've known for years amazing person. I'm trying to help them make it big. and all I ask, is y'all to show them some love

The outpouring of love didn't stop there. One longtime fan commented, “I love your show soo much. I've been watching since day 1 and it's soo incredible to see how far you have come. Keep slaying queen 🥰.”

Perhaps the most touching message came from a follower who wrote, “Brought a tear to my eye. It's been honestly so inspiring and amazing to watch your journey. Never been prouder of a stranger in my life! Well done Tammy 👏.”

Tammy's update included both selfie-style and full-body shots, showing off her slimmer figure. The use of filters and her fresh appearance had fans calling her transformation “unreal.”

Her TikTok presence has evolved into a space of positivity, self-love, and resilience—qualities that have resonated with her audience since the beginning.

Together with a friend, Tammy has contributed to a collective weight loss of over 2,000 pounds. While she has made incredible strides, she has been candid about the challenges she continues to face.

A post shared by Dr. Eric Smith (@doctorericsmith_)

While Tammy isn't behind the wheel just yet, she's already envisioning her dream ride: a classic Ford Mustang GT, which she adorably referred to as a “vintage stang” during a recent podcast appearance.

She also shared exciting personal news—her engagement to longtime partner Andrea Dalton. After three years of dating, Tammy proudly revealed her engagement ring on a podcast hosted by Hunter Ezell. The couple has kept their relationship mostly private, but her recent posts suggest she's entering a joyful and confident new era.

Tammy's journey—from her early struggles on “1000-Lb Sisters” to her current state of empowerment- has inspired millions. Her latest social media drop isn't just a photo update; it's a celebration of progress and hope. And fans can't wait to see what she'll do next.

	It's a big news week for the 50th Toronto International Film Festival starting with this morning's announcement of their full Galas and Special Presentations section including world premieres of Aziz Ansari's Lionsgate Keanu Reeves & Seth Rogen comedy Good Fortune, Maude Apatow's feature directorial debut Poetic License, Isabel Coixet's Three Goodbyes, James McAvoy's feature directorial debut California Schemin', Succession star Brian Cox's feature directorial debut Glenrothan, Romain Gavras' Sacrifice, David Michôd's Christy, Yeon Sang-ho's The Ugly, James Vanderbilt's Nuremberg, and Alice Winocour's Couture, as well as films from Mamoru Hosoda, Zacharias Kunuk, Baz Luhrmann, Kleber Mendonça Filho, Jafar Panahi, Benny Safdie, and Gus Van Sant.

					TIFF Unveils Round Of World Premieres With 'Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery' & Pics From Derek Cianfrance, Paul Greengrass, Nicholas Hytner, Hikari & More		
			








	Before Waiting for Godot begins its Broadway run on Sept. 13, both Bill and Ted will be in TIFF; Keanu Reeves starring in Good Fortune and Alex Winter with the world premiere of his Adulthood. 


			Watch on Deadline		







Good Fortune, which first dropped a trailer at CinemaCon 2024, follows a well-meaning but rather inept angel named Gabriel, played by Reeves, who meddles in the lives of a struggling gig worker (Ansari) and a wealthy venture capitalist (Seth Rogen). 


Poetic License stars Method Man, Nico Parker, Andrew Barth Feldman, Cooper Hoffman, Maisy Stella and Leslie Mann. The movie follows Liz, a former therapist and soon-to-be empty nester, as she becomes the unexpected point of tension between two inseparable best friends and college seniors, Sam and Ari. Liz is forced to reexamine her life as the boys' friendship unravels in a fierce competition for her affection.

	











	Sony Pictures Classics' Nuremberg chronicles the true story of the eponymous post WWII trials held by the Allies against the defeated Nazi regime. Pic centers on American psychiatrist Douglas Kelley (Rami Malek), who is tasked with determining whether Nazi prisoners are fit to stand trial for their war. He finds himself in a complex battle of wits with Hermann Göring (Russell Crowe), Hitler's right-hand man. 


	Michôd's Christy stars Sydney Sweeney as 1990s female boxer Christy Martin. Merritt Weaver, Ben Foster and Katy O'Brian also star. 


	Winocour's Couture stars Jolie as an American filmmaker who arrives in Paris for Fashion Week on a life-and-death journey, facing challenges and self-discovery. Jolie was at TIFF last year with the world premiere Without Blood, which she directed. The Oscar winner was also lauded at TIFF's awards gala. 


	McAvoy's California Schemin tells the story of two Scottish lads from Dundee who conned the music industry by pretending to be an established Californian rap duo, bagging a record deal and appearing on MTV until their scam unraveled.


Glenrothan also stars its director Cox, as well as Alan Cumming, Alexandra Shipp, and Shirley Henderson in a tale about two brothers, who following a violent exchange with their father on the day of their mother's funeral, sees the younger of the two leaving their Highland home for America. After forty years they reunite in the land of their birth.


Train to Busan filmmaker Yeon Sang-ho's new movie, the mystery thriller, The Ugly, centers around a man's investigation behind his long-lost mother's death.


	In a full reveal that other big fall and awards season movies are world premiering elsewhere, TIFF announced that Guillermo del Toro's Jacob Elordi and Oscar Isaac Frankenstein is getting a North American premiere in addition to Benny Safdie's Dwayne Johnson movie The Smashing Machine in which the former WWE wrestler plays mixed-martial arts and UFC champion Mark Kerr. Meanwhile, Edward Berger's Colin Farrell, Tilda Swinton psychological drama thriller, Ballad of a Small Player, is making its Canadian premiere at TIFF. Pic follows a high stakes gambler who is laying low in Macau whose past and debts start to catch up with him. He encounters a kindred spirit who might just hold the key to his salvation.


	In addition, the closing night movie is Peak Everything from Canadian director Anne Émond playing on the last night of the fest on Saturday, Sept. 13.


	TIFF, presented by Rogers, takes place Sept. 4–14. The festival says they've invited movies from 30 countries.

Tyler, the Creator has shared a new video to coincide with his newly released album Don't Tap the Glass. The self-directed visual for “Stop Playing With Me,” the album's fifth track, features the rapper dancing in a room between two oversized speakers before the carpeted floor begins to move as if on a treadmill. It also includes guest appearances from Clipse's Pusha T and Malice, LeBron James (who was excited for the album), and the basketball superstar's business associate Maverick Carter. Check out the video below.

Don't Tap the Glass follows Tyler, the Creator's recent verse on Clipse's “P.O.V.” It's also Tyler's first album since last October's Chromakopia, and was teased and released within just four days, achieving the shortest rollout for one of his albums yet. The new LP, which is just under 30 minutes, features a sample of Busta Rhymes' “Pass the Courvoisier Part II,” among other tracks.

Tyler, the Creator has been on tour behind Chromakopia since February, with future shows lined up in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines. See his itinerary in full here.

Adapted from Esi Edugyan's 2018 novel, the miniseries chronicles the globe-trotting adventures of a boy who escapes slavery in Barbados and winds up in Nova Scotia.


							By 

	Angie Han


Television Critic


	There's no mistaking the mission statement of Washington Black. “This just ain't his story. It's our story,” narrates Sterling K. Brown's Medwin in the opening moments, invoking themes of family, courage and inspiration. As a framing, it feels old-fashioned in style and didactic in tone, grand in ambition but also curiously limiting: Before we've even had a chance to meet the titular protagonist, he's already been burdened with the responsibility of representation.


	Luckily, Wash (Ernest Kingsley Jr.) has never been one to put too much stock in the rules of gravity anyway. While Hulu's adaptation of Esi Edugyan's Booker-shortlisted 2018 novel never fully shakes that self-seriousness, it eventually reveals itself to be a surprisingly fleet adventure, as buoyant and unpredictable as its hero's own globe-trotting travels.

The Bottom Line

	
	Weighty themes, buoyant heart.
	



Airdate: Wednesday, July 23 (Hulu)Cast: Ernest Kingsley Jr., Sterling K. Brown, Tom Ellis, Eddie Karanja, Iola Evans, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Rupert Graves, Edward BluemelCreator: Selwyn Seyfu Hinds			
			







	Selwyn Seyfu Hinds' miniseries starts, if not quite at the end of Wash's journey, somewhere deep into it. We first pick up with George Washington Black, as he's formally called, or “Jack Crawford,” as he identifies himself in hiding, as a 19-year-old in 1837. His life in Halifax, Nova Scotia — the last stop on the Underground Railroad, we're reminded — seems humble but relatively contented. He makes enough money working the docks to rent a modest room from the affectionately stern Medwin, dreams up exciting new inventions in his free time and, within the first five minutes of the Wanuri Kahiu-directed premiere, falls fast and hard for Tanna (Iola Evans), an upper-class Brit new to these shores.

	But his story properly begins eight years earlier on a Barbados sugar plantation, where as an 11-year-old (Eddie Karanja) he has a fateful meeting with Titch (Tom Ellis), the scientist brother of his cruel enslaver (Julian Rhind-Tutt). Intrigued by the boy's curiosity and impressed by his obvious intelligence, Titch enlists his help in constructing a “cloud cutter,” a proto-blimp of Titch's own design. Eventually, in a moment of crisis, Titch also escapes with him on it, kicking off what will become a wild continent-hopping odyssey. 


	Cutting between the two timelines, Washington Black bears witness simultaneously to the very first steps in Wash's adolescent coming-of-age, and the finishing stages of it. But the need to derive a clear and profound meaning from every facet of his saga proves more of a drag than it does a blessing. While Medwin's voiceover thankfully ceases after that first scene, a heavy-handed score serves much the same purpose, prodding us toward big and obvious emotions rather than contrasting or highlighting them.


	The story flies by in a blur, pausing long enough at each stop for Wash to internalize whatever life lesson fate has in store for him, but not for us to get any specific feel for these locations and the people within them. They're symbols and metaphors, rather than worlds unto themselves, and the lived-in intimacy of similarly roving shows like Amazon's The Underground Railroad or (in a very different mood) Peacock's Poker Face is sorely missed. With such a broad yet shallow scope, Washington Black occasionally takes on the dutiful feel of an educational video.

	











	Still, for a fictionalized history lesson, it's fun one, full of surprising twists and charming turns. If Wash's romance with Tanna, a white-passing biracial woman chafing under the future laid out for her by her father (Rupert Graves), initially feels reverse-engineered from statements the show wants to make about inequities and those with the courage to defy them, Kingsley and Evans are so sweet together that we can't help but root for them.


	And if characters like tender Kit, the closest Wash has to a mother on the plantation, or Nat Turner, who models for him a more militant form of rebellion, don't stick around as long as we hope, Shaunette Renée Wilson and Jamie Hector (respectively) make big impressions in limited timeframes. 


	Meanwhile, Brown's typically excellent performance helps to elevate Medwin into a formidable figure in his own right — though one hopes we'll get more insight into the nuances of his nigh-paternal relationship with Wash in the second half of the season. (Critics were given four of eight hour-long episodes.)


Washington Black is at its most intriguing when it's least straightforward, and most willing to embrace complications. Take its portrayal of Titch, a queasily ambiguous figure. Here is a white man whose supposed commitment to abolitionism extends to treating his brother's slaves with unusual kindness, but not to refraining from using them for his own ends. His friendship with Wash defies simplistic categorization: While sincere in feeling, its inherently untenable contradictions amount to a ticking time bomb, apparently destined to blow up in the back half of the series.

	











	The more experiences the young Wash accumulates, the more affecting and engaging the drama becomes. Through Karanja's wide-eyed performance, we watch as the child takes everything in, processing what all of these adults are telling him and noticing what they don't. We see how he recalibrates his perspective with every new pearl of wisdom, stringing them together bit by bit into a comprehensive understanding of himself, the universe and his place in it.


	And in Kingsley's portrayal, we see what kind of man all of these lessons might eventually make. I may have wished, occasionally, that Wash had been allowed more room to just be his own idiosyncratic self, rather than a stand-in for bigger, loftier themes. But credit where it's due: With each passing chapter, the truth of Medwin's words becomes increasingly apparent.


	Wash isn't any sort of Everyman; on the contrary, he's a singular hero blessed with natural genius and hard-won bravery, a soaring sense of ambition and the relentless determination to make his wildest hopes come true. Like any of us, though, he's a patchwork of influences and inspirations — the histories that span centuries and continents, the communities defined by both their solidarity and their diversity, the ideals that clash or contradict or marry to form new ones. Like any of us, he contains entire lifetimes within his own.

The adorable team-up on the 11-year-old's favorite song from her mom's catalog isn't the first time they've sung the track together on stage.

Kelly Clarkson turned her Friday night (July 18) performance at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace into a family affair. During her Studio Sessions residency gig, the talk show host and pop superstar invited 11-year-old daughter River Rose out to join her on stage for a very special duet. 


	In an Instagram post of the mommy-daughter moment, Clarkson wrote, “Last night we had a very special guest, my daughter River Rose, joined us for ‘Heartbeat Song.' It's her favorite song,” alongside an image of her kneeling down on stage to touch foreheads with her eldest child. 

	











	In a video posted by a fan, River Rose walks out on stage and gives her mom a big hug before Clarkson tells the crowd, “we're gonna do her favorite song.” Snuggling up to the tween — who, like her famous mother was wearing dark wash jeans and a bedazzled T-shirt — Clarkson told River Rose she looked “super cute” before revved the band up to play the lead 2015 single from her seventh studio album, Piece by Piece.




			Trending on Billboard		







	River Rose hung in there like a champ, doubling Clarkson's vocals and swaying along in unison as she smiled and belted out the song, even holding a big note at the end that made the singer smile proudly. Staring into each other's eyes and touching foreheads, mother and daughter landed the plane while joyfully singing the chorus in unison. “This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it/ Been so long, I forgot how to turn it/ Up, up, up, up all night long/ Up, up all night long,” they sang, bouncing in place together as the band dropped out and the two sang the chorus one more time while giving a sweet boop finger tap to each other's foreheads. 

	











	In a testament to a life lived with a pop star mom, River Rose gave the crowd a sassy power pose after hugging Clarkson, who asked the crowd to “give it up for River Rose y'all, c'mon!” before planting a kiss on the tween's cheek as she walked off.


	Back in 2023 during her first Vegas residency run at the Bakkt Theater, Clarkson first told the crowd that “Heartbeat Song” was River's favorite, bringing the then 9-year-old out on stage to belt the tune out. “She's been jamming to this song since she was a baby,” Clarkson told her fans back then. In addition to River Rose, Clarkson shares son Remington “Remy” Alexander, 9, with ex Brandon Blackstock.


	Clarkson will be back on stage at the Colosseum on Friday (July 25).

	Early Monday morning (July 21), Tyler, The Creator released his ninth studio album, Don't Tap The Glass. Shortly following the drop, the high-motored lyricist explained the intentions behind his dance-laden effort and the urgency that fueled it.

	“I asked some friends why they don't dance in public, and some said because of the fear of being filmed,” his Instagram post began. “I thought damn, a natural form of expression and a certain connection they have with music is now a ghost. It made me wonder how much of our human spirit got killed because of the fear of being a meme, all for having a good time.”

	On the eve of Don't Tap The Glass, Tyler held an intimate listening party where he played the album front-to-back twice, dubbing the dance soiree as one of the “greatest nites of his life.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I just got back from a listening party for this album and man was it one of the greatest nites of my life. 30 people. No phones allowed. No cameras. Just speakers and a sweatbox. Everyone was dancing. Moving. Expressing. Sweating,” the Grammy-winning MC said. “It was truly beautiful. I played the album front to back twice. It felt like that pent up energy finally got released and we craved the idea of letting more of it out.”


	He added: “There was a freedom that filled the room. A ball of energy that might not translate to every speaker that plays this album but man did that room nail it.”

	











	He finally urged people to soak in the album in a way that allows them to move freely, express themselves, and, most importantly, dance. “This album was not made for sitting still. Dancing. Driving. Running. Any type of movement is recommended to maybe understand the spirit of it. Only at full volume,” he wrote.


Don't Tap The Glass arrives less than a year after Tyler's Billboard 200 chart-topper CHROMAKOPIA. He's currently embarking on a worldwide tour for the project and will surely dish out new records from his latest effort during his multi-country trek.

As teased, Tyler, the Creator has released a new album. The 10-song Don't Tap the Glass follows last October's Chromakopia and was previewed only with a handful of posts teasing its release date of Monday, July 21. Listen to the album, which clocks in at just under half an hour, below.

In a graphic about the album, Tyler framed it as a dance-forward party album. Here's the note in full:

I asked some friends why they don't dance in public and some said because of the fear of being filmed. I thought damn, a natural form of expression and a certain connection they have with music is now a ghost. It made me wonder how much of our human spirit got killed because of the fear of being a meme, all for having a good time. I just got back from a ‘listening party' for this album and man was it one of the greatest nights of my life. 300 people. No phones allowed. No cameras. Just speakers and a sweatbox. Everyone was dancing, moving, expressing, sweating. It was truly beautiful. I played the album front to back twice, it felt like that pent up energy finally got released and we craved the idea of letting more of it out. There was a freedom that filled the room. A ball of energy that might not translate to every speaker that plays this album but man did that room nail it. This album was not made for sitting still. Dancing driving running any type of movement is recommended to maybe understand the spirit of it. Only at full volume.

While full credits have not yet been released, opener “Big Poe” finds Tyler embodying the titular alter-ego alongside an as-yet-anonymous guest rapper and a sample of Busta Rhymes' “Pass the Courvoisier Part II,” which featured P. Diddy and Pharrell Williams.

Tyler, the Creator's rollouts for his albums have generally been pretty short, but Don't Tap the Glass arrives with the least notice yet. Here's a brief history, excluding the fairly traditionally promoted Goblin and Wolf: Tyler announced Cherry Bomb just a handful of days before its release, but fans got a bit more time (15 days) before he dropped Flower Boy. He trimmed that down to 11 days for Igor, but only eight days separated the announcement and release of Call Me If You Get Lost. For Chromakopia, Tyler once again let 11 days pass between announcement and the album's release. Even with the short rollouts, Tyler always made sure to release pre-album singles, but that was not the case for Don't Tap the Glass.

Tyler remains on tour in support of Chromakopia. He still has shows left to play in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines. He's also due to headline major North American music festivals including Lollapalooza and Outside Lands. See his latest tour dates here.

Less than a year after CHROMAKOPIA's arrival, the Grammy-winning rapper is back.

	Michael Saponara



	While he's still on the road touring in support of CHROMAKOPIA, Tyler, The Creator unleashed his Don't Tap the Glass album on Monday morning (July 21). 


	Tyler debuted cuts from his new LP at a $5 show in Los Angeles on Sunday night (July 20) before he continued to buck the trend with another weekday release for fans to indulge in as they wake up for school, work or whatever comes as part of their weekday routine. 


	The Grammy-winning rapper announced the album at his Brooklyn show on Friday night and had a “Don't Tap the Glass” exhibit at various locations around New York, including the Barclays Center and the Oculus at the World Trade Center.

	The cover art finds a shirtless Tyler in a matching cap and red pants combo that could be inspired by LL COOL J, 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin and Ludacris' oversized muscle arms featured in the “Get Back” video. 


	Prior to the album's arrival, Tyler attempted to quell fans' expectations and hype surrounding the project. “Yall better get them expectations and hopes down this aint no concept nothing,” he wrote on X regarding Don't Tap the Glass.

	It's Tyler, The Creator's second album in less than a year and ninth solo effort overall, as CHROMAKOPIA hit streaming services in October. The project debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 299,000 album-equivalent units earned in the shortened tracking week. It was also ranked as Billboard‘s seventh best album in all genres of 2024.

Ellen DeGeneres confirmed that she and her wife Portia de Rossi moved to the U.K. because of Donald Trump. During an event the Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham, England, on Sunday, DeGeneres told broadcaster Richard Bacon that Trump's election in November spurred their permanent relocation to the Cotswolds.


	“We got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, ‘He got in,'” DeGeneres recalled, according to the BBC. “And we're like, ‘We're staying here.'”


	She acknowledged that living in the countryside has been a positive change from the U.S. “It's absolutely beautiful,” the comedian said. “We're just not used to seeing this kind of beauty. The villages and the towns and the architecture – everything you see is charming and it's just a simpler way of life. It's clean. Everything here is just better—the way animals are treated, people are polite. I just love it here. We moved here in November, which was not the ideal time, but I saw snow for the first time in my life. We love it here. Portia flew her horses here, and I have chickens, and we had sheep for about two weeks.”

	











	DeGeneres expressed her concern about the state of LGBTQ+ rights in the U.S. and noted that she and de Rossi are considering getting remarried in the U.K. 


	“The Baptist Church in America is trying to reverse gay marriage,” she said. “They're trying to literally stop it from happening in the future and possibly reverse it. Portia and I are already looking into it, and if they do that, we're going to get married here.”

	











	She added, “I wish we were at a place where it was not scary for people to be who they are. I wish that we lived in a society where everybody could accept other people and their differences. So until we're there, I think there's a hard place to say we have huge progress.”


	Elsewhere during the conversation, DeGeneres reflected on her talk show Ellen coming to an end in 2022 after 19 seasons amid claims that she was fostering a toxic work environment. She previously addressed the controversy in her 2024 tour and her recent Netflix stand-up special, and echoed similar sentiments on Sunday.

	“No matter what, any article that came up, it was like, ‘She's mean', and it's like, how do I deal with this without sounding like a victim or ‘poor me' or complaining?” she said. “But I wanted to address it. It's as simple as, I'm a direct person, and I'm very blunt, and I guess sometimes that means that… I'm mean?… I don't think I can say anything that's ever going to get rid of that [reputation] or dispel it, which is hurtful to me. I hate it. I hate that people think that I'm that because I know who I am and I know that I'm an empathetic, compassionate person.”


	She added that it was “certainly an unpleasant way to end” her talk show. The comedian also acknowledged that she misses “a lot” about her show, but doesn't feel that a similar format would work at this point. 


	“I mean, I wish it did, because I would do the same thing here,” she said. “I would love to do that again, but I just feel like people are watching on their phones, or people aren't really paying attention as much to televisions, because we're so inundated with with information and entertainment.”

	With that in mind, she hasn't figured out her next move yet career-wise. “I want to have fun, I want to do something,” she said. “I do like my chickens but I'm a little bit bored.”


	DeGeneres isn't the only American comedian to leave the country in the wake of Trump's second election. Earlier this year, Rosie O'Donnell revealed that she relocated to Ireland shortly before Donald Trump took office for the second time. Trump responded by threatening to take away her U.S. citizenship.

The series pairs the 'Crash Landing on You' star with the rising 'Squid Game' actress in a story about ambition, obsession and the dark side of the K-pop industry.


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


Netflix is adding another splashy series to its Korean originals slate with Variety, a K-pop industry drama starring Crash Landing on You headliner Son Ye-jin and rising actor-idol Jo Yu-ri, best known for her breakout turn in Squid Game Seasons 2 and 3.


	The upcoming series comes from director Kim Yong-hoon, the filmmaker behind Mask Girl, one of Netflix's surprise Korean hits of 2023. The black comedy thriller spent four consecutive weeks on the streamer's Global Top 10 Non-English TV list, peaking at No. 1 in its second week.

Variety marks a stylistic shift for Kim. He'll be trading in the gritty neo-noir crime world of his breakthrough, Beasts Clawing at Straws, for the high-gloss, high-pressure domain of K-pop super-stardom. The series will explore the tensions, ambitions and fraught relationships between industry power players, the stars and their obsessive fandoms.


	Son stars as Se-eun, a top entertainment executive willing to risk everything to revive the faltering idol group she helped create. Variety adds to a busy and exciting lineup of projects for the veteran actress, including the upcoming Netflix period drama Scandals and Park Chan-wook's much-anticipated feature No Other Choice. 


	Jo co-stars in Variety as Seung-hui, a fan whose fierce devotion to her favorite idol takes her down a dangerous path. It's an amusing casting for the rising actress, given her prior career as a K-pop star and fan-favorite member of Korean–Japanese girl group Iz*One. 

	











Variety is being produced by CJ ENM Studios and UNU, continuing Netflix's longstanding status as one of the Korean content creators' top commissioners.

“Supernatural” sure knows how to bring co-stars together in real life. We have Jensen and Danneel Ackles, Rob Benedict and Ruth Connell, Meg Donnelly and Drake Rodger, Mark Sheppard and Sarah Sheppard, DJ Qualls and Ty Olsson, and yes, Jared Padalecki and Genevieve Padalecki. 

The last two are definitely no exception. Especially after they like to remind fans how strong of a marriage they have. Like this week. Jared just turned 43, and his wife, Genevieve, made sure the world knew how loved he is. How? With a kiss, a convertible, and a carousel of memories that has fans crying into their flannels.

A post shared by Genevieve Padalecki (@genpadalecki)

On Saturday, July 19, Genevieve posted a heartfelt Instagram tribute to her husband of 15 years. “Almost 17 years together, 15 married,' she wrote on Instagram. “What a privilege and gift to wish @jaredpadalecki another year around the sun. I love you with all my heart. Grateful to celebrate you today. ❤️”

The photos were definitely a mix of goofy, glamorous, and intimate. One shows them cracking up mid-sentence, another has them riding in a drop-top, wind in their hair straight out of a CW romance. And yes, there's a full-blown kiss picture that had fans losing their minds in the comments. One wrote, “Happy birthday sam, yes I said sam😘 you and ruby (@jaredpadalecki @genpadalecki ) have a beautiful family and absolutely beautiful kiddos!! Who knew yalls parts in supernatural would lead to a marriage and decades together.”

But this birthday post is just the latest chapter in a love story that's been unfolding since “Supernatural's” fourth season.

Let's rewind to 2008, shall we? Jared was already an established heartthrob as Sam Winchester on “Supernatural” when Genevieve (then Cortese) joined the cast as Ruby. She was a demon in lacy underwear, as Jared famously recalled.

“I was a single dude, and she was a pretty girl in her underwear on her first day on set,” Jared revealed at a convention in 2012. “I was very excited to meet her. Meanwhile, I think she was like, ‘Who is this long-haired a-hole who thinks he can talk to me while I'm reading a book?'”

Despite that rocky first impression, sparks flew. They started dating in fall 2008, got engaged the following year, and tied the knot in Idaho on February 27, 2010.

Since then, they've built a life that includes three children, Tom, Shep, and the adorable Odette, along with a herd of mini horses, chickens, and even a taxidermied chicken that lives in their guest bathroom. Yeah, we're not asking about that; we know better. 

A post shared by Genevieve Padalecki (@genpadalecki)

What makes Jared and Genevieve's love story so irresistible isn't just the CW beginnings or the red carpet appearances. It's their balance of glamour and grit. For their honeymoon? They hiked Machu Picchu, and they have repeatedly said they enjoy kayaking and food truck dates. You know, just down-to-earth things that make them the couple they are today.

Even after 15 years, the couple still sneaks in goofy couple challenges on Instagram and cuddles up for annual tributes. Whether it's Father's Day, an anniversary, or a birthday bash, the Padaleckis never miss a chance to show up for each other, digitally and IRL.

So yes, Jared's 43rd birthday post was cute. But what makes it swoon-worthy is the quiet through-line that runs through every pic, caption, and kiss. It's a love story that started on a demon-hunting set and never stopped growing. 

Now, excuse us while we go cry into our “Supernatural” DVDs.

Disasters and tragedies have long been a source of conspiracy theories. But when devastating flash floods hit Texas over the Fourth of July weekend, far-right conspiracies over cloud seeding and weather manipulation spread within a matter of hours. The floods killed at least 135 people, including children who were staying at an all-girl summer camp along the Guadalupe River. Extremism reporter Ben Makuch explains more behind these conspiracy theories, while Guardian US environment reporter Oliver Milman tells us what really happened

María Inés Plaza Lazo: The title “As Above, So Below” is ancient and esoteric, yet uncannily contemporary. Helena Blavatsky reintroduced this phrase to 19th-century mysticism; you refract it through club culture and Christian iconography. In your hands, it resonates less as metaphysical truth than as method: flattening hierarchies, collapsing the sacred and mundane, the visible and the invisible, pop music and highway lights. What's the cosmology at work here?

Mark Leckey: What you're pointing to is how I'm trying to approach things from two directions: from being completely embedded in pop culture—that's my background—but also from a place of growing interest, maybe even awakening, to spiritualism and medieval metaphysics. That's really where this show comes from. Like you said, it's a line between stations of the visible and invisible, and that's exactly what I'm dwelling in right now.

There's a contradiction, though—or maybe a dialectic—that I can't resolve. A kind of spiritual or metaphysical pull, grounded in a historical materialist base: where I come from, how I grew up, the conditions and influences that shaped me politically and otherwise. I'm trying to work through that contradiction. The visible and the invisible. I really like that formulation.And the body—the human body—is the connective tissue between those two realms.

As for “As Above, So Below,” it's not just about theosophy. That phrase is everywhere now; it's basically a pop-cultural term. But my interest in it goes back further—to the alchemists, to Hermes Trismegistus. There's a whole cosmology there, a belief in the interconnectedness of everything in the universe. I suppose what I'm trying to do is to resolve spiritual and material concerns that exist simultaneously in me.

MIPL: If the body is the connective tissue between the visible and the invisible, how do you shape the spaces where memory, affect, and magic can actually take hold?

ML: I think it really started to come together at Haus der Kunst, though I wasn't fully aware of it at the time. When you're using so much moving image and sound, you can't just drop it into a black box—it never felt alive in that context. I realized I had to transform the space itself, make it part of the work, so that what you're seeing and hearing could really land, really hold your attention. That's when I started thinking more environmentally—not to seduce the viewer exactly, but to pull them into something more like a dream. I hesitate to say “immersive” because it's become a buzzword, but I wanted to create something closer to a psychedelic experience.

Affect, memory, magic—they're not content, they're modes of perception. You're taken out of yourself. In a successful psychedelic experience, you're lifted out of reason, out of rational circumstances, and placed into something more like a dream. And a dream carries the potential for magic. Once you leave the bounds of the known, you're already in the realm of the magical. I'm trying to create something closer to the condition of music than to cinema or traditional art exhibitions. Music makes space for the supernatural—for the paranormal. Whereas art often prescribes those things, or is suspicious of them.

I came across something after making the show that really stuck with me. I can't remember where I read it, but it said, “all pop culture is paranormal.” That struck a chord.

MIPL: In your video work Carry Me into the Wilderness (2022), we hear your voice collapse under the weight of sensation—sunlight, sound, space. But you're not on a pilgrimage. You're in Alexandra Park, in a northern suburb of London. Yet the experience was not only paranormal, it became sacramental. Were you documenting the sublime, or did this just happen to you?

ML: I had a sublime experience—and in the moment of that experience, I tried to record it. I thought I was capturing it as an artist: “This thing is happening to me; I need to document it so I can make use of it.” But when I actually started working with the material, I realized I wasn't acting as an artist so much as being contemporary. Just responding in the way we all do now: transforming every experience into information.

So yes, even in this very profound moment, I was still trying to extract value from it. There's a suspicion baked into that. Even suspicion about whether I actually had a spiritual experience.I come from a grounded, materialist background—and yet here I am, having these unexpected sacramental or sacred moments. I don't really know how to reconcile those two realities.So I tried to make the work feel both: exalted and skeptical.

MIPL: Was that feeling of being absolutely contemporary—almost as ecstasy—a refusal of productivity?

ML: I think I confused the artistic impulse with contemporary production. I had my phone in my pocket, thinking of it as an artistic tool—but really, it's an extraction device. The best example of this is how people behave at concerts. Holding up their phones constantly, recording. It's not really about the experience itself, but about the information the experience can generate. We're always translating or producing things for circulation and distribution. And artists aren't exempt from that. We're not standing above it.

But ecstasy itself—well, a lot of these realizations come after the work is made. I usually follow a hunch or impulse, and then reflect or read afterwards. I read about the etymology of “ecstasy”: it means to be taken outside of the place where you stand. It's about being pulled out of what you know—your surroundings, even yourself. It's both an exalted moment and a moment of horror, of fear. The world we live in now—yes, there's doomscrolling and all of that—but it's also a kind of ecstasy. A constant state of being pulled out of where you are. It's thrilling and exciting, but also terrifying and alienating.

MIPL: Doomscrolling can be both: Absolute saturation—your brain literally overwhelmed. People talk about brain rot as a side effect. You also seem to reach for a kind of temporal intensity—the moment where the world arrives all at once. Could we call this a politics of the moment? A refusal of progress in favor of the saturated now?

ML: I'm saturated. I can't deal with it.

MIPL: All of us are.

ML: I just look at the difference in how I worked in 1999, when I made Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore. I was dealing with a limited archive, with limited access. Now—only 25 years later—what's available is oceanic. It's transformed everything. We literally can't work without the internet anymore. I probably would have kept making archival collage work, but that method was voided by the sheer availability of imagery and sound we have now.

MIPL: Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore now feels like a secular icon—an object of reverence, even grief. You once called it a ghost. Has nostalgia become one of your materials?

ML: I mean, that's part of why I turned to medieval metaphysics—because it becomes so unknowable. I needed to find some kind of analogy between the understanding of God and the understanding of life under capitalism. I don't mean that in a spiritual sense necessarily, but in terms of trying to fathom the unfathomable. The tools I'd been given just didn't seem to work anymore. Something shifted so suddenly. The conditions changed in a way that felt abrupt. To go from Fiorucci at the turn of the century to where we are now—it just feels completely disorienting. I became interested in the idea of negative theology—the notion that God is fundamentally unknowable, un-circumscribable. You can't picture him, can't really know him in any definitive way. He exists beyond all human knowledge and sense. So, the only way to approach God is obliquely, through a kind of negative path.

MIPL: You've said before how images now function less as documents, more as performances or hallucinations. Is video the ideal form because it embraces that instability?

ML: Video is not a true medium in any traditional sense. It lends itself to circulation and transformation. It's very mutable. It's kind of the opposite of something like painting or sculpture. I change it constantly. Every time I do a show, the video changes—I adapt the work. But I do worry: is this still the right kind of medium? There's so much video now. And if all you consume is video, can you even see it anymore?

One of the most upsetting things I heard recently was an interview with a 16-year-old who said, “I don't listen to music anymore. I'm just bored of it.” I thought, “yeah, of course.” It's just there, all the time. Like water. But I don't think that means we should retreat to older forms like painting and sculpture—that feels reactionary. I'm not interested in that. And that's the point where I sometimes think: maybe I shouldn't make art at all. That's where that line of thinking goes.

MIPL: I'd like to ask about the masculine lineage in the figures you invoke: the hermit in the cave, the raver in the dark, the father with a phone during lockdown. But there's also instability, surrender, even genderlessness in these states of ecstasy. Is your work a way of making masculinity porous, mystical, overwhelmed?

ML: I sometimes look at the work and think: there's a lot of masculine energy there. There's a kind of violence that creeps in. But also… it might entirely be the wrong thing to say, but I think that art is queer. It queers you. And the more I make art, the queerer I get in how I understand the world. It changes the way I approach things. And I've allowed that to happen. The artists I admired were all gay. They influenced me. I never resisted it. That's what I'd hope the work does. I think my work is about being a man. A lot of it is about trying to understand what it means to be a man now. But I hope that men are changing. That they're transmuting. I want to be transmuted.

MIPL: That is a wonderful, utopian thought.

ML: I think it ties into what you said earlier about mysticism and transcendentalism. The promise of the digital is fluidity—it dissolves boundaries. That's its nature.

MIPL: But what's interesting is that you create glitches while embracing that fluidity. You constantly interrupt it.

ML: I'm trying to glitch myself. I do have a strong streak of romanticism, and I think I try to put obstacles in the way of that. I'm not repelled by my romanticism, but I see its dangers. Its ineffectiveness, maybe. So, if there are glitches, it's to get in the way of that. Because if I didn't, I'd just succumb.

MIPL: You seem to share this drive to glitch with other artists who metabolize the world in hybrid, polyphonic ways—such as, Christelle Oyiri or Arthur Jafa. Could you speak to the conversations or resonances you've had with them?

ML: The main resonance is music. I want art to expand toward music, or the space of music, because that's where I feel more at home. That's what I grew up with. To come into the art world—if you're from a background like mine—is to find yourself in a completely different world. You have to acclimatize, adjust, change yourself. But now it feels like art is more porous. It's more fluid. Its boundaries are less secure.

Music allows for that. It's not just democratic—it's graspable. Anyone can engage with it. I reached out to Christelle because I like what she does musically. I want to be in the same space she's in. I want more people like her around. My interest in art and music—this might be a very 20th-century idea—but I believe in form. I believe in formal experimentation.

MIPL: Like in Nobodaddy (2018), where you literally give voice to absence through technology. A bronze figure with holes in the entire body is inhabited by sound; a speaker-body that speaks absence and dematerialization, transcending the physical.

ML: Immanence, I think, is the word. Not transcendence—but immanence. Yes. I want to evoke and amplify being alive. It's as simple as that. Christelle makes me feel more alive. AJ makes me feel more alive. All these things—they amplify that feeling of presence. Of being here. Imminently here.

MIPL: What does “authenticity” mean to you today—especially when your own biography becomes raw material?

ML: I think I'm still drawn to authenticity—but I'm not quite sure how to put that into words. There's always a danger in trying to be “authentically working class,” and maybe even more so in trying to make “authentically working-class art.” I don't think either of those things necessarily serve the working class in any real or meaningful way. So, I'm very suspicious of authenticity when it comes to class. At the same time, someone's background does matter to me. I still feel a bit disappointed when I find out that someone I admired went to public school and had all the privileges that come with that.

I suppose I do still have a nose for some kind of authenticity—or maybe for a kind of groundedness, or reality. But I also know it's a trap. I think authenticity is something of a dance. You have to move in and out of it.

Mark Leckey's exhibition “Enter Thru Medieval Wounds" will be on view from 11 September 2025 to 03 May 2026 at the Julia Stoschek Foundation in Berlin. Saturday & Sunday, 12PM to 6PM.

Each week, TruckNews.com lists notable events, promotions and awards in the trucking industry.

This week, Simon Corriveau joined Turgeon – Solutions d'affichage as business development manager for its fleet division and UAP has announced that Francis Messier to take over the reins of regional vice-president of heavy vehicles parts division, as Gaétan Delisle is set to retire later this year. Meanwhile, BeyondTrucks hires AI specialist Mahriah Alf as head of products.

Turgeon – Solutions d'affichage has appointed Simon Corriveau as business development manager for its fleet division, the company announced. Corriveau officially joined the team on July 1, as Turgeon expands its services to meet growing demand from the trucking and transportation industry, according to a news release.

Corriveau has been involved in fleet operations since 2011 and brings extensive knowledge of the specific needs of fleet managers, the company says. His role will focus on strengthening Turgeon's position as a partner for fleet branding and vehicle graphics.

“This new role allows us to further tailor our offering to the transportation sector. With Simon, we're investing in expertise, proximity, and the ability to anticipate our clients' challenges,” said Kévin Turgeon, president of the company, in the release.

UAP has announced that Gaétan Delisle, vice-president of the Eastern Canada heavy vehicles parts division, will retire on Oct. 1 after more than 48 years with the company. Delisle joined UAP in 1977 and played a key role in the creation and development of the heavy vehicles parts division, established in 1995, the company said in a news release, adding that Delisle has been instrumental in the growth of UAP's network across Eastern Canada.

As part of the leadership transition, UAP has appointed Francis Messier as regional vice-president for the heavy vehicle parts division. Messier has been with the company since 2007 and has held several leadership roles, including positions with the Traction store network, the TW Distribution Center, and most recently, the integration of the Saniquip Bergor specialty division. UAP says his extensive market knowledge and customer focus make him well-suited for this new role.

BeyondTrucks has appointed Mahriah Alf, an AI product leader and former chief product officer at Noodle.ai, as head of product. The transportation management system (TMS) provider said in a news release that the move reflects its increased investment in artificial intelligence as fleets seek to modernize operations and improve efficiency.

Alf joins BeyondTrucks with extensive experience in AI product development. Most recently, she served as strategy and growth executive at Distyl AI, where she also held an advisor role focused on supply chain AI solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Prior to Distyl, Alf spent more than six years at Noodle.ai, a company specializing in large-scale applications for digital supply chain transformation, rising through the ranks to become chief product officer. During her time at Noodle.ai, she helped develop AI-native enterprise applications that generated more than US$200 million in annual customer value, the company says.

At BeyondTrucks, Alf will oversee the development of native AI products.

“Bringing Mahriah Alf onto our team of fleet operations, software, and data experts reflects the incredible potential we, and our customers, see in AI,” said Hans Galland, CEO of BeyondTrucks. “When paired with the right data and a multi-tenant operating system like BeyondTrucks, AI is becoming a source of strategic advantage for fleets. This hire underscores our commitment to AI innovation. Alf  is a seasoned AI leader with a proven track record of helping customers tackle real business challenges and deliver meaningful value.”

Dynamite Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products are teaming up for a Supernatural comic series, featuring new stories that are set between the first and second seasons of the long-running show. Writer Greg Pak and artist Eder Messias, who previously worked together on Sam Wilson: Captain America, will be the creative team for the new comics. In the first arc, the Winchester brothers, who hunt ghosts, demons, and other supernatural creatures, will search for the source of a series of mysterious fires in a decaying Rust Belt town. The series will launch in October and the first issue will have covers by Messias, Clayton Crain, and David Cousens, as well as photo covers from the show.

“A couple of dudes in a cool car chasing monsters, demons, and ghosts? Tongue-in-cheek, but deeply-felt emotional story of sibling rivalry and family tragedy? Hugely fun, anti-authoritarian heroes and vibes? Look, I was hooked with the ghosts, but I'm all in,” Pak said in a statement accompanying the announcement. “We're going for fun and grounded, and then we're going to absolutely cut loose when the time comes.”Supernatural debuted in 2005 and ran for 15 seasons, the first on The WB and the rest on The CW, making it the longest running scripted fantasy series on TV. “Here in Brazil, on Saturday nights, they would show four episodes in a row,” Messias said. “After that, we would spend the week talking to friends about the next episodes.”

DC's WildStorm published several miniseries based on the show, and it was adapted into an RPG early in its run (see “‘Supernatural RPG'”); more recently, CMON added two Supernatural packs to its Zombicide 2E game (see “The Winchesters Hunt Undead in ‘Zombicide 2E'”).

HAPPY VALLEY, Calif. - A decade after her daughter's mysterious disappearance, a Shasta County mother continues to seek answers. The baby, Ember Graham, vanished from her crib under puzzling circumstances.

Ember was just six months old when she went missing in July 2015. Her father, Matthew Graham, was considered a person of interest in her disappearance but was killed in a shootout with police a few weeks later. Before his death, Matthew told his wife, Jamie Graham, that someone had broken into their home and kidnapped Ember.

"Every chance I got I grilled him every conversation I grilled him. I grilled him when I visited him in jail and I grilled him when he was out of jail. He just kept saying I don't know. I don't remember his story kept changing and I knew he's not telling the truth about something," Jamie Graham said.

When asked if she believes someone else might have information, Graham expressed hope that the truth will eventually come out.

"I do and that's why I am so persistent. I do believe he spent a lot of time with his family and his friends, and I feel like he absolutely would have broke down and told somebody what happened if not multiple people," Graham said.

Ember, who would be 10 years old now, has brown hair and brown eyes and suffers from a seizure disorder. There is a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect.

Anyone with information is urged to contact the Shasta County Sheriff's Office at (530) 245-6025 or Secret Witness of Shasta County at (530) 243-2319.

The following is a syndicated interview with filmmaker John Shackleton, creator of the new YouTube series THE SUPERNATURAL UK. Shackleton talks about his fascination with the paranormal, balancing skepticism with belief, and gruelling all-night shoots. 

What inspired you to create The Supernatural UK, and how did the concept first come about?

As a filmmaker, I'm naturally drawn to the unknown. I've always had a love for horror and the supernatural – but it wasn't until a few years ago, when I found out my accountants moonlighted as paranormal investigators, that I really dipped my toe in! I tagged-along out of curiosity. No expectations, full sceptic mode.

The spark really happened when I was working on Château DIY for Channel 4. Some of the medieval château stories ignited my imagination. I made multiple trips to France across different series, but it was during one particular stay, alone in a gîte just after the pandemic, that things took a turn. One night something bit my finger – I jolted awake and saw my bedside table physically rocking. The next morning, my researcher (in the room opposite) told me she'd been woken by the sensation her bed was off the ground.

When I got back to the UK, I started filming investigations with different paranormal teams. That eventually led to a 50-minute TV pilot, ‘Somerset Supernatural'. At the time, I was also shooting ‘Dorset: Country and Coast' for Channel 5, and I liked how the format wove real people and real places into the fabric of a region. So, I took that approach – blending fly-on-the-wall documentary with local character and applied it to the paranormal.

I teamed up with my long-time collaborator and all round creative powerhouse Andy Bourne, who handles everything from cinematography and editing to VFX and post. We decided to make more episodes specifically for online. The result is ‘The Supernatural UK', a year-long passion project built on the back of that original pilot.

How do you define “supernatural” in the context of this series, and what makes the UK uniquely suited for these stories?

For me, the supernatural starts where science and logic stop. If it defies physics or falls outside the norm, then it is – by definition, para-normal. Like with UFOs – it doesn't mean little green men, just that it's unidentified.

The UK is especially rich ground for this kind of exploration. Its deep history, layered folklore, pagan traditions, religious shifts, give us an incredible scope. So in the context of the series, “supernatural” is a wide net. It covers the unexplained – spiritual, scientific, or otherwise. Everything's on the table.

Can you talk about the research process—how do you uncover or choose locations and cases?

Ironically, I try not to research too much. These are observational documentaries, and I want to arrive as open and fresh as possible. Whether or not I've read the history doesn't determine if something decides to make itself known on the night. In that sense often the less I know, the better.

That said, we do have researchers on standby. Karin Beasant, one of our producers, is incredibly thorough and often suggests locations or connects us with investigators. I go with my gut – it's proven to be a pretty reliable barometer.

Sometimes opportunities come out of other projects. While working on a show about Warwick Castle, I pitched access for The Supernatural UK' – remarkably they said yes, and that became episodes 9 and 10 of the series. I'm also drawn to specific phenomena like remote viewing, and when something intriguing lines up, I'll do everything I can to make it happen. That's the joy of working independently – no one's dictating the agenda. I can follow my instincts.

What challenges did you face—especially with the documentary-style format?

Plenty! For starters, the shoots can be gruelling. We pulled a lot of all-nighters, especially when things started to heat up. Crew availability could be tricky, too. In the opening episode, shot in Nottingham, I had to run everything solo – organisation, production, camera, sound, the lot. Luckily, my day job's prepared me for that, but it can create issues like dropped timecode, which then take longer to fix in post. I have to wear many caps, sometimes even the red hood, too!

The steepest learning curve for me was the edit. I don't usually edit my own work, but for this I had to learn how to sync multi-cam footage, manage audio files, and basically build the episodes from scratch. It was time-consuming, but rewarding. I'd often discover things I hadn't clocked on the night – like hidden story threads or electronic voice phenomena (EVPs) that only emerged during meticulous reviews. It's definitely sharpened my storytelling skills and revealed arcs that might've gone unnoticed otherwise.

Are there recurring themes or messages you hope viewers take away from the series?

Yes – mainly that science doesn't yet have all the answers. As Shakespeare put it: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. I think that quote sums it up perfectly. We need to keep enquiring. Keep our minds open. That's how we unlock whatever it is that's really going on out there.

How do you balance scepticism and belief in the series? Do you take a particular stance?

I'm not a fan of extremes—blind belief or staunch scepticism. I try to land somewhere in the middle. Think Mulder and Scully. In fact, we set that tone right from the first episode, with some healthy banter between our sceptic and  spiritualist investigators.

If something strange happens, I always try to debunk it first. But I've had moments where I know what I saw, I know what I heard, and no rational explanation holds water. That tension between belief and doubt is part of what makes the series so engaging and timeless, I think.



You're a well-regarded feature filmmaker. Did you bring any cinematic techniques to enhance the series?

Absolutely. I've spent years streamlining my process so I'm not waiting on anyone's permission to shoot. I own pro filming equipment, and Andy does too. Between us, we can load up the van and go. We also use GoPros, 360 cameras – anything to make sure we don't miss a beat. Weird stuff always seems to happen the moment the main camera's down, we soon learned!

We're both big fans of cinematic title sequences. Andy works in Unreal Engine and creates visuals that really punch up the intros. Music's crucial, too. We worked with Paul Saunderson on the theme and Jacob Maloney on the score. They've helped give the series a much more elevated feel. But above all, it's about story. And often, that story only really reveals itself in the edit.

Were there any moments during filming that genuinely surprised you or changed your perspective?

So many. One night I brought a trained security dog to what's considered the most haunted prison in the UK – just for insurance! Not only did the dog react to multiple unseen presences, but we started getting what felt like intelligent responses from assumed inmates. Lights triggered on command. Motion sensors responded to verbal prompts. Suddenly, “coincidence” didn't seem the most logical explanation anymore.

I keep the setup lean and spontaneous – often confirming investigators just days before, so I know nothing's being staged. Everything you see is real. That includes a poltergeist experience that even our biggest sceptic deemed 94% likely, and a museum investigation that escalated from the movement of a simple doll in a cabinet, to full-blown activity – footsteps, voices, EVP, and vibration sensor activation.

There have just been too many “coincidences” to ignore.

Do you think the rising interest in the paranormal reflects something deeper about society today?

Yes, I do. With everything going on in the world—the climate crisis, wars, political instability – it feels like we're collectively looking for meaning and reassurance. The doomsday clock is at 89 seconds to midnight. It's no wonder people are asking bigger questions about what happens when we die.

Finally, do you believe in ghosts?

Literal ghosts? No, they still don't make sense to me – and I felt that way before I started. But when I find EVP recordings of disembodied voices replying to questions… when radio signals give us information the team couldn't have known… when I hear footsteps in an empty building, or a voice that everyone on the team hears… it's hard to dismiss.

So do I believe something is out there? Yes. Without a doubt.
