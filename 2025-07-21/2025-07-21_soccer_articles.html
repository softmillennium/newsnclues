                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Xabi Alonso Will Decide Gonzalo Garcia's Real Madrid Future Kylian Mbappé's bout of gastroenteritis forced Xabi Alonso to field the 21-year-old, who rewarded his new manager with four goals and an assist across six Club World Cup games. Such form has unsurprisingly inspired admiring glances from a glut of clubs eager to whisk this young talent away. Several La Liga sides have been tipped to offer García the guarantee of playing time with a season-long loan and Getafe president Ángel Torres publicized his club's interest earlier this month. García's representatives have questioned the convincing tone behind Torres's proclamation. AS report that the Spanish forward is still considering a slew of “non-stop offers”, including several approaches from Premier League clubs. The same outlet claims that Madrid have not yet settled on García's future themselves. Alonso is expected to give his young striker another chance to impress during preseason, which begins for Real Madrid once players return from their extended breaks on Aug. 4. García got his break thanks to Mbappé's absence but retained his starting spot after the Frenchman returned to fitness during the tournament. Unlike his illustrious colleagues, García is willing to hare around the final third even when he doesn't have the ball. This summer, the hard-working Spaniard averaged a successful tackle every 90 minutes. Vinicius Junior and Mbappé spent a combined 581 minutes on the pitch at the Club World Cup without winning possession back once.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But this year, led by Javier Aguirre, Mexico reaffirmed its supremacy. First by winning the Nations League title and now by retaining the Gold Cup, for which “El Vasco” called up his best players while Mauricio Pochettino, the Argentine manager of the USMNT, preferred to rest several of his regular starters and instead try out other young players just one year before the FIFA World Cup, which will be held in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. “Obviously (this title) is important because we Mexicans have been fortunate enough to win the last tournaments CONCACAF has organized: we won the Nations League and now we're repeating in the Gold Cup. That fills me with pride because it gives us confidence, it gives us energy for the future, for what's coming. There are no more official matches; they're friendlies, and we have to continue looking for players for the World Cup,” said “El Vasco.” “The World Cup is going to be a real test for many of us, and we have a year to prepare well. I think there are people who would tell you today that they've passed, but there are always little things to improve. I myself sometimes make mistakes, and luckily I also have a great coaching staff that opens my eyes,” he added. “I think we've made good progress in CONCACAF recently, because it seems like we've stuck there in the past. Panama, Canada, and the United States itself have grown, and I think today we're in a prominent position in the region.” A few days earlier, at another press conference, in the run-up to the final, Aguirre arrived with a book under his arm. When asked, the Mexican national team coach said it was a book on Mexican history, and that he was reading a chapter in which Texas ceased to be Mexican territory. In one way or another, it may have served as motivation for his players ahead of the final, and perhaps also for the fans, who played a key role with their overwhelming support at NRG Stadium, packed with 70,925 spectators, something Pochettino himself emphasized when lamenting his team's defeat. Within this context, while Aguirre has used his best players to reaffirm his dominance in the region, he has also been experimenting with some young players, something he could fine-tune in the upcoming matches. Among them are midfielders Gilberto Mora and Marcel Ruiz and fullback Mateo Chávez, who have taken advantage of the opportunities in the Gold Cup and have positioned themselves to fight for their spots in the World Cup squad. Mora, 16, was forced into the starting team due to Luis Chávez's unfortunate right knee injury. In the final, he consistently showed his worth, showing himself constantly and calling for the ball to try to play between the two defensive lines set up by the United States, and even managed to make a difference with his skills and excellent passing. Ruiz, 24, also played a prominent role in the final and established himself throughout the tournament after other strong performances. Chávez, 19, also made his senior team debut, though less prominently as he came in as a substitute for Jesús Gallardo, although he also performed well. POLITICS: The World Cup is coming to Houston next summer. Will Trump make it hard for people to come? Among the absent, Captain Christian Pulisic asked for a vacation after a long season in Europe with AC Milan; Yunus Musah opted not to participate for an undisclosed personal reason; Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, and Gio Reyna were committed to their teams at the FIFA Club World Cup, Antonee Robinson and Folarin Balogun were injured; and Sergiño Dest was regaining his best physical form. In their places, players who stood out during the tournament were goalkeeper Matt Freese, right back Alex Freeman, midfielders Malik Tillman, Sebastian Berhalter and Diego Luna, and forward Patrick Agyemang. Pochettino, with a record of 10 wins and six losses since replacing Gregg Berhalter in the fall of 2024, will now face two exhibition games against 23rd-ranked South Korea on Sept. 6 in Harrison, N.J., and then face 17th-ranked Japan three days later in Columbus, Ohio. But with less than a year to go until the World Cup, FIFA should take note of some alarm bells raised during the tournament. The final, in which the English team routed Paris Saint-Germain of France 3-0 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, was a success with over 80,000 spectators. However, many of the matches, especially in the group stage, were played in half-empty stadiums as FIFA decided to use regular NFL venues instead of those of Major League Soccer (MLS), which continued to be played simultaneously with this club competition and the Gold Cup. Instead, it's the renewed complaints from some coaches and teams about the poor condition of some playing fields, something that had already occurred the previous summer during Copa América, which Argentina won at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami against Colombia. Like a year ago, the organizers' main excuse has been the lack of time they've had to change the turf on fields that typically use a synthetic or hybrid surface to a natural one, which is the most commonly used in Europe and South America. This is an issue directly related to scheduling matches for television audiences in other countries and continents. Sergio Marchi, president of FIFPro, the most important international players' association, harshly criticized the tournament and has already issued a warning to Swiss-Italian FIFA president Gianni Infantino ahead of the World Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We are very excited about this recruiting class of transfers. We have a great blend of strong, core returning players; young, eager and talented freshmen; and a fantastic group of transfers who have the ability to elevate what we do competitively as our program takes a step forward,” Villanova head coach Samar Azem said. “We are extremely selective on the players and people we recruit – and this group of transfers each have an important role they can play in our program re-establishing its competitive identity. We have graduate transfers who bring the experience of national championship matches, final fours, national teams and achieving success at the highest level of soccer and academic prestige. “I want to thank our assistant coaches, Ryan and Erin, our support staff, our admissions staff and academic staff, and our players for the time they've put into ensuring we bring individuals who not only fit the identity we want to play with and talent profile we are looking for, but who also have the ability to enhance our community and tradition of excellence here at Villanova University,” Azem continued. See below for a look at each of Villanova's new signings. Curtin comes to the Main Line after a four-year career at Dartmouth where she was an NEWISA Third Team All-Region and Second Team All-Ivy player, both awards coming in the 2021 campaign. In that time, she tallied 29 points on 10 goals and nine assists. Her final season at Dartmouth came with 13 starts in 16 matches played. She scored three goals and two assists while compiling a three-game point streak along the way in which she tallied two goals and an assist. She had a breakout season in 2021 where she logged both aforementioned accolades after a six-goal, four-assist year, netting two game-winners along the way. native was a four-year letter winner at Winchester High School, captaining the team in her senior year. She also earned two varsity letters as a sprinter on the indoor track team. On the pitch, she helped her team to the 2019 Division II State Championships in 2019 while going on a year later to be a finalist. She was a two-time High School Soccer First Team All-American selection, 2019 DII State Player of the Year, a four-time Middlesex League Champion, a three-time Middlesex League MVP as well as an All-State and All-New England honoree. At the club level, she played with the FC Stars from 2017-2021 where she was a Second Team Northeast ECNL and ODP Region 1 Team member. On why she chose Villanova: “During my visit to Villanova, I felt an overwhelming sense of good on campus and amongst the team. The combination of elite athletics, rigorous master's programs, and strong Augustinian values creates an environment where I believe I would thrive in during my fifth year.” Azem on Curtin: “Hannah is a fast, athletic, and relentless forward who has the capability to create a lot of problems for defenders. She is a prototype of what we are looking for in our attacking players and will bring four years of high-level experience with her. Dobsch was an ACC Honor Roll member and ACC Top 6 for Service honoree at Wake Forest, also earning a spot on the Dean's list all four years. In her time with the Demon Deacons, she suited up for three seasons and redshirted her junior campaign, logging 187 minutes on the pitch mostly as a defender. She is coming off a senior campaign that saw her play in four wins for the Deacs. She led her club team, Eclipse Select, to a No. Prior to that, she was named the FC United team captain in 2015-16 while playing with ODP Illinois State Team in the same year. She attended the US Soccer Training Center from 2015-17 and was an ECNL Midwest Conference Champion and Finalist at the ECNL National Championship. She was an instrumental leader in Wake Forest's NCAA championship run and brings the experience of winning with her as our program looks to take a leap forward.” She has worked her way through the Canadian Women's National Team system as well, suiting up with the U17 squad in 2023-24 cycle and U15 in 2022. At the club level, she played with 2022 OPDL U15 Gary Miller Cup and Shield and ODPL U15 League Champion teams, also winning the Ontario Summer Games that year. That year also saw her be a part of the Ontario Provincial Excel Team. She is not the only collegiate soccer player in her family. She has experience training and competing with the Canadian youth national team and comes from a year of experience with a dominant Ivy team. Isabelle's mind and vision for the game are extremely impressive. Coupled with her athletic ability, she will bring a lethal force to our front line.” Panaccione wrapped up her undergraduate career this past season at Santa Clara. Before Santa Clara, the Los Altos Hills, Calif. native was a four-year varsity soccer player at Saint Francis High School and played at the club level with MVLA. Azem on Panaccione: “Bella is a seasoned veteran and competitor. She can impact our ability to possess and move the ball through each phase of play phenomenally well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA have stripped a further eight clubs of a major title amid their decision over Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City. Earlier this month, Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain 4-0 to win the 2025 Club World Cup title. According to the Daily Mail, former Club World Cup winners Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City will all now be referred to as 'FIFA Intercontinental Champions'. Chelsea are not guaranteed to defend their title at the next Club World Cup in 2029, as the tournament's holders do not yet receive automatic qualification. Liverpool, United and City will all hope to meet the qualifying criteria over the next three years and effectively 'win back' their title of world champions. And seven other clubs are now no longer recognised as champions of the footballing world. Real Madrid are five-time winners of the Club World Cup under its previous format, but will now have to win it under its new format. Finally, Sao Paulo (2005 winners), Internacional (2006), AC Milan (2007) and Inter Milan (2010) are the other teams that can no longer call themselves world champions. PSG, Pyramids, Al Hilal and Cruz Azul are the teams already confirmed for the 2029 Club World Cup - but all the above teams can still qualify alongside them by winning continental titles or by meeting specific club ranking criteria set by FIFA. Live in constant hope of the top flight as a Preston North End fan. Written in the past for SPORF, GiveMeSport and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium will host six World Cup matches in 2026, including five group-stage games on June 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25, plus a round of 32 match on July 1. KRON reports that a name change is possible. Janine De La Vega, the City's Public Information Officer, told KRON: “It is our understanding that any name change for Levi's Stadium during the FIFA World Cup 2026 event is a matter of ongoing discussions between the Bay Area Host Committee (BAHC) and FIFA.” But sources tell Santa Clara News Online that a name change is likely already a done deal, with the BAHC delaying the official announcement, and Levi's may not be aware they are losing a global marketing opportunity. FIFA's strict sponsorship rules require that only official tournament sponsors be associated with World Cup venues. All existing stadium branding and signage not aligned with FIFA's sponsorship deals must be covered or removed. This has led to similar name changes at other host venues, such as Hard Rock Stadium becoming “Miami Stadium” and AT&T Stadium being renamed “Dallas Stadium” for the event. The BAHC is still working to finalize event preparations, but fundraising remains a huge problem for them. The projected costs for hosting the matches could reach $50 million, with FIFA contributing just $13 million. Father, writer/editor/journalist (santaclaranews.org), wrestling promoter (www.wfcwrestling.com), motorsports marketing, 2q37 rare disease advocate! Curious to hear any explanation from our City Staff, and maybe some options that we might have to avoid exposing our City to such “BS” Cost, especially with no matching risk / reward to merit these expenditures. By the way didn't the 49ers just ask to get us, the residents, to pay for their new Levi Stadium signs last year because they were looking a bit faded? Can City staff that “negotiated” this deal with the 49ers and FIFA please inform the public of what happens to the Stadium Authority's Naming Rights revenue in 2026? This is exactly what I said the cost would be to Residents when I was campaigning for District 5 council seat. If you add the SuperBowl it could be closer to $70M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea chiefs seem to have at last made a decision on what the 2025/26 season will hold for promising youngster Kendry Paez. There is plenty of excitement over what Paez can bring to Stamford Bridge after already establishing himself as a regular in the Ecuador senior side alongside Moises Caicedo. It was reported late last season that Paez had been training with Strasbourg, who are also under the BlueCo model that are in charge of proceedings at Stamford Bridge. Andrey Santos has already gone from loan spells to the Ligue 1 side to being a genuine option for Enzo Maresca, and they will be hoping the same becomes the case for their new addition. As per Ben Jacobs, a loan deal to Strasbourg is in the process of being finalised for Paez. He said: “Kendry Paez set for a Strasbourg loan after training with Chelsea during the Club World Cup. Fellow impressive youngster Estevao Willian will not be leaving on loan upon his arrival at Stamford Bridge. As per transfer rules, Chelsea are only allowed to loan three players to Strasbourg for a single season, and these transactions are allowed as the Blues will be playing in a different level of European football next season. The final spot has been taken by one of their former players. Mamadou Sarr will join Strasbourg for the 2025/26 season after joining Chelsea earlier this summer.</p>

New York and New Jersey officials are projecting a $3.3 billion economic boost to the region from hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2026.

The region will hold eight matches at Metlife Stadium in New Jersey, including the final on July 19, 2026, expecting to bring in over 1.2 million fans and tourists, according to an economic impact summary released Monday by the NYNJ Host Committee, the local body responsible for organizing the games. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In his years with the United States Soccer Federation, Steve Fell has seen them all. Following years alongside the United States men's national team at world soccer's highest level, he's adding a new role in 2025 as head of performance for Sporting Jax and its young roster. "There are differences in maybe the experiences of a higher-level player, because of what they deal with day-to-day, but I would say from a physical preparation side, you treat them all the same," Fell said. Even after some recent experienced additions, most recently former University of Florida defender Julia Lester on loan from the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League, Sporting Jax is racing toward August with youth. Head coach Stacey Balaam has the assignment of molding those newcomers into a cohesive unit for the club's Super League kickoff on Aug. 23, and she expects that Fell's background in the sport can accelerate the process of bringing them up to speed. "It's been valuable for our players to learn from him and for him to give them the necessary feedback. Right now, we're just soaking up all the information." A graduate of Towson University in Maryland, Fell is also at home on the First Coast, and he became Flagler College's director of sports performance in July 2015. Since early 2022, Fell has worked as a performance coach alongside the full U.S. men's national team, including the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and he intends to continue in that role while also assisting Sporting Jax's efforts. For Fell, the summer has raced along at near-nonstop pace. After the United States lost that tournament final 2-1 to Mexico on July 6 in Houston, almost immediately, he was on his way back to Florida for Sporting Jax camp. "It was good to get right back into it and almost erase the thought of [the loss] quickly," he said. "It's not just technical and tactical, we're talking the physical attributes," Fell said. "That is the universal thing when you go from college to a professional level. You see it all over the place, where individuals who were doing very well in college have this little adjustment period." The goal for Fell and the Sporting Jax staff is making that adjustment period as speedy as possible for rookies like defender Paige Kenton, who owns substantial credentials in her own right. She graduated magna cum laude from Penn with a degree in neuroscience and completed her fifth NCAA year last fall while pursuing her master's degree in the University of Delaware's Department of Linguistics and Cognitive Science. "It's not just about making a good pass, or making a pass, but it's about maximizing your decisions to help the team." It's a similar feeling for players like defender Grace Philpotts, in her first professional season out of the University of Kentucky. "We're having vets, we're having girls with pro experience of many years that are coming now and training, so I'd say the tempo is a lot faster [than in college]." Balaam, who came to Sporting Jax in April from SEC soccer at Vanderbilt, recognizes the step up awaiting the players. "It's something that they've probably not had before," Balaam said. "So it's an example of this as the next level for them." However, time is on the side of Sporting Jax. In addition to closed-door training matches later this month, the club also tunes up at UNF on Aug. 2 against Hibernian of Scotland and on Aug. 10 against Wrexham of Wales, games that will help Fell assess how players are advancing. "We're building these athletes who are just coming out of college progressively, in a way that's safe," Fell said, "to help them attain that level where they're able to handle the demands of the professional level."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's emerged that Chelsea officials had noticed that PSG reps were already assuming they had won the Club World Cup. Of course, seeing this would be enough to motivate you to do all you can to go on and win the competition, and that is exactly what Chelsea did just over a week ago now. PSG are European Champions and many people see them as the best team in the world at current, and they probably are. Chelsea proved to the world that PSG can be beaten and in all honesty, they were beaten with easy on the night with The Blues thrashing them 3-0 to become World Champions. But it sounds like PSG were getting complacent and already assuming that they were going to win the game before it was even played. Chelsea's people informed Enzo Maresca of this and he passed it onto the players. Mamadou Sarr is rejoining Strasbourg on loan from Chelsea after Fabrizio Romano called the ‘here we go' done deal on that one late last night. Nicolas Jackson's agent has been in talks with Manchester United over the weekend to see if a move to Old Trafford can happen for the striker this summer. Your email address will not be published.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea have won two trophies this season, credit to Enzo Maresca, and in large part, Cole Palmer. Yes, everyone expected Maresca's men to win the Conference League, but then again, everyone also expected Paris Saint-Germain to win the Club World Cup after wins over Bayern Munich and Real Madrid with ease. Chelsea's performance in the Club World Cup deserves recognition for several reasons. Maresca had the sense not to sit back against Paris Saint-Germain, but also not to press them too far forward, even though he deployed a high line. The Blues boss relied on his team's pacy backline to deal with the over-the-top through balls that Luis Enrique's side tried to play in behind. This should be noted, as the Italian manager has demonstrated this kind of pragmatism at several points throughout the season. If Chelsea can consistently deploy this style next season, it could lead to invaluable victories over direct rivals. That kind of efficiency should be acknowledged, though for a different reason. In fact, Chelsea missed 2.2 of every 3.2 big chances they created per game in the Premier League last season, across 38 games. That wastefulness extended to the Club World Cup final too. Joao Pedro is likely to help Maresca's men become more clinical next season. If the Blues want to compete for more than just a top-four finish, improving their efficiency in front of goal is essential. Chelsea's players showed a level of confidence that, admittedly, made me uneasy at first. Their performance reflected a team that believed in its game plan. Next season, Maresca's men will need that same belief, not only for big matches but also to meet the season's expectations as a whole. Levi Colwill's comments about “not being Inter or Madrid” may have come across as arrogant, but confidence and arrogance often wear the same face. That belief will also help the coach, as confident players take necessary risks without being overly cautious. These three factors are why Chelsea should be considered serious contenders for a top-two finish in the Premier League in the 2025/26 season. That is, as long as Maresca doesn't revert to a rigid “his way” approach, the kind that saw them lose 4-0 to Celtic in July 2024. While most of those opponents weren't expected to pose much of a challenge, the win over the Champions League holders was significant because it finally earned the Blues some long-overdue respect from rival fans. Premier League teams will be at least twice as difficult as most of the sides Chelsea faced in the Club World Cup. That is a positive sign of progress and they are only expected to get better moving forward. The content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only.
