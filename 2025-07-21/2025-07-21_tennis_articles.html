                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner has become used to having people talking about him, both in positive and negative ways. Sinner won Wimbledon to lift his fourth Grand Slam title earlier this month, after beating rival Carlos Alcaraz in the final. The world number one received a lot of praise for his performances at Wimbledon this year, including Sinner being told he has one shot that is the best in history. Not all of the comments toward Sinner have been positive, and now a former Roland Garros semifinalist has called out something she has recently heard. Before Sinner was the Grand Slam winning force that he is today, his Italian compatriot Martina Trevisan reached the semifinals of Roland Garros. In an interview with fanpage.it, the now world number 276 Trevisan has spoken about how much she was rooting for Sinner against Alcaraz. “Anyone who accuses him of having an unexciting style of play has probably never picked up a racket, because watching Jannik play, recognizing how he makes even the most complex movements appear simple, is a joy for the eyes and the heart. While the Wimbledon final may not have been as much of a spectacle, Sinner and Alcaraz's Roland Garros final has received high praise and been called one of the best in history. Sinner was heartbroken against Alcaraz after the Roland Garros final, where he lost in five sets despite having three championship points. “Well, I believe that the best memory, the one that allowed Jannik to beat Carlos in four sets, is like a fine-meshed sieve that lets through what's useless and harmful to growth and self-improvement, while retaining what's useful and instrumental to change,” explained Trevisan. Sinner is next scheduled to compete at the Cincinnati Open, which gets underway on Monday, August 4.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams will celebrate the 25th anniversary of her maiden US Open crown returning to play Flushing Meadows. 1 Venus will partner good friend Reilly Opelka in next month's US Open Mixed Doubles event, the USTA announced today. The 45-year-old Venus is set to play her first pro match in 16 months in Washington, DC this week.A quarter century ago, Venus Williams defeated Lindsay Davenport 6-4, 7-5 to capture her first US Open singles crown. Venus successfully defended the US Open in 2001 when she defeated younger sister and 1999 champion Serena Williams 6-2, 6-4 in one of the most-widely viewed US Open women's finals.Proving the couple that plays together, stays together, Australian No. 1 Alex de Minaur will partner fiancee Katie Boulter at the US Open.“Yeah, we're definitely going to be keen to try and play if they allow us to and if they want us to,” de Minaur told the media at Queen's Club last month. “If that's an option, then we'll definitely be up for it.”One of tennis' top glamor couples announced their engagement on December 23rd on social media.Earlier this season, de Minaur shared earning “big bucks” to pay for the wedding is one of his driving forces on court these days.“Realistically, what's driving me at the moment is trying to earn some big bucks for this wedding budget,” De Minaur told Tennis Channel in April. “That's the only thing on my mind—trying to win as many matches as I can, because I've started to look at venues and it's expensive. I can tell you that.”Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas, who have reportedly endeded their relationship, are no longer on the US Open Mixed Doubles entry list.Given the US Open Mixed Doubles champions will earn $1 Million for capturing the 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles crown, that could be even more motivation for de Minaur and Boulter to join forces in Flushing Meadows and cover their wedding budget.In total, 25 teams have now entered the event.The competition will take place during US Open Fan Week on Tuesday, August 19, and Wednesday, August 20, at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, with $1 Million in prize money being awarded to the winning team.Though Fan Week remains free, fans will need to buy tickets to watch the US Open Mixed Doubles.The entry window will close on July 28th at 12:00 ET, at which time the top eight teams with the best combined singles ranking at the time will officially be in the field/draw via direct acceptance.The remaining eight teams will be determined via wild card and announced on a date to follow.The entry list for the 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles Championship includes the following teams:Emma Navarro and Jannik SinnerAmanda Anisimova and Holger RuneJessica Pegula and Tommy PaulJasmine Paolini and Lorenzo MusettiElena Rybakina and Taylor FritzMirra Andreeva and Daniil MedvedevMadison Keys and Frances TiafoeAryna Sabalenka and Grigor DimitrovIga Swiatek and Casper RuudKarolina Muchova and Andrey RublevEmma Raducanu and Carlos AlcarazBelinda Bencic and Alexander ZverevOlga Danilovic and Novak DjokovicTaylor Townsend and Ben SheltonSara Errani and Andrea VavassoriNaomi Osaka and Nick KyrgiosKatie Boulter and Alex de MinaurDonna Vekic and Hubert HurkaczGaby Dabrowski and Felix Auger-AliassimeDemi Schuurs and Tallon GriekspoorKaterina Siniakova and Marcelo ArevaloDesirae Krawczyk and Evan KingSu-Wei Hsieh and Jan ZielinskiIva Jovic and Jenson BrooksbyVenus Williams and Reilly Opelka“In our initial discussions about reimagining and elevating the US Open Mixed Doubles Championship, we wanted to find a way to showcase the world's best men and women competing with and against one another, and we were confident that we would be able to get the top players in the game excited about this unique opportunity,” said Lew Sherr, CEO and Executive Director, USTA. “Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited.“It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do, and we know that the fans will love it.” Filed Under: Tennis News Tagged With: Reilly Opelka, Venus Williams</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams is paired with Reilly Opelka, and Wimbledon runner-up Amanda Anisimova is joined by Holger Rune on Monday's updated list of teams that have signed up to try to enter the newfangled U.S. Open mixed doubles tournament next month. A total of 25 duos are on the latest entry list released by the U.S. Tennis Association. Only 16 will make the field for the Aug. 19-20 competition that will pay the winning team $1 million. The deadline for entries is a week away. That's when the eight duos with the highest combined singles rankings will gain official acceptance for the event. The USTA will select the other eight teams and give them wild-card invitations. Singles matches begin on Aug. 24. In addition to Williams — a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion who is 45 and entered the tournament in Washington this week for her first competition in more than a year — with Opelka, and Anisimova with Rune, other new teammates announced Monday include Katie Boulter and Alex De Minaur, who are engaged to be married; Donna Vekic and Hubert Hurkacz; Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev; Iva Jovic and Jenson Brooksby; Gaby Dabrowski and Felix Auger-Aliassime; Demi Schuurs and Tallon Griekspoor; Katerina Siniakova and Marcelo Arevalo; Desirae Krawczyk and Evan King; and Su-Wei Hsieh and Jan Zielinski. It's a star-studded cast that is quite different from the mix of doubles specialists usually found in a Grand Slam mixed doubles bracket. Some criticized the changes when they were announced in February, with Errani and Vavassori calling the new format a “pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show” that would shut out true doubles players.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The total number of ATP points a tennis player has does not always translate to tournaments won. This point is particularly relevant when considering the successes of both Lorenzo Musetti and Ben Shelton. Ranked seven and eight in the world respectively, they have both enjoyed extremely successful careers to date, having both reached Grand Slam semi-finals and made significant inroads at ATP Masters 1000 events. There can be little doubt that these two players have achieved great things on the ATP Tour, and will likely continue to do so. However, there is one lesser-known player, ranked 45 in the world, who has overtaken both Musetti and Shelton for ATP tournaments won. Luciano Darderi, aged 23 years, defeated Jesper de Jong on Sunday afternoon to win the Bastad Open, an ATP 250 event. Despite his low ranking compared to compatriot Lorenzo Musetti and American Ben Shelton, Darderi has now won more ATP Tour tournaments than the two top 10 players. Musetti also holds a 100 per cent record in finals. Despite their relatively small number of ATP Tour titles, both Musetti and Shelton have enjoyed impressive 2025 campaigns so far, with Shelton reaching the Australian Open semi-finals and Musetti reaching the same stage of the French Open. He has now won three career titles, which is more than Musetti, which is rather, you know… stops you in your tracks. “I mean, Musetti definitely needs to close some more tournaments and he's obviously had bigger success generally, but three tour-level titles is no joke.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Sebastian Korda snapped a 17-year drought for home champions at the Mubadala Citi DC Open last year, the red, white and blue tide is in full force for this year's edition. Nobody owned the capital quite like Andre Agassi. Across 10 visits in the ‘90s, he racked up as many titles as losses — five of each — cementing his dominance in the sweltering summer heat with a record haul, including a victory as World No. Michael Chang enjoyed a reign in the winner's circle sandwiched in between Agassi's ‘95 and ‘98 titles. That season alone, Roddick claimed an American tri-fecta of sorts, capturing his first tour-level title in Atlanta, then adding to that count in Houston and in Washington, D.C, where in the championship match the teenager beat Sjeng Schalken — the Dutchman whom Roddick helped escape a hotel fire three years later in Rome. In ‘05, Roddick spoiled countryman Blake's quest for a second D.C. title. James Blake and Andy Roddick (champion) at the 2005 Washington, D.C. trophy ceremony. Blake won his first tour-level trophy there in 2002 and upon clinching championship point, the-then 22-year-old dropped his racquet in relief and leaped with ecstatic joy. Blake's pure enthusiasm spilled over as he celebrated with his team, and the New York native said post match that he almost knocked over his mom in a joyful courtside hug. The fourth-longest running professional tennis event in the United States, the Mubadala Citi DC Open celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018 and has continued to thrive at the original location Fitzgerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park. The venue, nestled in one of D.C.'s most inclusive neighborhoods, was chosen at the request of Arthur Ashe, who partnered Donald Dell and John A. Harris to launch the tournament in 1969. Held on clay courts until 1986, the event's deep roots and rich history have made it a favourite stop for some of the sport's biggest names. American icon Jimmy Connors brought his signature fire and flair to Washington, delivering his own brand of summer entertainment. He captured three titles in the capital, including two while holding No. A decade separated his second and third title run, with Connors returning to the winner's circle once more in 1988. It was during that era when another star made his mark in Washington. Staying on the theme of Czech-American success, last year featured a full-circle moment for Florida-native Korda and his father Petr Korda. 32 in the PIF ATP Rankings, ‘Sebi' Korda, captured his biggest career title at the ATP 500, matching his father's 1992 triumph. Now, a strong squad of home hopes look to build on the American legacy in D.C. this year. Perhaps nobody wants to win this tournament more than DMV's own Tiafoe, who has lost to the eventual champion the past three years. Fritz is aiming for his first ATP 500 crown since 2022. Shelton is seeking his first title of the year.

Wimbledon's plan includes adding an 8,000-seat stadium with a retractable roof and 38 other grass courts that would allow the All England Club to move its qualifying event on-site to boost attendance and revenue. Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam tournament that holds its qualifying rounds at a completely separate location. There are also too few practice courts in the current setup, requiring some of the world's best players to share courts. "It is clear that we have a robust planning permission that enables us to create a permanent home for the Wimbledon qualifying competition as well as delivering 27 acres of beautiful new park land for local people, providing public access to land that has been a private golf course for over 100 years," Jevans added.The next hurdle in the process is a hearing in January over whether there is a statutory trust over the former golf course land.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Town And Country magazine reports that the styling is done by Elisabeth Piner, the stylist and owner of ‘Having a ball dress hire', a company that rents out dresses for formal affairs. She sets up a full-service salon inside centre court in an empty space across the hall from the ladies' locker room. “Because we don't know who will win the tournament we choose styles that perhaps can be flexible, perhaps they have a lace up back or are more or less an average size,” she says. We try to choose items that are just glamorous and ready to compliment the dresses … Most of the footwear and accessories are carefully selected for comfort, elegance, and reliability under pressure,” she said. “The room is totally transformed into a glamorous, lovely boutique with all these wonderful dresses,” Piner said. “It's a tennis locker room with rails of silk and sparkle.” Wimbledon doesn't offer this kind of service to the men's winners, letting their individual sponsor attire them. Sinner had worn a custom dark Gucci suit, with signature loafers. Sinner and Iga would dance, though it wasn't initially part of the plan. “Yes I mean we were there and, in the beginning, they told us that because it was quite late that we don't have to do it and then Iga told me, no, no, let's do it and I was like OK,” said Sinner. And yea it was nice to share that moment with Iga. And it's yeah, a beautiful moment,” Sinner shared later with BBC Sport. At that hour, there is no traffic, so it's like 25 minutes. They have a cocktail party, and then you go down to the dinner, where it's set up beautifully. You have some appetisers, and then Iga showed up at 10:30 pm. They made this cool video up on the Jumbotron. She holds up her trophy, and then you sit down.“Sinner came at 00:05. I did not care, but he was just in the back hammering drinks with his team, having a good time. He came out with the trophy, and at some point, Laura Robson brought them both on stage. And there was a rumour they were not going to have to dance, and the crowd peer pressured them into dancing.“It was good, though. He started twirling Iga, and then 45 seconds in, they were done dancing and went back to the table … You had unbelievable food, wine,” Querrey shared.</p>

Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) took legal action against the Greater London Authority's (GLA) decision to grant planning permission last year. Barristers for SWP told the High Court earlier this month that the decision to approve the plans was “irrational” and should be quashed, as Wimbledon Park – a Grade II*-listed heritage site partly designed by Lancelot “Capability” Brown – was covered by restrictions on how it could be used. In a ruling on Monday, Mr Justice Saini dismissed the challenge. The proposals would see seven maintenance buildings, access points, and an area of parkland with permissive public access constructed, in addition to the courts and associated infrastructure. They would also include work on Wimbledon Lake, which would involve building a boardwalk around and across it. Planning permission for the scheme was granted by Jules Pipe, London's deputy mayor for planning, who said that the proposals “would facilitate very significant benefits” which “clearly outweigh the harm”. He continued that separate High Court proceedings were ongoing over whether a statutory trust existed, and that if it does, the All England Club has “accepted” that this is “incompatible with the development of the proposal”. In court, he said: “You could not have a more protected piece of land within the planning system, frankly.” He said: “Officers advised that the alleged obstacle that they may present to delivery of the development was not itself a material consideration which should weigh against the grant of planning permission.” In his written arguments, Russell Harris KC, for the All England Club, said that planning officers “acknowledged and had regard to” the trust and covenants, but deemed they were not “material”.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lois Boisson breaks into the Top 50, Irina-Camelia Begu wins at home and rising teenagers Tereza Valentova and Petra Marcinko headline a week of momentum-shifting results. The post-Wimbledon stretch of scenic European clay-court WTA 250 events has traditionally been sites of breakthroughs and rebounds, and this year was no different. In Hamburg, Lois Boisson captured her first Hologic WTA Tour trophy, while Irina-Camelia Begu delighted the Romanian crowd in Iasi by taking the title on home soil. Boisson put together one of the summer's notable underdog stories when, as a wild card competing in just her second tour-level event, she thrilled the French fans at Roland Garros by reaching the semifinals. In her third tour-level event, the 22-year-old showed that was no one-off performance by going all the way to the title. In this week's edition of the PIF WTA Rankings, she makes her Top 50 debut with a 19-place jump from No. By contrast to Boisson's sudden burst on to the scene, Begu has been a tour mainstay for nearly a decade and a half. The 34-year-old cracked the Top 10 in April 2011 after reaching her first WTA final in Marbella. A year later, she collected her maiden title in Tashkent. Last week, she went into Iasi winning just two out of 11 tour-level matches in 2025 -- and emerged with her sixth career title, and first since Palermo 2022. Begu became the first Romanian champion on home soil since her own title run at Bucharest 2017 and returns to the Top 100 for the first time since May with a 28-place leap from No. Last year, Anna Bondar picked up her second career WTA 125 title in Hamburg. Twelve months on, with the event back at WTA 250 level, the Hungarian continued her strong form in the city by reaching her first tour-level final. Bondar's run included her second career Top 20 win, over No. 1 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova in the quarterfinals. Her loss to Boisson in the final continued an unusual pattern at the tournament: in 2024, Bondar had herself dethroned the previous year's champion, Arantxa Rus, in the title match. Bondar's strong clay-court form in recent months also included the Wiesbaden ITF W100 title in April and a run to the Bari WTA 125 final in June. She climbs 18 places this week from No. 59, nine places below the career high of No. 50 that she set in July 2022. Iasi runner-up Jil Teichmann snapped a four-year drought by reaching her first tour-level final since Cincinnati 2021, and fifth overall. 21 has re-embedded herself there this year. Also a champion at the Mumbai WTA 125 in February, Teichmann is up 22 spots from No. Teenage talents Valentova, Marcinko thrive in WTA 125 events Last week saw a teenage sweep of WTA 125 titles by former junior Slam champions, with 18-year-old Tereza Valentova triumphing on the hard courts of Porto and 19-year-old Petra Marcinko lifting the trophy on the clay courts of Rome. Valentova didn't drop a set all week, conceding just 23 games across five matches en route to the title, a continuation of her standout season. The Czech has compiled a 36-8 record in 2025, going 16-2 over her past four tournaments, a stretch that includes two WTA 125 titles and a run to the second round of Roland Garros as a qualifier. 261, she's now just outside the Top 100, jumping 23 spots this week to a new career high of No. Marcinko, the 2022 Australian Open junior champion, has already experienced a significant rise and fall in her career. The Croatian reached her previous career high of No. 132 back in October 2023, only to fall out of the Top 300 a year later after an injury-struck 2024. However, she's been rounding into form at WTA 125 level in recent weeks, reaching the semifinals in Grado and Contrexéville over the past month. Marcinko's first WTA 125 trophy means she sets a new career high, rocketing 38 places to No. 33: In Hamburg, the Ukrainian reached her third semifinal of the year, and first on clay since the same tournament in 2021. 111: The 21-year-old Australian won her second ITF title of the year at last week's Granby W75, and hits a new career high. 112: Zhang, 36, won last week's Nottingham ITF W50 without dropping a set. 21 Cirstea, 35, reached the Iasi semifinals on home soil -- her first tour-level semifinal since Dubai 2024. 138: The Hungarian reached the last eight in Iasi -- her second career tour-level quarterfinal, and first since Budapest 2021. 143: The 22-year-old reached her first WTA 125 final in Rome, and is just five places beneath the career high of No. The Slovenian reached her first tour-level semifinal since Strasbourg 2022 in Hamburg last week. 167: Tararudee, 21, reached her first career WTA 125 final last week in Porto, and is one place beneath her career high of No. 181: The 21-year-old Polish player reaches a new career high after winning her first ITF W75 title last week in Vitoria-Gasteiz. 190: At the age of 31, Sánchez captured the first ITF W75 title of her career last week in Olomouc and makes her Top 200 debut as a result. The Mexican made her WTA main-draw debut as a wild card at Monterrey 2013. 199: Mikulskyte, 29, also makes her Top 200 debut after reaching the first ITF W75 final of her career in Vitoria-Gasteiz. She becomes the second Lithuanian to reach the WTA Top 200 following Lina Stanciute, who peaked at No. 267: Schunk, the 2021 Wimbledon junior finalist, won the first WTA main draw match of her career last week in Hamburg. The 21-year-old German reached a career high of No. 143 in 2022 before being set back by injury. 271: At the age of 29, Werner qualified for her first WTA main draw on home soil in Hamburg and reached the second round. 328: Siskova notched her second career Top 100 win over Ann Li to reach her first WTA quarterfinal in Iasi as a qualifier. The 24-year-old Czech's season record is now 37-8. 344: University of North Carolina alumna Crawley, 23, reached her first career ITF W75 final last week in Granby and climbs to a new career high. 474: Following a nine-month injury hiatus, former No. 118 Swan returned to action in April this year. 879: As a qualifying wild card in Iasi, 15-year-old Popa notched her first career Top 200 win over Andrea Lazaro Garcia en route to qualifying for her first WTA main draw. 1,065: Playing just her second pro tournament, Polish 16-year-old Kostecka claimed the title two weeks ago at the Grodzisk Mazowiecki ITF W15. Lois Boisson breaks into the Top 50, Irina-Camelia Begu wins at home and rising teenagers Tereza Valentova and Petra Marcinko headline a week of momentum-shifting results.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The only men to hold a position in the top 10 for more weeks than Djokovic are his greatest rivals: Roger Federer (968) and Rafael Nadal (912). The 38-year-old amassed his other 555 weeks as a top 10 player consecutively between March 2007 and November 2017. Andrey Rublev (Los Cabos), Casper Ruud (Gstaad) and Francisco Cerundolo (Bastad) were the only top 20 players in action, but none went beyond the semi-finals at their respective events. Former world No 10 Denis Shapovalov has jumped five places from 33rd to 28th after defeating Aleksandar Kovacevic in the Los Cabos final. 2025 Citi DC Open ATP draw: Taylor Fritz and Lorenzo Musetti lead the way Tim Henman makes ‘unfair' claim as he reflects on dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz At the Swedish Open, Luciano Darderi saw off Jesper de Jong, a triumph that has lifted him from 55th to 46th. For reaching his first ATP final, de Jong has been rewarded with a new career-high ranking of 83rd (+23 from 106th). Ben Shelton has reached a new career-best of world No 8 despite not playing last week as Holger Rune has fallen to ninth after losing the points from his Hamburg Open quarter-final run in 2024. Arthur Fils has fallen out of the top 20, sliding from 15th to 21st, as he has dropped the 500 points from his Hamburg title last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Danish world No.8 was recently spotted having a hitting practice under the watchful eye of Agassi, who won 17 Masters 1000 and eight Grand Slam titles during his career. Leading up to this week, the duo held a three-day training block. “I reached out to him some months ago,” Rune told tennis.com. He sees the game in a unique way that I've never experienced before.” “I thought now was a good moment to reach out to Agassi because my base is back and I'm playing well again. I thought this was the right time to get some extra input…It's not anything magic, but he obviously had some very wise words I can use.” Rune is hoping to bounce back in North America after a disappointing grass-court swing. At Wimbledon, he suffered a shock first round loss to Chile's Nicolas Jarry, who prevailed in five sets. Overall, his win-loss record for the season currently stands at 22-14 and he has won one title in Barcelona. As to why he approached Agassi, Rune explained that he had studied the American's game via YouTube and wanted a view to coincide with that of his current coach, Lars Christensen. 8 in the world, and anything that can help me get higher in the rankings, I'm happy to hear and listen,” he said. He was trying to help me achieve that. We're still in contact and everything, so those three days were a kind of beginning of feeling things out, him giving me some advice, and me trying to do it on the court to see how it feels. It was just very exciting to see his point of view.” So far in his career, he has been ranked as high as fourth in the world and has won five ATP titles. “If you're happy to stick around and be No. 5, 10, 15, or 20 in the world, some players can do that without doing more…My goal was always to be No. “I think [the gap] is very distant for some, but for some others, they're not that far away,” Rune commented. Rune is seeded third at this week's Citi Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ivan Ljubicic, Roger Federer's ex-coach, has fired back at John McEnroe for spouting "nonsense" when he claimed that either Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz could have beaten Rafael Nadal in his prime at the French Open. McEnroe's statement came after the thrilling Roland-Garros showdown between Sinner and Alcaraz last month. The epic five-set match saw Alcaraz, rally from two sets behind and save three Championship points to take his second French Open title and fifth major overall. Sinner, another rising star, got his revenge by outplaying Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final earlier this month, adding a fourth Grand Slam to his collection. After the Paris clash, McEnroe told TNT Sports that with the best versions of Sinner and Alcaraz, either of them might be considered favorite against Nadal on clay, even when Nadal was in his prime. McEnroe said: "You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now - I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Nadal on clay - you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best." However, he isn't sure they'll break the record of most titles: "Do I think they're going to reach 20, 24 titles either one of them? Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible; there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen." McEnroe recently expressed his admiration for the impressive performances of Alcaraz and Sinner, saying: "But these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen." However, some interpreted his remarks as a slight against tennis legend Rafael Nadal, who won an incredible 14 French Open titles before retiring. "John McEnroe said Nadal wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys. We haven't seen the best of Alcaraz and Sinner yet. They still have a lot of room for improvement. When Alcaraz defeated Cameron Norrie in the Wimbledon quarterfinals, McEnroe addressed his earlier comments on BBC One, seemingly backpedaling: "I made a comment during the French [Open] where I said these guys [Alcaraz and Sinner] would have a shot... I didn't say they would beat Nadal every time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A busy opening day of ATP Washington action is scheduled. Huge-serving Reilly Opelka's attempt to find form in home conditions against the qualifier Murphy Cassone is among the matches. We here at LWOT predict all 11 contests between three articles, including Jenson Brooksby vs Yoshihito Nishioka and Cameron Norrie vs Billy Harris. O'Connell has struggled this season, with a 7-15 win/loss record at ATP Tour level. 21-year-old Quinn sits at a career-high ranking of No. Although O'Connell is still ranked five spots higher, I like Quinn's chances in this contest. He usually enjoys playing in front of home American crowds, and his Australian opponent will need to be much more solid than in recent months to have a chance. Drawing a qualifier ranked outside the Top 100 is a matchup he was probably happy with, but Zhukayev has played some good tennis lately. Muller's experience and more complete game still make him a slight favorite, but a victory for Zhukayev would not be surprising. After making a promising start on grass by making the semifinal at the Libema Open, Opelka must have been disappointed not to make a deep run at the Queen's Club, in Eastbourne, or at Wimbledon on a surface that suits him. However, fast hard courts like those in Washington also suit the massive server. 191 Cassone will not be used to playing someone who serves that big. I doubt that the 22-year-old, inexperienced at ATP Tour level, will be able to create many break chances or stop Opelka from manufacturing chances on return. He is particularly interested in the women's game and loves offering his insights on anything related to the WTA Tour.
