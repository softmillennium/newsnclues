                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Albizzia julibrissin is a widely distributed plant in China. Its dried stem bark has been used in traditional oriental medicine to treat insomnia, diuresis, sthenia, ascaricide, and confusion. Phytochemical investigations on the components of the stem bark of Albizzia julibrissin resulted in the isolation of saponins, lignans, phenolic glycosides, triterpenes, flavonoids, and others. The bioactive ingredients from Albizzia julibrissin have been reported for their medicinal activities such as anti-tumor, inhibitory effect of diarrhoea, and a sedative activity. Nonetheless, to date, literature on polysaccharide as an important component of Chinese herbal remains scarce, particularly in the case of polysaccharide in Albizzia julibrissin. We demonstrated that AJDW could inhibit the growth and proliferation of pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo. Notably, this polysaccharide suppressed pancreatic cancer migration, blocked cell cycle and induced ROS-mediated apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential linked to PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway." Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignant tumor with poor prognosis, and most of the current chemotherapeutic agents are prone to drug resistance and have extreme side effects. Hence, the discovery of polysaccharides with anti-pancreatic cancer activity is in clinical demand. "In our work, patient-derived xenografted mice model was constructed, and AJDW would completely impede pancreatic cancer growth in nude mice, which was matched with the anti-pancreatic cancer activity in cellular level." "Our findings not only showed the novel polysaccharide compound in Chinese herbal AJD, but also revealed its anti-pancreatic cancer effect." This discovery provides the material and theoretical basis for the potential anti-tumor effect of AJD, further facilitating the development of new anti-pancreatic cancer drugs based on natural ingredients. AJDW, polysaccharide from Albizia julibrissin, binds to PI3K and induces cell cycle arrest and ROS-mediated pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This discovery opens a new avenue for developing targeted strategies to control appetite and treat metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. On July 9, KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced that the research was led by Professor Greg S.B. The team demonstrated that, in a state of hunger, animals are capable of detecting and preferentially selecting D-glucose in the gut via a specialized gut-brain circuit. These neurons did not respond, or responded inversely, to other nutrients like L-glucose, amino acids, or fats. This is in contrast to signals from amino acids and fats, which travel to the brain via the vagus nerve. Inhibiting the activity of CRF neurons in fasting mice eliminated their natural preference for glucose, confirming the necessity of this circuit for glucose-specific nutrient selection. The study builds on Professor Suh's earlier work at NYU, where his team identified DH44 neurons in fruit flies that detect sugar in the gut. Inspired by the possibility that mammals might possess similar glucose-sensing neurons, the KAIST team launched this investigation. Dr. Jineun Kim (KAIST Ph.D., now at Caltech) played a leading role in the study, demonstrating that fasting mice preferred glucose over other nutrients delivered directly into the stomach and that CRF neurons responded in real time. Wongyo Jung (KAIST B.S., now a Ph.D. student at Caltech) contributed modeling and behavioral analyses, while Dr. Shinhye Kim uncovered the role of specific spinal neurons in transmitting nutrient signals from the gut to the brain. Kim and Kim noted, "This study began with a simple but fundamental question: How does the brain distinguish glucose from other nutrients absorbed in the gut? We've shown that spinal-based gut-brain circuits play a central role in maintaining energy balance and metabolic homeostasis." Professor Suh added, "By identifying a specialized gut-brain pathway for glucose sensing, this research opens up new therapeutic possibilities for metabolic diseases. Moving forward, we aim to investigate how similar circuits detect other essential nutrients, such as amino acids and fats, and how these systems interact." Ph.D. student Jineun Kim, Dr. Shinhye Kim, and student Wongyo Jung (co-first authors) contributed to this study, which was published online in the international journal Neuron on June 20, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gaining insights into the complex pathways and key cell populations involved in immune dysregulation can aid the development of therapeutic approaches to treat polytrauma, which is associated with poor patient outcomes. In a new study, researchers from the USA have utilized advanced genetic analysis tools and techniques to reveal the cellular and molecular processes involved in polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation. Their findings advance our current knowledge on polytrauma and indicate actionable targets to treat immune dysregulation. Polytrauma, which involves multiple serious injuries occurring simultaneously, is associated with complex healing challenges. In such cases, bone regeneration is often compromised, accompanied by widespread immune system dysregulation. These effects may not surface immediately, but they commonly emerge later in recovery, contributing to increased treatment burden and poorer long-term outcomes. Previous studies have explored immune activity either at the injury site or within systemic tissues like blood and bone marrow. To address this gap, a team of researchers led by Professor Krishnendu Roy, Bruce and Bridgitt Evans Dean of Engineering at Vanderbilt University, conducted a comprehensive study using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This work was supported by a National Institutes of Health grant (R01AR074960). Their findings were published online in Bone Research on 07 July, 2025. "Previously, our research group had developed a preclinical rat model of polytrauma that could mimic severe musculoskeletal trauma along with the associated local and systemic immune responses. In this study, we utilized cells from the polytrauma rat model and subjected them to scRNA-seq analysis to comprehensively assess the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive immune dysregulation in polytrauma", says Prof. Roy, sharing further details about the study. Their analysis revealed a prominent role of myeloid cells—a type of white blood cell—in shaping immune responses across the blood, bone marrow, and injured tissue. Building on their previous findings linking systemic immunosuppressive myeloid cells with poor bone healing outcomes, the researchers sub-clustered the blood polytrauma myeloid cells into five distinct groups to identify those expressing immunosuppressive genes such as interleukins-4 (IL-4), IL-13, and IL-10. Further DEG analysis revealed that TIM cells from polytrauma patients significantly expressed additional immunosuppressive genes, including annexin A1 (Anxa1) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2). To decipher the pathways used by TIM cells to communicate with other myeloid cells, the team assessed ligand-receptor interactions using CellChat tool. Their analysis revealed that TIM cells were dependent on chemokine pathway involving Ccl6-Ccr1 and immunosuppressive Anxa1-Fpr2 mechanisms to communicate with other cells in polytrauma blood. In the local injury site tissue affected during polytrauma, mono/mac cells demonstrated increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes including secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), fibronectin 1 (FN1), and Anxa2. Interestingly, the mono/mac cells showed reduced expression of tissue repair genes following polytrauma. By utilizing an integrated all-tissue dataset, the research team further discovered 15 closely connected hub genes which could potentially regulate polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation. The altered communication patterns in polytrauma reveal the critical role of myeloid cell interactions, with TIM cells involved in immune suppression while mono/mac cells drive inflammatory pathways. Future studies can build on our findings to develop targeted strategies to modulate immune responses, reduce complications, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes in patients with polytrauma. Towards that goal, a multi-site clinical study to risk stratify patients with open tibial fractures has been initiated by Prof. Guldberg and colleagues. In summary, this study not only advances our current understanding of complex immune interactions following polytrauma but also provides actionable targets for therapeutic intervention. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis identifies systemic immunosuppressive myeloid cells and local monocytes/macrophages as key regulators in polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Nature has been at this for millions of years and offers clues for developing better biomaterials," said senior author Wyatt Shields, Thomas F. Austin assistant professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at CU Boulder. First-author Jin Gyun Lee, a postdoctoral researcher in the Shields Lab, said early results show great promise. "We envision that this gecko-inspired technology could ultimately reduce the frequency of clinical treatments, potentially allowing patients to receive fewer but longer-lasting therapies," Lee said. The gecko's secret to effortlessly ascending surfaces as smooth as glass lies in the millions of microscopic, hair-like fibers, called setae, that line their toes. With each step, these structures - and thousands of even tinier split ends called spatulae - flatten out across a broad surface area, conforming into nooks and crannies. When molecules on the spatulae and surfaces interact- a phenomenon known as Van der Waals force- their feet stick hard. Yet just a slight movement can break the bond, enabling them to scurry on. Scientists have tried for decades to replicate the design of the gecko toe, for use in stronger adhesives, medical and personal care products, and more. But those tiny hairs have proven complicated and expensive to fabricate and almost impossible to make at scale. Shields and Lee sought to invent a material that was not only sticky, but could also linger safely in the body, delivering a sustained dose of medicine, before disintegrating. They developed a way to turn an already FDA-approved biodegradable polymer, poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), into small particles displaying branched hair-like nanostructures similar to those on the gecko's feet. Then they infused these "soft dendritic particles" with chemotherapy drugs and attached them to cancer cells in a petri dish and bladder tumors in mice. The animals tolerated them well and elicited a favorable immune response. We've developed a practical, flexible platform for localized cancer therapy that could be easily scaled and translated." The authors stress that more research is necessary, and it could be years before the technology is ready for clinical trials in people. Ultimately, they say, it could be a game changer for treating localized tumors, with minimal damage to surrounding healty tissue. The team started with bladder cancer because it can be uniquely challenging to treat. "Bladder cancer is common, with most patients presenting with localized disease," said co-author Thomas Flaig, MD, an oncologist and professor of medicine at CU Anschutz who specializes in bladder cancer. "There is a real need for new and effective therapies to prevent progression to more advanced stages of disease for these patients." To treat localized bladder tumors, doctors typically insert a catheter into the bladder and bathe the organ in chemotherapy drugs. Because people urinate about six times a day, the medication washes out fast, necessitating frequent repeat treatments that can be painful. The researchers envision a day when a gel containing their gecko-inspired particles could be applied directly to the tumor, delivering a sustained, high concentration of cancer-killing medicine more selectively to the tumor until it breaks down and is excreted. The technology could also work for other cancers, such as oral, head or neck tumors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new genetic analysis using data from over five million people has provided a clearer understanding of the risk of going on to live with obesity. New research led by the Universities of Copenhagen and Bristol shows analyzing genes at a young age may support early strategies to prevent obesity developing later in life. However, treatment strategies such as lifestyle change, surgery and medications are not universally available or effective. By drawing on genetic data from over five million people, an international team of researchers, have created a measure called a polygenic risk score (PGS) that is reliably associated with adulthood obesity and shows consistent and indicative patterns in early childhood. The findings could help to identify children and adolescents at higher genetic risk of developing obesity in later life, who could benefit from targeted preventative strategies, such as lifestyle interventions, at a younger age. "What makes the score so powerful is the consistency of associations between the genetic score and body mass index before the age of five and through to adulthood – timing that starts well before other risk factors start to shape their weight later in childhood. Intervening at this point could theoretically make a huge impact," said Assistant Professor Roelof Smit at the University of Copenhagen and lead author of the research published in the journal Nature Medicine. The subtle variations in people's genomes can have a real impact on health when acting together. Thousands of genetic variants have been identified that increase the risk of obesity, for example, variants that act in the brain and influence appetite. The PGS was able to explain almost a fifth (17%) of a person's variation in body mass index – much higher than in previous studies. To create these PGS, the scientists drew on the genetic data of more than five million people – the largest and most diverse genetic dataset ever – including genetic data from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium and consumer DNA testing firm, 23andMe. They found that their new PGS was twice as effective as the previous best method at predicting a person's risk of developing obesity. Obesity is a major public health issue, with many factors contributing to its development, including genetics, environment, lifestyle and behaviour. These factors likely vary across a person's life, and we believe that some of these originate in childhood. We hope this work will contribute to detecting individuals at high risk of developing obesity at an earlier age, which could have a vast clinical and public health impact in the future." Dr. Kaitlin Wade, Associate Professor in Epidemiology, University of Bristol and second author on this paper The research team also investigated the relationship between a person's genetic risk of obesity and the impact of lifestyle weight loss interventions, such as diet and exercise. They discovered that people with a higher genetic risk of obesity were more responsive to interventions but also regained weight more quickly when the interventions ended. For example, it was far better at predicting obesity in people with European-like ancestry than in people with African ancestry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the aging population grows, could your supplement routine help combat muscle and bone decline? This new review highlights which emerging options hold real promise, and where science still needs to catch up. They concluded that novel supplements have the potential to play a significant role in nutritional interventions aimed at improving bone and muscle composition and enhancing physical function in older adults. However, further research is needed to determine their efficacy and identify which populations benefit most. The review also highlights that agents affecting bile acid metabolism are an emerging area of interest within the gut–bone–muscle axis. Osteosarcopenia is a growing health concern among older adults, defined by the combined presence of osteoporosis (weakened bone structure and low bone density) and sarcopenia (muscle loss with age). As the global elderly population is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2050, the prevalence of osteosarcopenia is likely to increase, making it an urgent public health issue. Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures, particularly in older adults who are also more prone to falls. Sarcopenia contributes to loss of muscle strength and physical function, and there is currently no approved medication to treat it. When these two conditions occur together, they amplify each other's adverse effects, increasing the risks of death, falls, and disability. Shared risk factors such as impaired protein metabolism, hormonal changes, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation contribute to the deterioration of both bone and muscle. Therefore, interventions targeting one tissue may also benefit the other. However, emerging research suggests that novel supplements, such as hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB), creatine, probiotics, prebiotics, and compounds that influence bile acid metabolism, may offer additional benefits. Creatine is a compound vital for energy production, especially in muscles and the brain. While the body produces some creatine, dietary sources, mainly fish and meat, are essential. Older adults often consume less creatine, making supplementation a potentially beneficial option. Research indicates that creatine, particularly when combined with resistance training, enhances muscle mass, strength, and function in older individuals, thereby reducing fall risk and improving mobility. It may instead influence bone geometry and strength indirectly through muscle gain. Combining creatine with protein, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), or vitamin D has been shown to provide additional benefits for muscle health in some studies. However, there is currently no research on the synergy between creatine and prebiotics, probiotics, or HMB in older adults. The review specifically notes that studies of combined supplementation (such as creatine plus HMB or creatine plus probiotics) have not been conducted in older populations. HMB, a metabolite of the amino acid leucine, has gained interest for its potential to support muscle health in older adults. It enhances muscle protein synthesis and reduces breakdown, potentially helping to preserve muscle mass during periods of inactivity or illness. Supplementation up to three grams a day is considered safe, but research findings are mixed. Some studies have shown that HMB improves hand grip strength and muscle quality, particularly with prolonged use of more than 12 weeks. However, the effects on skeletal muscle mass and physical performance remain inconsistent, and most trials demonstrate only small or non-significant effects on muscle mass. Most evidence is not available for community-dwelling older adults; few studies have been conducted, and the effects are modest, with statistical significance primarily observed for hand grip strength, rather than mass or performance. Evidence for HMB's role in bone health is limited to animal studies, with no randomized controlled trials in humans. HMB may work synergistically with other supplements, such as vitamin D, creatine, protein, and probiotics, to enhance muscle growth and development outcomes. However, results vary by population and supplement combinations. Prebiotics (non-digestible fibers) and probiotics (live beneficial microbes) may influence muscle and bone health by modulating the gut microbiota. Together, as synbiotics, they enhance microbial balance and promote anti-inflammatory effects. Aging-related changes in gut microbiota are associated with sarcopenia and osteoporosis through mechanisms that involve nutrient absorption, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and immune regulation. The gut–muscle axis suggests that microbiota influence muscle strength and metabolism, while the gut–bone axis shows impacts on bone density through immune modulation, hormone production, and gut barrier function. Probiotics, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, may improve muscle function and mass; however, well-designed clinical trials in older adults are limited. The review specifies that only one study in mildly frail adults over 70 years showed improvement with L. plantarum; most evidence for probiotic effects in older people is based on animal models or mixed-age populations. Similarly, certain prebiotics have been shown to enhance bone health in animal models. Human data for older adults are scarce and strain-specific. Though mostly safe, probiotics may rarely cause infections in vulnerable individuals, including bacteremia or liver abscess. This review highlighted emerging nutritional supplements as promising strategies for managing osteosarcopenia in older adults. HMB may enhance muscle strength, though results are inconsistent. Probiotics and prebiotics offer potential through modulation of the gut microbiota, but their effects vary by individual and bacterial strain. Overall, these interventions show promise, but further research is needed to optimize their use and identify target populations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers show that specific dairy products, particularly fortified goat milk, offer superior benefits in combating muscle wasting and inflammation in aging mice, pointing to new dietary strategies for healthier aging. Study: Four Dairy Products Mitigates Sarcopenia in Mice by Modulating Muscle Inflammation, Autophagy, and Protein Degradation. In a recent study published in the Food Science & Nutrition journal, researchers used murine models to investigate whether four everyday dairy products, specifically variants of goat and bovine milk, could delay the progression of sarcopenia—the age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and function. Study findings reveal that mice fed dairy-enriched diets exhibited reduced markers of muscle inflammation and improved muscle fiber integrity. This suggests that daily consumption of dairy products may support muscle health by modulating inflammatory and immune pathways. Sarcopenia is a stealthy yet debilitating consequence of aging, clinically characterized as the progressive loss of strength, muscle mass, and function leading to frailty, falls, and increased healthcare costs. The condition is emerging as a severe public health concern in today's rapidly aging population, with 10–27% of the global population estimated to live with the disease. Current prevention strategies include supervised resistance exercises and high-protein diets to slow the progression of the condition. Dairy products, in particular, are gaining considerable attention, with the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia recommending their consumption to sarcopenia patients. Unfortunately, these recommendations are based exclusively on dairy's reputation as a source of high-quality protein and its observed benefits in general age-associated health outcomes, primarily due to its vitamin D and calcium content. The direct benefits of dairy on muscle mass and function, as well as the mechanisms by which its products promote healthy muscle metabolism, remain unverified. A handful of recent studies suggest that fermented dairy products contain bioactive peptides with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. To simultaneously elucidate the role of dairy products in sarcopenia outcomes and investigate the mechanisms of their action, the present study leverages animal (aging mice) model systems to explore the impacts of consuming four specific dairy products on muscle integrity, inflammation, mitochondrial function, and relative muscle-degradation-associated gene expression. The model system consisted of SPF C57BL/6 mice (n = 60, sex = male, age = 8 months) randomly assigned to six experimental groups (each n = 10): 1. The NC group was administered 5 mg/kg saline intraperitoneally for 8 weeks. All other groups were administered dexamethasone for the same duration as a means of artificially inducing sarcopenia. Outcomes of interest included grip strength (measured using a grip strength meter), weight (fat and lean), bone mineral density (dual-energy X-ray absorption [DXA]), autophagy (western blotting), muscle morphology, host metabolism (XploreMet platform), inflammation, and gut microbial health (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing). Statistical analyses included confirmations of sample homogeneity and normality, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for reporting multigroup comparisons, least significant difference (LSD) test for reporting pairwise comparisons, and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis for gut microbiotal evaluations. Gut microbiota function was predicted using the KEGG and PICRUSt2 pathway libraries. The outcomes of metabolomic assays were elucidated using univariate analyses and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). At study initiation (baseline), all sarcopenia (non-NC group) mice demonstrated reduced grip strength and lean weight. Dairy supplementation alleviated the latter concern (all dairy products caused a surge in lean weight) but did not significantly address the former. Critically, only goat milk products (not bovine) significantly reduced fat weight. Molecular investigations revealed that all dairy products impacted sarcopenia through similar mechanisms: activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, with low-fat goat milk (GLM/GFM) showing stronger mTOR activation; enhancement of muscle regeneration; reduced AMPK phosphorylation; and upregulated MyoG expression, specifically in GFM-supplemented mice (fortified goat low-fat milk). Autophagy investigations presented a similar picture, with all dairy products promoting autophagy through increased LC3B expression and decreased p62 levels. However, low-fat goat milk (GLM) showed the most substantial reduction in p62 levels. Dairy products were also observed to benefit inflammation marker profiles, with significant reductions in CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and CXCL10 levels compared to SOP controls. Gut microbial investigations revealed that all dairy products promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria, especially those from the genus Leuconostoc. Most importantly, mice supplemented with GLM and GFM showed increased densities of S. sciuri. S. sciuri may contribute to muscle health benefits, suggesting low-fat goat's milk variants as promising candidates in non-invasive sarcopenia interventions. A novel "dairy-microbial score" revealed that GLM and GFM had significantly higher beneficial microbial profiles compared to whole goat milk, correlating with lower fat mass. Metabolomics revealed leucine enrichment in the GFM groups, which was negatively associated with the dairy-microbial score. Bone mineral density improved with GWM, GFM, and BWM, but not GLM, underscoring composition-dependent effects. This study presents promising evidence that regular consumption of dairy products, particularly low-fat goat milk fortified with vitamin D and calcium (GFM), could help delay or prevent sarcopenia by reducing inflammation and supporting muscle regeneration. While findings are currently limited to animal models, they underscore the importance of dairy composition (source, fat content, fortification) and frequent consumption in shaping long-term muscle health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research uncovers how repetitive strain injuries ignite an inflammatory storm, driving both pain and social withdrawal, offering fresh insight into the biological roots of workplace burnout and recovery. Study: Overuse injury induces persistent behavioral declines that correlate with higher IL-6 expression in the affected musculoskeletal tissues, circulation, and brain. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) sideline millions of workers each year and drain billions in productivity losses, but still, it is not fully understood how repeating the same physical tasks leads to fatigue, pain, and social withdrawal. Animal studies further indicate that proinflammatory cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and disrupt mood-related neural circuits. Key factors include how age, task intensity, and rest periods interact within this neuroimmune dialogue. Further studies should investigate sex-specific effects, fever responses, and long-term functional outcomes. Investigators employed a three-arm, randomized, controlled design using mature female Sprague-Dawley rats (14 months of age at the onset). After food restriction, animals were trained under operant conditioning to reach and pull a lever for 6 weeks until they produced about 55% of their maximum voluntary pulling force (MPF). Randomly selected trained rats then performed a high-repetition low-force (HRLF) task for 6 weeks: 2 hours per day, 3 days per week, with a target of 4 reaches per minute at 15% MPF. Blinded observers tracked reflexive grip strength, forepaw mechanical sensitivity, social interaction with a juvenile rat, and observed aggression at baseline, after training, and again at week 6. After 6 weeks of task exposure or matched rest, animals were euthanized, and serum, flexor digitorum muscles, tendons, bones, median nerves, and selected brain regions were collected. Cytokines including interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Brain sections were double-labeled for IL-6 with neuronal nuclei antigen (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), or ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures mixed-effects models and Tukey post hoc tests (α = 0.05); planned samples achieved at least 80% statistical power. Training resulted in immediate functional costs, as both experimental groups lost approximately 20% of their baseline grip force and became hypersensitive to forepaw stimulation. By week six, rest partially rescued sensation, yet grip weakness lingered, while task animals deteriorated further. They remained 25% weaker than controls, withdrew their paws to monofilaments one-third the original size, and cut prosocial grooming and sniffing time from 40 to 20 seconds. The incidence of boxing or biting rose from nearly 0% in controls and trained rats (who showed only a single instance of aggression) to 42% in task rats. A slight but statistically significant reduction in body weight was also observed in task rats compared to controls at the end of the study. Force-sensor logs revealed that voluntary pull force averaged 27 centinewtons (cN), close to the 15% MPF target, but unsuccessful attempts doubled to more than 300 per two-hour session, intensifying cumulative load. Serum IL-1α climbed twofold, TNF-α threefold, and IL-6 fourfold in task rats, whereas the trained + rest group displayed only modest rises in IL-1α and TNF-α, but, crucially, showed no significant increase in IL-6. With the repetitive reaching task, IL-6 increased by 200 to 500% in flexor muscles, forearm bones, and median nerves, while IL-10 declined in muscles, shifting the local balance toward inflammation. Uninvolved tail tissues showed no change, highlighting regional specificity. Immunohistology identified approximately six IL-6-positive neurons per square millimeter in the rostral cingulate cortex of task rats versus one in controls, alongside dense labeling of ependymal cells and selective activation of the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), with a similar, though not statistically significant, trend observed in the subfornical organ (SFO), gateway regions through which blood-borne cytokines influence the brain. Median nerve IL-6 and TNF-α tracked most strongly with pain metrics, highlighting the nerve's role in pathogenic signaling. Muscle width remained unchanged, excluding sarcopenia as a confounder. Power analysis confirmed adequate sample size, and most group differences achieved p < 0.01. Elevations in GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba-1-positive microglia co-expressing IL-6 within the ventricles signaled neuro-immune activation, providing a plausible substrate for the enduring behavioral deficits observed despite cessation of high-force loading. To summarize, repetitive reaching tasks in aging female rats triggered a multi-level inflammatory cascade dominated by IL-6, which paralleled the development of lasting pain-like and sickness behaviors. Local musculoskeletal cytokine surges spilled into the bloodstream, traversed the BBB, and engaged limbic circuits implicated in mood and pain processing, linking workplace-style overuse to whole-body malaise. Therapies that dampen IL-6 signaling or interrupt this injury-inflammation cycle could accelerate rehabilitation, reduce sick leave, and lower the broader costs of WMSDs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A novel study reveals that targeting a single protein's aggregation can dramatically reduce brain injury after stroke, potentially transforming how acute ischemic strokes are treated. Study: Inhibition of GAPDH aggregation as a potential treatment for acute ischemic stroke. A recent study published in the journal iScience reported that inhibiting the aggregation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) could be a therapeutic target for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Stroke is the second leading cause of death. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is among the most effective treatments for AIS but has limited acceptability and a narrow therapeutic window (within 4.5 hours). Other medications are symptomatic treatments and have short therapeutic time windows. As such, novel therapeutic approaches are needed to explore alternative therapies. Evidence suggests that ischemia-reperfusion injury plays a role in AIS pathogenesis. The brain undergoes robust nitrosative/oxidative stress during ischemia-reperfusion, resulting in neuronal death. Understanding the damage induced by stress could illuminate the underlying mechanisms and help identify potential treatments for AIS. GAPDH is a multifunctional protein that exhibits various functions, including DNA repair, kinase regulation, heme metabolism, and regulation of necrosis and apoptosis. In the present study, researchers assessed whether GAPDH aggregation induced by ischemia-reperfusion is involved in the pathogenesis of AIS. First, a mouse AIS model was created by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). GAPDH aggregates were detected in the striatum (ischemic core) 12 hours post-reperfusion, preceding infarction. The team generated conditional transgenic mice with neuron-specific expression of GAPDH-C152A to test whether neuronal damage could be prevented by inhibiting the aggregation. To this end, they used a human GAPDH-C152A construct (which reduces GAPDH aggregation in a dominant-negative manner) and doxycycline for temporal control of its expression. Further, transgenic and non-transgenic mice were treated with Dox or vehicle for 14 days before MCAO. By contrast, Dox-untreated transgenic mice had significantly smaller infarct volumes in both cortex and striatum than Dox-treated counterparts. Moreover, the neurological score, a unilateral paralysis index, was significantly improved in Dox-untreated transgenic mice, suggesting that GAPDH-C152 expression ameliorated brain damage. The researchers previously reported that GAPDH aggregates induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in vitro. As such, mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed based on the release of cell death mediators: apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c (Cyt c), which enter the nucleus and cytosol, respectively. Both nuclear AIF and cytosolic Cyt c levels were significantly lower in Dox-untreated transgenic mice than in Dox-treated transgenic mice. Further, the team evaluated whether brain damage could be prevented through pharmacological inhibition of GAPDH aggregation. To this end, peptides with varying types and numbers of amino acids were designed and tested for their inhibitory potential. The SCT (serine-cysteine-threonine) tripeptide (GAI-17, IC50 = 1.18 μM) was identified as the most potent inhibitor, without adverse effects on cell viability or GAPDH enzymatic activity. Its therapeutic effects were subsequently assessed in the MCAO model. GAI-17 pretreatment significantly reduced infarct volumes in a dose-dependent fashion. Treatment with 60 nmol GAI-17 did not affect physiological parameters. In addition, nuclear AIF and cytosolic Cyt c levels were significantly reduced in the cortex by 60 nmol GAI-17. Neurological deficits were improved considerably by GAI-17 treatment in the post-3h and post-6h groups. However, the post-9h group lacked protective effects, establishing a therapeutic window up to 6 hours post-reperfusion. The research had key limitations: (1) Only transient ischemia (with reperfusion) was modeled, not permanent stroke; (2) Effects were only assessed acutely (≤48h), not in subacute/chronic phases; (3) Potential off-target effects of GAI-17 remain unexplored; and (4) While females showed reduced susceptibility to damage, sex differences weren't fully investigated. The study demonstrated that GAPDH aggregates form prior to the onset of brain infarction following ischemia-reperfusion in a mouse AIS model. The findings suggest GAPDH aggregation as a likely causal mechanism for neuronal death in AIS. Decreasing GAPDH aggregation via genetic (C152A-GAPDH expression) or pharmacological (GAI-17) approaches alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and ameliorated neurological deficits and brain damage primarily in the cortical penumbra. Together, the findings suggest that inhibiting GAPDH aggregation could be a therapeutic target for AIS, offering an extended treatment window compared to current options.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A diet rich in foods that support gut microbiota diversity is linked to reduced age acceleration, pointing to new strategies for healthy aging and disease prevention. Study: Association of a newly proposed dietary index for gut microbiota with phenotypic age acceleration: a cross-sectional study of NHANES 1999–2018. In a recent study published in the Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition, researchers assessed associations between the dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) and phenotypic age acceleration (PAA). Adding good foods mattered more than cutting bad ones: Boosting intake of beneficial components (like fiber, fermented dairy) showed a stronger link to slower aging (OR 0.92) than just reducing detrimental foods like red meat (OR 0.97). Aging is a significant global health concern, affecting lifespan and contributing to an increased disease burden. Dietary factors have increasingly gained attention for their role in regulating aging. Studies indicate links between gut microbiota composition or diversity and aging-related diseases. A functionally intact and diverse gut microbiota could delay aging. In contrast, unhealthy diets rich in fats and refined grains can lead to gut dysbiosis and accelerate the aging process. The DI-GM is a composite score balancing the intakes of foods deemed detrimental or beneficial to microbial diversity. However, its relationship with biological aging remains unclear. Data were used from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) conducted between 1999 and 2018 in the United States. Participants were included if they were aged 20 years or older and excluded if they lacked diet or phenotypic age data. The DI-GM score (range: 0–13) was derived from two 24-hour dietary recalls, with higher scores indicating greater benefits to the gut microbiota. The index originally included 14 components, but green tea, unavailable in NHANES, was excluded. Scoring was based on sex-specific median food intake. Phenotypic age relied on real clinical markers: The biological age calculation incorporated routine blood test results like albumin, creatinine, and white blood cell count alongside vital signs like blood pressure. Phenotypic age was determined using 10 physiological indicators (including chronological age), such as creatinine, albumin, glucose, lymphocyte percentage, C-reactive protein, mean cell volume, white blood cell count, alkaline phosphatase, and red cell distribution width. PAA was defined as a positive ACR. Potential confounding variables included gender, age, marital status, race, poverty income ratio, body mass index (BMI), alcohol intake, smoking status, education level, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), physical activity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate the association between the DI-GM score and ACR and PAA. Furthermore, restricted cubic spline analyses were used to assess the non-linear relationship between PAA and DI-GM. Notably, detrimental food components exhibited a significant non-linear association with PAA, whereas the overall DI-GM showed a linear association (P = 0.063 for non-linearity). In addition, stratified analyses were performed to explore the consistency of associations in subgroups defined by age, gender, alcohol intake, race, smoking status, and chronic disease status (diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease). A significant interaction emerged between DI-GM and age groups. Moreover, various sensitivity analyses, including propensity score matching and multiple imputation for missing data, were undertaken to verify the robustness of the findings. Avoiding harmful foods still helped, but differently: While reducing processed meats and refined grains lowered PAA risk, this relationship wasn't perfectly linear, suggesting complex threshold effects. In total, 29,435 NHANES participants aged 50.3 years, on average, were included. Individuals with PAA were significantly older and had a higher BMI and lower average DI-GM score than those without PAA. There were significant differences in race, gender, education level, smoking status, and chronic disease status between individuals with and without PAA. Further, higher DI-GM scores were significantly associated with lower ACR and PAA. A linear, negative correlation was found between DI-GM scores and PAA risk. Stratified analyses showed that higher scores were consistently associated with reduced PAA risks across subgroups. Likewise, sensitivity analyses using advanced statistical methods confirmed these results. Taken together, the findings illustrate that higher DI-GM scores were significantly associated with lower ACR and PAA risks. Specifically, each unit increment in the score was associated with 7% lower PAA risk in the fully adjusted model. Increasing beneficial foods had a stronger effect than reducing detrimental ones. This suggests that the potential benefits of dietary patterns on the gut microbiota may play a vital role in slowing biological aging. However, as a cross-sectional study based on 24-hour dietary recalls, causality cannot be inferred, and long-term dietary patterns may not be fully captured.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals that mind-body exercise, such as tai chi and yoga, surpasses other workouts in reversing frailty and enhancing daily function for seniors, offering a cost-effective strategy for healthier aging worldwide. Study: Mind-body training outperforms other physical activities in reducing frailty and enhancing quality of life in older adults: a network meta-analysis. Current estimates suggest that up to 25% of older adults live with frailty, which is characterized by declining strength, slowed gait, and poor endurance. As the global population continues to age, the prevalence of frailty will continue to rise and negatively impact the lives of community-dwelling older adults, particularly those residing in low- and middle-income countries. To date, numerous studies have confirmed the benefits associated with physical activity or regular exercise for building resilience to both prevent and reverse frailty. Despite these observations, it remains unclear whether certain physical activity modalities may be more effective in reducing frailty outcomes than others. Frailty was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) or Fried phenotype, whereas ADL was quantified using the Barthel Index or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). QoL of the study participants was determined using standardized instruments including the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), SF-12, SF-8, and EuroQol-5 Dimension (Eq-5D). Mind-body training was associated with the most significant reduction in frailty as compared to controls, who exhibited the least improvement. Thereafter, mixed physical activity also improved frailty outcomes, whereas aerobic and strength training provided less significant improvements. Overall, mind-body training was considered to be 81% more effective in ameliorating frailty in older adults than all other interventions. Mind-body training also led to the most effective QoL improvements as compared to the other exercise interventions. Compared to aerobic training, aerobic training was associated with more significant improvements in ADLs in up to 74% of cases. Nevertheless, both mind-body training and mixed physical activity similarly improved ADLs, with a modest impact associated with strength training as compared to controls. The subgroup analyses demonstrated that the efficacy of community programs was similar to that associated with hospital interventions, which supports a shift in policy toward local delivery. Mind-body training sessions of 50‑60 minutes at least three times every week were associated with the greatest improvements. The observed improvements in frailty measurements persisted across continents, economic strata, and baseline fitness, which confirms the generalizability of this approach. Cost modeling indicated that each quality‑adjusted life year (QALY) gained through mind-body training was one‑third of the price of current pharmacological fall‑prevention programs. Taken together, exercise emerges as a low‑risk pathway to resilience in aging. Mind-body training emerged as most effective in alleviating frailty and enhancing overall quality of life, making it particularly suitable for severely frail individuals with restricted mobility.” Exercise modality is a key factor in determining the prescription of movement medicine for seniors. Mind‑body training was associated with consistent and significant improvements in both frailty and QoL outcomes, whereas aerobic workouts are ideal for preserving daily independence. Importantly, mixed physical activity and strength training also offer complementary benefits. The effects of these exercise modalities exceed clinically meaningful levels, can be easily incorporated into community settings, and are considered both safe and cost‑efficient. The study findings indicate that practitioners should prioritize one-hour sessions that incorporate both mindfulness and exertion with a frequency of at least three sessions each week. Policymakers can invest confidently in local mind‑body sessions, while researchers are encouraged to continue assessing adherence, biological pathways, and cost‑effectiveness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists uncover how zebrafish switch between cell division and direct differentiation to rebuild sensory organs, challenging long-held views on tissue regeneration. Specifically, the study leveraged cutting-edge CRISPR gene editing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and live imaging to investigate how two distinct cyclin D genes, ccndx and ccnd2a, regulate distinct cell populations during the development and regeneration of these sensory organs. Even when one pathway is lost, the other can partially compensate, but regeneration proceeds via a limited and less robust mechanism. For example, in ccndx mutants, direct differentiation can generate hair cells without division; however, fewer cells and a pronounced polarity defect occur, with approximately 70% of regenerated hair cells exhibiting a posterior bias. This polarity defect is mechanistically linked to reduced expression of hes2.2, which normally inhibits Emx2, a master regulator of hair cell polarity. Together, these genes ensure robust tissue maintenance, offering new therapeutic directions for sensory regeneration research. Tissue turnover and regeneration are fundamental processes essential for maintaining life. These constantly occurring processes rely on delicate balances between populations of stem cells, which gradually replenish themselves over time, and progenitor cells, which mature into specialized forms in response to physiological requirements. Decades of research have revealed that cyclin D proteins, known primarily for their crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression, have substantial modulatory effects on cell proliferation. Unfortunately, the mechanistic associations between specific stem cell populations and cyclin D protein use remain poorly understood. Unraveling these associations may open the door to novel regenerative therapies, especially relevant in today's increasingly aging global population, which is experiencing a decline in sensory ability. Recent research aims to leverage the zebrafish, a well-studied model organism renowned for its regenerative capabilities, to answer this question. In particular, the zebrafish's sensory lateral line is known to regenerate cells rapidly following injury. This line consists of hair, support, and mantle cells, essential for detecting water movement. Given their functional analogy to the human inner ear, these models are used to gain a better understanding of sensory regeneration. The study focuses on two cyclin D genes: ccndx and ccnd2a. By leveraging CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a gene editing, transgenic zebrafish with ccndx and/or ccnd2a knocked out were then observed (via scRNA-seq) to elucidate their differences in gene expression and cell states. These assays were replicated over 10,000 cells and were complemented by RNA velocity modeling using the scVelo and partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) algorithms. Researchers began by treating zebrafish larvae with neomycin, an antibiotic (ototoxin) that triggers rapid hair death (and subsequent regeneration) along the lateral line organ. Observation via single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) assays in combination with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling and time-lapse imaging (Nikon Ti2 Eclipse; 42 hours at 28.5 °C) resulted in the identification of two proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression-marked cell populations, one governed by ccndx and the other by ccnd2a. Finally, protein modeling using the Robetta and Mol*3D Viewer platforms was conducted to compare the structural conservation of cyclin D proteins across transgenic zebrafish species. Statistical analyses comprised analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests for inter-treatment difference significant reporting (p < 0.05). Neomycin treatment assays revealed the presence of two independent cell populations involved in neuromast regeneration. Importantly, expressing ccnd2a under the ccndx promoter, an artificial genetic rescue, was able to restore both the number and orientation of hair cells in ccndx-mutants (p < 0.0001), marking a mechanistic demonstration rather than a physiological compensation. In contrast, ccnd2a-deficient mutants showed reduced amplifying stem cell proliferation during development, but regeneration was less affected, suggesting that other cyclins can compensate during tissue repair, without inducing polarity defects. This independent regulation suggests sensory regeneration can occur even if one population (pathway) is compromised. For example, five days post-fertilization (dpf), ccndx mutants showed significantly reduced EdU+ differentiating progenitor cells compared to their wild-type siblings (p = 0.0001), while amplifying cell counts remained unchanged (p = 0.35). This finding that zebrafish hair cells can regenerate through direct differentiation without progenitor proliferation represents a paradigm shift in regenerative biology, challenging the long-standing view that proliferation is essential for tissue regeneration. Finally, this study revealed the importance of ‘Notch signaling' in sensory regeneration. This highly conserved cell-to-cell communication pathway, essential for development and tissue homeostasis, was found to suppress ccndx expression, with its inhibition leading to increased progenitor proliferation only in ccndx-intact fish, thereby confirming a tight regulatory loop between Notch activity, cyclin D expression, and regeneration capacity. This study represents a significant advance in our understanding of regenerative biology, demonstrating for the first time that, contrary to prior assumptions, all proliferating cells in regenerative tissues are not regulated similarly. It highlights the future importance of tailored cell cycle regulation, leveraging both ccndx and ccnd2a for optimal sensory regeneration outcomes. These findings could accelerate the development of therapies in regenerative medicine. However, it is important to note that ccndx is absent in mammals, so these findings are directly applicable only to non-mammalian species. As with all basic science studies in animal models, findings should be considered in the context of zebrafish biology, and their applicability to humans will require further research.
