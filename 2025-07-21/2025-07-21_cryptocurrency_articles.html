                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchains—digital ledgers or shared systems across a network—are most well-known for their use in cryptocurrency. However, the flexibility and speed offered by asset tokenization are moving to the housing market, attracting young investors who may want to quickly transfer shares. Not only are shares in housing digitized, but using them can also reduce costs and prevent fraud. If you own real estate and tokenize it, you're representing your property with digital tokens that can be bought, sold, or traded on real estate platforms. Select your blockchain platform and verify the assets before you begin trading. There's a lot to dislike about the traditional housing market, but investors will find a lot to like about tokenized real estate. Although tokenized real estate may not be for everyone, this way of investing in the real estate market is becoming increasingly popular. You can quickly purchase fractional tokens in a property and begin earning income, while automatic processes make it easy to manage your investments. “Real Estate Tokenization: A New Era for Property Investment and Luxembourg's Strategic Role.” “Digital Dividends: How Tokenized Real Estate Could Revolutionize Asset Management.” “Real Estate Tokenization: Recent Developments in New Jersey and Dubai.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins Unleashed: Ethereum, XRP and Dogecoin Ignite Rally as Crypto Tops $4 Trillion For crypto traders, it's been a good week to be in XRP, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. Or just about anything else for that matter, but these three coins in particular have really stood out, given Bitcoin's relatively modest performance over the last seven days. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing one of its most explosive rallies since 2021, with total market capitalization surging above $4 trillion once again for only the second time ever, after briefly touching this milestone last week. It comes as Bitcoin shattered its previous all-time high, reaching $122,838 on July 14, igniting heavy bullish sentiment among crypto permabulls. The broader macroeconomic picture is also looking optimistic for investors. The S&P 500 keeps flirting with 6,000 points while oil prices remain relatively stable around $76 per barrel despite ongoing Middle East tensions. This perfect storm of favorable conditions has ignited a new Alt Season, with its own Index surging to 59 points, just 2 points below the yearly high registered on January 30. Ethereum has emerged as the star performer among major cryptocurrencies, posting an impressive 25.7% gain over the past week to reach $3,843 before correcting to its current levels around $3769. This surge seems to be backed by serious institutional muscle, with spot ETH ETFs attracting $2.2 billion in weekly inflows. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, sits at a red-hot 70, indicating extreme bullish momentum. Think of RSI as a speedometer for price momentum—when it's this high, it means buyers are stepping on the gas pedal hard. While RSI readings above 70 typically signal overbought conditions that might concern day traders, in the context of a major breakout, this actually confirms genuine buying pressure rather than mere speculation. An ADX below 20 indicates no clear trend while readings above 25 confirm a strong directional move is underway. This may happen without affecting the overall bullish movement. Most importantly, Ethereum's price action relative to its Exponential Moving Averages tells a bullish story. The expanding gap between these averages—known as moving average divergence—typically precedes multi-month trending moves. When short-term averages pull away from long-term ones like this, it's like a rubber band stretching before a powerful snap higher. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator—which measures whether markets are in periods of contraction before massive movements—has also fired bullish, suggesting that after a period of consolidation, volatility is expanding in the bulls' favor. The token finally broke above its previous all-time high of $3.40, entering true price discovery mode for the first time in seven years. The weekly charts look like something unnatural for a serious investment: flat for years, then a parabolic explosion out of nowhere. The ADX reading of 20 might seem weak compared to other indicators, but for XRP, this actually makes sense. After trading sideways for so long, trend strength indicators naturally reset to low levels, making it hard to overcome in months what has been the standard for more than half a decade. The fact that it's climbing toward 25 suggests a new trend is just beginning to establish itself. XRP's moving average configuration provides the most bullish signal. On weekly timeframes, this widening differential typically precedes multi-month trending moves, as it reflects sustained accumulation by long-term holders rather than short-term speculation. The meme coin is undergoing a fundamental transformation, highlighted by Nasdaq-listed Bit Origin's announcement of a $500 million DOGE treasury strategy, with an initial $40.5 million purchase already completed. The technical indicators for DOGE are also showing bullish momentum. The RSI at 61 shows strong buying pressure without being overextended—it's in what traders call the "sweet spot" where trends can run for extended periods. The ADX at 16 means the bullish spike is actually a weak movement, but remember that DOGE was stuck in a prolonged downtrend. Low ADX readings after a strong move often indicate consolidation before the next leg higher. If you're a DOGE trader, it might be a good idea to monitor this indicator in the upcoming days for more accurate readings. This may point to bulls failing to keep up after reaching a price resistance, but with DOGE successfully breaking past a double bottom (an usually bullish pattern in which prices bounce twice in a resistance, and the 200-period EMA forming a “W” shape), conventional wisdom here suggests it should struggle but maintain its course for a few more weeks at least.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media and Technology Group said Monday it has accumulated roughly $2 billion in bitcoin and related assets, as President Donald Trump's highly lucrative pivot to crypto continues to grow his net worth while in office. The announcement offered the latest marker of how Trump and his family have embraced digital currency to such a degree that crypto now accounts for most of the president's wealth on paper, according to a Forbes analysis from June. He has already taken multiple steps in that direction by signing an executive order to establish a "strategic bitcoin reserve," appointing a "crypto czar" and urging Congress to pass multiple crypto-related bills. Trump on Friday signed one of those bills, the GENIUS Act, into law after it passed with bipartisan support in the House. Trump has made millions more off of other crypto ventures, including the decentralized finance entity World Liberty Financial and the meme coin $TRUMP, whose initial coin release came just days before his inauguration. The Trump family, which owns much of World Liberty through a business entity, has made about $500 million since the venture's launch in September, according to a Reuters analysis. Trump's spokespeople have said that the president's connection to World Liberty does not create a conflict of interest because his assets are in a trust that is currently managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr. But assets in that revocable trust still belong "indirectly" to the president, who is the trust's grantor and its sole beneficiary. And the funds would be available to him after he leaves office in 2029. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts, warn that Trump's crypto interests and his political power create an environment ripe for corruption. Before taking office in January, Trump transferred all of DJT shares to a revocable trust managed by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Some experts were unconvinced Trump was eliminating conflict-of-interest concerns by removing himself from direct control of the shares. Since then, Trump Media has effectively redefined itself as a crypto and financial services company. The company's first product was the Twitter-like social media platform Truth Social, which is used by Trump but has failed to generate much revenue. The company, which went public last year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, nevertheless attracted thousands of retail investors In late January, the company announced a FinTech brand called Truth.Fi, boosted by a $250 million allocation in investments including bitcoin and exchange-traded funds. In late May, the company said it raised over $2.3 billion in net proceeds from selling stock and convertible notes to about 50 institutional investors, and that it would those funds to build a bitcoin treasury. Trump Media's announcement Monday morning came less than a week after bitcoin hit an all-time high, making it by far the world's most valuable and popular cryptocurrency. The asset jumped past $120,000 as investors anticipated Congress would pass new U.S. crypto legislation to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the nascent industry. "We're rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan," Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in Monday's release. "These assets help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere," Nunes said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not just bitcoin (BTC-USD) that corporate treasuries are buying. A handful of firms are scooping up ethereum — or its native token, ether (ETH-USD) — as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets. So far, the companies taking this approach are mainly smaller names in the crypto world, such as BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee. One larger player — Coinbase Global (COIN), the parent company of trading network Coinbase — has more than $440 million in holdings, according to crypto and investment tracker CoinGecko. When Coinbase announced in a 2021 blog post that it would become the first publicly traded company to hold ethereum and other assets, in addition to bitcoin, it stated, "We believe that in the future, more and more companies will hold crypto assets on their balance sheet." Ethereum has surged 60% over the past month to hover near $3,800, its highest level since January. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has yet to reclaim its 2021 high north of $4,600. It currently leads as the dominant infrastructure that allows businesses and consumers to transact with each other directly without banks, with a market share of more than 51%. "Ethereum lets anyone — whether it's a crypto project, a factory, an artist, an influencer — create their own token and thus their own community and incentivize communities with an economy basically," Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto marketplace NoOnes, told Yahoo Finance. "You could argue it has more utility than bitcoin," he said. That utility is why firms like BitMine and SharpLink Gaming have increasingly been raising capital to buy ETH, similar to how Strategy (MSTR) and a slew of other companies have added bitcoin to their balance sheets in recent months. Read more: Can you buy crypto with a credit card? As with bitcoin, the approach can be risky due to volatile prices. Ethereum prices tumbled in April when President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement roiled markets. The rewards have not been as high as those that bitcoin has offered either: The return on ethereum year to date is 14%, versus bitcoin's 26%. Crypto miner BitMine Immersion Technologies recently announced it holds more than $1 billion in ethereum, or roughly 300,000 tokens. He noted that the company was "committed to Ethereum's continued growth." BitMine shares surged 25% in one session last week after an SEC filing revealed that billionaire Peter Thiel purchased 9.1% of the firm's common stock through his investment funds. Shares of each are up nearly 200% over the past month. Earlier this month, computing firm Bit Digital (BTBT) announced that it had shifted its entire treasury from bitcoin to ethereum. "We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system," Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital, said in a press release. Ethereum's surge coincides with the GENIUS Act, landmark legislation signed by President Trump last Friday, moving through Congress. Optimism over stablecoin's adoption has sent shares of issuer Circle (CRCL) up more than 600% since its IPO on June 5. "Any company that uses stablecoin tech pays transaction fees to the Ethereum network." When asked directly whether Strategy would add ETH to its holdings, executive chairman Michael Saylor said in an interview with The Street, "MicroStrategy wouldn't because MicroStrategy is 150% Bitcoin. Indeed, ethereum is by no means replacing bitcoin as the investment of choice for companies, Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance. "These companies are just capitalizing on the real world asset [tokenization] trends." Ines Ferre is a Senior Business Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media and Technology Group, the social media company owned by President Trump, said it has bought about $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities as it remodels itself as an investment firm. The $2 billion bitcoin purchase is part of the company's "bitcoin treasury plan," Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a news release on Monday. Mr. Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies both through his private businesses and his administration. The company's $2 billion bitcoin purchase comes as Trump Media looks to roll out a range investment products, including a plan to sell exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. The bitcoin purchase will "help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere," Nunes said in a statement. Trump Media said it plans to continue acquiring bitcoin. Shares of Trump Media rose $1.04, or 5.6%, to $19.71 in Monday morning trading. A crypto treasury strategy involves buying and holding cryptocurrencies, similar to how companies may invest in more traditional assets like bonds to provide them with financial flexibility. The best-known advocate of this approach is billionaire Michael Saylor, who runs a software company called Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy). It owns 607,000 bitcoins – worth more than $72 billion at today's bitcoin price — making it the largest public bitcoin treasury company, according to Bitcointreasuries.net. Saylor's company uses a variety of strategies, such as selling shares or issuing debt, to keep expanding its bitcoin holdings. As the digital currency's price has soared to more than $118,000, shooting up 74% over the last year alone, Strategy's stock price has followed, surging more than 3,500% since 2020. That success has also spawned many imitators, while the White House invited him to its Digital Assets Summit earlier this year. The Trump administration is planning a new U.S. "strategic reserve" of crypto assets. "For the past five years, the only thing better than Bitcoin is More Bitcoin," Saylor wrote in a July 17 social media post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Morocco's central bank is advancing its work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), having recently completed its first test involving peer-to-peer (P2P) retail payments, Bank Al-Maghrib Governor Abdellatif Jouahri announced Monday in Rabat. Speaking at the opening of the 2025 Continental Conference of the Association of African Central Banks, Jouahri revealed that a second test is underway. This new trial focuses on cross-border transfers, in partnership with the Central Bank of Egypt and with support from the World Bank. He explained that the CBDC, as a sovereign currency, could serve as a digital payment option for both wholesale and retail use. The broader project is being supported by ongoing studies and analyses covering legal and regulatory frameworks. «Like other countries on the continent, we at Bank Al-Maghrib have conducted studies, supported by the World Bank and IMF, on issuing a CBDC. These studies focused on defining the strategic objectives of the currency, its potential macroeconomic impacts, and its implications for the payment system», Jouahri said. Regarding cryptocurrencies, Jouahri confirmed that a draft law has been finalized to establish a legal framework for their use. He stressed the need for regulators, including central banks, to define a legal framework for digital assets and stablecoins, which, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), do not meet the characteristics of legal tender. «These instruments carry particular risks, notably in relation to money laundering and the erosion of financial intermediation, which could harm the integrity and resilience of the financial system», he warned.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meme coins are dominating the market, with Dogecoin's value increasing by 19% over the past seven days, while Bonk's value has rallied by 43%. While these meme coins surge, TOKEN6900 (T6900) is gaining attention among emerging altcoins. This new crypto coin's ICO surpassed the $680K mark. Here is an overview of this altcoin gaining community interest. Investors are used to seeing serious roadmaps and token utility, but TOKEN6900 (T6900) flips that on its head. The hard cap is set at $5 million USD, and TOKEN6900 ICO 2025 has raised over $680K, indicating investor interest. With no utilities or fundamentals, TOKEN6900 gives investors a glimpse into the brain rot of finance and is gaining attention in the community. If you're wondering how a meme coin without utility can be one of the notable altcoins to buy now, stay tuned, as we'll explain its unique appeal here. Some investors highlight TOKEN6900's retro-futuristic design and potential, drawing inspiration from 90s internet culture. This type of design makes the perfect throwback to internet nostalgia that many are thinking about now, as digitalization is in full swing. It is a unique rebellion against the system. There is no clear recipe for the success of a meme coin. However, some factors can indicate its future performance. The ultra-low market cap of T6900 is perfectly positioned for massive growth. Investors can purchase their tokens using cryptocurrency or a credit card, making the entire investment process smoother. The new crypto coin is poised to go viral as it points out the delusions that every crypto investor will face sooner or later. With over $680,000 raised in its presale, T6900 is gaining interest among investors. T6900 is an emerging crypto project in the meme coin space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens. The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time. The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast. Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030. The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that's seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance. The world's most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs — more than $123,000 on Monday — while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what's been called the “golden age” for digital assets. Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike. Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday. “Tokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,” said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins. Securities law can be complex and even defining what is a security can be a hotly debated question, particularly in crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country's securities law. Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump's victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer. “The most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,” she said. However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood's announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider “their disclosure obligations” under federal law. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said. One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren't subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones. That's unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization. “These are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,” said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. But Robinhood's giveaway of tokens meant to represent an investment in OpenAI immediately drew pushback from the company itself, which said it was not involved in Robinhood's plan and did not endorse it. “Door-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn't understand.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Bitcoin giving everyone a reason to celebrate, it was about time Ethereum, often dubbed the digital silver, had its moment. As per data from Coinglass, more than $76.54M worth of Ethereum short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours. Read on as we dive into the reason behind Ethereum's explosive move and what could be next for the token. This Sunday, a whale wallet bought 13,500 $ETH with $50M worth of $USDT. In another notable move, SharpLink, a publicly traded sportsbook marketing company, recently became the largest corporate holder of $ETH, acquiring 280,706 tokens valued at $1.06B. Clearly, Bitcoin isn't the only reserve-worthy asset anymore, with Ethereum quickly catching up. While Bitcoin has already reached a new all-time high, $ETH is just 25% away from breaching its previous peak of $4,800. As Ethereum continues to attract whales and institutional investors, setting the stage for its next major move, several other crypto tokens stand to benefit from this bullish momentum. The bot allows retail users to place buy/sell limit and stop orders (which Snorter then automatically executes) directly from the Telegram chat, creating a more level playing field. In addition to its ease of use, the bot is mighty secure too. It not only independently verifies every token before enabling trading, but also comes with protection against honeypots, rug pulls, and even sophisticated sandwich attacks. Currently in presale, $SNORT has raised over $2.18M, with each token priced at just $0.0989. Moreover, according to our Snorter Token price prediction, the token could surge by 1,900% in 2026, potentially hitting $1.96 and offering life-changing returns. Finally, it's worth noting that holding $SNORT unlocks lower trading fees (0.85% vs. 1.5% for non-holders), advanced analytics, and increased daily sniping limits, giving early adopters a clear edge. Over time, the Bitcoin network has slowed due to rising transaction volume, and it still lacks native compatibility with DeFi and Web3 applications. $HYPER aims to change that, powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Once converted into wrapped Bitcoin, your $BTC can be used across DeFi, NFTs, blockchain gaming, and other Web3 ecosystems. The $HYPER presale is gaining strong traction, having already raised $3.9M. And according to our $HYPER price prediction, it could reach $0.08625 by 2026 – a potential 7x return. FLOKI ($FLOKI) boasts a market cap of around $1.3 billion, making it one of the top 10 meme coins by market capitalization. Named after Elon Musk's Shiba Inu, FLOKI has grown into a multi‑utility meme token since its launch in June 2021. Players can use it for in‑game purchases, trade NFTs, and win rewards. Since its July 1 launch, Valhalla has crossed the 1M transaction mark and seen approximately 125K NFT mints. Better still, $FLOKI has surged over 92% in the past four weeks, and it's currently trading around $0.0001402. With strong Valhalla adoption and bullish technical sentiment, as the token consolidates near recent highs, potentially setting up for a breakout, experts anticipate a 50%-80% upside from current levels. With Ethereum joining Bitcoin in a fresh rally, the broader crypto market, led by its two dominant players, looks overwhelmingly bullish. This renewed momentum sets the stage for promising altcoins like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) to ride the wave, offering early investors a chance to capitalize on what could be the next major breakout phase in crypto.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese blockchain Conflux launched Conflux 3.0 network and unveiled a new offshore yuan-backed stablecoin targeting “Belt and Road” cross-border payments. Chinese blockchain Conflux announced a third version of its public network and introduced a new stablecoin backed by offshore Chinese yuan. At the event, Conflux unveiled a partnership with fintech firm AnchorX and information technology security firm Eastcompeace to support the launch of an offshore yuan-backed stablecoin. The news follows AnchorX receiving in-principle approval for its yuan-pegged stablecoin AxCNH by Kazakhstan's regulator, the Astana Financial Services Authority, in late February. It is unclear whether Conflux's stablecoin is AxCNH or a separate project, and the involved companies had not responded to Cointelegraph's inquiries by publication. The project will also explore real-world asset applications, according to Conflux. The Belt and Road Initiative is a global infrastructure and economic strategy launched by China in 2013 as part of efforts to increase the country's international influence. The report follows Hong Kong's government introducing a crypto regulatory framework known as “LEAP.” The new framework includes a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers starting Aug. 1, which “will facilitate the development of real-world use cases.” The issuance of licenses will be overseen by Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission. Mainland China is known for having one of the most restrictive approaches to cryptocurrencies. However, recent reports indicate that the country is reconsidering its stance on stablecoins. Earlier this month, the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission held a meeting to discuss strategic responses to stablecoins. After the meeting, the regulator's director, He Qing, called for “greater sensitivity to emerging technologies and enhanced research into digital currencies.” Magazine: China threatened by US stablecoins, G7 urged to tackle Lazarus Group: Asia Express Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, fintech, and iGaming industries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Much like coiled springs, sideways channels are periods of energy accumulation. Thus, a breakout in the XRP/BTC ratio could mean significant gains for XRP relative to bitcoin. XRP looks set for a continued run higher, having defended the support of the January high of $3.39 over the weekend in a classic "breakout and re-test play." Markets tend to revisit resistance-turned-support to test dip demand and commitment of bulls before staging bigger rallies. Momentum looks stronger than ever with the bullish golden cross, marked by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) shifting above the 200-day SMA, while prices are already at record highs. Friday's high of $3.66 is the immediate resistance, followed by $4.00. Below $3.35, the risk of an extended pullback would increase. Ether's (ETH) rally continues, with the 50-day SMA rising to its highest level since March and the 100-day SMA poised to cross above the 200-day SMA in a bullish manner. There is little to no sign of bears looking to reassert themselves, as evident from the small upper wicks attached to most daily candles since July 13. Perhaps, it's only a matter of time before prices do the same, topping the December high of $4,109. On the way higher, prices may consolidate near $4,000, thanks to the significant positive dealer gamma at that level in the Deribit-listed options market. Dealers typically trade against the market direction in such situations to maintain a net neutral exposure, curbing volatility. AI's take: The Mayer Multiple suggests strong underlying momentum. This indicator's higher reading signals ETH is building bullish strength relative to its long-term average, hinting at potential for future price appreciation. Bitcoin's price continues to crisscross the 50-, 100- and 200-hour SMAs, with the three averages now flat-lined in a narrow range, signaling that the upside momentum has weakened. This makes BTC vulnerable to potential risk-off in traditional markets and the ongoing recovery in the dollar index. Conversely, a move above $120,000 could bring fresh highs, although prices have consistently failed to establish a foothold above that level since July 14. Solana's SOL token has topped resistance at around $185 as expected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the excitement surrounding what President Donald Trump has dubbed “Crypto Week,” experts caution against premature celebrations in the cryptocurrency space. The House of Representatives recently passed three significant bills aimed at regulating digital assets, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. However, these legislative changes are not expected to take effect for quite some time. This development has been fueled by intense lobbying efforts from industry players like Coinbase Global, which have successfully influenced politicians, including Trump. In anticipation of this legislative week, Bitcoin prices soared to record highs beyond the $123,000 mark for the first time, alongside significant gains for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP. However, TD Securities analyst Jaret Seiberg notes that it could take over a year for the new legislation to come into effect. This act establishes a framework for regulating payment stablecoins requiring issuers to maintain one-to-one reserves in US dollars or Treasury securities. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has argued that this law could generate an additional $3.7 trillion demand for T-bills, although some analysts, like Raymond James' Ed Mills, express skepticism about such projections. Despite the signing of the Genius Act, there will be no immediate impacts on stablecoin issuers such as Circle Internet Group or Tether. This process will involve public commentary and could lead to litigation, suggesting a lengthy timeline before any real changes are felt in the industry. This bill, which passed with narrower margins, was attached to a national defense bill, and its future in the Senate will likely involve protracted negotiations, possibly extending until December.
