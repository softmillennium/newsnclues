Masterson describes himself as "a results-oriented conservative laborer and businessman." While Kansas has gone red in every presidential election for more than 50 years, the state currently has a Democratic governor. Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, testifies during a committee hearing, Feb. 25, 2025, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kans. Laura Kelly has held the post since early 2019, but is not eligible to run again in 2026 because she's currently serving her second consecutive term. "No person may be elected to more than two successive terms as governor …" the state constitution stipulates. Masterson's move to jump into the running adds another candidate to the Kansas GOP gubernatorial field that also includes former Kansas Gov. (Emily Curiel/The Kansas City Star/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Colyer, a former Kansas lieutenant governor, ascended to the governorship in 2018 because then-Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, departed the role to serve as U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom. While serving in the governorship in 2018, Colyer ran for governor, but was just barely edged out in the GOP primary by then-Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who went on to lose the general election later that year to Kelly.

Fox News national correspondent Fox News national correspondent reports on the latest update in the fundraising efforts of Zohran Mamdani and Eric Adams and more on 'America Reports.' That's because Democrats outnumber Republicans roughly six-to-one in the nation's most populous city. Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates in a come-from-behind primary victory to capture the nomination. President Donald Trump believes that Cuomo, who last week officially announced he would continue his mayoral bid as an independent candidate, has a solid chance of defeating Mamdani, whom the president has repeatedly claimed is a "communist." "I would think that he would have a good shot at winning," the president told reporters at the White House last week, a day after Cuomo's announcement. A handful of polls conducted this month in New York City suggest that Mamdani is the frontrunner, but that he is far from running away with the race. Trailing Mamdani and Cuomo in the surveys are Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled incumbent who announced earlier this year that he would seek re-election as an independent candidate, and Guardian Angels co-founder Curtis Sliwa, who for a second straight election is the Republican mayoral nominee. Also on the ballot in the general election is Jim Walden, a former federal prosecutor running as an independent. Walden has proposed that an independent survey be conducted in September to determine which candidate would have the best shot of defeating Mamdani, with the other candidates agreeing to drop out. Andrew Cuomo, in a speech to supporters, acknowledges that rival Zohran Mamdani "won" the New York City Democratic Party mayoral primary on June 24, 2025 in New York City. Cuomo has embraced the idea, with Adams and Sliwa not signing on board. Having the former governor, who resigned in 2021 amid multiple scandals, and Adams, who has faced a slew of controversies since winning election as mayor four years ago, both agreeing that such a scenario seems remote, both have urged the other to exit the race. "We have to put our political ambitions in the backseat to the interests of New Yorkers," Walden said this past weekend in an interview with Fox News' Bryan Llenas. He charged that the other candidates "right now, they're putting their own political ambitions above New Yorkers." Since his Democratic Party nomination victory, some of the unions and elected officials that supported Cuomo in the primary are now backing Mamdani. NYC Democratic Party mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani briefly speaks with reporters as he leaves the Dirksen Senate Office Building on July 16, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Mamdani, who was backed by progressive champions Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, surged to a primary victory thanks to an energetic campaign that put a major focus on affordability and New York City's high cost of living. Mamdani made smart use of social media platforms, including TikTok, as he engaged low-propensity voters. He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) "tuition-free," freezing rents on municipal housing, offering "free childcare" for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores. They aim to anchor him to vulnerable Democrats across the country running in elections this year and next year. They include a 2020 photo Mamdani posted online that shows him flipping off a statue of Christopher Columbus, stories about comments Mamdani made last December when he said as mayor he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his recent comments in a cable news interview that "I have many critiques of capitalism." "I don't think that race is over yet. We do have a couple of people running. There are things coming out about him," Trump said last week, as he referred to Mamdani.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FBI under former President Barack Obama failed to examine fully several thumb drives containing hacked State Department data, including messages linked to Obama, during its 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, according to a newly declassified watchdog report released Monday. “This document shows an extreme lack of effort and due diligence in the FBI's investigation of former Secretary Clinton's email usage and mishandling of highly classified information,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) told the Washington Examiner. The new details are in a declassified appendix to a 2018 report by former Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. Grassley, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, released the document on Monday after receiving it from Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel. The revelations have renewed scrutiny of former FBI Director James Comey, whose team limited the scope of the Clinton investigation while aggressively pursuing allegations of collusion by then-candidate Donald Trump and Russia. “The Comey FBI's negligent approach and perhaps intentional lack of effort in the Clinton investigation is a stark contrast to its full-throated investigation of the Trump-Russia collusion hoax,” Grassley said. Although the drives were queried at least three times, including once by then-special counsel Robert Mueller's office, there was no comprehensive review of their contents. The documents, which included claims about Debbie Wasserman Schultz and George Soros-linked operatives, were reviewed and dismissed as unreliable, according to FBI agents cited in the watchdog report. Comey defended his July 5, 2016, decision to exonerate Clinton publicly before interviewing several key witnesses, citing concerns about internal leaks. His decision, made without notifying Lynch, has remained a point of controversy — particularly because the FBI soon launched its Crossfire Hurricane investigation targeting Trump's 2016 campaign.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — New York City's former interim police commissioner has filed a $10 million defamation claim against Mayor Eric Adams for reportedly suggesting he was mentally unfit for the job of top cop. Donlon said he was sidelined for trying to clean up the corruption. After that lawsuit was filed, Adams privately told members of a nonprofit business advocacy group at a meeting that he'd fired Donlon, 71, from his brief stint as commissioner last fall because he was “rapidly deteriorating mentally,” according to attendees. Donlon cited news reports about those comments in his legal claim. Donlon, a former FBI official, was appointed by Adams in September to lead a department reeling from overlapping federal investigations and high-level resignations. He was replaced by the current commissioner, Jessica Tisch, in November. During his short tenure, federal authorities searched Donlon's home for decades-old documents that he said were unrelated to his work at the department. He has not been publicly accused of wrongdoing in connection with that search. In his short time as commissioner, Donlon said he uncovered “systemic corruption” by members of the mayor's inner circle, including a scheme to reward unqualified loyalists with lucrative promotions in exchange for political favors. In his lawsuit, Donlon accused Sheppard of misappropriating the commissioner's rubber stamp signature to give himself a raise, then threatening to kill Donlon when confronted about it. Sheppard, who left the department in May, has denied that allegation. Inquiries to City Hall about the defamation claim were not immediately returned. The defamation claim adds to a recent spate of litigation brought by police officals against Adams, focusing scrutiny on his leadership as he seeks re-election on a platform emphasizing managerial competence and public safety. Earlier this month, four high-ranking former NYPD officials brought separate lawsuits accusing Adams and his deputies of allowing rampant corruption and cronyism within the police department.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Workers finish installing the Cleveland Guardians sign above the scoreboard at Progressive Field, March 17, 2022, in Cleveland. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration CLEVELAND (AP) — President Donald Trump is threatening to hold up a new stadium deal for Washington's NFL team if it does not restore its old name of the Redskins, which was considered offensive to Native Americans. Trump also said Sunday that he wants Cleveland's baseball team to revert to its former name, the Indians, saying there was a “big clamoring for this” as well. The Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians have had their current names since the 2022 seasons and both have said they have no plans to change them back. Trump said the Washington football team would be “much more valuable” if it restored its old name. “I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original ‘Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, ‘Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,” Trump said on his social media site. His latest interest in changing the name reflects his broader effort to roll back changes that followed a national debate on cultural sensitivity and racial justice. The team announced it would drop the Redskins name and the Indian head logo in 2020 during a broader reckoning with systemic racism and police brutality. Washington Commanders jerseys are displayed at an event to unveil the NFL football team's new identity, Feb. 2, 2022, in Landover, Md. The provision was part of a short-term spending bill passed by Congress in December. While D.C. residents elect a mayor, a city council and commissioners to run day-to-day operations, Congress maintains control of the city's budget. Josh Harris, whose group bought the Commanders from former owner Dan Snyder in 2023, said earlier this year the name was here to stay. Not long after taking over, Harris quieted speculation about going back to Redskins, saying that would not happen. The team did not immediately respond to a request for comment following Trump's statement. The Cleveland Guardians' president of baseball operations, Chris Antonetti, indicated before Sunday's game against the Athletics that there weren't any plans to revisit the name change. Cleveland announced in December 2020 it would drop Indians. It announced the switch to Guardians in July 2021. In 2018, the team phased out “Chief Wahoo” as its primary logo. The name changes had their share of supporters and critics as part of the national discussions about logos and names considered racist. Trump posted Sunday afternoon that “The Owner of the Cleveland Baseball Team, Matt Dolan, who is very political, has lost three Elections in a row because of that ridiculous name change. He ran the team's charity endeavors until 2016. Washington and Cleveland share another thing in common. David Blitzer is a member of Harris' ownership group with the Commanders and holds a minority stake in the Guardians. Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>

Fox News correspondent CB Cotton reports on the latest shark sightings in Rockaway Beach, N.Y., on ‘Fox Report.' The New Jersey lifeguard impaled by a beach umbrella while working a summer job on the sand is speaking out about the ordeal that almost ended her life. Alex Kaus, 18, was working as a lifeguard on Asbury Park's 3rd Avenue Beach last month when the incident occurred. Alex Kaus was working as a lifeguard when she was impaled by a beach umbrella in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Kaus was setting up the umbrella when a gust of wind blew her off a lifeguard stand, dropping her on the point end of the 1-inch metal pole, NJ.com reported. Fellow lifeguards found Kaus lying on the ground with the stake through her left shoulder and sticking out the back of her arm, Asbury Park Fire Chief Kevin Keddy previously told Fox News Digital. First responders cut the umbrella stake off Kaus, making it easier to transport her to the hospital. Three weeks after the incident, Kaus is reportedly back at work, according to the local outlet. While she is not yet guarding beachgoers, the college student is reportedly checking for beach badges as she prepares to head back to school at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. People visit the beach during Memorial Day weekend on May 26, 2019 in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Kaus has no exact return date for when she will return to guarding, as she reportedly is waiting to be medically cleared before taking to the water. This summer marks the New Jersey native's second year on the Asbury Park beach, which she chose to apply to after spending time visiting as a child, according to NJ.com. With the news of her accident making national headlines, Kaus looked to downplay the attention as she focused on her recovery. "I'm definitely one of those people who's just like, ‘It's all good,'" she said. Kaus is especially thankful for her fellow lifeguards and those who rushed to her rescue. "I'm really grateful to the people that were there with me," Kaus told NJ.com. Kaus did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. While Kaus is still recovering from her accident, she hopes the level of attention her story created shines some light on the role of lifeguards protecting local beaches up and down the country's coasts. "Because we're out here every day, keeping everybody safe." Fox News Digital's Stepheny Price contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Microsoft company logo is displayed at their offices in Sydney, Australia, on Feb. 3, 2021. NEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft has issued an emergency fix to close off a vulnerability in Microsoft's widely-used SharePoint software that hackers have exploited to carry out widespread attacks on businesses and at least some U.S. government agencies. The company issued an alert to customers Saturday saying it was aware of the zero-day exploit being used to conduct attacks and that it was working to patch the issue. Microsoft updated its guidance Sunday with instructions to fix the problem for SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition. Engineers were still working on a fix for the older SharePoint Server 2016 software. Security researchers warn that the exploit, reportedly known as “ToolShell,” is a serious one and can allow actors to fully access SharePoint file systems, including services connected to SharePoint, such as Teams and OneDrive. Google's Threat Intelligence Group warned that the vulnerability may allow bad actors to “bypass future patching.” Eye Security said in its blog post that it scanned over 8,000 SharePoint servers worldwide and discovered that at least dozens of systems were compromised. Microsoft said the vulnerability affects only on-site SharePoint servers used within businesses or organizations, and does not affect Microsoft's cloud-based SharePoint Online service. But Michael Sikorski, CTO and Head of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, warns that the exploit still leaves many potentially exposed to bad actors. “While cloud environments remain unaffected, on-prem SharePoint deployments — particularly within government, schools, health care including hospitals, and large enterprise companies — are at immediate risk.” The vulnerability targets SharePoint server software so customers of that product will want to immediately follow Microsoft's guidance to patch their on-site systems. “We are urging organizations who are running on-prem SharePoint to take action immediately and apply all relevant patches now and as they become available, rotate all cryptographic material, and engage professional incident response. An immediate, band-aid fix would be to unplug your Microsoft SharePoint from the internet until a patch is available,” Sikorski advises.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The letter has 156 anonymous signatories and 131 public signatures — including at least 55 current employees. “Major programmatic shifts at NASA must be implemented strategically so that risks are managed carefully,” states the letter to Duffy, a former member of Congress, prosecutor and reality TV personality who also currently serves as Transportation secretary. “Instead, the last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA's workforce.” “If you have a significant disagreement with a technical decision that's being made, (the system) gives someone an alternate avenue that's not their project manager or program manager” to express that concern, a source at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, told CNN. Changes to that system “should be made only in the interests of improving safety, not in anticipation of future budget cuts,” the declaration reads. The source said that they considered looming changes “a really scary prospect, especially for my colleagues who work directly on the human spaceflight side of things.” In a statement, current NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens responded to the Voyager Declaration. “Despite the claims posted on a website that advances radical, discriminatory DEI principles, the reality is that President Trump has proposed billions of dollars for NASA science, demonstrating an ongoing commitment to communicating our scientific achievements,” Stevens added in the statement. “To ensure NASA delivers for the American people, we are continually evaluating mission lifecycles, not on sustaining outdated or lower-priority missions.” Another letter, signed by federal workers at the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month, resulted in about 140 people being placed on administrative leave. At least some of those workers will remain on leave until at least August 1, “pending the Agency's inquiry,” according to internal email correspondence obtained by CNN. One signatory of the NASA letter who spoke to CNN said they felt that expressing dissent against the Trump administration may pose a risk to their livelihoods, but they believed the stakes were too high to remain silent. Ella Kaplan, a contractor employed by Global Science and Technology Inc. and the website administrator for the NASA Scientific Visualization Studio, said she decided to publicly attach her name to the Voyager Declaration because “the overall culture at NASA has very much shifted — and it feels a lot less safe for me.” “That's been felt kind of universally by most minority employees at NASA,” Kaplan said. While Kaplan said her job has not yet been directly threatened, in her view, “I'm a member of the LGBT community … and I'm probably going to be fired for this at some point, so I might as well do as much community organizing as possible before that point.” The letter and its signatories implore Duffy to evaluate recent policies they say “have or threaten to waste public resources, compromise human safety, weaken national security, and undermine the core NASA mission.” The declaration's criticism of changes to NASA's Technical Authority stem from statements made at an agency town hall in June. Garrett Reisman — a former NASA astronaut and engineer who later served as a SpaceX advisor — told CNN that he believes implementing some changes to the Technical Authority may be welcome. “So far, this administration has used a very heavy hand with their attempts to remove bureaucracy — and what they've ended up doing is not making things more efficient, but just eliminating things.” At NASA, leadership complied with Trump's executive order by shuttering a DEIA-focused branch, scrubbing pronouns from email signatures, and removing references to a pledge made during the president's previous term to land a woman and person of color on the moon for the first time. The space agency also shuttered employee groups that lent support to minority workers. The source who spoke with CNN anonymously said that DEIA policies not only ensure a welcoming work environment — they're also essential to practicing sound science. “We've also been hearing repeatedly passed down from every level of management: No one is coming to save you; Congress is not coming to save you,” the source said. “But it seems like Congress is moving towards an appropriations that's going to continue to fund our projects at approximately the same level.” The source noted that they have first-hand knowledge of leadership beginning to decommission a clean room — a facility free of dust and debris where sensitive hardware and science instruments must be prepared for spaceflight — despite the fact that there are ongoing tests happening at the facility. The White House's proposal to slash NASA's science budget by as much as half has been met with widespread condemnation from stakeholders who say such cuts threaten to cripple US leadership in the field. Recent agency communication to staff has also noted that at least 3,000 staff members are taking deferred resignation offers, according to an internal memo, the authenticity of which was confirmed to CNN by two sources who had seen the communication. NASA leadership under Petro also worked on an agency restructuring plan, though the details of that initiative have not yet been made public. “American taxpayers have invested a lot of money in my education and training directly,” the Goddard source said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas., speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill, Feb. 6, 2025, in Washington. Greg Abbott speaks as President Donald Trump listens during a roundtable discussion with first responders and local officials at Hill Country Youth Event Center in Kerrville, Texas, during a tour to observe flood damage, Friday, July 11, 2025. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who represents a slice of the Rio Grande Valley along the border with Mexico, won his last congressional election by just over 5,000 votes. Adjusting the lines of Gonzalez's district to bring in a few thousand more Republican voters, while shifting some Democratic ones out, could flip his seat. Those Democratic voters will have to end up in one of the Republican districts that flank Gonzalez's current one, making those districts more competitive — possibly enough so it could flip the seats to Democrats. “Get ready for some pickup opportunities,” Gonzalez said, adding that his party is already recruiting challengers to Republicans whose districts they expect to be destabilized by the process. Republicans now hold 25 and Democrats 12, with one seat vacant after Democrat Sylvester Turner, a former Houston mayor, died in March. Gonzalez's district — and what happens to the neighboring GOP-held ones — is at the crux of President Donald Trump's high-risk, high-reward push to get Texas Republicans to redraw their political map. Trump's push comes as there are numerous political danger signs for his presidency, both in the recent turmoil over his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and in new polling. Surveys from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show most U.S. adults think his policies have not helped them and that his tax cut and spending bill will help the wealthy. The fear of accidentally creating unsafe seats is one reason Texas Republicans drew their lines cautiously in 2021, when the constitutionally mandated redistricting process kicked off in all 50 states. Mapmakers — in most states, it's the party that controls the legislature — must adjust congressional and state legislative lines after every 10-year census to ensure that districts have about the same number of residents. That is a golden opportunity for one party to rig the map against the other, a tactic known as gerrymandering. That lasted until 2018, when a backlash against Trump in his first term led Democrats to flip two seats in Texas that Republicans had thought safe. In 2021, with Republicans still comfortably in charge of the Texas Statehouse, the party was cautious, opting for a map that mainly shored up their incumbents rather than targeted Democrats. Still, plenty of Republicans believe their Texas counterparts can safely go on offense. “Smart map-drawing can yield pickup opportunities while not putting our incumbents in jeopardy,” said Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which helps coordinate mapmaking for the party nationally.. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature, which starts Monday, to comply with Trump's request to redraw the congressional maps and to address the flooding in Texas Hill Country that killed at least 135 people this month. “I don't think anybody should underestimate the will of Texas Democrats,” he said. Texas is not the only Republican state engaged in mid-decade redistricting. After staving off a ballot measure to expand the power of a mapmaking commission last election, Ohio Republicans hope to redraw their congressional map from a 10-5 one favoring the GOP to one as lopsided as 13-2, in a state Trump won last year with 55% of the vote. Some Democratic leaders have suggested that states where their party is in control should counter the expected redraw in Texas. “We have to be absolutely ruthless about getting back in power,” former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said Sunday on CNN. More of the states the party controls do not allow elected partisans to draw maps and entrust independent commissions to draw fair lines. The few Democratic-controlled states that do allow elected officials to draw the lines, such as Illinois, have already seen Democrats max out their advantages. Trump and his allies have been rallying Texas Republicans to ignore whatever fears they may have and to go big. On Tuesday, the president posted on his social media site a reminder of his record in the state last November: “Won by one and a half million Votes, and almost 14%. Also, won all of the Border Counties along Mexico, something which has never happened before. I keep hearing about Texas ‘going Blue,' but it is just another Democrat LIE.” Texas has long been eyed as a state trending Democratic because of its growing nonwhite population. But those communities swung right last year and helped Trump expand his margin to 14 percentage points, a significant improvement on his 6-point win in 2020. Michael Li, a Texas native and longtime watcher of the state at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, said there's no way to know whether that trend will continue in next year's elections or whether the state will return to its blue-trending ways. The heavily Hispanic region, where many Border Patrol officers live, has rallied around Trump's tough-on-immigration, populist message. As a result, Gonzalez and the area's other Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, have seen their reelection campaigns get steadily tighter. If mapmakers scatter Democratic voters from districts in the Houston, Dallas and Austin areas, they could get to five additional seats. But in doing so, Republicans face a legal risk on top of their electoral one: that they break up districts required by the Voting Rights Act to have a critical amount of certain minority groups. The Texas GOP already is facing a lawsuit from civil rights groups alleging its initial 2021 map did this. If this year's redistricting is too aggressive, it could trigger a second complaint. “It's politically and legally risky,” Li said of the redistricting strategy.</p>

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, accusing her of funding "genocide" in Gaza. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is getting broadsided from her left over her vote on an amendment aimed at blocking U.S. funding for Israel's Iron Dome. The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) are criticizing the progressive firebrand for voting against an amendment by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to block $500 million in Congress' annual defense spending bill that was aimed at helping fund Israeli missile defense systems. This is why we oppose Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez'[s] vote against an amendment that would have blocked $500 million in funding for the Israeli military's Iron Dome program," the DSA said over the weekend. The group added, however, "We were further deeply disappointed by her clarifying statement on her position on the Iron Dome." "Along with other US-funded interceptor systems, the Iron Dome has emboldened Israel to invade or bomb no less than five different countries in the past two years," the DSA said. "The fact that Representative Ocasio-Cortez acknowledges that Israel is carrying out this genocide makes her support for military aid all the more disappointing and incongruous. We urge the representative to continue voting against the Iron Dome, whether it is part of a larger defense spending bill or as a stand-alone bill." The DSA commended Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Summer Lee, D-Pa., and Al Green, D-Texas, for voting against the amendment. Fox News Digital reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's campaign and congressional office for comment. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene led the amendment, which failed overwhelmingly. She posted on X after the vote, "Marjorie Taylor Greene's amendment does nothing to cut off offensive aid to Israel nor end the flow of US munitions being used in Gaza. "What it does do is cut off defensive Iron Dome capacities while allowing the actual bombs killing Palestinians to continue. I have long stated that I do not believe that adding to the death count of innocent victims to this war is constructive to its end," she said. I remain focused on cutting the flow of US munitions that are being used to perpetuate the genocide in Gaza." It's not the first time Ocasio-Cortez caught heat from the progressive base for failing to take a critical enough stance on Israel. In 2021, the New York Democrat cried on the House floor after voting "present" on funding Israel's Iron Dome defense system. Rep. Rashida Tlaib voted in favor of the amendment. "Yes, I wept," she wrote in an open letter to constituents after the incident. "I wept at the complete lack of care for the human beings that are impacted by these decisions. I wept at an institution choosing a path of maximum volatility and minimum consideration for its own political convenience." That's separate from the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), another annual bill that sets defense and national security policy each fiscal year – essentially detailing how those funds will be spent. Greene's amendment to strip $500 million going toward Israeli missile defense programs lost in a lopsided 6-422 vote. Previous digital bylines seen at Daily Mail and CBS News.

Ambassador to Turkey and Special Envoy to Syria Tom Barrack speaks during a press conference at the government palace in Beirut, Lebanon, Monday, July 21, 2025. BEIRUT (AP) — A U.S. envoy doubled down on Washington's support for Syria's new government, saying Monday there is “no Plan B” to working with it to unite the country still reeling from years of civil war and wracked by new sectarian violence. In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Tom Barrack also criticized Israel's recent intervention in Syria, calling it poorly timed and saying it complicated efforts to stabilize the region. Syrian government forces intervened, ostensibly to restore order, but ended up siding with the Bedouins before withdrawing under a ceasefire agreement with Druze factions. Neighboring Israel intervened last week on behalf of the Druze, who are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military. Over the weekend, Barrack announced a ceasefire between Syria and Israel. Syrian government forces have redeployed in Sweida to halt renewed clashes between the Druze and Bedouins, and civilians from both sides were set to be evacuated Monday. At a press conference later, he said Syrian authorities “need to be held accountable” for violations. Regarding Israel's strikes on Syria, Barrack said: “The United States was not asked, nor did they participate in that decision, nor was it the United States' responsibility in matters that Israel feels is for its own self-defense.” Prior to the violence in Sweida, Israel and Syria had been in talks over security matters, while the Trump administration had been pushing them to move toward full normalization of diplomatic relations. When the latest fighting erupted, “Israel's view was that south of Damascus was this questionable zone, so that whatever happened militarily in that zone needed to be agreed upon and discussed with them,” Barrack said. The ceasefire announced Saturday between Syria and Israel is a limited agreement addressing only the conflict in Sweida, he said. It does not address broader issues including Israel's contention that the area south of Damascus should be a demilitarized zone. He suggested that Israel would prefer to see Syria fragmented and divided rather than a strong central state in control of the country. But in Syria, he said, “I think all of the the minority communities are smart enough to say, ‘We're better off together, centralized. Later Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz posted on X that Israel's strikes “were the only way to stop the massacre of the Druze in Syria, who are brothers of our Druze brothers in Israel.” Katz added: “Whoever criticizes the attacks are not familiar with the facts.” It was not clear if he was responding to Barrack's comments. While interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to protect minorities and punish those who target civilians, many feel his government has not done enough. Barrack, who spoke to SDF leader Mazloum Abdi over the weekend, said he does not believe the violence in Sweida will derail those talks and that there could be a breakthrough “in the coming weeks.” “It's not in the U.S.'s business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said. Barrack's visit to Lebanon came amid domestic and international pressure for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah to give up its remaining arsenal after a bruising war with Israel that ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement in November. Speaking at a press conference, Barrack said the ceasefire agreement “didn't work.” Israel has continued to launch near-daily airstrikes in Lebanon that it says are aimed at stopping Hezbollah from rebuilding its capabilities. Hezbollah has said it will not discuss disarming until Israel stops its strikes and withdraws its forces from all of southern Lebanon.</p>

The officer, who was not in uniform, was sitting with a woman in Riverside Park, beneath the George Washington Bridge, when two men approached on a moped just before midnight. The passenger got off and approached the officer, who realized he was being robbed and drew his service weapon, Tisch said. A person of interest, identified as Miguel Mora, a 21-year-old undocumented immigrant with an extensive criminal past, was taken into custody after arriving at a Bronx hospital with gunshot wounds to the groin and leg, Tisch said. After a search, Mora's alleged accomplice, who is also undocumented, was arrested Monday, Noem said. That person also has a history of criminal activity, Tisch announced Monday. Federal charges against both men are expected, officials said. He was wanted in New York to face accusations of robbery and felony assault, and in Massachusetts over a stolen weapons case, Tisch said. Mora's criminal history includes charges for assault on a pregnant woman and a stabbing charge in January, two senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told CNN. Noem blamed “sanctuary city policies” for the shooting, citing a list of previous arrests and warrants against Mora. “He was arrested four different times in New York City, and because of the mayor's policies and sanctuary city policies, was released back to do harm to people and to individuals living in this city,” she said. Noem called on leaders of sanctuary cities nationwide to change their policies. When asked what policies would have prevented the shooting, Noem did not provide specifics. President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, echoed Noem's statements. “Sanctuary cities are sanctuaries for criminals,” Homan said Monday. At a separate news conference Monday, New York Mayor Eric Adams said he is not responsible for the “revolving-door criminal justice system” that kept Mora on the streets. Adams said he would welcome more federal agents being deployed to his city, as long as they are focused on dangerous individuals and not “everyday individuals who are trying to complete the path to be a citizen.” The officer suffered a broken jaw and a bullet is lodged in his throat, but he is alert and has been communicating through hand gestures, senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told CNN. The officer is expected to make a speedy recovery, Customs and Border Protection Director of Field Operations Frank Russo said. He executed our mission, which is to protect the country, and he did it by stopping a threat,” Russo said Sunday. “If not for his efforts, this person of interest would have committed more armed robberies.” In a social media post Sunday afternoon, Trump seized on the shooting as evidence of Democrats' failures to secure the border. As enforcement efforts have ramped up in recent months, many officers have chosen to cover their faces with the goal of avoiding harassment in public and online. On Sunday, the acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, said he would allow agents to continue covering their faces as a safety measure.</p>

Carter added that she is making the decision to protect herself “in a bid to keep my focus on helping the team anyway I can.” “Hopefully speaking out will make the people writing this abuse think twice so others won't have to deal with it. We have made some historic changes with this Lionesses squad that I am so proud to be a part of and my hope is that by speaking out about this it will make another positive change for all.” CNN Sports has reached out to Meta and X for comment. Related article Real Madrid manager backs Antonio Rüdiger's claims of being racially abused during Club World Cup match “No one should have to endure such vile abuse, be that in football or any walk of life,” the team said on X. The statement added that England players will stand rather than kneel – an act of solidarity against racism and prejudice introduced to soccer following the global outrage over the 2020 murder of George Floyd – ahead of their semifinal clash on Tuesday. Mark Bullingham, CEO of the English Football Association (FA), said that the group is “working with police to ensure those responsible for this hate crime are brought to justice.” “We will continue to discuss with the relevant authorities and social media companies about what more can and should be done to prevent this abhorrent abuse.” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered his support for Carter, writing on social media: “There is no place for racism in football or anywhere in society. “I stand with Jess, the Lionesses, and any players who have suffered racism, on and off the pitch,” Starmer said. Online abuse directed at women's soccer players was a subject discussed ahead of the Women's Euros, with members of the England team saying they would avoid social media during major tournaments due to the abuse they are subjected to. Carter's England teammate Lotte Wubben-Moy announced on Sunday she would be coming off social media as a result of the persistent abuse. “Another tournament goes by where we see the same disgusting racist abuse. It is unacceptable for any person to be subject to this or any kind of abuse,” Wubben-Moy said in a post on her Instagram Stories. I will not continue to feed the very ­platform that enables abuse with no consequence.” Another of Carter's England teammates, defender Lucy Bronze, detailed the anger and sadness the whole squad felt upon hearing about the abuse targeted at Carter and that she hopes by standing before kick-off, rather than kneeling, will show that the players' voices “make a difference.” Bronze added that the increasing popularity of women's soccer has led to increased abuse.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's fascination with reopening Alcatraz, a dilapidated former state prison off the coast of San Francisco, seems motivated more by symbolism than necessity and could risk becoming the administration's biggest boondoggle. Trump has enthusiastically floated the idea of restoring Alcatraz to its former glory multiple times, each time met with intense pushback over its impracticality and astronomical cost, estimated at $2 billion. That makes it attractive to Trump, who sees himself as the “law and order” president. Indeed, for nearly three decades, the California prison housed some of the most notorious criminals in U.S. history, including gangster Al Capone, George “Machine Gun Kelly” Barnes, and Robert Stroud, better known as the “Birdman of Alcatraz.” The Bureau of Prisons, which would be tasked with running Alcatraz, has been struggling with short staffing, chronic violence, and crumbling infrastructure at its current facilities. Adding a rebooted Alcatraz into the mix would not only be costly but, some say, a waste of time, space, and effort. While the Bondi field trip was nothing short of an orchestrated redirect by the administration that had taken heat over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, it did open up new questions about Trump's fascination with Alcatraz, its brand recognition, history, myths, environmental effects, and costs to taxpayers should he sign off on it. Over the 29 years that Alcatraz operated as a prison, 36 men were involved in 14 escape attempts. The fate of five other men is still unknown. They are presumed to have drowned, though there is evidence that contradicts the claim. Former San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, who has been swimming in the bay several times a week since 1992 and has swam from Alcatraz seven times, told the San Francisco Chronicle that he has seen “quite a few sea lions, some harbor seals and no sharks — other than some land sharks named Pam Bondi and her entourage” on his outings. Sharks aside, Alcatraz has many other problems that need fixing before it can become a functional maximum-security prison. A pricetag of more than $2 billion to fix the place up has been reported by Axios. Currently, Alcatraz is a tourist destination generating about $60 million in annual revenue and sees about 1.4 million visitors a year, according to the nonprofit organization Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, which works with the National Park Service. The conservancy said, “Reopening Alcatraz as a prison would erase decades of progress and miss the point of what this place has become. For Alcatraz to operate again as a prison, Congress would also have to pass legislation to remove National Environmental Policy Act and Historic Preservation Act requirements for the area, which could be a lot easier said than done. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) called plans to reopen Alcatraz “batsh*t crazy.” “As for the merits of this proposal, if you thought ‘Alligator Alcatraz' was dumb, cruel, and wasteful, you'll run out of adjectives for this idiotic political stunt,” he said. “I told Secretary Burgum last month that not a single serious person at the National Park Service, from superintendents to janitors, thinks this is a good idea. It would also be a financial boondoggle, not just the massive amount it would cost to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, but all the money and goodwill the Park Service would lose from closing one of America's most popular tourist destinations. “The bottom line: this is deeply idiotic, transparently political, and ultimately unlikely to happen. The only possible rational explanation for why Pam Bondi was touring Alcatraz is that she thinks it might be a good place to hide the Epstein files.” Unlike the original Alcatraz, the Trump administration had much better luck capitalizing on its name and lore when it built “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida at record speed. Workers transformed the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport from an 11,000-foot isolated airstrip in the Everglades into a temporary tent facility to house undocumented migrants.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Idaho's only maximum security prison could soon be home to Bryan Kohberger, the man who admitted to the 2022 gruesome killings of four University of Idaho students in a remarkable change-of-plea hearing earlier this month. The Idaho Maximum Security Institution, opened in 1989 to confine the state's “most disruptive male residents,” has garnered nationwide attention following an aborted execution due to a botched lethal injection and a prisoner-led hunger strike demanding better conditions. Kohberger, a 30-year-old former former PhD student of criminology, admitted guilt for the first time on July 2 to charges of burglary and first-degree murder in the fatal stabbings of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen in their off-campus Moscow, Idaho, home. The case reached a bitter resolution after two and a half years of desperately searching for answers when Kohberger, seated behind a table in an off-white button-up shirt and patterned tie, responded to questions from State District Judge Steven Hippler with a series of simple yeses and a neutral gaze, admitting in one-word answers that he planned and carried out the brutal stabbings. Those prisoners include Chad Daybell, who was convicted in the 2019 killings of his first wife and two of his second wife's children. Kohberger is expected to return to court in Boise later this week for his sentencing, and could be transferred just over 10 miles down the road to the state's maximum security prison right after. Here's a look at what life inside the Idaho Maximum Security Institution could like: The male-only facility, located just south of Boise, is surrounded by a double perimeter fence reinforced with razor wire and equipped with an electronic detection system, according to its website. It has the capacity to house 549 people, and has a unit for civilly committed psychiatric patients, which has faced backlash from the National Alliance on Mental Illness for using a prison to house people with mental illnesses in need of mental health treatment. The alliance faulted the facility for allegedly denying patients access to prison programs and services typically available to incarcerated individuals. The prison has also garnered criticism for its harsh treatment of inmates in solitary confinement and for its poor conditions, driving prisoners to organize a mass six-day hunger strike last year in protest of the facility, the Idaho Statesman reported. The “cages” were described as “large chain link-like metal boxes each man is placed into, littered with human urine and feces that have soaked into the concrete.” Men housed in a lower-security section within the maximum-security prison,﻿ who are allowed access to an open outdoor recreation area, told the Statesman the space is often littered with trash and bodily fluids, and others said the facility's HVAC system hasn't been cleaned in decades because the vents are clogged with garbage, urine and feces. The prison's strict solitary confinement policies have also sparked concern. Kevin Kempf, who served as director of the Idaho Department of Correction in 2016, told CNN affiliate KBOI at the time that inmates were confined alone for up to 23 hours a day with little human interaction, received meals in their cells, and were allowed showers only three times a week. The Idaho Department of Correction implemented a step-down program that gradually transitions inmates from solitary confinement to a more open environment, KBOI reported. This program includes stages such as placing prisoners in cells where they can talk and interact with others, helping them adjust slowly and safely. Creech, the longest-serving inmate on Idaho's death row, was sentenced to death after pleading guilty to the murder of another inmate, David Dale Jensen, in 1981, while Creech was serving four life sentences, according to the Ada County Prosecutor's Office. Brad Little signed into law a bill in March, making his state the only one in the country with the firing squad as its primary execution method beginning July 1, 2026. Unpacking Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea deal to avoid death penalty in Idaho student killings Idaho lawmakers first passed legislation in 2023 allowing for the firing squad as a means of execution if drugs are unavailable, or lethal injection is found to be unconstitutional. The renovations are expected to take about seven months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pakistani police have made multiple arrests after a couple were allegedly murdered in broad daylight on the orders of a tribal elder for having an “illicit” relationship, in the latest so-called “honor killing” in the country. The killings last month in the southwestern Balochistan province, underscores the shocking and persistent nature of such crimes across parts of Central and South Asia, where family and community members believe they can restore “honor” through bloodshed. At least 11 people have been arrested since video of the incident recently went viral on social media, Balochistan's chief minister Safraz Bugti said. A woman, her head wrapped in a shawl, can be seen slowly walking in front of one of the vehicles as a man follows her, watched by the group. “You are only allowed to fire at me, nothing else,” she can be heard saying in Brahvi, a local language, before the man raises a pistol and shoots her at close range. Related article Teenage TikTok star's murder leaves Pakistani women questioning whether any safe spaces exist – online or on the street The man and woman were killed because they were allegedly engaged in a relationship considered “illicit” by a local tribal leader, according to a police report seen by CNN. Honor killings remain disturbingly common in Pakistan, with hundreds of cases reported each year — though experts believe the real number is much higher due to underreporting. These murders are typically carried out by family members or village leaders who believe a relative, often a woman, has brought “shame” upon the family, sometimes for reasons as seemingly innocuous as marrying by choice, seeking a divorce, or defying traditional gender roles. Deeply-rooted patriarchal norms that equate family honor with women's behavior, cultural acceptance, and weak law enforcement, allow perpetrators to act with near impunity. In recent years, a string of high-profile so-called honor killings have made headlines in Pakistan, drawing national and international condemnation and underscoring the persistence of the practice. In 2016, social media star Qandeel Baloch was murdered by her brother in a so-called “honor killing.” Baloch gained both fame and notoriety in inherently conservative and patriarchal Pakistan for her bold, sassy and increasingly political social media posts. Her murder sparked a national outcry and promoted changes in the country's so-called “honor killing” laws. Honor killings now carry a life sentence but the change in legislation has not made the crimes go away. At least 335 women and 119 men were killed in so-called “honor killings” last year alone, according to data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP). Balochistan's chief minister Bugti called the most recent alleged murder “intolerable” and a “blatant violation of social values and human dignity.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Sunday night against one of his strongest critics, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), as Fannie Mae investigators look into allegations of mortgage fraud by the senator. In a post on Truth Social, Trump teased that Schiff is in “BIG TROUBLE” and accused him of falsifying loan documents, saying he should face prison time. “Adam ‘Shifty' Schiff is in BIG TROUBLE! He once said my son would go to prison on a SCAM that Schiff, along with other Crooked Dems, illegally ‘manufactured' in order to stage an actual coup. Trump's call for Schiff to see jail time follows the president's statement last week that the California senator faced an investigation from Fannie Mae that concluded Schiff “engaged in a sustained pattern of possible mortgage fraud” by listing a Maryland home as his primary residence for years instead of his California home. While a memorandum from Fannie Mae investigators found something similar to Trump's accusations, specifically that Schiff and his wife, Eve, “engaged in a sustained pattern of possible occupancy misrepresentation,” no determination on anything illegal has yet been made. Still, Trump has only escalated his rhetoric against Schiff over the past week, including earlier on Sunday, when he called for his prosecution. He should be prosecuted, just like they tried to prosecute me, and everyone else — The only difference is, WE WERE TOTALLY INNOCENT, IT WAS ALL A GIANT HOAX!” Trump posted. “Big surprise — members of Congress, almost all of them, own more than one home or rent more than one home because we're required to be on both coasts. So he is using my ownership of two homes to make a false claim of mortgage fraud,” the California senator said early last week.</p>
