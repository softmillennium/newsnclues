Disasters and tragedies have long been a source of conspiracy theories. But when devastating flash floods hit Texas over the Fourth of July weekend, far-right conspiracies over cloud seeding and weather manipulation spread within a matter of hours. The floods killed at least 135 people, including children who were staying at an all-girl summer camp along the Guadalupe River. Extremism reporter Ben Makuch explains more behind these conspiracy theories, while Guardian US environment reporter Oliver Milman tells us what really happened

Installation view, Mark Leckey: "As Above So Below," 2025. Images courtesy of the artist and Lafayette Anticipations, Paris. María Inés Plaza Lazo: The title “As Above, So Below” is ancient and esoteric, yet uncannily contemporary. Helena Blavatsky reintroduced this phrase to 19th-century mysticism; you refract it through club culture and Christian iconography. In your hands, it resonates less as metaphysical truth than as method: flattening hierarchies, collapsing the sacred and mundane, the visible and the invisible, pop music and highway lights. What's the cosmology at work here? Mark Leckey: What you're pointing to is how I'm trying to approach things from two directions: from being completely embedded in pop culture—that's my background—but also from a place of growing interest, maybe even awakening, to spiritualism and medieval metaphysics. That's really where this show comes from. Like you said, it's a line between stations of the visible and invisible, and that's exactly what I'm dwelling in right now. A kind of spiritual or metaphysical pull, grounded in a historical materialist base: where I come from, how I grew up, the conditions and influences that shaped me politically and otherwise. I'm trying to work through that contradiction. That phrase is everywhere now; it's basically a pop-cultural term. But my interest in it goes back further—to the alchemists, to Hermes Trismegistus. There's a whole cosmology there, a belief in the interconnectedness of everything in the universe. I suppose what I'm trying to do is to resolve spiritual and material concerns that exist simultaneously in me. ML: I think it really started to come together at Haus der Kunst, though I wasn't fully aware of it at the time. When you're using so much moving image and sound, you can't just drop it into a black box—it never felt alive in that context. I realized I had to transform the space itself, make it part of the work, so that what you're seeing and hearing could really land, really hold your attention. That's when I started thinking more environmentally—not to seduce the viewer exactly, but to pull them into something more like a dream. Affect, memory, magic—they're not content, they're modes of perception. In a successful psychedelic experience, you're lifted out of reason, out of rational circumstances, and placed into something more like a dream. And a dream carries the potential for magic. Whereas art often prescribes those things, or is suspicious of them. I came across something after making the show that really stuck with me. I can't remember where I read it, but it said, “all pop culture is paranormal.” That struck a chord. Installation view, Mark Leckey: "As Above So Below," 2025. Images courtesy of the artist and Lafayette Anticipations, Paris. MIPL: In your video work Carry Me into the Wilderness (2022), we hear your voice collapse under the weight of sensation—sunlight, sound, space. But you're not on a pilgrimage. Yet the experience was not only paranormal, it became sacramental. ML: I had a sublime experience—and in the moment of that experience, I tried to record it. Just responding in the way we all do now: transforming every experience into information. So yes, even in this very profound moment, I was still trying to extract value from it. There's a suspicion baked into that. Even suspicion about whether I actually had a spiritual experience.I come from a grounded, materialist background—and yet here I am, having these unexpected sacramental or sacred moments. I don't really know how to reconcile those two realities.So I tried to make the work feel both: exalted and skeptical. I had my phone in my pocket, thinking of it as an artistic tool—but really, it's an extraction device. The best example of this is how people behave at concerts. Holding up their phones constantly, recording. We're always translating or producing things for circulation and distribution. And artists aren't exempt from that. But ecstasy itself—well, a lot of these realizations come after the work is made. I read about the etymology of “ecstasy”: it means to be taken outside of the place where you stand. It's about being pulled out of what you know—your surroundings, even yourself. The world we live in now—yes, there's doomscrolling and all of that—but it's also a kind of ecstasy. Courtesy the artist and Cabinet, London. Courtesy the artist and Cabinet, London. MIPL: Doomscrolling can be both: Absolute saturation—your brain literally overwhelmed. People talk about brain rot as a side effect. You also seem to reach for a kind of temporal intensity—the moment where the world arrives all at once. Could we call this a politics of the moment? We literally can't work without the internet anymore. I probably would have kept making archival collage work, but that method was voided by the sheer availability of imagery and sound we have now. MIPL: Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore now feels like a secular icon—an object of reverence, even grief. Has nostalgia become one of your materials? ML: I mean, that's part of why I turned to medieval metaphysics—because it becomes so unknowable. I don't mean that in a spiritual sense necessarily, but in terms of trying to fathom the unfathomable. The tools I'd been given just didn't seem to work anymore. The conditions changed in a way that felt abrupt. To go from Fiorucci at the turn of the century to where we are now—it just feels completely disorienting. I became interested in the idea of negative theology—the notion that God is fundamentally unknowable, un-circumscribable. You can't picture him, can't really know him in any definitive way. He exists beyond all human knowledge and sense. So, the only way to approach God is obliquely, through a kind of negative path. Courtesy the artist and Cabinet, London. MIPL: You've said before how images now function less as documents, more as performances or hallucinations. Is video the ideal form because it embraces that instability? ML: Video is not a true medium in any traditional sense. It lends itself to circulation and transformation. But I do worry: is this still the right kind of medium? One of the most upsetting things I heard recently was an interview with a 16-year-old who said, “I don't listen to music anymore. I'm just bored of it.” I thought, “yeah, of course.” It's just there, all the time. But I don't think that means we should retreat to older forms like painting and sculpture—that feels reactionary. And that's the point where I sometimes think: maybe I shouldn't make art at all. But there's also instability, surrender, even genderlessness in these states of ecstasy. Is your work a way of making masculinity porous, mystical, overwhelmed? ML: I sometimes look at the work and think: there's a lot of masculine energy there. There's a kind of violence that creeps in. But also… it might entirely be the wrong thing to say, but I think that art is queer. It changes the way I approach things. The artists I admired were all gay. That's what I'd hope the work does. I think my work is about being a man. A lot of it is about trying to understand what it means to be a man now. But I hope that men are changing. MIPL: That is a wonderful, utopian thought. ML: I think it ties into what you said earlier about mysticism and transcendentalism. ML: I'm trying to glitch myself. So, if there are glitches, it's to get in the way of that.

MIPL: You seem to share this drive to glitch with other artists who metabolize the world in hybrid, polyphonic ways—such as, Christelle Oyiri or Arthur Jafa. ML: The main resonance is music. I want art to expand toward music, or the space of music, because that's where I feel more at home. That's what I grew up with. To come into the art world—if you're from a background like mine—is to find yourself in a completely different world. You have to acclimatize, adjust, change yourself. But now it feels like art is more porous. I want more people like her around. MIPL: Like in Nobodaddy (2018), where you literally give voice to absence through technology. A bronze figure with holes in the entire body is inhabited by sound; a speaker-body that speaks absence and dematerialization, transcending the physical. ML: Immanence, I think, is the word. I want to evoke and amplify being alive. Christelle makes me feel more alive. AJ makes me feel more alive. All these things—they amplify that feeling of presence.

Images courtesy of the artist and Lafayette Anticipations, Paris. MIPL: What does “authenticity” mean to you today—especially when your own biography becomes raw material? There's always a danger in trying to be “authentically working class,” and maybe even more so in trying to make “authentically working-class art.” I don't think either of those things necessarily serve the working class in any real or meaningful way. So, I'm very suspicious of authenticity when it comes to class. At the same time, someone's background does matter to me. I still feel a bit disappointed when I find out that someone I admired went to public school and had all the privileges that come with that. I suppose I do still have a nose for some kind of authenticity—or maybe for a kind of groundedness, or reality. But I also know it's a trap. I think authenticity is something of a dance. You have to move in and out of it. Mark Leckey's exhibition “Enter Thru Medieval Wounds" will be on view from 11 September 2025 to 03 May 2026 at the Julia Stoschek Foundation in Berlin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Each week, TruckNews.com lists notable events, promotions and awards in the trucking industry. This week, Simon Corriveau joined Turgeon – Solutions d'affichage as business development manager for its fleet division and UAP has announced that Francis Messier to take over the reins of regional vice-president of heavy vehicles parts division, as Gaétan Delisle is set to retire later this year. Meanwhile, BeyondTrucks hires AI specialist Mahriah Alf as head of products. Turgeon – Solutions d'affichage has appointed Simon Corriveau as business development manager for its fleet division, the company announced. Corriveau officially joined the team on July 1, as Turgeon expands its services to meet growing demand from the trucking and transportation industry, according to a news release. Corriveau has been involved in fleet operations since 2011 and brings extensive knowledge of the specific needs of fleet managers, the company says. His role will focus on strengthening Turgeon's position as a partner for fleet branding and vehicle graphics. UAP has announced that Gaétan Delisle, vice-president of the Eastern Canada heavy vehicles parts division, will retire on Oct. 1 after more than 48 years with the company. UAP says his extensive market knowledge and customer focus make him well-suited for this new role. The transportation management system (TMS) provider said in a news release that the move reflects its increased investment in artificial intelligence as fleets seek to modernize operations and improve efficiency. Alf joins BeyondTrucks with extensive experience in AI product development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discovery Global Consumer Products are teaming up for a Supernatural comic series, featuring new stories that are set between the first and second seasons of the long-running show. Writer Greg Pak and artist Eder Messias, who previously worked together on Sam Wilson: Captain America, will be the creative team for the new comics. In the first arc, the Winchester brothers, who hunt ghosts, demons, and other supernatural creatures, will search for the source of a series of mysterious fires in a decaying Rust Belt town. The series will launch in October and the first issue will have covers by Messias, Clayton Crain, and David Cousens, as well as photo covers from the show. Tongue-in-cheek, but deeply-felt emotional story of sibling rivalry and family tragedy? Hugely fun, anti-authoritarian heroes and vibes? Look, I was hooked with the ghosts, but I'm all in,” Pak said in a statement accompanying the announcement. “Here in Brazil, on Saturday nights, they would show four episodes in a row,” Messias said. “After that, we would spend the week talking to friends about the next episodes.” DC's WildStorm published several miniseries based on the show, and it was adapted into an RPG early in its run (see “‘Supernatural RPG'”); more recently, CMON added two Supernatural packs to its Zombicide 2E game (see “The Winchesters Hunt Undead in ‘Zombicide 2E'”).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shackleton talks about his fascination with the paranormal, balancing skepticism with belief, and gruelling all-night shoots. What inspired you to create The Supernatural UK, and how did the concept first come about? As a filmmaker, I'm naturally drawn to the unknown. I've always had a love for horror and the supernatural – but it wasn't until a few years ago, when I found out my accountants moonlighted as paranormal investigators, that I really dipped my toe in! The spark really happened when I was working on Château DIY for Channel 4. Some of the medieval château stories ignited my imagination. I made multiple trips to France across different series, but it was during one particular stay, alone in a gîte just after the pandemic, that things took a turn. One night something bit my finger – I jolted awake and saw my bedside table physically rocking. That eventually led to a 50-minute TV pilot, ‘Somerset Supernatural'. At the time, I was also shooting ‘Dorset: Country and Coast' for Channel 5, and I liked how the format wove real people and real places into the fabric of a region. So, I took that approach – blending fly-on-the-wall documentary with local character and applied it to the paranormal. We decided to make more episodes specifically for online. How do you define “supernatural” in the context of this series, and what makes the UK uniquely suited for these stories? For me, the supernatural starts where science and logic stop. The UK is especially rich ground for this kind of exploration. Its deep history, layered folklore, pagan traditions, religious shifts, give us an incredible scope. It covers the unexplained – spiritual, scientific, or otherwise. Ironically, I try not to research too much. These are observational documentaries, and I want to arrive as open and fresh as possible. Whether or not I've read the history doesn't determine if something decides to make itself known on the night. That said, we do have researchers on standby. Karin Beasant, one of our producers, is incredibly thorough and often suggests locations or connects us with investigators. I go with my gut – it's proven to be a pretty reliable barometer. Sometimes opportunities come out of other projects. While working on a show about Warwick Castle, I pitched access for The Supernatural UK' – remarkably they said yes, and that became episodes 9 and 10 of the series. What challenges did you face—especially with the documentary-style format? For starters, the shoots can be gruelling. We pulled a lot of all-nighters, especially when things started to heat up. In the opening episode, shot in Nottingham, I had to run everything solo – organisation, production, camera, sound, the lot. Luckily, my day job's prepared me for that, but it can create issues like dropped timecode, which then take longer to fix in post. I have to wear many caps, sometimes even the red hood, too! I don't usually edit my own work, but for this I had to learn how to sync multi-cam footage, manage audio files, and basically build the episodes from scratch. I'd often discover things I hadn't clocked on the night – like hidden story threads or electronic voice phenomena (EVPs) that only emerged during meticulous reviews. It's definitely sharpened my storytelling skills and revealed arcs that might've gone unnoticed otherwise. Are there recurring themes or messages you hope viewers take away from the series? Yes – mainly that science doesn't yet have all the answers. As Shakespeare put it: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. I think that quote sums it up perfectly. How do you balance scepticism and belief in the series? I'm not a fan of extremes—blind belief or staunch scepticism. I try to land somewhere in the middle. In fact, we set that tone right from the first episode, with some healthy banter between our sceptic and  spiritualist investigators. If something strange happens, I always try to debunk it first. That tension between belief and doubt is part of what makes the series so engaging and timeless, I think. Did you bring any cinematic techniques to enhance the series? I own pro filming equipment, and Andy does too. Between us, we can load up the van and go. We're both big fans of cinematic title sequences. Andy works in Unreal Engine and creates visuals that really punch up the intros. They've helped give the series a much more elevated feel. And often, that story only really reveals itself in the edit. Were there any moments during filming that genuinely surprised you or changed your perspective? One night I brought a trained security dog to what's considered the most haunted prison in the UK – just for insurance! Not only did the dog react to multiple unseen presences, but we started getting what felt like intelligent responses from assumed inmates. Suddenly, “coincidence” didn't seem the most logical explanation anymore. I keep the setup lean and spontaneous – often confirming investigators just days before, so I know nothing's being staged. That includes a poltergeist experience that even our biggest sceptic deemed 94% likely, and a museum investigation that escalated from the movement of a simple doll in a cabinet, to full-blown activity – footsteps, voices, EVP, and vibration sensor activation. There have just been too many “coincidences” to ignore. With everything going on in the world—the climate crisis, wars, political instability – it feels like we're collectively looking for meaning and reassurance. The doomsday clock is at 89 seconds to midnight. It's no wonder people are asking bigger questions about what happens when we die. No, they still don't make sense to me – and I felt that way before I started. But when I find EVP recordings of disembodied voices replying to questions… when radio signals give us information the team couldn't have known… when I hear footsteps in an empty building, or a voice that everyone on the team hears… it's hard to dismiss. So do I believe something is out there? THE SUPERNATURAL UK launches on YouTube, Monday July 21, 7pm.
