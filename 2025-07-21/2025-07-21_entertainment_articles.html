                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's meant to be a perfect replica of a shirt by (fictional) hot new designer Gordon Gartrell, which Warner's Theo Huxtable intends to wear on a date with his new girlfriend Michelle. When Theo's dad Cliff refuses to pay $95 for the genuine article, Theo's older sister Denise (Lisa Bonet) offers to make a knockoff for only $30, assuring her brother she can get it done. A horrified Theo, aware Michelle will be at the Huxtable brownstone any minute, declares it “the ugliest shirt I've ever seen!” He is arguably being too kind. Whenever we talk about the funniest sitcom scenes of all time, a few inevitably pop up. Theo's reaction to the fake Gordon Gartrell shirt should be on there, too — at least as much for Malcolm-Jamal Warner's performance as for how the show's costume designer got every single detail perfectly wrong. Warner was found dead on Sunday, victim of an accidental drowning in the ocean. He worked as an actor from age 12, when he appeared in an episode of detective drama Matt Houston, through the rest of his life; just this past spring, Fox aired his multi-episode stint on the drama Alert: Missing Persons Unit. He was a reassuring screen presence, someone who made viewers feel like a person who knew what they were doing had just showed up. But in life and in much-too-soon death, he will always be tied to The Cosby Show and its complicated legacy. Though episodes are still available for digital purchase, and rerun on a couple of cable channels, the series for the most part has been memory-holed — an understandable choice that has the unfortunate effect of also memory-holing the contributions to its success by everyone involved other than Bill Cosby. That hits Warner's own legacy especially hard, because Theo turned out to be the best comedic foil for Cliff. The Huxtables were loosely based on Cosby's own children, and Cosby's son Ennis (who also died much too young) was the family member mentioned by far the most often in Cosby's stand-up act. The most famous moment of The Cosby Show pilot has Theo telling Cliff that he doesn't intend to go to college, and instead just be like “regular people.” Cliff dismantles his son's argument piece by piece, to uproarious laughter and thunderous applause by the studio audience, and it was obvious from there on that pairing Cliff with his overconfident son would be an endlessly renewable humor resource. Theo has put so much faith into Denise, because he loves her, and also because he's young and naive enough to believe that if Denise states confidently that she can do something, she can. The mortification at seeing the mismatched fruits of her labor is even funnier because it all came from a sincere place. Belgium's Tomorrowland Saved by Metallica After Fire Destroys Main Stage Epstein Accuser Twice Told FBI About His Ties to Trump Right-Wing Leader Says Conservatives Need ‘Scalps' of Woke Wall Street CEOs Liam Gallagher Declares Oasis Concerts Safe for Cheaters: 'We Don't Have That Coldplay Camera' Mostly, though, it's Warner doing an epic meltdown over the thing. When Denise suggests the shirt might look better if Theo tucked it in more, he screams — through gritted teeth, no less — “It's tucked into my socks!” It's an incredible line delivery, and the kind of thing that should be beyond the gifts of a 14-year-old, even one being directed by a future Television Hall of Fame inductee like Jay Sandrich. The episode actually offers a happy ending for poor beleaguered Theo. Theo rushes to change into it, not realizing that Michelle and their friends are waiting in the living room. His response to being caught by the girl he wanted so badly to impress is another spectacular bit of physical comedy from Warner, but it turns out to be unnecessary: Michelle improbably thinks the knock-off is hot, and is excited to be seen out on the town with the handsome boy wearing it. It wasn't always easy to get through, because of everything that's now associated with Cosby. But Malcolm-Jamal Warner was still magic in it. I hate that this is the reason why.

In addition to Shukert, executive producers include Lopez, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina for Nuyorican Productions; Sophia Dilley, EVP of Concord Originals and co-president of RKO; former Concord CEO Scott Pascucci; and Bill Bost. Skydance Television has a pact with Concord to develop a slate of original projects mined from the latter's vast catalog of musicals that includes Cinderella and a modern-day adaptation of Oklahoma! from John Lee Hancock and Bekah Brunstetter. Cinderella is one of Rodgers & Hammerstein's most popular titles. More than 100 million viewers saw the broadcast. Cinderella was re-made for TV in 1965 starring Lesley Ann Warren in the title role with Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon as the King and Queen, and Celeste Holm as the Fairy Godmother.

Kevin Feige is looking to put the ex in “X-Men.” The Marvel Studios head said during a press conference, as reported by Variety, that he will be recasting iconic characters for the upcoming “X-Men” movie directed by “Thunderbolts*” helmer Jake Schreier. Feige stressed that Schreier's iteration will be a franchise “reset” and kill the multiverse moment once and for all. Reset, singular timeline — we're thinking along those lines.

How ‘I Know What You Did Last Summer' Reinvented the Original's Iconic Seaside Town The ensemble casts of previous “X-Men” movies are set to reprise their roles for “Avengers: Doomsday,” with Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, and Kelsey Grammer among those returning. However, that may be their final bow as those characters after  the events of 2027's “Avengers: Secret Wars.” “We're utilizing that [story] not just to round out the stories we've been telling post-‘Endgame,' just as importantly — and you can look at the at the ‘Secret Wars' comics for where that takes you — it very, very much sets us up for the future,” Feige said. The rumored cast for Schreier's “X-Men” movie includes Harris Dickinson as Cyclops, Sadie Sink as Jean Grey, Margaret Qualley as Rogue, Julia Butters as Kitty Pryde, and Jesse Plemons as Beast (Plemons will also be in the “Hunger Games” franchise now too, with “The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” writer Michael Lesslie behind the “X-Men” script.) “Amy Pascal and David Heyman are now searching for a new James Bond,” Feige said, referring to the producers of Amazon MGM's upcoming Bond film. “David [Corenswet], the new Superman — he was awesome.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rolling Stone has obtained exclusive audio and documents from the event. Nelson noted she had spoken about this at breakfast. “Whether it's Larry Fink or Brian Moynihan, we have got to take one of these guys out,” she said, presumably another metaphor. ALEC is a powerful “bill mill” that brings corporations, conservative advocates, and state legislators together to hash out right-wing, pro-business legislation that is then introduced nationwide, with a focus on red states. “Over the past three years, the assets BlackRock manages on behalf of our clients have grown by $4 trillion to $12.5 trillion,” says a BlackRock spokesperson. Bank of America declined to comment, though a person familiar with the matter says that the bank's representatives attended ALEC's annual meeting last week. The firm has trillions in assets under management, and manages billions of dollars for public pension funds. Because of its extensive holdings, BlackRock exerts enormous influence across the stock market through shareholder votes. Consumers' Research targeted Bank of America in 2023 for engaging in “anti-consumer” behaviors: namely, having internal DEI training and offering tips for how clients can calculate their greenhouse gas emissions. Amid Republican attacks on ESG and DEI, including from President Donald Trump, BlackRock and Bank of America both dropped out of Net Zero alliances, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Additionally, both companies have eliminated their DEI goals, while maintaining a general commitment to inclusion. Leo's network helps fund ALEC, which has pushed model legislation in the states to ban asset managers for state retirement funds from promoting ESG. The anti-ESG coalition has notched some wins in terms of BlackRock and Bank of America's public posturing, but these conservatives argue the fight is far from over. We're sharing them every day when they get out of something,” Nelson noted, but “it's words right now.” Trump's Wildly Fascistic Posting Spree Isn't Just a Distraction From Epstein Ellen DeGeneres Says She Moved to the U.K. Because of Trump: 'Everything Here Is Just Better' Epstein Accuser Twice Told FBI About His Ties to Trump Rep. Jasmine Crockett: 'Wannabe Hitler' Trump Is Demanding GOP 'Loyalty' Over Epstein Files “We were talking about it at lunch, or breakfast. A JPMorgan representative declined to comment but confirmed the firm is an ALEC member. The organization receives some corporate funding, including from Chevron, and donations from lobbying groups for Big Pharma, fossil fuel interests, the telecom industry, and electric utilities. ALEC's Private Enterprise Advisory Council includes Mike Thompson, a top lieutenant at Leo's consulting firm CRC Advisors, which helped manage the summit; as well as execs at Consumers' Research; the American Bankers Association (ABA); oil billionaire Charles Koch's business empire; and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington's top business lobby. Bank of America previously cut ties with ALEC in 2012. Nelson, who previously ran global government relations at credit card giant Visa, made her comments about the CEOs during a larger conversation about the necessity of political neutrality in public investments. Fiduciaries, like BlackRock, are legally bound to act in the best financial interests of their clients. Conservative politicians and groups, ALEC included, have demanded that companies eschew ESG and DEI as part of their investment criteria, arguing the only thing that should matter is maximizing shareholder profit. During Nelson's panel, an operative asked the panelists if they had any examples where Republican-led states had “in their efforts to kind of correct, [and] go from liberal ESG investing, instead of going back to neutral, they over-corrected,” to a place where they're putting public money into conservative investments. Debate ensued, with most participants concluding that long-suffering conservatives needed to beat back Big Banks, who are in cahoots with the Left — neutrality be damned. “That's a very good kind of point to bring up,” Nelson said. “We need to stop their momentum and then push back,” Thompson continued. It means get us back to where we can be neutral. Tom Jones — the right-wing opposition researcher notorious for publishing a DEI Watch List of mostly Black federal officials he decided should be fired by Trump — argued that conservatives should not “get wedded” to neutrality. “Publicly held funds should reflect the values of Americans, and if that means we're not going to invest in companies that support boycott, divestment, and sanctions, [against Israel] or we're not going to invest in companies that use slave labor in China, or we're not going to invest in companies that invest in Iran because it's a threat to American national security, we should 100 percent have those policies,” said Jones. “I don't know what neutral means — but legal and principled,” said perennial anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who seemed irritated with his compatriots' hypocrisy. I have no idea how you don't get laughed out of court with any argument…. This is a real slippery slope, and I don't know how you make that argument without laughing at yourself.” Described by NPR in 2001 as a “conservative revolutionary,” Norquist famously told the outlet: “I don't want to abolish government. A spokesperson for Consumers' Research tells Rolling Stone, ​“For years, megalomaniacs at the helm of powerful corporations like BlackRock and Bank of America exploited their positions to impose a political agenda and bully others into compliance. The American people have had enough and they are demanding a return to business, not activism. Neutrality means moving away from the far left and back to focusing on consumers. There is still a long way to go and damage to make amends for before these companies and others like them can earn the public's trust again.” GOP attorneys general — long financed by Leo through their Republican Attorneys General Association — are currently suing BlackRock on alleged antitrust violations regarding its coal investments. The effort is being led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose top deputy bragged during a different panel that he threatened another big bank, Wells Fargo, into leaving the Net Zero Banking Alliance. Dan Patrick detailed Fink's moves to get back into his good graces, by lining up investors for new natural gas plants in the state's power grid. That didn't dissuade Paxton from launching the antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock last November.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2 and Lenae's "Love Me Not" leaps to No. Alex Warren's “Ordinary” scores a seventh week atop the Billboard Hot 100. The song has spent all its weeks on top consecutively, having become his first No. Plus, two songs are new to the Hot 100's top 10, led by Justin Bieber's “Daisies,” which debuts at No. The track is from his new album, Swag, which likewise bounds onto the Billboard 200 at No. It also opens as the week's most-streamed song. Meanwhile, Ravyn Lenae lands her first Hot 100 top 10 as “Love Me Not” surges five spots to No. Additionally in the Hot 100's top 10, Teddy Swims' former leader “Lose Control,” at No. Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 19.6 million official streams (up 2% week-over-week),  73 million radio airplay audience impressions (essentially even week-over-week) and 6,000 sold (up 8%) in the United States July 11-17. 4 on the Streaming Songs chart, following four weeks at the summit; adds a fifth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs; and rebounds from No. 2 for a ninth week atop Digital Song Sales. 2 on the Hot 100 with 27.6 million streams, 4.3 million in airplay audience and 4,000 sold through July 17 following its July 11 release on his new album, Swag. Bieber ups his career total to 27 career Hot 100 top 10s — tying Janet Jackson for the 10th-most in the chart's nearly 67-year history. 1 on Streaming Songs, where it's Bieber's seventh leader. Bieber had last earned a new Hot 100 top 10 with “Ghost,” which rose to No. He first reached the region when “Baby” debuted at its No. Of his 27 top 10s, he boasts eight No. In April, it became her first Hot 100 hit. She began releasing music around a decade ago and signed to Atlantic in 2016. “I'm just happy for all artists who have been in this 10-plus years and are feeling the love and the benefits of so much time and effort and hard work,” Lenae told Billboard in April, a day before her Coachella debut. “This is something I feel like I haven't heard in such a long time,” Lenae added of “Love Me Not,” which she co-wrote, noting that it reminded her of OutKast's classic “Hey Ya!,” which ruled the Hot 100 for nine weeks in 2003-04. “That mix of soulfulness with pop sensibility that anybody could sing and dance to, and feels like it could have come out in any era — that's my favorite type of song.” Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. It also tallies a record-extending 70th week in the top 10. It broke the Hot 100's longevity mark in May when it surpassed the run of Glass Animals' “Heat Waves,” which ran up 91 weeks in 2021-22. Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, holds at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. It notches a ninth week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart. 2-peaking “Just in Case” dips 4-5 on the Hot 100. Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stumbles woozily 5-6 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. Drake's “What Did I Miss?” drops to No. 8 on the Hot 100, a week after it debuted at No. It posts a second week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, where it became his record-padding 31st leader on each list. Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” repeats at No. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

The film has reached $235 million domestically since its release; internationally, it's only at $171 million, but Gunn is glad it has had a strong multiple. “We're definitely performing better domestically than we are internationally, but internationally is also rising and having really good weekday numbers in the same way we are,” Gunn said. Related Stories How ‘I Know What You Did Last Summer' Reinvented the Original's Iconic Seaside Town Cinespia Closes Out the Summer with ‘Silence of the Lambs,' ‘Princess Bride,' and More He added, “Superman is not a known commodity in some places. And it also affects things that we have a certain amount of anti-American sentiment around the world right now. So I think it's just a matter of letting something grow. But again, for us, everything's been a total win. Gunn told Entertainment Weekly that “Superman” is really about humanity, which transcends politics. “I've heard people say it was woke, and then I've heard a lot of people say it's not. I am curious as to what in the movie is considered woke,” Gunn told EW. Originally, he said that [Superman comic creators] Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were the sons of immigrants, and they wrote Superman as an immigrant story. He continued, “That's the thing we can all act upon, is kindness. And so what does that lead to? Well, does that lead to the way you vote? Does it lead to how many people are dying from road rage? All those things are affected if people just start to value kindness. I mean, people did value kindness in the past. That was an American value, was kindness, and it doesn't necessarily seem to be that way to me anymore. So that was always the center of the movie for me, and it wasn't about anything other than that.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adria Arjona (Hit Man) has taken over the co-lead opposite Michael B. Jordan in Amazon MGM Studios‘ Jordan-directed reimagining of The Thomas Crown Affair, Deadline has confirmed. Arjona takes over the role from Taylor Russell, who we told you first on Friday exited the project due to creative differences, with production underway in London. The actress is set for the role of an insurance investigator who comes to suspect that an adventurous banking executive is pulling off ambitious heists, and develops a spark with him. It's a version of the role played by Faye Dunaway opposite Steve McQueen in the original 1968 film, and by Rene Russo opposite Pierce Brosnan in the 1999 version. Maia Reficco To Star In Amazon MGM Romance 'The Last Sunrise' Based On Novel From 'After' Series' Anna Todd; Carlson Young Directing Others in the cast of the new Thomas Crown Affair include Kenneth Branagh, Lily Gladstone, Danai Gurira, Pilou Asbaek and Aiysha Hart. Jordan and Elizabeth Raposo are producing for Outlier Society alongside Charles Roven at Atlas Entertainment. Drew Pearce wrote the script, with previous drafts by Wes Tooke and Justin Britt-Gibson. Patrick McCormick and Toberoff Productions' Marc Toberoff are also producing and Alan Trustman, who wrote the McQueen original, is an executive producer. The film is set to release in theaters on March 5, 2027. Arjona comes to the project after starring in the studio's thriller Blink Twice, directed by Zoë Kravitz, as well as its upcoming series Criminal. Recently appearing on hit Star Wars series Andor and wrapping on A24's Onslaught, she's also known for turns in films like Hit Man and Los Frikis, among others. Next up, she'll be seen in Neon and Topic Studios' comedy Splitsville, from The Climb‘s Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin, out August 22 following its premiere at Cannes.

Latina women are so sorely under represented any win for a fellow woc is a win for us all. So.. they recast for a sex symbol? Taylor Russell isn't exactly Anne Ramsey, you know. Michael B. Jordan is the leading Black next generation A-list actor who can't have a Black leading lady. I was looking forward to seeing him finally in a solid suave, bachelor role that gives him a chance to walk out of the Yurman billboards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With more than 750 contestants having competed on the show since its debut in 2000, it's no surprise that “Survivor” has given birth to a number of on-screen showmances, many of which have since blossomed into full-blown real-world relationships after the cameras stopped rolling. From “Survivor: Worlds Apart” alums Joe Anglim and Sierra Dawn Thomas, who tied the know in 2021, to “Survivor 45” players Katurah Topps and Sabiyah Broderick, who announced their relationship in June 2025, fans of the show love to keep tabs on the love lives of former castaways – especially when it comes to “Survivor” power couple Rob “Boston Rob” Mariano and his now-wife Amber Brkich. On July 19, Mariano sent love-sick “Survivor” fans into a frenzy when took to Instagram to share a never-before-seen snap of himself and Amber taken on the set of “Survivor: All Stars,” where the lovers first crossed paths in 2003. “They gave us a Polaroid camera the last few days…I saved this one!” Another called Mariano and Brkich's relationship a “Top 5 love story,” while more echoed the sentiment, with one fan commenting, “I love that a relationship from reality TV turned out so well and is still so strong against all odds.” Thanks to an early alliance that quickly turned romantic, Mariano and Brkich proved an unstoppable force on the season, eventually securing themselves spots next to one another at Final Tribal Council, where Amber, sporting a shirt that read “I [heart] Rob,” emerged victorious after a 4-3 jury vote. Just moments before Brkich was declared the season's “Sole Survivor” and presented with the million-dollar grand prize, Mariano shocked fans when he dropped to one knee and asked Amber to marry him. “Regardless of what happens here tonight, I feel like I already won,” Mariano told longtime “Survivor” host Jeff Probst during the live finale of “All Stars.” “I have the most special girl in the entire world sitting right here next to me.” “I've seen you at your highest high and your lowest low, and between it all, we work together as a team to accomplish so much,” he continued. You're the most amazing person I've ever met in my entire life, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HYBE label Belift Lab disputes the former ADOR CEO's claims that ILLIT's debut too closely mirrored NewJeans. Former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin appeared in court again on Friday (July 18) for the third oral hearing in a 2 billion won ($1.45 million) defamation lawsuit filed by HYBE's label Belift Lab. The case centers on Min's public claims that Belift plagiarized concepts from her and ADOR's work with the girl group NewJeans in their promotion of ILLIT. Source Music had filed its claim in July 2024, alleging that Min's statements constituted false information and harmed both the company and its artists. With Source Music's case delayed, only the Belift-Min proceedings took place that day. Both sides were given 30 minutes each to present their arguments in court. Belift Lab emphasized Min's influence as a prominent producer in the K-pop industry and questioned whether labeling a rookie group as plagiarists less than a month after their debut could truly be seen as serving the public interest. They also noted that Min herself had faced accusations of similarity during NewJeans' “Ditto” era. In response, Min's legal team stated that from ILLIT's debut, both domestic and international fans and critics had consistently pointed out similarities between the two groups, claiming the resemblance was too significant to be coincidental. They further argued that HYBE initiated an abnormal internal audit of ADOR shortly after Min raised these concerns, framing the current dispute as a matter of defamation and business interference rather than copyright infringement. The proceedings follow a recent development on July 15, when police dismissed HYBE's criminal complaint against Min for breach of trust, concluding there was no evidence of wrongdoing. However, the ongoing conflict between HYBE labels and Min Hee-jin, which began with an internal audit of ADOR in 2024, remains unresolved. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adapted from Esi Edugyan's 2018 novel, the miniseries chronicles the globe-trotting adventures of a boy who escapes slavery in Barbados and winds up in Nova Scotia. It's our story,” narrates Sterling K. Brown's Medwin in the opening moments, invoking themes of family, courage and inspiration. Luckily, Wash (Ernest Kingsley Jr.) has never been one to put too much stock in the rules of gravity anyway. While Hulu's adaptation of Esi Edugyan's Booker-shortlisted 2018 novel never fully shakes that self-seriousness, it eventually reveals itself to be a surprisingly fleet adventure, as buoyant and unpredictable as its hero's own globe-trotting travels. New 'Alien: Earth' Trailer Reveals Monsters Gone Wild After Spaceship With Hybrid Life Forms Crashes Airdate: Wednesday, July 23 (Hulu)Cast: Ernest Kingsley Jr., Sterling K. Brown, Tom Ellis, Eddie Karanja, Iola Evans, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Rupert Graves, Edward BluemelCreator: Selwyn Seyfu Hinds Selwyn Seyfu Hinds' miniseries starts, if not quite at the end of Wash's journey, somewhere deep into it. But his story properly begins eight years earlier on a Barbados sugar plantation, where as an 11-year-old (Eddie Karanja) he has a fateful meeting with Titch (Tom Ellis), the scientist brother of his cruel enslaver (Julian Rhind-Tutt). Intrigued by the boy's curiosity and impressed by his obvious intelligence, Titch enlists his help in constructing a “cloud cutter,” a proto-blimp of Titch's own design. While Medwin's voiceover thankfully ceases after that first scene, a heavy-handed score serves much the same purpose, prodding us toward big and obvious emotions rather than contrasting or highlighting them. They're symbols and metaphors, rather than worlds unto themselves, and the lived-in intimacy of similarly roving shows like Amazon's The Underground Railroad or (in a very different mood) Peacock's Poker Face is sorely missed. With such a broad yet shallow scope, Washington Black occasionally takes on the dutiful feel of an educational video. Still, for a fictionalized history lesson, it's fun one, full of surprising twists and charming turns. If Wash's romance with Tanna, a white-passing biracial woman chafing under the future laid out for her by her father (Rupert Graves), initially feels reverse-engineered from statements the show wants to make about inequities and those with the courage to defy them, Kingsley and Evans are so sweet together that we can't help but root for them. And if characters like tender Kit, the closest Wash has to a mother on the plantation, or Nat Turner, who models for him a more militant form of rebellion, don't stick around as long as we hope, Shaunette Renée Wilson and Jamie Hector (respectively) make big impressions in limited timeframes. His friendship with Wash defies simplistic categorization: While sincere in feeling, its inherently untenable contradictions amount to a ticking time bomb, apparently destined to blow up in the back half of the series. Through Karanja's wide-eyed performance, we watch as the child takes everything in, processing what all of these adults are telling him and noticing what they don't. We see how he recalibrates his perspective with every new pearl of wisdom, stringing them together bit by bit into a comprehensive understanding of himself, the universe and his place in it. I may have wished, occasionally, that Wash had been allowed more room to just be his own idiosyncratic self, rather than a stand-in for bigger, loftier themes. But credit where it's due: With each passing chapter, the truth of Medwin's words becomes increasingly apparent. Wash isn't any sort of Everyman; on the contrary, he's a singular hero blessed with natural genius and hard-won bravery, a soaring sense of ambition and the relentless determination to make his wildest hopes come true. Like any of us, though, he's a patchwork of influences and inspirations — the histories that span centuries and continents, the communities defined by both their solidarity and their diversity, the ideals that clash or contradict or marry to form new ones. Like any of us, he contains entire lifetimes within his own. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
