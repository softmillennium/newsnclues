            Police in northwestern Germany on Sunday said that several people were injured when a car veered off a road, hit a 7-year-old boy on a trampoline and went flying into a barn roof on its side.
    


            Police said that the car first collided with a parked vehicle in the town of Bohmte, broke through a hedge and drove into a garden where it hit the boy.
    


            The car then went over uneven ground and it was apparently catapulted into the air and ended up crashing into the roof of a neighboring barn about 3 meters (10 feet) off the ground.
    


            The boy was seriously injured, the police statement said.
    


            The driver was an unidentified 42-year-old man, and his wife was also seriously injured.
    


             Their two sons, ages 11 and 12, and a 13-year-old passenger were also on board, who like the driver emerged with minor injuries.
    


            Dozens of firefighters, as well as a dozen ambulances and two rescue helicopters were among the emergency services deployed in response.
    


            Images from the scene showed rescuers cutting through the roof, and wreckage of a playground that the car ran through.
    


            The car had to be removed from the roof with a crane and was carted away by police.
    


            An investigation was underway.

Follow:


            (CNN) – A Bangladesh Air Force jet crashed into a college in the capital Dhaka on Monday, killing at least 19 people, according to emergency officials, in the country's deadliest air incident in recent memory.
    


            The crash at Milestone School and College campus, in the Diabari neighborhood of northern Dhaka, injured more than 100 others, according to a spokesperson for the country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus.
    


            At least 83 of those survivors – mostly students – were being treated in hospitals in the capital, some “in critical condition,” the spokesperson added.
    


            The BAF F7 jet hit the campus around 1:18 p.m. local time (3:18 a.m. EST), according to state media BSS News, citing a Fire Service and Civil Defense official. The plane's pilot was among those killed, The Associated Press reported, citing regional officials.
    


            Scores of people rushed towards the crash site, where emergency crews could be seen trying to extinguish the smoking wreckage of the jet.
    


            The government has announced a day of mourning and special prayers, BSS News said.
    


            “I express my deep grief and sorrow over the tragic incident of casualties caused by the crash,” Yunus wrote in a post on X.
    


            “This is a moment of profound pain for the nation. I pray for the speedy recovery of the injured and direct all concerned authorities, including hospitals, to address the situation with the utmost priority,” the interim leader added.
    


            Eyewitnesses, including the parents of students, recalled huge plumes of ash rising over the school – after a banging sound rang out following the deadly crash.
    


            “When I was picking (up) my kids and went to the gate, I realized something came from behind,” Masud Tarik, also a teacher at the school, told Reuters. “I heard an explosion. When I looked back, I only saw fire and smoke.”
    


            Others watched the chaotic aftermath unfold on TV. “I was terrified watching videos,” Rafiqa Taha, a student at the facility, told The Associated Press.
    


            “My God! It's my school,” added the 16-year-old.
    


            Milestone College teaches students from ages 4 to 18, according to its website.

Russia, China, and Iran will hold talks on Tuesday to discuss Tehran's nuclear program, Esmaeil Baghaei, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, has announced. He noted that a separate round of talks with European nations is scheduled for later this week.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Baghaei said that the trilateral talks would also focus on the threats by Britain, France, and Germany to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. In particular, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot warned of a potential sanctions snapback next month if no meaningful progress is made in limiting Iran's nuclear activities.

Baghaei noted that Russia and China remain members of the 2015 nuclear deal and hold significant influence in the UN Security Council. He added that Iran had had “good consultations” with the two countries regarding the potential sanctions snapback. “Legally and logically, there is no reason for the return of sanctions lifted under the [nuclear deal],” he stressed.

The spokesman also confirmed that Iran would hold a separate meeting at the deputy foreign minister level with Britain, France, and Germany in Istanbul on Friday, adding that Tehran has “no plans to talk with the US” at this time.

One of the key stumbling blocks has been Iran's decision to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was monitoring Tehran's nuclear program. Tehran has accused the IAEA of releasing a biased report, which was allegedly used as a pretense by Israel to launch a 12-day war against Iran.

The Israeli attack came after Iran-US nuclear talks ended up at an impasse due to Washington's demand that Tehran fully abandon uranium enrichment. While the US has argued that Iran could use the capacity to create a nuclear bomb, Iran has dismissed any plans of doing so, insisting that it needs enrichment to fuel its civilian energy industry.

Both Russia and China maintain that the Iranian nuclear crisis can only be resolved through political and diplomatic means.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will miss scheduled corruption hearings this week after being diagnosed with food poisoning, his office said on Sunday.

The trial began in 2020 and involves charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust over allegations of influence peddling and accepting gifts. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing, describing the case as a politically motivated campaign against him.

According to officials, the 75-year-old prime minister fell ill overnight and was examined at home by his doctor. He was diagnosed with intestinal inflammation from eating “spoiled food” and is receiving intravenous fluids for dehydration. His condition was described as good.

“In accordance with his doctors' instructions, the prime minister will rest at home for the next three days and will conduct state affairs from there,” the Prime Minister's Office stated. He also missed Sunday's weekly cabinet meeting due to the illness.

Netanyahu's lawyer, Amit Hadad, requested the postponement, which the State Attorney's Office accepted, proposing testimony later in the week. The court, however, canceled all sessions, and with summer recess starting, the next hearing is not expected before September 5.

The hearings have faced a number of delays due to Netanyahu's health issues, Israel's wars with Hamas and Iran, and diplomatic travel, according to Israeli media. In December 2024, he missed a session following a urinary tract infection caused by an enlarged prostate and reportedly underwent surgery.

Last month, US President Donald Trump called for the proceedings be canceled, labeling the case a “witch hunt.” Earlier in June, the US joined Israel's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, claiming that Tehran was nearing the completion of a nuclear bomb. Iran denied the allegations and retaliated with attacks on Israel and a US base in Qatar.

BEIRUT, July 21. /TASS/. 298 civilians have become victims of the armed clashes that have been ongoing in the province of Al-Suwayda in southern Syria since July 13, while the total number of deaths during the inter-communal conflict amounted to 1,119 people, Sky News Arabia TV channel reported, citing medical sources, which previously put death toll at 940.

According to the TV channel, 427 fighters of the Druze self-defense units were killed. The special forces of the Interior and Defense Ministries sent from Damascus to the southern regions to restore stability lost 354 soldiers, and the pro-government formations of the Arab tribes lost 21 militias. Another 19 members of the internal security forces were killed in Israeli airstrikes.

On July 19, Syrian President for the transitional period Ahmed al-Sharaa introduced a ceasefire in Al-Suwayda in accordance with the settlement plan developed with the participation of international mediators. The planned prisoner exchange on July 20 failed due to renewed clashes in several areas between Bedouins and supporters of radical leader of the Syrian Druze Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri.

Earlier, supporters of Sheikh al-Hijri, who opposes normalization of relations with Damascus, prevented the passage of a government delegation to the province, which was escorting a cargo of humanitarian aid. The Syrian authorities condemned these provocative actions.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, July 21. /TASS/. Air defense systems intercepted 74 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) overnight, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

The fall of drone debris on an infrastructure facility at the Kamenolomny station in the Rostov Region has caused delays for 26 passenger trains.

TASS has compiled key facts about the aftermath of the drone strike.

Overnight, from 11:20 p.m. Moscow time (8:20 p.m. GMT — TASS) on July 20 to 7 a.m. Moscow time on July 21, air defense systems on duty intercepted and eliminated 74 Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles.

According to the ministry, air defense forces downed 23 drones over the Moscow Region, including 15 headed toward the capital. Fourteen UAVs were intercepted over the Kursk Region, 12 over the Rostov Region, 10 each over the Bryansk and Kaluga regions, four over the Tula Region, and one over the Lipetsk Region.

The fall of drone debris on an infrastructure facility at the Kamenolomny station in the Rostov Region triggered a fire.

At least 26 passenger trains have been delayed, the North Caucasus Railway reported in a Telegram post.

Traffic through the Kamenolomny station is proceeding at reduced speed. An emergency response team is on site to manage the aftermath.

Acting Rostov Region Governor Yury Slusar also stated on Telegram that a flower shop caught fire in the village of Kamenolomny, Oktyabrsky Rural District, which was later extinguished.

According to Slusar, in the village of Rakovo, Krasnosulinsky District, drone fragments damaged a private home, a summer kitchen, and two cars. Preliminary reports indicate no casualties.

Temporary restrictions on arrivals and departures were imposed at Moscow's airports: Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky.

These measures have since been lifted.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Democrats are livid over the governor's plan to redraw districts at a time when Texas officials are supposed to be focused on recovery from the floods

A plan for Texas to redraw its congressional districts and gain five additional Republican seats barrels through flimsy legal arguments and political norms like a rough-stock rodeo bronco through a broken chute.

But the fiddly process of drawing the maps to Republicans' advantage for 2026 may require more finesse than cowboy politics can produce.

“It is more than redistricting. It's really theft,” said Democratic representative Al Green, whose Houston-area congressional district is likely to be one targeted by Republicans in a redrawn map. “It's the kind of election theft that you use when you realize that you can't win playing with the hand that you've been dealt. So, you decide that you'll just rearrange the cards so that they favor you.”

The attempted power grab comes at a time when the state legislature is meant to be focused on the floods that killed more than 130 people just two weeks ago.

Texas has 38 congressional districts, and Republicans hold 25 of those districts today. All but one of those districts has a white voting majority. And every one of those districts was won by double digits.

While Republicans hold two-thirds of the seats, they only won about 58% of congressional voters last year. In 2018, the midterm of Donald Trump's first term in office and a Democratic wave election year, Texas Republicans barely cleared 50% statewide, and lost two of those seats. In 2022, after a harsh gerrymander that voting rights groups challenged in court, Republicans reclaimed those seats.

Texas is the only state that explicitly permits more than one redistricting in between decennial censuses. But even accounting for that, the strategy exploits the end of pre-clearance requirements for new maps under the Voting Rights Act that the US supreme court eliminated in the Shelby county v Holder decision in 2013.

“They are willing to enact, frankly, illegal, racially discriminatory maps, even while their current maps are in court,” said Sam Gostomski, executive director of the Texas Democratic party. “They know if they just cheat, they can break the law … They can just do this every couple of years and kick the ball down the road, because every time they draw new districts, those cases have to be litigated, and that takes time, right?”

The party opposing the president historically gains seats in Congress in off-year elections. Facing a likely repeat of 2018, the White House is looking for options in Texas to limit the damage.

“I think we get five,” Trump said of Texas earlier this week. “And there could be some other states. We're going to get another three or four or five in addition. Texas would be the biggest one. And that'll be five … Just a very simple redrawing. We pick up five seats, but we have a couple of other states where we'll pick up seats also.”

Texas governor Greg Abbott shoehorned mid-cycle redistricting into a special session of the Texas legislature that begins Monday, ostensibly to address disaster relief after deadly flooding near Austin. It's not at all clear if a proposed map will be presented even by the time of the first public hearing on redistricting on 24 July, said state representative Barbara Gervin-Hawkins, a Democrat from San Antonio and a member of the Texas house's redistricting committee.

“No maps have been seen,” she said. “No doubt, we believe those maps have been drawn already, but we haven't seen them.”

The redistricting is not politics born of Texas, Gostomski said. Republicans there are not eager to campaign in more competitive districts. They're less keen to resist a Trump demand.

“The Republican congressional delegation and Governor Abbott bent the knee before they even saw the maps,” Gostomski said. “They don't know what these maps are going to be and have already agreed to redraw whatever lines the White House wants them to.”

Democrats in Texas are livid. Gostomski said he had spent some days after the flooding near Austin with people from church and former classmates digging out cars and doing whatever could be done to help.

“On a very personal level, I felt it in the pit in my stomach when all of a sudden, 24 hours later, I come back to my job, and 24 hours after that, now the governor has made it political,” he said. “And that should not be the conversation right now.”

A redistricting fight hijacks a session which should be devoted to disaster recovery, Gervin-Hawkins said. “We should be focusing on those families, how we can support them, how we can help them, how we can recover from the bodies that are missing. Yet, we're trying to redistrict a map, cut out people's rights to vote … I think it's just an atrocity, and I think our leadership should be ashamed of what they've done.”

A gerrymandered, off-year Texas redistricting that increases Republicans' congressional delegation to 79% in a year when their share of the vote is likely to decrease? It would require redrawing maps for a state that already has an F rating on the Princeton redistricting report card to one of the most unfair maps in American history.

“In order to get the five seats that Donald Trump is telling the media and telling the Republican congressional delegation that they want, they're going to have to take risks,” Gostomski said. “They're going to make some of these Republican seats a lot less safe, especially in what we expect to be a big swing year in the midterms.”

Houston and its surrounding area is one of the fastest-growing municipalities in the country and at about eight million people it is the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Harris County at the center has about 4.8 million residents, about three quarters of whom are nonwhite, with a Hispanic plurality.

Eleven members of Congress represent voters in the metro Houston area. Seven are Republicans.

For seats around Houston, Republican mapmakers would carve the city up like a pie, splitting up a core thick with Democratic voters with long, thin wedges, radiating outward into the Republican suburbs and rural counties surrounding them. Green's south Houston ninth district is vulnerable to this strategy, as is Lizzie Fletcher's seventh district, Sylvia Garcia's 29th district and Sylvester Turner's 18th district. All are in safe Democratic seats.

Other districts near Dallas and along the southern Texas border may also see changes. Democrats Vincente Gonzales and Henry Cuellar are both in districts that are close to evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Between them is Republican Monica De La Cruz, whose 15th district is rated as a +7 Republican lean by the Cook Partisan Voting Index. In most states, that would be a lock. In Texas, facing a wave election year, it presents a challenge for mapmakers angling to catch Democratic lawmakers nearby.

Shaving Republican districts of conservative voters to capture Democratic districts makes presumptions that may not hold about how suburban voters and Latino swing voters might behave in future elections, said Mike Doyle, chairman of the Harris county Democratic party in Houston.

“It also makes assumptions about turnout,” he said. “They work incredibly hard to make it difficult to vote here in the state, and so our voting is some of the lowest in the nation.” But in a wave election year, Democratic anger at Trump and the reaction of rural voters to the economy and suburban swing voters to partisan excesses may change the electoral math.

“There are certainly some districts where you know, with the right candidate, right resources, we could easily turn some of these quote ‘red' seats into Democrats,” he said.

There's little Democrats can do legislatively; Republicans control both chambers of the Texas state legislature. But they might succeed … fugitively.

They can run for it, and deny Republicans a quorum.

At least two-thirds of the 150-member Texas house and 31-member senate must be present to conduct legislative business. Sixty-two Texas house members are Democrats, as are 11 state senators. One state senate seat is vacant.

Texas Democrats last fled the state four years ago when attempting to derail legislation that attacked voting rights. While within Texas, a fugitive lawmaker during a session is subject to arrest by Texas rangers and being hauled back to the capitol in Austin. But if they make it across the border to a friendly state, Texas cannot compel them to return. The attorney general can prevail upon the federal government to issue an arrest warrant, however, and they are subject to $500 daily fines.

Opponents of redistricting launched a website, StopTheTexasSteal.com, which accuses the Republican majority of using the flooding for partisan gain and is raising money. “We're preparing our members to use every tool available – including breaking quorum if necessary – to force Abbott to focus on flood relief instead of Trump's power grab,” the site states.

And legislators are definitely thinking about it.

“I think we need to leave all tools on the table,” Gervin-Hawkins said. “But I think anybody knows that it's very difficult to do a quorum break when you talk about families, jobs and everything like that. That's difficult. But we're leaving everything on the table to really just see what works best. Our goal is, no doubt, to save democracy. Our goal is to make sure our people are protected.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Carrier says Horizon Air flights also suspended while not specifying reasons for outage causing fleet's second grounding in a year

US carrier Alaska Airlines grounded its flights after an IT outage on Sunday that affected its systems, the company said, without specifying the nature of the outage, marking the second time it has grounded its fleet in just over a year.

“At approximately 8pm Pacific on Sunday (0300 GMT on Monday), Alaska Airlines experienced an IT outage that's impacting our operations,” the carrier said in a statement. “We requested a temporary, system-wide ground stop for Alaska and Horizon Air flights.”

The Seattle-based airline said there would be residual impacts to its operations throughout the evening, without providing more details.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The FAA status page showed all destinations affected by the ground stop of Alaska's mainline aircraft, and the suspension of Horizon's operations.

In April 2024, Alaska grounded its entire fleet due to an issue with the system that calculates the weight and balance of its planes, just a few months after a door panel on an Alaska Airlines-operated Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet blew off midair.

Alaska Air Group maintains an operational fleet of 238 Boeing 737 aircraft, and 87 Embraer 175 aircraft, according to its website.

In June, Alaska Air Group-owned Hawaiian Airlines said some of its IT systems were disrupted by a hack. Alaska Air Group said it was still determining the financial impact of that event.

The news of Alaska's IT issues comes at a time when tech companies Google and Palo Alto Networks have warned of the “Scattered Spider” hacking group's interest in the aviation sector.

Canada's WestJet Airlines was struck by an unspecified cyber incident in June, while Australia's Qantas experienced a data breach in July where a cyber hacker accessed the personal information of millions of customers.

It remains unclear whether Alaska's outage is related to Microsoft stating on Sunday that there were “active attacks” on its server software used by government agencies and businesses.

Alaska did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on whether the outage was related to the Microsoft announcement.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Authorities interviewed Israeli pair after they were seen at Tomorrowland music festival near Antwerp

Belgian authorities have said they briefly held and questioned two Israeli citizens who attended an electronic music festival last week, after pro-Palestinian groups accused them of war crimes.

Prosecutors said they had received legal complaints alleging that two Israeli soldiers responsible for “serious violations of international humanitarian law” in Gaza were spotted at the Tomorrowland festival near the northern city of Antwerp.

The federal prosecutor's office said it had asked the police to locate the two people named in the complaint and to interview them. “Following these interviews, they were released,” it said in a statement.

The office said it had taken action after concluding that Belgian courts had extraterritorial jurisdiction over alleged war crimes. “No further information will be given at this stage of the investigation,” the office said.

The two Israelis have not been named.

Last week, the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), a Belgian pro-Palestinian organisation, said it had identified two Israeli soldiers “responsible for grave international crimes” in Gaza among the crowds at Tomorrowland.

It claimed that a group of young Israeli men were seen at the festival waving a flag of the Givati Brigade, an Israeli military unit involved in the fighting in the Palestinian territory.

HRF said it had filed a complaint with prosecutors in association with the Global Legal Action Network, a lawyers' group specialising in human rights violations.

One of the world's largest electronic music festivals, Tomorrowland draws music enthusiasts from all over the world. About 400,000 people are expected to attend the event this year over two weekends.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A former top Ukrainian police official has been found dead under mysterious circumstances in the same Spanish residential complex where a Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine was assassinated last year, Spanish news outlet El Espanol reported on July 20.

The body of 61-year-old Ihor Hrushevskyi, a former senior officer in Ukraine's Department for Combating Organized Crime, was discovered floating face down in the swimming pool of the Cala Alta residential complex in Villajoyosa, a coastal town in Spain's Alicante province, on June 29. 

While initial findings suggest no signs of violence, witnesses noted he was bleeding from one ear, suggesting it might have been a cerebral hemorrhage or stroke. Despite efforts by bystanders and emergency personnel to revive Hrushevskyi, he was declared dead at the scene.

The exact cause of Hrushevskyi's death remains unclear. 

El Espanol reports that Hrushevskyi was a senior official in Ukraine's Interior Ministry and later in the National Police, though he is largely absent from public records. 

Ukrainian legal databases reportedly list him as holding top roles in anti-organized crime units in Cherkasy and Kirovohrad oblasts in the early 1990s. These units were disbanded in 2015 as part of police reforms and replaced by the National Police and the SBU's anti-corruption directorate.

The same residential complex was previously the site of another death — that of Russian pilot Maksim Kuzminov, who defected to Ukraine with a military helicopter in 2023. 

Kuzminov was found shot dead in a garage there in February 2024, with a burned-out car discovered nearby, believed to have been used by his killers. Ukraine's military intelligence confirmed his death on Feb. 19, 2024. 

There was no direct connection confirmed between the two deaths. 

According to El Espanol, Hrushevskyi had recently purchased and begun renovating a unit in the complex. 

Hrushevskyi's age and his recent purchase of the apartment have led some neighbors to believe he may have simply retired to Villajoyosa for its sizable Ukrainian community, the news outlet reported.

Ukraine needs $6 billion to bridge its weapons production shortfall in 2025, Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal told allies during a virtual Ramstein format meeting on July 21, as cited by Radio Svoboda.

Ukraine is determined to constantly increase its homegrown drone capabilities, with recent plans focusing on developing interceptor drones designed to counter Russia's frequent Shahed-type drone attacks on Ukrainian cities.

""This would allow us to produce more FPV (first-person view) drones, more interceptor drones to repel Shahed attacks, and additional long-range weapons so that the war also continues on Russian territory,"" Shmyhal said during the meeting, Radio Svoboda reported.

The 29th Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, known as the Ramstein format, brought together representatives from 52 countries under German and British leadership. 

The regular gatherings of top defense and military officials coordinate weapons deliveries and other military support for Ukraine's war effort.

The U.S. was represented by its ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker rather than Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, despite earlier announcements by the British NATO mission.

During the meeting, the newly-appionted Shmyhal also urged partners to earmark Ukraine funding in their 2026 budgets.

On June 24, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during the NATO summit that Ukraine has the capacity to produce over 8 million drones of various types each year, but lacks the financial backing to reach that potential.

Zelensky urged allies to scale up investments in joint weapons production, including drone technologies, artillery, and interceptors.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has rapidly developed domestic military capabilities, with particular success in groundbreaking drone technology. 

According to Zelensky, overall, domestically-produced weapons account for more than 40% of the arms used in Ukraine's defense against Russia's war.

According to the U.K. government, the tankers have secretly transported $24 billion worth of oil since the start of 2024.

Jake Tapper, a CNN anchor and veteran political journalist, says that he wishes he had been more aggressive in trying to find out what was going on behind the scenes with then-president Joe Biden.Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images

A year ago Monday, Joe Biden ended his re-election bid and endorsed Kamala Harris to take his place atop the Democratic presidential ticket. The move followed weeks of mounting pressure from party grandees after Mr. Biden's disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump raised questions about the octogenarian's cognitive decline.

In the book Original Sin, released this past spring, authors Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson revealed that the moment was only the culmination of worsening mental acuity during the latter half of Mr. Biden's presidency. White House advisers, they reported, engaged in a “cover-up” to hide his troubles from voters.

Speaking with The Globe and Mail, Mr. Tapper, a CNN anchor and veteran political journalist, reflected on how such a situation could happen in the world's most scrutinized political office, the effect of Mr. Biden's decline on his governance, and the criticism the Washington press corps has taken from both sides in the aftermath.

He also delivered one piece of good news for Canadians: In his view, Westminster systems such as Canada's – with their traditions of Question Period and caucus politics – would not allow a situation such as Mr. Biden's to occur.

Book Review: Original Sin details Biden's declining health and a cover-up by closest advisers

On criticisms of the media, and whether reporters failed to push hard enough to uncover evidence of Mr. Biden's cognitive problems:

Knowing then what I know now, I wish I had been more aggressive in trying to find out what was going on behind the scenes. It's difficult to report on that if sources won't communicate it, and that was one of the problems that people in the news media had, that people weren't talking. The Biden people made the argument that if you're hurting Biden, you're helping Trump. So people kept their mouths shut, Democrats kept their mouths shut.

On whether journalists are now failing to report on potential problems with Mr. Trump's mental acuity:

I agree that there are plenty of people asking questions about President Trump. And I don't think it's true that the media didn't cover that. It's less an issue of people thinking that President Trump has some sort of cognitive decline, it's more people questioning whether or not he has some sort of personality disorder. I certainly think that that has been covered thoroughly.

Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson was released this past spring.ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images

On the moment he realized something serious might be going on with Mr. Biden – February of 2024, when special counsel Robert Hur, in his investigation of the then-president's handling of classified documents, revealed that Mr. Biden had become confused about key dates in his life while Mr. Hur was interviewing him:

I've been covering Biden since 2001, so obviously I have seen him age quite a bit. There were moments throughout the 2020 campaign when it was obvious that he was aging. But I would distinguish between aging and having cognitive issues, because they are not the same thing. This was a guy who, already in his prime, was prone to long, rambling stories, and gaffes, could be short-tempered.

The Hur report was a very significant moment. He was providing the very first unfettered view of what Biden was like behind the scenes. And it was disturbing.

Even having read that, and the transcript of the interviews, I was still stunned by the debate. The debate was the real moment that I thought to myself, “Okay, something is really, seriously going wrong behind the scenes here, and they have been lying to us and covering it up.”

On how Mr. Biden's decline affected his governing:

You have Senator Mark Warner talking to President Biden in October of 2023 about the release of detainees from [Guantanamo Bay], and Warner is concerned that Biden doesn't seem to really have a grasp on what they are talking about. In June, 2024, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado goes to an immigration event where Biden seems to be struggling and, afterwards, comes to the conclusion that Biden's issues are one of the reasons why immigration policy in the country is such a mess.

We have cabinet secretaries in our book saying that Biden could not be relied upon to handle the 2 a.m. phone call for a national-security emergency. And thank God one never happened. But what if one had? What would have happened? It's terrifying.

Robyn Urback: Joe Biden's personal tragedy is also America's betrayal

On how a situation like this can occur, how it could be avoided, and the Canadian context:

It's still going on, just at a much lower level. There are more members of Congress 70 and above than ever before in this nation's history, and there are questions about the ability of some of them to do the job. But still, because it's an uncomfortable conversation to have, it's considered rude for reporters, or anyone, to bring up.

Presidents are very cut off from the American people. Bill Clinton once referred to the White House as the crown jewel of the American prison system. And then a lot of politicians surround themselves with yes-men and yes-women and people who are not there to tell you ugly truths but to tell you how to get through the day.

One of the problems we have is that political parties have never been weaker. And we have an increasingly weak legislative branch, so we can't rely on them either. So, really, it comes down to voters and reporters. Voters need to be aggressive in rewarding politicians who tell the truth, and reporters need to continue to remember that we're not here to be friends with politicians. We're not here to win accolades from partisans on social media. We're here to ask tough questions.

This could not ever happen in Canada, because the party wouldn't let it happen. Whoever is next in line behind the prime minister would rally the other members of the party and say, “We can't do this any more, this is crazy, let's figure something out.”

Shigeru Ishiba on Monday vowed to stay in his role as Japan's Prime Minister, despite disappointing election results.PHILIP FONG/Reuters

Japan's Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the party's founding in 1955, were pushed into minority status in both houses of parliament in an election Sunday, leaving the future of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in doubt.

According to public broadcaster NHK, the LDP and its allies in the Komeito party will likely control 121 seats in the upper house of the Japanese Diet, four short of a majority, a repeat of lower house elections last year which also saw the coalition lose absolute control of the chamber. 

There were renewed calls for Mr. Ishiba's resignation as votes were tallied. Describing the results as a “harsh judgment,” he nevertheless vowed Monday to stay on as prime minister, citing the importance of continuity amid tense trade talks with the United States. This may not be up to him, however. 

“It is difficult to see how an LDP Leader who has led the party to two consecutive national election defeats, lost control of both houses, and failed to fend off new challenges on the right will continue to enjoy the confidence of his own party,” political analyst Tobias Harris, founder of Japan Foresight, wrote in a newsletter Monday. 

The LDP avoided outright defeat only thanks to the fractured nature of the opposition, which has formed a government just twice in Japan's post-World War II history. Established parties on the left failed to make major gains: the Constitutional Democratic Party, a successor to the Democratic Party that governed Japan from 2009-12, did not add any seats, while the Communist Party saw its total slip from 11 to seven, according to NHK. 

The centrist Democratic Party For the People, which has supported the ruling coalition in the lower house, emerged as a major winner of Sunday's election, as did the far-right Sanseito, which took 14 seats.

“Japanese voters wanted a conservative party to win the election – just not necessarily the LDP,” Michael MacArthur Bosack, special adviser for government relations at the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, wrote Monday. 

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba vowed to remain in office on Monday after his ruling coalition suffered a bruising defeat in upper house elections, prompting some of his own party to deliberate his future as the opposition weighed a no-confidence motion.

The previously fringe Sanseito – known for pushing conspiracy theories about vaccines and global elites during the COVID-19 pandemic – campaigned on an anti-immigration, “Japanese First” message, capitalizing on growing concerns around tourism and an increase in foreign-born workers at a time when the Japanese economy is struggling and the yen is weak. 

Speaking to Japanese TV after the election, Sanseito Leader Sohei Kamiya said his party has been mischaracterized, claiming “the phrase ‘Japanese First' was meant to express rebuilding Japanese people's livelihoods by resisting globalism.” 

“I am not saying that we should completely ban foreigners or that every foreigner should get out of Japan,” he added. 

Mr. Kamiya said the party has been criticized as “xenophobic and discriminatory,” but the public has come “to understand that the media was wrong and Sanseito was right.” 

Unlike in recent elections in Canada and Australia, where conservative parties suffered as a result of being seen as too close or similar to U.S. President Donald Trump, Mr. Kamiya revelled in the comparison and had already pushed the government to the right on immigration even before his victory Sunday. 

Other fringe conservative parties also added to their seat count, as did the left-wing Reiwa Shinsengumi, which has presented itself as an alternative to the staid CDP and the Communists, who have struggled to break through with mainstream liberal Japan in part due to the party's strict pacifism at a time when more and more Japanese support rearmament. 

Resisting calls to resign Monday, Mr. Ishiba said he has a “responsibility to the nation” to deal with the pressing issues facing Japan, not least trade negotiations with Mr. Trump, which have proven far tougher than Tokyo expected and increasingly left the country out in the cold with one of its previously most reliable allies. 

‘Mutually beneficial' trade deal with Japan still possible, U.S. Treasury Secretary says

He said the most important thing for the country at this time is “political stability,” adding he will seek to speak to Mr. Trump “at the earliest date possible to seek a solution on trade.” 

Some members of the DPFP, whose support will be key for the ruling coalition to pass legislation, suggested they may not back the LDP if Mr. Ishiba stays in power, however. 

If he is removed, a leadership fight could prove bruising for the LDP, which has been racked by infighting and scandal since the resignation and subsequent death of former prime minister Shinzo Abe. 

When Mr. Ishiba won the leadership in 2024, he was the fourth person to hold that job in as many years. In that race, he narrowly defeated a candidate from the party's hard-right, Sanae Takaichi, who would have been Japan's first female prime minister and is still widely seen as his most likely successor.

Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial assaults on Ukraine in recent months, only hours before the U.K. and Germany chaired a meeting to discuss U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for NATO allies to provide Ukraine with weapons.

The attack killed two people and wounded 15, including a 12-year-old, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

In Kyiv's Shevchenkivskyi district, a drone struck the entrance to a subway station where people had taken cover. Videos posted on social media showed the station platform engulfed by smoke, with dozens of people inside. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said the station had to be ventilated in what he called an “enhanced mode.”

The heaviest strikes hit Kyiv's Darnytskyi district, where a kindergarten, supermarket and warehouse facilities caught fire.

Russia launched a new barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine in an overnight attack on Monday, killing at least one person and causing multiple fires in the capital Kyiv, city officials said. The attack damaged the entrance to a metro station, a woman that sheltered in that station said.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot arrived in Kyiv on Monday and visited some of the damage.

The hours-long drone and missile assault on Kyiv overnight into Monday underscored the urgency of Ukraine's need for further Western military aid, especially in air defence, a week after Trump said deliveries would arrive in Ukraine within days.

The virtual meeting of high-level military officials Monday was led by British Defence Secretary John Healey and his German counterpart Boris Pistorius. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and NATO leader Mark Rutte, as well as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, attended the meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group.

Moscow has intensified its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate as Russian drone production expands.

Ukraine's new Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal urged allies to speed up deliveries of American air defence systems under the plan put forward by Trump.

“I request the U.S. to make these weapons available for purchase, and our European partners to extend all the needed financing for their procurement,” Shmyhal, who until recently served as prime minister, said as the meeting began.

Trump's arms plan, announced a week ago, involves European nations sending American weapons, including Patriot air defence missile systems, to Ukraine via NATO – either from existing stockpiles or buying and donating new ones.

In an shift of tone toward Russia, Trump last week gave Moscow a 50-day deadline to agree to a ceasefire or face tougher sanctions.

U.S.-Russia ties in ‘deplorable state,' but Trump sanctions threat has not ended talks, Kremlin says

At Monday's meeting, Healey was expected to urge Ukraine's Western partners to launch a “50-day drive” to get Kyiv the weapons it needs to fight Russia's bigger army and force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, the U.K. government said in a statement.

NATO's Grynkewich told The Associated Press on Thursday that “preparations are underway” for weapons transfers to Ukraine while U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said he couldn't give a time frame.

Germany has said it offered to finance two new Patriot systems for Ukraine and raised the possibility of supplying systems it already owns and having them replaced by the U.S.

But delivery could take time, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested, because “they have to be transported, they have to be set up; that is not a question of hours, it is a question of days, perhaps weeks.”

Other Patriot systems could come thanks to Switzerland, whose defence ministry said Thursday it was informed by the U.S. Defense Department that it will “reprioritize the delivery” of five previously ordered systems to support Ukraine.

While Ukraine waits for Patriots, a senior NATO official said the alliance is still co-ordinating the delivery of other military aid – such as ammunition and artillery rounds – which includes aid from the U.S. that was briefly paused. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

Zelensky said Saturday that his officials have proposed a new round of peace talks this week. Russian state media on Sunday reported that no date has yet been set for the negotiations, but said that Istanbul would likely remain the host city. The Kremlin spokesman said Sunday that Russia is open to peace with Ukraine, but achieving its goals remains a priority.

The overnight Russian barrage of Kyiv began shortly after midnight and continued until around 6 a.m. Residents of the capital were kept awake by machine-gun fire, buzzing drone engines and multiple loud explosions.

It was the first major attack on Kyiv since Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, arrived in the city last Monday. Russia halted strikes on Kyiv during his visit.

Russia's Ministry of Defence said its attack used drones and Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. It said that the barrage successfully targeted airfield infrastructure and Ukraine's military-industrial complex.

Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 426 Shahed and decoy drones overnight Monday, as well as 24 missiles of various types. It said 200 drones were intercepted with 203 more jammed or lost from radars.

Ukraine, meanwhile, continued to deploy its domestically produced long-range drones. Russia's Ministry of Defence said that its forces shot down 74 Ukrainian drones overnight, with almost a third of them destroyed close to the Russian capital. Twenty-three drones were shot down in the Moscow region, the ministry said, 15 of which were intercepted over the city itself.

Rescuers retrieved five bodies, including a pregnant woman following the fire on a passenger ferry. The vessel was heading to Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi province and caught fire in the water.

An Indonesian passenger ferry fire killed at least five people and injured hundreds more on Sunday, the country's coast guard said. More than 280 others were saved, with many jumping overboard to flee the inferno.

The KM Barcelona 5 was en route to Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi province, from Talaud — an island district in the province — when it caught fire in waters near Talise, the Indonesian Maritime Security Agency said.

The incident occurred just weeks after at least 19 people were killed when a ferry sank off the popular resort island of Bali.

""Five people were reported dead, two of whom have yet to be identified. Meanwhile, 284 people have been evacuated safely,"" the agency, also known as Bakamla, said in a statement. 

Rescuers retrieved five bodies, including a pregnant woman but there were no immediate details on other injuries, and no exact figures of passengers and crew members on board the ferry.

Photos and videos released by the National Search and Rescue Agency showed terrified passengers, mostly wearing life jackets, jumping into the sea as flames and black smoke billowed from the burning vessel.

The fire broke out at the ferry's stern, forcing some passengers jump overboard with life jackets, the Bakamla statement added.

Several fishermen also helped evacuate the victims to nearby islands, according to the statement. The injured were taken to the nearest health facility.

Marine incidents occur frequently in the Southeast Asian archipelago of around 17,000 islands, in part due to questionable safety standards or bad weather.

The ferry sinking en route to Bali earlier in July was attributed to bad weather while in March, a boat carrying 16 people capsized in rough waters off Bali, killing an Australian woman and injuring at least one other person. 

In 2018, more than 150 people drowned when a ferry sank in one of the world's deepest lakes on Sumatra island.

Two people, including a child, were seriously injured on Saturday evening in a spectacular accident which saw a car leave the road, crash through a hedge and hit a trampoline before lodging itself in the roof of a barn.

A hole in a hedge, a smashed up trampoline, branches ripped off trees, tiles torn off roofs, and a car lodged in the roof of a barn.

The small town of Bohmte near the city of Osnabrück in the northwestern German state of Lower Saxony was the scene of a spectacular accident on Saturday evening which has left two people seriously injured, including a seven-year-old boy.

For as yet unknown reasons, local police reported on Sunday, the car appears to have come off the road at high speed before colliding with a parked vehicle and crashing through a hedge.

On the other side of the hedge, the car then fell around 1.5 meters (five feet) into a lower-lying back garden where it appears to have landed on a trampoline, hitting and injuring the child who was playing on it.

Then, either as a result of the topography of the area or of bouncing off the trampoline, or both, it appears to have been flung further through the air, eventually crashing into the attic of a barn about 3 meters off the ground.

""There was a massive clatter and we just thought: Help! What has happened?"" said a local resident. ""Then we ran outside and saw the car in the roof.""

The driver of the car, a 42-year-old man, sustained only light injuries, as did three boys aged 11, 12 and 13 in the back seat. A 43-year-old woman in the passenger seat was seriously injured, as was the little boy on the trampoline, who police said was in a life-threatening condition.

After being alerted to the accident, dozens of emergency service personnel attended the scene, including firefighters, police, technical relief staff, 12 ambulance crews and emergency pastoral carers, while two rescue helicopters circled overhead.

""This is clearly an extraordinary deployment,"" said a fire brigade spokesman.

The occupants of the car were taken to various local clinics where the driver had blood samples taken and his driving license confiscated. Police said they are ruling out alcohol as a cause of the accident.

The car had to be removed from the barn roof with a crane and was also subsequently impounded by prosecutors.

Photographs and video footage from the scene show a trail of destruction left by the car as it hurtled along: branches ripped off trees, tiles torn off roofs, a smashed hedge and a wrecked trampoline.

The entire operation continued until about 4 a.m. (0200 GMT) local time on Sunday morning.

Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, is releasing a new single this week even as she continues to mull entering the race for North Carolina's vacant Senate seat.

She shared the song, entitled Eyes of God, exclusively with The Telegraph.

“This song is a reminder that we are all more alike than we are different – everyone is dealing with different highs and lows and, in the era of hiding behind a screen, we should all take a moment to give one another a little grace,” she said.

“Instead of turning to a negative comment, maybe it's time we all turn to God.”

The track is due to be released on Friday.

Mrs Trump, 42, is married to the president's son Eric, making her one half of a Maga power couple.

While he oversees the family business, and will be in Scotland with his father for the opening of a new golf course next week, she has been a key Trump cheerleader on Fox News and an important factor in the 2024 election win.

Mrs Trump launched her musical career last year with a string of singles even as she served as co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, a key fundraising arm for Mr Trump's presidential run.

In the meantime, she hosts a Fox News TV show and last week interviewed the president to mark the anniversary of the Butler assassination attempt.

She also has a line of sports clothing based around patriotic or conservative themes including “Made in America” and “Maga Red”.

Her busy schedule raises questions around whether she has the bandwidth to enter politics full-time with a run for the Senate.

LJ Fino, her producer, said he had not discussed political plans with Mrs Trump.

“She's an incredibly talented, driven, and capable woman,” he said. “Whether it's music, media, or potentially public service, she approaches everything with heart and excellence.

“I'm sure whatever decision she makes will be what's best for her family and for this country.”

Her fans will have to wait a little longer for another collection of songs. She was originally due to release an EP of songs on Friday.

“We've made the decision to delay the release of Lara Trump's EP, Just Lara, in order to put our final touches on the project and allow our incredible collaborators the time they need to deliver their very best work,” said Mr Fino. “The new release date will be announced shortly.”

It includes a collaboration with Gims, the French-Congolese rapper, best known for his work in the hip hop group Sexion d'Assaut.

Gims said Mrs Trump was unafraid to step outside her comfort zone.

“So it felt completely natural for me to be open to this collaboration — especially since the song itself has real depth and represents a style that's quite different from what she usually does, which makes the project all the more exciting,” he said.

Last month Thom Tillis announced he was retiring from the Senate after clashing with Mr Trump. It means the Republican's Senate seat in North Carolina is up for grabs, and Mrs Trump, who was born and raised in the state, emerged as the clear favourite for the party nomination.

The president indicated he was her first choice but left her an excuse to gracefully decline.

“She's a great person, Lara Trump. I mean, that would always be my first choice, but she doesn't live there now,” Mr Trump said.

“But she's there all the time, her parents are there. You know, she really knows North Carolina well.”

Analysts say she would benefit from strong name recognition and instant backing at the very highest levels of the Republican Party.

In the past, Trump has directly profited from overcharging agencies to protect him at his personal properties.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A provision within President Donald Trump's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” which he signed into law earlier this month, will allocate an extra $300 million for protecting Mar-a-Lago and other properties owned by Trump — money that Trump could partially profit from, if history is any indicator. 

The bill provides that funding in the form of reimbursements to local and state law enforcement whenever Trump travels to his properties, such as Mar-a-Lago in Florida or his Bedminster estate in New Jersey, for example. 

Those local agencies have been reimbursed in the past, but not nearly by the extraordinary amount the new law allocates. In fiscal year 2022, for example, $3 million was given to local law enforcement to reimburse expenses they incurred for protecting former President Joe Biden.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The funds are being provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Notably, FEMA funds are now being regulated by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, who implemented new “cost-saving” rules requiring that she sign off on any expenditure exceeding $100,000 before it could be allocated. Such rules may have led to a slower response time from the agency during the deadly flooding in Texas earlier this month.

Security for the president, in the form of Secret Service protection, is already funded at a high level. Last year's budget, for example, prioritized $1.2 billion toward the “Protective Operations” division within the agency, which is responsible for keeping presidents, vice presidents and their families protected. That expenditure is close to half the entire Secret Service's budget, and 44 percent of the agency's 8,300 employees work for the division.

Trump has personally profited from Secret Service protection in the past. During his first term as president, he charged the agency $1.4 million for use of his properties and facilities, largely because he traveled to his properties nearly 550 times over the course of his first four years in the White House. 

These costs were often “overcharges,” an assessment from the nonprofit watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) found. 

The Secret Service expenditures amounted to the agency “literally paying Donald Trump for the right to protect him and his family,” CREW staffers wrote in a post on their website about the spending, adding: 

Of course presidents and their families need to be protected. But Trump is ostensibly a billionaire … and these were not personal residences.

Trump basically “line[d] his pockets with taxpayer money via his Secret Service protection,” the group went on.

It's possible that the money allocated to local law agencies could also find its way to Trump's pockets, if they are reimbursed for expenses incurred at his properties.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

“The only conclusion that one can come to is that Israel is doing this deliberately,” says analyst Alex de Waal.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The starvation crisis in Gaza is deepening under Israel's brutal blockade and amid regular massacres of civilians attempting to secure aid at the only officially sanctioned aid sites, run by Israeli troops and American mercenaries. The so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and the onset of famine are the subjects of a new report by analysts Davide Piscitelli and Alex de Waal for the research organization Forensic Architecture on the “architecture of genocidal starvation” in Gaza. “I've been working on this field of famine, food crisis and humanitarian action for more than 40 years, and there is no case, over those four decades, of such minutely engineered, closely monitored, precisely designed mass starvation of a population as is happening in Gaza today,” says de Waal, who is also the author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: In one of the deadliest days yet for aid seekers in Gaza, Israeli forces killed at least 115 people on Sunday, including 92 who were killed while seeking aid. In the deadliest attack, at least 79 people at the Zikim crossing in North Gaza were massacred as they gathered near an aid convoy sent by the U.N. World Food Programme in northern Gaza in the hopes of getting flour. In a statement, the U.N. agency said, quote, “As the convoy approached, the surrounding crowd came under fire from Israeli tanks, snipers and other gunfire,” unquote.

These latest killings come as the starvation crisis in Gaza continues to deepen. UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, has accused Israel of starving civilians, including a million children. The entire population, more than 2 million people, lack access to sufficient food, putting their lives at immediate risk. Health authorities in Gaza say 19 people died of starvation over the last day, including at least one infant. This is the uncle of 3-month-old Yahya Al-Najjar.

ANAN AL-NAJJAR: [translated] He died due to malnutrition and the unavailability of baby formula at the Gaza Strip. We urge the entire world, all Arab countries and everyone with a living consciousness, humanity and dignity, to just stand with the children, just to let baby formula get into the Gaza Strip.

AMY GOODMAN: Since late May, when militarized aid sites run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were established, nearly 900 Palestinians have been killed while attempting to access aid, and more than 5,700 have been injured. This is the brother of Raed Sindy, who was killed by Israeli fire while attempting to access aid yesterday at a site run by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Aid Foundation.

AHMED SINDY: [translated] They go out just trying to stave off their hunger and the hunger of their children, but they come back wrapped in shrouds. We ask God Almighty, and we appeal to the international community, that these death traps be shut down and that humanitarian corridors be opened, out of mercy for our children, our women and our elderly.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined by two guests. In London, Davide Piscitelli is with us, an advanced researcher at Forensic Architecture at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he co-directs Gaza research and is working on a forthcoming report tentatively titled “The Architecture of Genocidal Starvation in Gaza.” And in Somerville, Massachusetts, Alex de Waal is with us, executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine. He's working with Forensic Architecture on their report on starvation in Gaza.

Welcome you both to Democracy Now! Davide Piscitelli, let's begin with you. You are coming out with this final report in the next few weeks, but you felt it was critical to get out something faster than that. Talk about why and what you found.

DAVIDE PISCITELLI: Yeah, thank you.

What we saw yesterday, with over 90 people being killed while seeking aid, is something that we have been seeing daily since the end of May, especially with the introduction of the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aid system and also the dismantling of the U.N. system already in place, forcing civilians waiting aid at the crossing, like yesterday at the Zikim crossing in the north.

In our forthcoming report, we are analyzing how the militarized aid system, the GHF, is replacing the U.N. system in Gaza. The GHF is where we see most of the violence right now, especially in the proximity of the GHF, but also inside the GHF and along the path. And there is a reason for this. The GHF system has only like four stations. As we know, three are in Rafah, south of Gaza. One is in central, close to the Wadi Gaza. And this is only for the population that are in the south. So, the population that are in the north, they are completely cut out of this system. And we are comparing four stations to the 400 sites of the U.N. model.

So, we have been collecting and verifying visual evidence of attacks against civilians and infrastructure, again, both in the proximity of the GHF or inside them. And we also analyze the temporal and spatial architecture of the GHF system, which is a system that is designed to be little. So, what we saw yesterday and the day before and in the past month is just the result of this new, introduced militarized system. I can speak a bit more about the spatial and temporal architecture of the system, if you like.

AMY GOODMAN: Go ahead.

DAVIDE PISCITELLI: So, the GHF system, we are analyzing in two elements. Like, the spatial element, we call it a militarized system, because over the past 21 months we were analyzing satellite images, and we see how — we saw a lot of destruction. As we all know, virtually all Gaza has been destroyed. But in the meantime, there is a military infrastructure that is growing inside Gaza, starting from the margin, especially over the month of April and May 2025. We saw the complete destruction of Rafah and the construction of the corridor, the Morag Corridor. So, between the Morag Corridor and the Philadelphi Corridor, we start to see pop up new military stations. And few days after, we started to see what is today the aid distribution center of the GHF starting to grow out of this infrastructure. So the GHF aid system is an extension of the military infrastructure that Israelis put in place in Gaza.

And then there's a temporal element of it. We analyzed over 160 announcements of the GHF. And by putting them on a timeline, we started to see that, on average, the site is only open for 20 to 23 minutes. And after the 19th of June, the site is only open for 10 minutes. That means that the civilians has only 10 minutes to enter and collect food, when it's possible. Another important date on the time is the time between the announcement and the opening. And this shrank down to 17 minutes. Having only 17 minutes means two things: one, that Palestinians cannot access to the site, because they have to walk between 2.5 to 10 kilometers, by walk, under hot temperature, hot surfaces like sand and between rubble, but also it means that it forces further displacement towards the south. And we are seeing from satellite images that new tents are getting closer and closer to the GHF, but the GHF stations are inside the military zone, and this is where the shootings are happening right now.

AMY GOODMAN: Alex de Waal, I'd like to bring you into this conversation. You're executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine. You're working with Forensic Architecture on their report. We have just heard that in the last day 19 people, including at least one infant, have died of starvation in Gaza. Can you talk about why this is happening?

ALEX DE WAAL: So, let me say that I've been working on this field of famine, food crisis and humanitarian action for more than 40 years, and there is no case, over those four decades, of such minutely engineered, closely monitored, precisely designed mass starvation of a population as is happening in Gaza today.

So, we have known, from expert reports by the United Nations, by the independent Famine Review Committee, by many others, exactly how this situation would unfold. And in May, there were some authoritative reports that indicated two trajectories that starvation might take in Gaza. There was then a complete siege. And if that siege were to be continued, Gaza would completely run out of food within weeks. And it takes about 60 to 80 days for an adult to die of starvation. It's entirely predictable, foreseeable. A child will die much more quickly, and particularly a young child without infant formula, without clean water, without maternal care, etc. We knew this was going to happen.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has “humanitarian” in the name, but it is not anything that a humanitarian professional would ever design. There are decades of experience of how you design these operations to work in war zones, and the U.N. had had a system, 400 feeding stations, as Davide mentioned, all embedded within the community, so that you could use the support of the community, of families, to make sure there was minimal disruption. It wasn't enough, but it was still something.

Now what is happening with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is that not enough food is being provided. It's simply the rations are not enough. The essential food that children need is not there. The essential services, like clean water, like sanitation, like shelter, like fuel for cooking, none of those are there. And then, as this report documents, the only way in which people can get access to those centers is by putting themselves in harm's way, by risking death by shooting, in order to get — to try and get food to feed their children.

So, it is entirely unsurprising, exactly as was predicted. And the only surmise that one — the only conclusion that one can come to is that Israel is doing this deliberately. They know exactly what they are doing, and this is intended.

AMY GOODMAN: Alex, you've referred to the ICJ — that's the International Court of Justice — provisional order, more than a year ago, in March of 2024, that instructed Israel to provide a full spectrum of humanitarian relief and essential services through the U.N. Even the Israeli judge voted for it on the panel. It was unanimous. What happened as a result?

ALEX DE WAAL: So, that was a very, very important decision. It was an instruction, an order by the highest court in the world, the World Court, if you like, to Israel. And it had that humanitarian provision. It also had a vote of 16 to 1 to say that this was a requirement, if Israel were to fulfill its obligations to prevent genocide. Now, that is very important. The Genocide Convention is not a convention just for punishing genocide. It's a convention for preventing it. So, by definition, you can't wait until after a genocide has happened or after a famine has happened. We shouldn't wait and then count the graves of the children who have died, and then say, “Wasn't that terrible? Never again.” When we have an authoritative warning, we need to act — and not just Israel. All states that are signatory to the Genocide Convention — the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom — everyone is required to act to prevent genocide.

And that decision, that instruction, that order by the International Court of Justice — and, as you say, the Israeli former chair of the high court, Aharon Barak, voted for it — was the most authoritative order that one can have. And it has not been acted upon. And what is happening today with this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is an utter travesty of that. And I think we can all draw the logical conclusion from this shameful failure to prevent an utterly foreseeable disaster and crime.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, and we'll link to your reports, your preliminary findings at democracynow.org, and also, again, Alex, your London Review of Books article that we interviewed you for in May, called “Starvation in Gaza.” Alex de Waal, executive director of World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine, he's working with Forensic Architecture on their forthcoming report on starvation in Gaza, and Davide Piscitelli, speaking to you in London, advanced researcher for Forensic Architecture.

When we come back, we'll look at a new 972 report on Israeli soldiers saying they're dropping grenades from drones in Gaza “like a video game,” that the goal is for Palestinians to “learn through blood.” We'll speak with Meron Rapoport, editor at Local Call, columnist with 972 Magazine. Stay with us.

Henry Kissinger once compared himself to the lone cowboy who rode into town to sort out the bad guys. But the U.S. secretary of state, who also served as national security adviser, knew different when it came to dealing with major powers. His hero was the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich, who somehow brought together the unlikely combination of Austria, the United Kingdom, Prussia, Russia, and a number of even smaller allies and their incompatible leaders into the alliance that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. As Kissinger understood, even lone rangers need friends.

It is an insight that appears to be lost on U.S. President Donald Trump. Since returning to office in January, Trump has called the United States' closest allies cheaters and freeloaders. Japan and other Asian trading partners, he insists, are “very spoiled”; immediate North American neighbors stand accused of exporting drugs and criminals. He freely and publicly labels the leaders of some of the United States' most important democratic partners as has-beens, weak, or dishonest, while heaping praise on autocrats he finds easier to deal with, such as Hungarian President Viktor Orban (“a very great leader”), Salvadoran strongman Nayib Bukele (“a great friend”), North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un (“a smart guy”), and—at least until very recently—Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he has called “a genius” and “very savvy” in attacking Ukraine. In what would have been unthinkable in previous administrations, including Trump's first, the United States in February even sided against its own democratic allies and with Russia and other authoritarian states, such as North Korea and Belarus, in voting against a UN resolution that condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine and upheld the latter's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Perhaps most baffling, at a time when Washington is trying to contain China and shore up U.S. defenses in the Indo-Pacific, the administration is preparing punitive tariffs on South Korea and Japan, the United States' closest Asian allies, as well as on a sweeping list of European partners it is trying to keep away from Beijing. U.S. allies around the world are also rattled by the public musings of Trump and members of his cabinet that the so-called nuclear umbrella under which the American nuclear deterrent was a guarantee for their defense is no longer a sure thing. Such is now the level of doubt that in July, France and the United Kingdom announced a new agreement to begin providing extended nuclear deterrence in Europe for themselves, and allies such as South Korea, Poland, and even Japan have begun to contemplate acquiring their own nuclear weapons.

The past offers plenty of examples of world powers falling out with erstwhile alliance partners or seeking new ones. But it's hard to think of a case in which the leader of a major alliance has so casually and brutally cast aside allies that, for the most part, have been dependable and have accepted its writ. If the United States wants Canadian or Greenlandic resources, those have always been available. Threatening annexation is counterproductive, stirring up anti-Americanism as it has already done. Washington's NATO allies, it is true, have not been spending enough on defense but that is partly because the United States has insisted for decades on having the dominant role. And when pressed, as at the most recent NATO summit in June, members of the transatlantic alliance have increased their defense budgets, or pledged to do so, to levels that could not have been imagined only a few years ago.

It is difficult to find a plausible explanation for the policies of the second Trump administration. If the president is impatient with existing alliances, he has offered few alternatives beyond an apparent attachment to the old concept of spheres of influence, in which a handful of powers dominate their immediate neighbors, and multilateral organizations, if they survive at all, have little power or authority. Such a world offers greater threats in the future to the United States as the other spheres—presumably including a Chinese-dominated Asia and perhaps a Russian zone in eastern Europe and Central Asia—jostle against it and smaller powers within each sphere either accept their fate often resentfully or look for new hegemons. 

By trashing alliances that have served it well, the United States risks a general breakdown of stability and order that will, in the long run, prove highly costly, whether in military expenditure or unending trade wars, as each great power seeks advantage where their zones of interest meet. The striking lack of historical precedents for such behavior does not suggest a clever Machiavellian policy to enhance American power; rather, it shows a United States acting against its own interests in bewildering fashion, undermining one of the key sources of that power. And this comes at a time when American global leadership and economic and technological dominance are already under growing pressure from China and other major rivals.

For centuries, the value of alliances, even among highly disparate countries, has been accepted as a key element of international relations. As far back as history has been recorded, groups, whether clans or nations, have come together for protection against common enemies. In the fifth century BC, the Delian League of Greek city-states defeated the Persian Empire; in 1815, the Grand Alliance of Austria, the United Kingdom, Prussia, and Russia joined forces to vanquish Napoleon's France. Common cause can bring together the most unlikely partners, such as Catholic France and the Muslim Ottoman Empire, which joined forces in the sixteenth century and remained allies for more than two centuries, or Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union with the United Kingdom and the United States, which together defeated Germany and Japan and the other Axis powers in World War II.

Before the world became so interconnected and communication was more difficult, geography allowed some states to live without allies. Japan was able to remain in lonely isolation for two and a half centuries until it was confronted with a different and more expansive world when the U.S. naval officer Commodore Matthew Perry came calling in 1853. The United States, protected as it once was by two oceans and with no powerful enemies along its land borders, prided itself for much of its history on avoiding alliances. Even when it belatedly entered World War I on the Allied side, President Woodrow Wilson insisted that the United States was an “associated power” rather than an ally. Only after 1945 did it abandon this suspicion of alliances. Facing a hostile Soviet Union and communist China, the Soviets' then close partner, it entered peacetime defensive alliances, foremost among them NATO, for the first time in its history. As we see today, the isolationist strand in American foreign policy never entirely went away.



As the Truman administration learned 80 years ago, even powerful states need allies, partly for reasons of prestige but also because great power has its limits and is costly to maintain. By the late nineteenth century, the British Empire, the biggest the world had ever seen, was experiencing what the historian Paul Kennedy called “imperial overstretch” as it confronted both old rivals, such as France and Russia, and newer ones such as Germany, Japan, and the United States. The British economy was still powerful and its navy ruled the oceans, but others were catching up. The British Treasury and the British taxpayer grumbled at the expense of maintaining dominance.

How widely the United Kingdom had come to be resented was made clear when it struggled to crush the two tiny Afrikaner republics (the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State) in the South African War of 1899–1902. The early Afrikaner victories not only showed the inadequacies of the British Army but were generally welcomed around the world. The brutal treatment of Afrikaner civilians further undermined the reputation of the British Empire. At the Paris Exposition in 1900, admiring crowds piled flowers at the Transvaal Pavilion. The realization of how much they were loathed shocked the British into seeing that even they needed friends. In short order, the British government reached understandings with its rivals France, Japan, and Russia, which lessened the chance of conflict with each and encouraged cooperation, and so mitigated the overstretch. The United Kingdom, in the eyes of its contemporaries, remained the world's dominant power, arguably until the middle of World War II.

As the British experience demonstrates, global power cannot be measured in military resources alone. It is relatively easy to count guns, ships, aircraft, economic output, or scientific and technological strengths, but it is not so easy to gauge competencies, organizational capacity, effective government, or morale. Russia looked strong before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and for China, Iran, and North Korea, a desirable ally. Today, after three and a half years of unsuccessful war and heavy losses, Russia may be more of a liability. A state has to have credibility in the eyes of others, whether allies or enemies or its own people. When Soviet Russia in the 1980s and then the United States in the first decades of this century failed in Afghanistan in spite of their overwhelming military advantage, those failures dismayed their own allies, pushed away the uncommitted, and shook the faith of their own peoples in their governments while encouraging potential enemies. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, which was made possible by Russia's military defeats, should have warned the Soviet regime itself of the consequences of failure—and should be a warning to Putin today.

Nor is power a constant. Despite being on the winning side in both world wars, the United Kingdom found its resources depleted and its empire melting away. Is the United States as powerful as it once was? It has had failures abroad, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, is increasingly divided at home, and has an exploding national debt and waning investment in crucial infrastructure. And in an age of increasingly fast and long-range missiles, geography no longer provides the barrier to adversaries that it once did. All the more reason to nurture alliances with sympathetic powers rather than spurn them. Canada has never been a threat to the United States, except in hockey, and Canadians have long seen Americans as their close relatives. The border between the two countries is the longest undefended one in the world. The two economies are closely intertwined. 

Yet what Trump has done with his talk of the 51st state, his imposition of punitive tariffs, and his threats that the United States will not defend Canada under the proposed Golden Dome missile defense system unless it pays up (and he keeps raising the putative bill), has enraged a normally mild-mannered people. In Ottawa, the mood is one of shock and disbelief. What had seemed the unquestionable bases of Canadian foreign policy are melting like the glaciers in Greenland. What is being destroyed will not be easily mended, certainly not for a generation. And for what?

Like many other human relationships, alliances are hard work: their management requires patience, forbearance, skill, and, like a garden, repeated tending. The stakes are often high, and the character of the leaders and diplomats involved can be critical. Diplomacy is not about going to cocktail parties, although socializing is part of it. Rather, it is gaining insight into other nations and their leaders and learning how to negotiate with them. Publicly chastising allies on their supposed faults, as Vice President JD Vance did with the Europeans at the Munich Security Conference in February, barking out orders and insults on social media, as the president does almost daily, or publicly releasing letters to other heads of state before they have been delivered to the recipients, only stores up resentments and makes future personal relations more difficult.

If Kissinger had not been able to establish a rapport of mutual respect with his Chinese counterpart, Zhou Enlai, the opening of relations between the United States and China during the Nixon administration might have been delayed for years. The case of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt is perhaps even more telling. From the time that war broke out in Europe in 1939, Churchill worked on, as he put it, wooing Roosevelt like a suitor. He knew that, to prevail, the United Kingdom needed American resources, such as guns and money, and eventually, he fervently hoped, American forces. And for his part, Roosevelt did not want the British to fail. Although he was at first constrained by the American public, which resisted entering the war, he stretched the powers of the presidency to provide as much assistance as he could.

As World War II unfolded, the two leaders traveled thousands of miles by ship and plane to meet each other and Stalin, often at risk to their health and their lives. Without the strong personal relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt, the irritations and cross-purposes that exist in any alliance would have greatly hampered joint strategic planning and vital U.S. military aid under the Lend-Lease Act. The partnership between their two countries was amplified and strengthened by the thousands of experts, administrators, publicists, intellectuals, and serving military who learned, not always easily, to work with one another. 



Consider the deep and rare friendship that John Dill, the United Kingdom's senior military representative in Washington, established with the reserved George Marshall, chief of staff of the U.S. Army and Roosevelt's most important military adviser. Together, the two generals were able to reconcile what were often deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions among their colleagues and between their political masters. Although Churchill and his successors exaggerated just how special the postwar “special relationship” was, it served both the United States and the United Kingdom well from the Berlin airlift at the start of the Cold War to the fall of the Berlin Wall at its end.

Alliances are also unlikely to last beyond their immediate purpose. Churchill and Roosevelt were far less successful in their effort to build a more lasting friendship with Stalin and his Soviet Union. The gulf between the democracies and the Soviet dictatorship was too great: Soviet memories of Allied intervention against the Bolsheviks at the end of World War I, the strained relations of the interwar years, and the deep suspicions, partly born out of Russian history and partly out of Marxist assumptions about the coming final battle between capitalism and socialism, made ordinary relations almost impossible. The need to defeat Nazi Germany and Japan's military dictatorship was the main glue that held the Grand Alliance together, and when that vanished, so did the relationship. That had happened repeatedly throughout history, whether in the collapse of the Delian League once Persia had been defeated or the Balkan States waging war on one another in 1913 once they had together defeated the Ottoman Empire.

While they are impossible to measure, emotions such as liking or hatred, admiration or contempt—the quotidian stuff of human relations—play a crucial part in making and unmaking alliances. Personal friendships and mutual respect and trust are the oil in the complicated machinery that helps them last. On repeated occasions since 1945, British and American leaders—Harold Macmillan and John F. Kennedy, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Tony Blair among them—have had good relations that have helped reinforce the partnership between their countries. In the absence of such chemistry, or at least some measure of trust between leaders, however, relations can deteriorate surprisingly quickly, as the world is witnessing again today._Alexander I of Russia chafed under Napoleon's patronage and gradually drifted toward his enemies. Mao Zedong and his colleagues increasingly resented Soviet assumptions of superiority and leadership of the world communist movement, while Stalin's successor Nikita Khrushchev found the Chinese devious and untrustworthy—contributing to the very public and bitter Sino-Soviet split after 1962.

Since 1945, dozens of countries in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East have depended on their security relationships with Washington. This includes the 31 other members of NATO; Asian countries with formal U.S. military alliances, such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea; and those with less formal but far-reaching U.S. military partnerships, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. And then there are those countries around the world such as Chile and Vietnam that have tended to work with the United States on a friendly basis. This impressive variety of countries has welcomed U.S. protection and leadership over the decades since the end of World War II not just because the American superpower was strong but because it represented hope for a better and fairer world.

Yet there is now the real possibility that the Western alliance is joining the list of ones that failed. Trump has always been uncomfortable with the give and take of alliance politics. This may be in part because of his own experience in business where he was usually the unchallenged boss. He ran his companies with small offices, unlike the big corporations with their structures and outside boards. In his show The Apprentice, his notorious line was, “You're fired!”

In his first term, Trump seemed especially uneasy at multilateral meetings where he had to deal with other leaders as equals, such as the G-7 meeting in Canada in 2018 where he arrived late and left early but not before quarreling with the other leaders over their trade policies and tariffs. He further shocked allies when he unilaterally pulled out of important and painstakingly negotiated agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to limit Iran's capacity to develop nuclear weapons (an agreement that bears a distinct resemblance to the one the second Trump administration offered Iran, at least until it was drawn into bombing Iranian nuclear sites in June). Striking a note that became the leitmotif of his second term, he complained, “We're like the piggy bank that everybody's robbing.”



Today, Trump is freer to act on his impulses because those established and respected advisers who stood up to him in his first term have been replaced by courtiers and sycophants. From time to time, Trump still has to deal with other democratic powers or even multilateral organizations, and he has made clear his impatience with them. With few exceptions, the Oval Office has become the stage set for a demonstration of Trump's dominance, and when he makes an appearance at international meetings, he keeps it as brief as possible. And the gratuitous insults—to NATO allies, the European Union, the BRICs, the United Nations, or the World Health Organization—continue to flow from the president. It is hard to make out an overall purpose beyond keeping him the center of attention.

Trump prefers to treat international relations as a series of transactions, holding face-to-face meetings or long phone calls with only one other leader at a time, and seems distinctly more at ease with powerful autocrats than democratic statesmen. If necessary, he will bludgeon both friends and adversaries into submission, assuming they will abandon any opposition if the offer on the table is good enough or if Washington seems to hold the best hand. (“You don't have the cards right now,” he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the now infamous Oval Office dressing down.) 

If only it were so simple. Nations do not always act on what others assume are their best interests. Hitler thought in 1940 that the United Kingdom had little choice but to capitulate just as Putin believed that Ukraine would give up in a matter of days in the face of the Russian invasion. As Roosevelt had come to realize by the time he died in the spring of 1945, leaders can define interests in different ways. Beliefs and cultural and personal differences can matter as much as more objective factors such as demographics or geography. Stalin came out of a very different world and had very different experiences and goals than did the privileged son of an old American family.

In Trump's world, mutual trust and respect, so hard to establish and so easy to destroy, do not matter. Parties will work together if it suits their interests and only until a better offer comes along. Russia sees the advantages of friendship from the United States. European allies will grumble but do what Washington wants or find themselves alone and friendless. China will negotiate on trade, promising for example to buy American agricultural products because it does not want to be shut out of U.S. markets. And if Beijing wants Taiwan, why not let it have it as long as the United States gets something in return? The president seems to assume that current and potential allies see international relations as he does. If you lose one round you may win the next. Yet nations, like individuals, have long memories of past wrongs or defeats, as Trump himself should know.

Trust among individuals or nations is hard to measure, but lasting and productive relations cannot exist without it. During the Cold War, negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States over arms control were tortuous and drawn out because neither side trusted the other. Incidents such as the American pilot Gary Powers's intercepted U-2 flight over the Soviet Union in 1960 or the Soviet shooting down of the Korean airliner in 1983 tended to be read by the other side as evidence of malign intent. By contrast, although there were certainly tensions between the United States and its allies, each generally assumed their counterparts were acting in good faith, and there was a willingness to discuss tricky matters and search for mutually acceptable solutions. That no longer exists today and cannot be easily or quickly rebuilt.



The United States is now experiencing what the United Kingdom did even in the heyday of its empire. Being the world's greatest military power is a heavy burden, and partly as a result, the U.S. debt continues to grow to staggering levels. Ambitious powers, China in particular, are pouring resources into an arms race that gets ever more expensive. And, as has happened many times before, other nations are tempted to abandon the old power for the new or group against it to take advantage of what they see as its decline. If Trump's current hostility to alliances continues and the administration keeps insulting, belittling, and even economically harming its long-standing partners, the United States is going to find the world an increasingly unfriendly place.

Former allies or uncommitted powers may decide, as the Slovak Republic or Serbia have already done, that Putin's Russia is a better bet; others may bypass the United States with new trade arrangements or, as is happening with European nations and Canada, sharing in their own military production, planning, and mutual deterrence, on the assumption that the United States is no longer a dependable ally. In a harbinger of things to come, Canada has just shipped its first container of liquefied natural gas to Asia. The British once called their position in the world “splendid isolation” until they realized the costs were too high. Trump's United States may find that, in the dangerous twenty-first century, those splendors are overrated.

Follow:


            A group of 287 scientists and current and former NASA employees has issued a declaration lambasting budget cuts, grant cancellations and a “culture of organizational silence” that they say could pose a risk to astronauts' safety.
    


            The document — titled “The Voyager Declaration” and dedicated to astronauts who lost their lives in tragic spaceflight incidents of the past — is addressed to acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy, a staunch Trump loyalist who abruptly replaced Janet Petro, a longtime NASA employee, in the agency's top role on July 9. The letter has 156 anonymous signatories and 131 public signatures — including at least 55 current employees.
    


            “Major programmatic shifts at NASA must be implemented strategically so that risks are managed carefully,” states the letter to Duffy, a former member of Congress, prosecutor and reality TV personality who also currently serves as Transportation secretary. “Instead, the last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA's workforce.”
    


            The letter raises concerns about suggested changes to NASA's Technical Authority, a system of safety checks and balances at the agency.
    


            Established in the wake of the 2003 Columbia shuttle disaster that killed seven astronauts, the Technical Authority aims to ensure mission safety by allowing NASA employees at all levels of the agency to voice safety concerns to leaders outside their direct chain of command.
    


            “If you have a significant disagreement with a technical decision that's being made, (the system) gives someone an alternate avenue that's not their project manager or program manager” to express that concern, a source at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, told CNN.
    


            Changes to that system “should be made only in the interests of improving safety, not in anticipation of future budget cuts,” the declaration reads.
    


            The source said that they considered looming changes “a really scary prospect, especially for my colleagues who work directly on the human spaceflight side of things.”
    


            The letter comes as the agency is grappling with the impending loss of thousands of employees and broader restructuring.
    


            In a statement, current NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens responded to the Voyager Declaration. “NASA will never compromise on safety. Any reduction — including our current voluntary reduction — will be designed to protect safety-critical roles,” she said.
    


            “Despite the claims posted on a website that advances radical, discriminatory DEI principles, the reality is that President Trump has proposed billions of dollars for NASA science, demonstrating an ongoing commitment to communicating our scientific achievements,” Stevens added in the statement. “To ensure NASA delivers for the American people, we are continually evaluating mission lifecycles, not on sustaining outdated or lower-priority missions.”
    


            The signed letter is the most recent in a string of declarations rebuking proposed cuts and changes at other federal agencies.
    


            Some National Institutes of Health employees led the way in June, publishing a declaration opposing what they called the politicization of research.
    


            Another letter, signed by federal workers at the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month, resulted in about 140 people being placed on administrative leave. At least some of those workers will remain on leave until at least August 1, “pending the Agency's inquiry,” according to internal email correspondence obtained by CNN.
    


            One signatory of the NASA letter who spoke to CNN said they felt that expressing dissent against the Trump administration may pose a risk to their livelihoods, but they believed the stakes were too high to remain silent.
    


            Ella Kaplan, a contractor employed by Global Science and Technology Inc. and the website administrator for the NASA Scientific Visualization Studio, said she decided to publicly attach her name to the Voyager Declaration because “the overall culture at NASA has very much shifted — and it feels a lot less safe for me.”
    


            “That's been felt kind of universally by most minority employees at NASA,” Kaplan said.
    


            While Kaplan said her job has not yet been directly threatened, in her view, “I'm a member of the LGBT community … and I'm probably going to be fired for this at some point, so I might as well do as much community organizing as possible before that point.”
    


            The letter and its signatories implore Duffy to evaluate recent policies they say “have or threaten to waste public resources, compromise human safety, weaken national security, and undermine the core NASA mission.”
    


            The declaration's criticism of changes to NASA's Technical Authority stem from statements made at an agency town hall in June. During that meeting, NASA executives said they planned to attempt to make the Technical Authority more “efficient.”
    


            “We're looking at: ‘How do we do programs and projects more efficiently? And how much should we be spending on oversight?'” said Vanessa Wyche, NASA's acting associate administrator.
    


            Garrett Reisman — a former NASA astronaut and engineer who later served as a SpaceX advisor — told CNN that he believes implementing some changes to the Technical Authority may be welcome. He noted that NASA may have become too risk averse in the wake of the Columbia tragedy, and the current structure may be hampering innovation.
    


            But, Reisman said, any changes to the space agency's safety backstops need to be made with extreme care. And currently, he said, he does not trust that will happen.
    


            “I have very little confidence that it will be done the right way,” Reisman, who signed the declaration, said. “So far, this administration has used a very heavy hand with their attempts to remove bureaucracy — and what they've ended up doing is not making things more efficient, but just eliminating things.”
    


            The signatories who spoke to CNN each expressed opposition to President Donald Trump's directives to shutter Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility — or DEIA — initiatives.
    


            At NASA, leadership complied with Trump's executive order by shuttering a DEIA-focused branch, scrubbing pronouns from email signatures, and removing references to a pledge made during the president's previous term to land a woman and person of color on the moon for the first time. The space agency also shuttered employee groups that lent support to minority workers.
    


            The source who spoke with CNN anonymously said that DEIA policies not only ensure a welcoming work environment — they're also essential to practicing sound science.
    


            “The concept of inclusivity being a pathway to better science is something that has become really entrenched in the overall academic and scientific community in the last decade or so,” the source said, adding that the changes “set an immediate tone for the destruction that was going to come.”
    


            Among the other policies that the letter decries is the Trump administration's call for NASA to shutter some projects that have Congressional backing — a move the signatories say is wasteful and “represents a permanent loss of capability to the United States both in space and on Earth.”
    


            The NASA employee told CNN that leadership has already begun shutting down some facilities that the Trump administration put on the chopping block in its budget proposal, despite the fact that Congress appears poised to continue funding some of them.
    


            “We've also been hearing repeatedly passed down from every level of management: No one is coming to save you; Congress is not coming to save you,” the source said. “But it seems like Congress is moving towards an appropriations that's going to continue to fund our projects at approximately the same level.”
    


            The source noted that they have first-hand knowledge of leadership beginning to decommission a clean room — a facility free of dust and debris where sensitive hardware and science instruments must be prepared for spaceflight — despite the fact that there are ongoing tests happening at the facility.
    


            The Voyager Declaration also criticizes what it refers to as “indiscriminate cuts” planned for the agency.
    


            The White House's proposal to slash NASA's science budget by as much as half has been met with widespread condemnation from stakeholders who say such cuts threaten to cripple US leadership in the field.
    


            Recent agency communication to staff has also noted that at least 3,000 staff members are taking deferred resignation offers, according to an internal memo, the authenticity of which was confirmed to CNN by two sources who had seen the communication.
    


            Broader workforce cuts could also be on the horizon. NASA leadership under Petro also worked on an agency restructuring plan, though the details of that initiative have not yet been made public.
    


            Other Trump-era changes denounced in the Voyager Declaration include directives to cancel contracts and grants that affect private-sector workers across the country and plans to pull the space agency out of some projects with international partners. The White House budget proposal calls for defunding dozens of projects, including the Lunar Gateway space station that the US would have worked on with space agencies in Canada, Europe, Japan and the United Arab Emirates.
    


            The letter and its signatories argue these policies are wasteful, squandering investments that have been years or decades in the making.
    


            “American taxpayers have invested a lot of money in my education and training directly,” the Goddard source said. “I'm in it for the public service — and I want to return that investment to them.”

            Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blamed New York officials and “sanctuary city policies” for the shooting of an off-duty US Customs and Border Protection officer in an apparent robbery gone wrong over the weekend.
    


            The 42-year-old officer is in stable condition and expected to survive, officials said Monday. There is no indication that he was targeted because of his employment, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Sunday.
    


            The officer, who was not in uniform, was sitting with a woman in Riverside Park, beneath the George Washington Bridge, when two men approached on a moped just before midnight. The passenger got off and approached the officer, who realized he was being robbed and drew his service weapon, Tisch said.
    


            The two exchanged gunfire and the off-duty officer was shot in the face and arm. The perpetrator was injured before he and the moped driver rode off, police said.
    


            A person of interest, identified as Miguel Mora, a 21-year-old undocumented immigrant with an extensive criminal past, was taken into custody after arriving at a Bronx hospital with gunshot wounds to the groin and leg, Tisch said.
    


            The police commissioner said Mora's injuries were consistent with what was seen on surveillance video of the shooting shared by the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            It is unclear whether Mora has an attorney.
    


            After a search, Mora's alleged accomplice, who is also undocumented, was arrested Monday, Noem said. That person also has a history of criminal activity, Tisch announced Monday.
    


            Federal charges against both men are expected, officials said. 



            Mora entered the country illegally through Arizona in 2023 and had two prior arrests for domestic violence in New York. He was wanted in New York to face accusations of robbery and felony assault, and in Massachusetts over a stolen weapons case, Tisch said.
    


            Mora's criminal history includes charges for assault on a pregnant woman and a stabbing charge in January, two senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told CNN. Mora was wanted for robbing a pawn shop in Massachusetts where guns were stolen, and authorities are looking into whether the semi-automatic weapon used in the attack over the weekend is from the pawn shop, the officials said.
    


            Noem blamed “sanctuary city policies” for the shooting, citing a list of previous arrests and warrants against Mora. 



            “He was arrested four different times in New York City, and because of the mayor's policies and sanctuary city policies, was released back to do harm to people and to individuals living in this city,” she said.
    


            Noem called on leaders of sanctuary cities nationwide to change their policies. When asked what policies would have prevented the shooting, Noem did not provide specifics.
    


            “This individual should have been deported and never been in this country,” she said.
    


            President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, echoed Noem's statements.
    


            “Sanctuary cities are sanctuaries for criminals,” Homan said Monday. “Full stop.”
    


            At a separate news conference Monday, New York Mayor Eric Adams said he is not responsible for the “revolving-door criminal justice system” that kept Mora on the streets.
    


            “I just carry out the rules,” Adams said.
    


            Adams said he would welcome more federal agents being deployed to his city, as long as they are focused on dangerous individuals and not “everyday individuals who are trying to complete the path to be a citizen.”
    


            The mayor previously said he visited the wounded officer Sunday in the hospital, where he was recovering with family members by his side who thanked the city for its response.
    


            “I am extremely angry that we have a customs border patrol officer that is in the hospital because that person should have not been on our streets,” Adams said Monday.
    


            The officer suffered a broken jaw and a bullet is lodged in his throat, but he is alert and has been communicating through hand gestures, senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told CNN.
    


            The officer is expected to make a speedy recovery, Customs and Border Protection Director of Field Operations Frank Russo said.
    


            “Our officer is a hero. He did exactly what we ask of all of our officers under the circumstances. He executed our mission, which is to protect the country, and he did it by stopping a threat,” Russo said Sunday. “If not for his efforts, this person of interest would have committed more armed robberies.”
    


            In a social media post Sunday afternoon, Trump seized on the shooting as evidence of Democrats' failures to secure the border.
    


            “The CBP Officer bravely fought off his attacker, despite his wounds, demonstrating enormous Skill and Courage,” Trump added.
    


            The shooting comes as federal officials warn of a surge of attacks on agents carrying out Trump's mass deportation agenda.
    


            As enforcement efforts have ramped up in recent months, many officers have chosen to cover their faces with the goal of avoiding harassment in public and online.
    


            On Sunday, the acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, said he would allow agents to continue covering their faces as a safety measure.
    


            “If that's a tool that the men and women of ICE (use) that keeps themselves and their families safe, then I will allow it,” Lyons said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Inside Idaho's only maximum security prison where Bryan Kohberger may spend the rest of his life","https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/us/bryan-kohberger-idaho-prison","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            Idaho's only maximum security prison could soon be home to Bryan Kohberger, the man who admitted to the 2022 gruesome killings of four University of Idaho students in a remarkable change-of-plea hearing earlier this month.
    


            The Idaho Maximum Security Institution, opened in 1989 to confine the state's “most disruptive male residents,” has garnered nationwide attention following an aborted execution due to a botched lethal injection and a prisoner-led hunger strike demanding better conditions.
    


            Kohberger, a 30-year-old former former PhD student of criminology, admitted guilt for the first time on July 2 to charges of burglary and first-degree murder in the fatal stabbings of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen in their off-campus Moscow, Idaho, home.
    


            The case reached a bitter resolution after two and a half years of desperately searching for answers when Kohberger, seated behind a table in an off-white button-up shirt and patterned tie, responded to questions from State District Judge Steven Hippler with a series of simple yeses and a neutral gaze, admitting in one-word answers that he planned and carried out the brutal stabbings.
    


            While the plea will allow Kohberger to avoid the death penalty, he could still be in close proximity to the state's eight male death row prisoners who are also housed in the Kuna, Idaho, facility.  Those prisoners include Chad Daybell, who was convicted in the 2019 killings of his first wife and two of his second wife's children.
    


            Kohberger is expected to return to court in Boise later this week for his sentencing, and could be transferred just over 10 miles down the road to the state's maximum security prison right after.
    


            Here's a look at what life inside the Idaho Maximum Security Institution could like:
    


            The male-only facility, located just south of Boise, is surrounded by a double perimeter fence reinforced with razor wire and equipped with an electronic detection system, according to its website.
    


            It has the capacity to house 549 people, and has a unit for civilly committed psychiatric patients, which has faced backlash from the National Alliance on Mental Illness for using a prison to house people with mental illnesses in need of mental health treatment. The alliance faulted the facility for allegedly denying patients access to prison programs and services typically available to incarcerated individuals.
    


            The prison has also garnered criticism for its harsh treatment of inmates in solitary confinement and for its poor conditions, driving prisoners to organize a mass six-day hunger strike last year in protest of the facility, the Idaho Statesman reported.
    


            Among the ninety inmates who participated in the strike, some complained about delays in access to medical care, long bouts of isolation and recreational “cages,” the newspaper reported. The “cages” were described as “large chain link-like metal boxes each man is placed into, littered with human urine and feces that have soaked into the concrete.”
    


            Men housed in a lower-security section within the maximum-security prison,﻿ who are allowed access to an open outdoor recreation area, told the Statesman the space is often littered with trash and bodily fluids, and others said the facility's HVAC system hasn't been cleaned in decades because the vents are clogged with garbage, urine and feces.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Idaho Department of Correction for comment about the prison's conditions.
    


            The prison's strict solitary confinement policies have also sparked concern.
    


            Kevin Kempf, who served as director of the Idaho Department of Correction in 2016, told CNN affiliate KBOI at the time that inmates were confined alone for up to 23 hours a day with little human interaction, received meals in their cells, and were allowed showers only three times a week.
    


            The Idaho Department of Correction implemented a step-down program that gradually transitions inmates from solitary confinement to a more open environment, KBOI reported. This program includes stages such as placing prisoners in cells where they can talk and interact with others, helping them adjust slowly and safely.
    


            The prison has recently come under scrutiny because it's equipped with the state's execution chamber, which was the site of an aborted execution last year.
    


            After Idaho struggled for years to obtain pentobarbital, a single-drug protocol to execute death row inmates, the state's first attempt to use the lethal injection in 12 years failed. In February 2024, officials were unable to set an IV line on Thomas Creech﻿, forcing them to abort the execution.
    


            Creech, the longest-serving inmate on Idaho's death row, was sentenced to death after pleading guilty to the murder of another inmate, David Dale Jensen, in 1981, while Creech was serving four life sentences, according to the Ada County Prosecutor's Office. His second execution was postponed when a federal judge issued a stay in November.
    


            Now, the state is making the firing squad its lead method of execution. Idaho Republican Gov. Brad Little signed into law a bill in March, making his state the only one in the country with the firing squad as its primary execution method beginning July 1, 2026.

            Idaho lawmakers first passed legislation in 2023 allowing for the firing squad as a means of execution if drugs are unavailable, or lethal injection is found to be unconstitutional.
    


            ﻿All executions and execution-related procedures were suspended until the maximum security prison completes the renovation of the F-Block, the execution chamber, to accommodate both methods – lethal injection and firing squad, the Idaho Department of Correction announced in June. The renovations are expected to take about seven months.
    


            However, executions have been rare in Idaho. Only three executions have taken place in the facility since the state revised its death penalty statute in 1977, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Follow:


            England's Jess Carter says she will step back from social media after the defender said she has received “a lot of racist abuse” since the beginning of the 2025 UEFA Women's Euros.
    


            Carter has started all four matches for England as the team has reached the semifinal stage of the tournament, where the Lionesses are seeking to win their second consecutive European Championship.
    


            “While I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result, I don't agree, or think, it's OK to target someone's appearance or race,” the 27-year-old said in a statement posted across her social media channels. “As a result of this I will be taking a step back from social media and leaving it to a team to deal with.”
    


            Carter added that she is making the decision to protect herself “in a bid to keep my focus on helping the team anyway I can.”
    


            “Hopefully speaking out will make the people writing this abuse think twice so others won't have to deal with it. We have made some historic changes with this Lionesses squad that I am so proud to be a part of and my hope is that by speaking out about this it will make another positive change for all.”
    


CNN Sports has reached out to Meta and X for comment.
    


            The official England women's social media account released a statement in support of Carter, calling the abuse the defender has suffered “online poison.”

            “No one should have to endure such vile abuse, be that in football or any walk of life,” the team said on X. “Representing our country is the greatest honour.
    


            “It is not right that while we are doing that, some of us are treated differently simply because of the colour of our skin.”
    


            The statement added that England players will stand rather than kneel – an act of solidarity against racism and prejudice introduced to soccer following the global outrage over the 2020 murder of George Floyd – ahead of their semifinal clash on Tuesday.
    


            “It is clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism,” it said.
    


            Mark Bullingham, CEO of the English Football Association (FA), said that the group is “working with police to ensure those responsible for this hate crime are brought to justice.”
    


            “Regrettably, this is not the first time this has happened to an England player, so we had measures in place to allow us to respond quickly and where possible provide information to support any potential police action,” Bullingham said.
    


            “We will continue to discuss with the relevant authorities and social media companies about what more can and should be done to prevent this abhorrent abuse.”
    


            UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered his support for Carter, writing on social media: “There is no place for racism in football or anywhere in society.
    


            “I stand with Jess, the Lionesses, and any players who have suffered racism, on and off the pitch,” Starmer said.
    


            Online abuse directed at women's soccer players was a subject discussed ahead of the Women's Euros, with members of the England team saying they would avoid social media during major tournaments due to the abuse they are subjected to.
    


            Carter's England teammate Lotte Wubben-Moy announced on Sunday she would be coming off social media as a result of the persistent abuse.
    


            “Another tournament goes by where we see the same disgusting racist abuse. It is unacceptable for any person to be subject to this or any kind of abuse,” Wubben-Moy said in a post on her Instagram Stories. “The issue goes beyond sport. But what is being done about it? On the very platforms we post on? I will not continue to feed the very ­platform that enables abuse with no consequence.”
    


            Another of Carter's England teammates, defender Lucy Bronze, detailed the anger and sadness the whole squad felt upon hearing about the abuse targeted at Carter and that she hopes by standing before kick-off, rather than kneeling, will show that the players' voices “make a difference.”
    


            Bronze added that the increasing popularity of women's soccer has led to increased abuse.

            “The bigger the game gets, the bigger the noise becomes, the more fans there are, but the more critics there are,” Bronze told reporters. “We're obviously open to critics – that's why we love the sport – but we're not open to abuse.
    


            “Especially in women's football, the online abuse seems to be getting worse and worse. We see it more in the stadiums in men's football and online, but I think with women's football there seems to be a real target online.
    


            “It's something that we're very aware of. There is a way to make a change. There is a solution. I don't have the answer, but I'm sure that there is one.”
    


            Since making her debut for England in 2017, Carter has been an ever-present in subsequent squads and was a part of the team who won the Women's Euros in 2022. She has made 49 appearances for the national side.
    


            England will look to book its second successive Women's Euros final as it plays Italy in the semifinal on Tuesday.

Follow:


Pakistani police have made multiple arrests after a couple were allegedly murdered in broad daylight on the orders of a tribal elder for having an “illicit” relationship, in the latest so-called “honor killing” in the country.
    


            The killings last month in the southwestern Balochistan province, underscores the shocking and persistent nature of such crimes across parts of Central and South Asia, where family and community members believe they can restore “honor” through bloodshed.
    


            At least 11 people have been arrested since video of the incident recently went viral on social media, Balochistan's chief minister Safraz Bugti said.
    


            Graphic video of the killing shows about a dozen men surrounding several vehicles in a desert.
    


            A woman, her head wrapped in a shawl, can be seen slowly walking in front of one of the vehicles as a man follows her, watched by the group.
    


            “You are only allowed to fire at me, nothing else,” she can be heard saying in Brahvi, a local language, before the man raises a pistol and shoots her at close range.
    


            The woman remains standing after two shots, collapsing only after the third, the video shows. The video then captures more gunshots.
    


            Another video shows the bloodied bodies of a man and woman lying side by side.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos. Police told CNN they believe the footage does show the murder under investigation.

            The man and woman were killed because they were allegedly engaged in a relationship considered “illicit” by a local tribal leader, according to a police report seen by CNN.
    


            The leader had allegedly issued a verdict to execute them, the police report said.
    


            Honor killings remain disturbingly common in Pakistan, with hundreds of cases reported each year — though experts believe the real number is much higher due to underreporting.
    


            These murders are typically carried out by family members or village leaders who believe a relative, often a woman, has brought “shame” upon the family, sometimes for reasons as seemingly innocuous as marrying by choice, seeking a divorce, or defying traditional gender roles.
    


            Deeply-rooted patriarchal norms that equate family honor with women's behavior, cultural acceptance, and weak law enforcement, allow perpetrators to act with near impunity.
    


            In recent years, a string of high-profile so-called honor killings have made headlines in Pakistan, drawing national and international condemnation and underscoring the persistence of the practice.
    


            In 2016, social media star Qandeel Baloch was murdered by her brother in a so-called “honor killing.” Baloch gained both fame and notoriety in inherently conservative and patriarchal Pakistan for her bold, sassy and increasingly political social media posts.
    


            Her murder sparked a national outcry and promoted changes in the country's so-called “honor killing” laws. Honor killings now carry a life sentence but the change in legislation has not made the crimes go away.
    


            At least 335 women and 119 men were killed in so-called “honor killings” last year alone, according to data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).
    


            Balochistan's chief minister Bugti called the most recent alleged murder “intolerable” and a “blatant violation of social values and human dignity.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft has issued an emergency fix to close off a vulnerability in Microsoft's widely-used SharePoint software that hackers have exploited to carry out widespread attacks on businesses and at least some U.S. government agencies.

The company issued an alert to customers Saturday saying it was aware of the zero-day exploit being used to conduct attacks and that it was working to patch the issue. Microsoft updated its guidance Sunday with instructions to fix the problem for SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition. Engineers were still working on a fix for the older SharePoint Server 2016 software.

“Anybody who's got a hosted SharePoint server has got a problem,” said Adam Meyers, senior vice president with CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm. “It's a significant vulnerability.”

Companies and government agencies around the world use SharePoint for internal document management, data organization and collaboration.




A zero-day exploit is a cyberattack that takes advantage of a previously unknown security vulnerability. “Zero-day” refers to the fact that the security engineers have had zero days to develop a fix for the vulnerability.

According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the exploit affecting SharePoint is “a variant of the existing vulnerability CVE-2025-49706 and poses a risk to organizations with on-premise SharePoint servers.”

Security researchers warn that the exploit, reportedly known as “ToolShell,” is a serious one and can allow actors to fully access SharePoint file systems, including services connected to SharePoint, such as Teams and OneDrive.

Google's Threat Intelligence Group warned that the vulnerability may allow bad actors to “bypass future patching.”

Eye Security said in its blog post that it scanned over 8,000 SharePoint servers worldwide and discovered that at least dozens of systems were compromised. The cybersecurity company said the attacks likely began on July 18.

Microsoft said the vulnerability affects only on-site SharePoint servers used within businesses or organizations, and does not affect Microsoft's cloud-based SharePoint Online service. 

But Michael Sikorski, CTO and Head of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, warns that the exploit still leaves many potentially exposed to bad actors. 

“While cloud environments remain unaffected, on-prem SharePoint deployments — particularly within government, schools, health care including hospitals, and large enterprise companies — are at immediate risk.”

The vulnerability targets SharePoint server software so customers of that product will want to immediately follow Microsoft's guidance to patch their on-site systems. 

Although the scope of the attack is still being assessed, CISA warned that the impact could be widespread and recommended that any servers impacted by the exploit should be disconnected from the internet until they are patched.

“We are urging organizations who are running on-prem SharePoint to take action immediately and apply all relevant patches now and as they become available, rotate all cryptographic material, and engage professional incident response. An immediate, band-aid fix would be to unplug your Microsoft SharePoint from the internet until a patch is available,” Sikorski advises.

BEIRUT (AP) — A U.S. envoy doubled down on Washington's support for Syria's new government, saying Monday there is “no Plan B” to working with it to unite the country still reeling from years of civil war and wracked by new sectarian violence.

In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Tom Barrack also criticized Israel's recent intervention in Syria, calling it poorly timed and saying it complicated efforts to stabilize the region.

Barrack is ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, with a short-term mandate in Lebanon. He spoke in Beirut following more than a week of clashes in Syria's southern province of Sweida between militias of the Druze religious minority and Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes.

Syrian government forces intervened, ostensibly to restore order, but ended up siding with the Bedouins before withdrawing under a ceasefire agreement with Druze factions. Hundreds have been killed in the fighting, and some government fighters allegedly shot dead Druze civilians and burned and looted homes.

Neighboring Israel intervened last week on behalf of the Druze, who are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military. Israel launched dozens of strikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and struck the Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus.

Over the weekend, Barrack announced a ceasefire between Syria and Israel. Syrian government forces have redeployed in Sweida to halt renewed clashes between the Druze and Bedouins, and civilians from both sides were set to be evacuated Monday.

Barrack told the AP that “the killing, the revenge, the massacres on both sides” are “intolerable,” but that “the current government of Syria, in my opinion, has conducted themselves as best they can as a nascent government with very few resources to address the multiplicity of issues that arise in trying to bring a diverse society together.”

At a press conference later, he said Syrian authorities “need to be held accountable” for violations.

Regarding Israel's strikes on Syria, Barrack said: “The United States was not asked, nor did they participate in that decision, nor was it the United States' responsibility in matters that Israel feels is for its own self-defense.”

However, he said Israel's intervention “creates another very confusing chapter” and “came at a very bad time.”

Prior to the violence in Sweida, Israel and Syria had been in talks over security matters, while the Trump administration had been pushing them to move toward full normalization of diplomatic relations.

When the latest fighting erupted, “Israel's view was that south of Damascus was this questionable zone, so that whatever happened militarily in that zone needed to be agreed upon and discussed with them,” Barrack said. “The new government (in Syria) coming in was not exactly of that belief.”

The ceasefire announced Saturday between Syria and Israel is a limited agreement addressing only the conflict in Sweida, he said. It does not address broader issues including Israel's contention that the area south of Damascus should be a demilitarized zone.

In the discussions leading up to the ceasefire, Barrack said “both sides did the best they can” to reach agreement on specific questions related to the movement of Syrian forces and equipment from Damascus to Sweida.

“Whether you accept that Israel can intervene in a sovereign state is a different question,” he said.

He suggested that Israel would prefer to see Syria fragmented and divided rather than a strong central state in control of the country.

“Strong nation-states are a threat — especially Arab states are viewed as a threat to Israel,” he said. But in Syria, he said, “I think all of the the minority communities are smart enough to say, ‘We're better off together, centralized.'”

Later Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz posted on X that Israel's strikes “were the only way to stop the massacre of the Druze in Syria, who are brothers of our Druze brothers in Israel.”

Katz added: “Whoever criticizes the attacks are not familiar with the facts.” It was not clear if he was responding to Barrack's comments.

The violence in Sweida has deepened the distrust of minority religious and ethnic groups in Syria toward the new government in Damascus, which is led by Sunni Muslim former insurgents who unseated longtime autocratic ruler, Bashar Assad in an offensive in December.

The attacks on Druze civilians followed the deaths of hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, to which Assad belongs, earlier this year in sectarian revenge attacks on the Syrian coast. While interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to protect minorities and punish those who target civilians, many feel his government has not done enough.

At the same time, Damascus has been negotiating with the Kurdish forces that control much of northeast Syria to implement an agreement that would merge the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with the new national army.

Barrack, who spoke to SDF leader Mazloum Abdi over the weekend, said he does not believe the violence in Sweida will derail those talks and that there could be a breakthrough “in the coming weeks.”

Neighboring Turkey, which wants to curtail the influence of Kurdish groups along its border and has tense relations with Israel, has offered to provide defense assistance to Syria.

Barrack said the U.S. has “no position” on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.

“It's not in the U.S.'s business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said.

Barrack's visit to Lebanon came amid domestic and international pressure for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah to give up its remaining arsenal after a bruising war with Israel that ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement in November.

Speaking at a press conference, Barrack said the ceasefire agreement “didn't work.”

Israel has continued to launch near-daily airstrikes in Lebanon that it says are aimed at stopping Hezbollah from rebuilding its capabilities. Hezbollah has said it will not discuss disarming until Israel stops its strikes and withdraws its forces from all of southern Lebanon.

While the U.S. has been pushing for Hezbollah's disarmament, Barrack described the matter as “internal” to Lebanon.

“There's no consequence, there's no threat, there's no whip, we're here on a voluntary basis trying to usher in a solution,” he said. He added that the U.S. “can't compel Israel to do anything” when it comes to the ceasefire.

TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Monday he will stay in office to tackle challenges such as rising prices and high U.S. tariffs after a weekend election defeat left his coalition with a minority in both parliamentary chambers and triggered calls for his resignation.

Ishiba's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito were short three seats to maintain a majority in the 248-seat upper house in Sunday's vote. Though the LDP is still the leading party, its ruling coalition is now a minority in both houses of the Diet, or parliament, which makes it difficult for the coalition to pass any legislation.

The loss of a majority in Sunday's election does not immediately lead to a change of government because the upper house lacks power to file a no-confidence motion against a leader. With opposition too fractured to form a united front powerful enough to topple the ruling coalition, Ishiba is under more pressure to step down from ultraconservative rivals in his own party. 

Ishiba said he takes the result seriously but that his priority is to avoid creating a political vacuum and to tackle impending challenges, including the Aug. 1 deadline for a tariff deal with the U.S.

“While I painfully feel my serious responsibility over the election results, I believe I must also fulfill my responsibility I bear for the country and the people so as not to cause politics to stall or go adrift,” Ishiba said. “Challenges such as global situation and natural disaster won't wait for a better political situation.”

His chief tariff negotiator, Economic Minister Ryosei Akazawa, is heading to Washington for his eighth round of talks. The prime minister hopes to reach a mutually beneficial deal and meet with U.S. President Donald Trump “as soon as possible,” he said.




Sunday's vote comes after Ishiba's coalition lost a majority in the October lower house election, stung by past corruption scandals, and his unpopular government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through parliament. It has been unable to quickly deliver effective measures to mitigate rising prices, including Japan's traditional staple of rice, and dwindling wages.

Trump has added to the pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations and the lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba. 

At a news conference Monday, Ishiba said his LDP and the Komeito have agreed to stick with their coalition while seeking further cooperation from opposition parties. 

Ishiba resisted calls for his resignation and did not say how much longer he planned to stay on. He is sticking around for the country and the people, not for self-interest, “to put the pressing issues on a path to a solution,” he said.

Voters frustrated with price increases exceeding the pace of wage hikes, especially younger people who have long felt ignored by the ruling government's focus on senior voters, rapidly turned to emerging conservative and right-wing populist parties. Established liberal to centrist parties, including the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, gained little ground.

The Democratic Party for the People quadrupled its seats by campaigning for higher take-home pay. The right-wing Sanseito, running on a “Japanese First” platform that puts tougher regulations on foreigners and brakes on gender and sexual diversity, surged to number three in the opposition. 

The LDP has lost support due to the people's discontent over the party's measures for rising prices, foreign residents and other reasons and that he will “quickly analyze the results and learn the lesson,” Ishiba said.

None of the opposition parties said they want to form a full-fledged alliance with the governing coalition but are open to cooperating on policy. CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda told broadcaster NHK that his priority is to form an alliance among the opposition.

“Public opinion clearly said ‘no' to the Ishiba government,” Noda said.

Sanseito leader Sohei Kamiya told NHK late Sunday he is open to cooperating with the ruling bloc on conservative policies. While he said his party did better than expected, he would wait to gain more seats in the other house in the next election and attempt to form a multi-party coalition like in Europe.

The Sanseito party's stance encouraged the spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the campaign and on social media, while also attracting people who are strugging with economic woes and looking for targets to vent their discontent and anxiety, experts say. The language triggered protests from rights activists and alarmed foreign residents.

CLEVELAND (AP) — President Donald Trump is threatening to hold up a new stadium deal for Washington's NFL team if it does not restore its old name of the Redskins, which was considered offensive to Native Americans.

Trump also said Sunday that he wants Cleveland's baseball team to revert to its former name, the Indians, saying there was a “big clamoring for this” as well.

The Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians have had their current names since the 2022 seasons and both have said they have no plans to change them back.

Trump said the Washington football team would be “much more valuable” if it restored its old name. 

“I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original ‘Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, ‘Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,” Trump said on his social media site. 

A new stadium deal for the Commanders in D.C. could face resistance from the White House. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports.

His latest interest in changing the name reflects his broader effort to roll back changes that followed a national debate on cultural sensitivity and racial justice. The team announced it would drop the Redskins name and the Indian head logo in 2020 during a broader reckoning with systemic racism and police brutality.




The Commanders and the District of Columbia government announced a deal earlier this year to build a new home for the football team at the site the old RFK Stadium, the place the franchise called home for more than three decades.

Trump's ability to hold up the deal remains to be seen. President Joe Biden signed a bill in January that transferred the land from the federal government to the District of Columbia. 

The provision was part of a short-term spending bill passed by Congress in December. While D.C. residents elect a mayor, a city council and commissioners to run day-to-day operations, Congress maintains control of the city's budget.

Josh Harris, whose group bought the Commanders from former owner Dan Snyder in 2023, said earlier this year the name was here to stay. Not long after taking over, Harris quieted speculation about going back to Redskins, saying that would not happen. The team did not immediately respond to a request for comment following Trump's statement.

The Washington team started in Boston as the Redskins in 1933 before moving to the nation's capital four years later.

The Cleveland Guardians' president of baseball operations, Chris Antonetti, indicated before Sunday's game against the Athletics that there weren't any plans to revisit the name change.

“We understand there are different perspectives on the decision we made a few years ago, but obviously it's a decision we made. We've got the opportunity to build a brand as the Guardians over the last four years and are excited about the future that's in front of us,” he said.

Cleveland announced in December 2020 it would drop Indians. It announced the switch to Guardians in July 2021. In 2018, the team phased out “Chief Wahoo” as its primary logo.

The name changes had their share of supporters and critics as part of the national discussions about logos and names considered racist.

Trump posted Sunday afternoon that “The Owner of the Cleveland Baseball Team, Matt Dolan, who is very political, has lost three Elections in a row because of that ridiculous name change. What he doesn't understand is that if he changed the name back to the Cleveland Indians, he might actually win an Election. Indians are being treated very unfairly. MAKE INDIANS GREAT AGAIN (MIGA)!”

Matt Dolan, the son of the late Larry Dolan, no longer has a role with the Guardians. He ran the team's charity endeavors until 2016.

Matt Dolan was a candidate in the Ohio U.S. Senate elections in 2022 and '24, but lost.

Washington and Cleveland share another thing in common. David Blitzer is a member of Harris' ownership group with the Commanders and holds a minority stake in the Guardians.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who represents a slice of the Rio Grande Valley along the border with Mexico, won his last congressional election by just over 5,000 votes.

That makes him a tempting target for Republicans, who are poised to redraw the state's congressional maps this coming week and devise five new winnable seats for the GOP that would help the party avoid losing House control in the 2026 elections. Adjusting the lines of Gonzalez's district to bring in a few thousand more Republican voters, while shifting some Democratic ones out, could flip his seat.

Gonzalez said he is not worried. Those Democratic voters will have to end up in one of the Republican districts that flank Gonzalez's current one, making those districts more competitive — possibly enough so it could flip the seats to Democrats.

“Get ready for some pickup opportunities,” Gonzalez said, adding that his party is already recruiting challengers to Republicans whose districts they expect to be destabilized by the process. “We're talking to some veterans, we're talking to some former law enforcement.”

Texas has 38 seats in the House. Republicans now hold 25 and Democrats 12, with one seat vacant after Democrat Sylvester Turner, a former Houston mayor, died in March.

Gonzalez's district — and what happens to the neighboring GOP-held ones — is at the crux of President Donald Trump's high-risk, high-reward push to get Texas Republicans to redraw their political map. Trump is seeking to avoid the traditional midterm letdown that most incumbent presidents endure and hold onto the House, which the GOP narrowly controls.




Trump's push comes as there are numerous political danger signs for his presidency, both in the recent turmoil over his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and in new polling. Surveys from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show most U.S. adults think his policies have not helped them and that his tax cut and spending bill will help the wealthy.

The fear of accidentally creating unsafe seats is one reason Texas Republicans drew their lines cautiously in 2021, when the constitutionally mandated redistricting process kicked off in all 50 states. Mapmakers — in most states, it's the party that controls the legislature — must adjust congressional and state legislative lines after every 10-year census to ensure that districts have about the same number of residents.

That is a golden opportunity for one party to rig the map against the other, a tactic known as gerrymandering. But there is a term, too, for so aggressively redrawing a map that it puts that party's own seats at risk: a “dummymander.”

The Texas GOP knows the risk. In the 2010s, the Republican-controlled Legislature drew political lines that helped pad the GOP's House majority. That lasted until 2018, when a backlash against Trump in his first term led Democrats to flip two seats in Texas that Republicans had thought safe.

In 2021, with Republicans still comfortably in charge of the Texas Statehouse, the party was cautious, opting for a map that mainly shored up their incumbents rather than targeted Democrats.

Still, plenty of Republicans believe their Texas counterparts can safely go on offense.

“Smart map-drawing can yield pickup opportunities while not putting our incumbents in jeopardy,” said Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which helps coordinate mapmaking for the party nationally..

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature, which starts Monday, to comply with Trump's request to redraw the congressional maps and to address the flooding in Texas Hill Country that killed at least 135 people this month.

Democratic state lawmakers are talking about staying away from the Capitol to deny the Legislature the minimum number needed to convene. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton posted that any Democrats who did that should be arrested.

Lawmakers can be fined up to $500 a day for breaking a quorum after the House changed its rules when Democrats initiated a walkout in 2021. Despite the new penalties, state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, who led the walkout in 2021, left open the possibility of another.

“I don't think anybody should underestimate the will of Texas Democrats,” he said.

Texas is not the only Republican state engaged in mid-decade redistricting. After staving off a ballot measure to expand the power of a mapmaking commission last election, Ohio Republicans hope to redraw their congressional map from a 10-5 one favoring the GOP to one as lopsided as 13-2, in a state Trump won last year with 55% of the vote.

Some Democratic leaders have suggested that states where their party is in control should counter the expected redraw in Texas. “We have to be absolutely ruthless about getting back in power,” former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said Sunday on CNN.

But Democrats have fewer options. More of the states the party controls do not allow elected partisans to draw maps and entrust independent commissions to draw fair lines.

Among them is California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has floated the long shot idea of working around the state's commission.

The few Democratic-controlled states that do allow elected officials to draw the lines, such as Illinois, have already seen Democrats max out their advantages.

Trump and his allies have been rallying Texas Republicans to ignore whatever fears they may have and to go big.

On Tuesday, the president posted on his social media site a reminder of his record in the state last November: “Won by one and a half million Votes, and almost 14%. Also, won all of the Border Counties along Mexico, something which has never happened before. I keep hearing about Texas ‘going Blue,' but it is just another Democrat LIE.”

Texas has long been eyed as a state trending Democratic because of its growing nonwhite population. But those communities swung right last year and helped Trump expand his margin to 14 percentage points, a significant improvement on his 6-point win in 2020.

Michael Li, a Texas native and longtime watcher of the state at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, said there's no way to know whether that trend will continue in next year's elections or whether the state will return to its blue-trending ways.

“Anyone who can tell you what the politics of Texas looks like for the balance of the decade has a better crystal ball than I do,” Li said.

One region of the state where Republican gains have been steady is the Rio Grande Valley, which runs from the Gulf of Mexico along much of the state's southern border. The heavily Hispanic region, where many Border Patrol officers live, has rallied around Trump's tough-on-immigration, populist message.

As a result, Gonzalez and the area's other Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, have seen their reelection campaigns get steadily tighter. They are widely speculated to be the two top targets of the new map.

The GOP is expected to look to the state's three biggest cities to find its other Democratic targets. If mapmakers scatter Democratic voters from districts in the Houston, Dallas and Austin areas, they could get to five additional seats.

But in doing so, Republicans face a legal risk on top of their electoral one: that they break up districts required by the Voting Rights Act to have a critical amount of certain minority groups. The goal of the federal law is to enable those communities to elect representatives of their choosing.

The Texas GOP already is facing a lawsuit from civil rights groups alleging its initial 2021 map did this. If this year's redistricting is too aggressive, it could trigger a second complaint.

“It's politically and legally risky,” Li said of the redistricting strategy. “It's throwing caution to the winds.”

A grieving daughter placed her mom's ashes in a bottle so the woman could finally ""see"" the world. Not long after, a stranger found the bottle — and the daughter's message went viral.

A scientist studying caves found himself in a dangerous situation on Sunday.

While exploring the Abisso Paperino cave in Italy along with others, the explorer became trapped by falling rocks. 

The 62-year-old speleologist was found over 130 feet below the surface with a head injury.

That injury prevented him from escaping the cave, The Associated Press (AP) reported.

In order to help retrieve the man from the cave, rescuers widened the cave using explosive charges at three key junctures carrying him to the surface.

Fox News correspondent CB Cotton reports on the latest shark sightings in Rockaway Beach, N.Y., on ‘Fox Report.'

The New Jersey lifeguard impaled by a beach umbrella while working a summer job on the sand is speaking out about the ordeal that almost ended her life. 

Alex Kaus, 18, was working as a lifeguard on Asbury Park's 3rd Avenue Beach last month when the incident occurred.  

""Physically, I'm pretty good,"" Kaus told NJ.com. 

FREAK UMBRELLA ACCIDENT LEAVES LIFEGUARD IMPALED IN BEACH DAY HORROR

Kaus was setting up the umbrella when a gust of wind blew her off a lifeguard stand, dropping her on the point end of the 1-inch metal pole, NJ.com reported. 

Fellow lifeguards found Kaus lying on the ground with the stake through her left shoulder and sticking out the back of her arm, Asbury Park Fire Chief Kevin Keddy previously told Fox News Digital. First responders cut the umbrella stake off Kaus, making it easier to transport her to the hospital. 

Three weeks after the incident, Kaus is reportedly back at work, according to the local outlet. While she is not yet guarding beachgoers, the college student is reportedly checking for beach badges as she prepares to head back to school at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

""I hope to have at least like two-ish weeks on the stand before I have to go back to school,"" Kaus said. 

Kaus has no exact return date for when she will return to guarding, as she reportedly is waiting to be medically cleared before taking to the water. 

This summer marks the New Jersey native's second year on the Asbury Park beach, which she chose to apply to after spending time visiting as a child, according to NJ.com. 

""I knew I liked it here and I knew it was a busy beach and wanted some, like action,"" Kaus said.

With the news of her accident making national headlines, Kaus looked to downplay the attention as she focused on her recovery. 

""I'm definitely one of those people who's just like, ‘It's all good,'"" she said. ""I'm still processing everything."" 

Kaus is especially thankful for her fellow lifeguards and those who rushed to her rescue. 

""I'm really grateful to the people that were there with me,"" Kaus told NJ.com. ""My coworkers, Liz and Noah and Patty and Colin, they were all there."" 

Kaus did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

While Kaus is still recovering from her accident, she hopes the level of attention her story created shines some light on the role of lifeguards protecting local beaches up and down the country's coasts. 

""We appreciate it when people appreciate us as lifeguards,"" she said. ""Because we're out here every day, keeping everybody safe.""

Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on Kilmar Abrego Garcia's trial on 'Special Report.'

Lawyers for the Trump administration and Salvadorian migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia agreed on Monday to keep Abrego Garcia in U.S. criminal custody in Tennessee for a 30-day period — delaying, if only for now, the government's stated plans to remove him to a third country. 

In a filing submitted Monday to U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, lawyers for Abrego Garcia told the court that the agreement with the Justice Department will afford their client additional time to evaluate his legal options ahead of the government's plans to deport him from the U.S. again — this time, likely to a third country such as Mexico or South Sudan.

The agreement appears to be a significant concession from the Trump administration and follows senior officials telling a federal judge in Maryland earlier this month that they planned to ""immediately"" transfer Abrego Garcia to ICE custody upon his release from federal criminal detention in Tennessee and deport him to a third country — regardless of the status of his criminal trial.

FEDERAL JUDGE EXTENDS ARGUMENTS IN ABREGO GARCIA CASE, SLAMS ICE WITNESS WHO 'KNEW NOTHING'

Demonstrators gather outside the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, to protest the Trump administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvador in March in what administration officials said was an administrative error, on July 7, 2025.  (Breanne Deppisch/Fox News Digital)

""The government does not object to this request, and such a short delay will not affect the parties' ability to confer regarding a proposed scheduling order or to prepare for trial,"" lawyers for Abrego told Judge Crenshaw on Monday. 

""The government has informed defense counsel that it will continue producing discovery during this 30- day time period, the parties will continue to collaborate on a scheduling order in advance of the July 30, 2025 deadline, and do not anticipate continuance of the January 27, 2026 trial date due to this requested relief.""

The 30-day stay appears to cap months of confusing and contradictory statements from the Trump administration in the case of Abrego Garcia, the Salvadorian migrant who was erroneously deported to El Salvador in March in violation of a court order, and returned to the U.S. three months later in June.

The extended time frame is also likely a welcome relief for Abrego Garcia's lawyers, who are still waiting for U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to rule on their request to block ICE from immediately deporting him to a third country.

Justice Department officials acknowledged in court that they plan to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country as early as this month. 

""There's no intention to just put him in limbo in ICE custody while we wait for the criminal case to unfold,"" Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn said then. ""He will be removed, as would any other illegal alien in that process.""

Xinis, who has presided over the civil case since March, suggested after a days-long evidentiary hearing this month that she planned to issue a temporary restraining order requiring ICE to keep Abrego Garcia in custody for a set amount of time before they can deport him to a third country.

She said the order would require ICE to keep Abrego Garcia in local custody for a set period — likely between 48 and 72 hours — before deportation, which Xinis suggested would ensure that Abrego Garcia had the ability to seek counsel and to contest his planned removal. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador in violation of a 2019 court order. 

""However, I'm not willing to just allow an unfettered release of Abrego Garcia,"" Xinis said at the time, referring to his potential release from federal custody in Tennessee. ""I want full-throated assurances"" from the government on these matters, she added, noting at the end of the days-long hearing that ""much delta"" remained between where the parties stand and where she had hoped they would be.

Notably, the Justice Department told Xinis then that they would not agree to a stipulation she suggested, holding Abrego Carcia in ICE custody for 48- to 72-hours hold in ICE custody. It is unclear what, if anything, has changed since that hearing and Monday's filing, which agreed to the much longer administrative stay of 30 days.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is getting broadsided from her left over her vote on an amendment aimed at blocking U.S. funding for Israel's Iron Dome.

The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) are criticizing the progressive firebrand for voting against an amendment by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to block $500 million in Congress' annual defense spending bill that was aimed at helping fund Israeli missile defense systems.

""An arms embargo means keeping all arms out of the hands of a genocidal military, no exceptions. This is why we oppose Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez'[s] vote against an amendment that would have blocked $500 million in funding for the Israeli military's Iron Dome program,"" the DSA said over the weekend.

The DSA noted she did vote against the defense funding bill itself, thereby ""voting against funding for the imperialist military-industrial complex and the Israeli genocide.""

FAR-LEFT FIREBRAND SAYS SHE 'NEVER HAD A CONCERN' ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL STATE AS HOUSE PROBE HEATS UP

The group added, however, ""We were further deeply disappointed by her clarifying statement on her position on the Iron Dome.""

""Along with other US-funded interceptor systems, the Iron Dome has emboldened Israel to invade or bomb no less than five different countries in the past two years,"" the DSA said.

""The fact that Representative Ocasio-Cortez acknowledges that Israel is carrying out this genocide makes her support for military aid all the more disappointing and incongruous. We urge the representative to continue voting against the Iron Dome, whether it is part of a larger defense spending bill or as a stand-alone bill.""

The DSA commended Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Summer Lee, D-Pa., and Al Green, D-Texas, for voting against the amendment.

Fox News Digital reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's campaign and congressional office for comment.

She posted on X after the vote, ""Marjorie Taylor Greene's amendment does nothing to cut off offensive aid to Israel nor end the flow of US munitions being used in Gaza. Of course I voted against it.""

""What it does do is cut off defensive Iron Dome capacities while allowing the actual bombs killing Palestinians to continue. I have long stated that I do not believe that adding to the death count of innocent victims to this war is constructive to its end,"" she said.

""That is a simple and clear difference of opinion that has long been established. I remain focused on cutting the flow of US munitions that are being used to perpetuate the genocide in Gaza.""

The clash exemplifies how Israel continues to drive an ideological wedge within the Democratic Party. 

It's not the first time Ocasio-Cortez caught heat from the progressive base for failing to take a critical enough stance on Israel.

In 2021, the New York Democrat cried on the House floor after voting ""present"" on funding Israel's Iron Dome defense system.

""Yes, I wept,"" she wrote in an open letter to constituents after the incident. ""I wept at the complete lack of care for the human beings that are impacted by these decisions. I wept at an institution choosing a path of maximum volatility and minimum consideration for its own political convenience.""

The overall bill that passed last week calls for $832 billion in defense funding for fiscal year 2026.

That's separate from the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), another annual bill that sets defense and national security policy each fiscal year – essentially detailing how those funds will be spent.

Greene's amendment to strip $500 million going toward Israeli missile defense programs lost in a lopsided 6-422 vote.

Secretary of Education Linda McMahon joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's push to abolish the department, the administration's stance on anti-Israel college protests and DOGE's role within the Cabinet. 

Tucson Unified School District (TUSD), based in Tucson, Arizona, is reportedly facing financial and enrollment struggles after universal school choice passed in the state in 2022.

A TUSD official told KGUN that approximately 4,000 students used vouchers to either go to private schools or homeschool.

The trend of parents overlooking TUSD cost the school district about $20 million. TUSD's Chief Financial Officer, Ricky Hernandez, told the local outlet that TUSD is ""preparing for continued declines in enrollment as a result"" of vouchers.

Vouchers are a form of school choice that allow parents to send their kids to schools outside their neighborhood or opt out of going to public school. 

Arizona became the first state to offer universal school choice for all families in 2022, launching an $800 million program that gives parents $7,000 to put toward their children's tuition. Several other states followed, indicating a trend of parents seeking alternative options to traditional public schools.

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT SIGNS $1 BILLION VOUCHER PROGRAM INTO LAW, CAPPING OFF WIN FOR SCHOOL CHOICE ADVOCATES

Parents' use of school vouchers put the district's already debilitating enrollment in worse circumstances, including impacting teacher pay, according to TUSD's chief financial officer. The district cannot offer competitive pay to retain and recruit teachers due to the loss of money the district incurred.

Furthermore, the district has had to implement budget reductions as a result. 

""If those numbers aren't there, then that certainly affects the number of teachers that we have, how we can compensate them,"" Hernandez said to KGUN.

The president of the Tucson Education Association, a local branch of the National Education Association, warned that the loss of funds could lead to teachers leaving the district.

OHIO GRADUATE SAYS SCHOOL CHOICE PROGRAM 'SAVED' HIS LIFE AS VOUCHERS BOOST GRADUATION RATES

""Having to look at, 'do I stay in education? How many other jobs do I have to keep this one?'"" Jim Byrne told KGUN.

On the other hand, the Vail Unified School District (VUSD), located in Vail, Arizona, is seeing the opposite.

The local outlet reported on Tuesday an increase in enrollment over the last year. More specifically, the district's K-8 saw an increase of 20 to 50 students.

The VUSD superintendent, John Carruth, attributed the growth to the housing construction growing in the area. Carruth added that their losses to school vouchers were offset by students leaving other public school districts to enroll in VUSD.

Reacting to the school district's difference in outcomes after the vouchers, school choice advocates weighed in.

Several red states passed universal school choice, following Arizona, indicating a trend of parents seeking alternative options around the country. 

""Some school districts are better than others. The best ones that are competitive don't have to worry as much about losing their customers,"" Corey DeAngelis of the American Culture Project said to Fox News Digital.

Education policy analyst, Jason Bedrick of the Heritage Foundation, who is based in Arizona tracking policy decisions in the state, said to Fox News Digital that  TUSD ""has long had a reputation for poor quality, despite spending more per pupil than the state average.""

""Only 21 percent of TUSD students passed the state math exam last year, well below both the state average (32 percent) and district with similar demographics (26 percent). The passing rate for TUSD students is not much better in English (27 percent) and even worse in science (18 percent),"" Bedrick said, citing state data.

""On http://GreatSchools.org, parents also complain about chronic issues with discipline, safety, and school culture,"" he added to Fox News Digital.

New Hampshire is the latest state to pass universal school choice, joining Arizona in responding to concerns of children being trapped in failing school districts.

The TUSD nor the VUSD immediately responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane discusses the potential war technology deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, the upcoming deadline for an Iranian nuclear deal and more on ‘Fox & Friends.'

Drones have rapidly evolved from backyard novelties into critical components of today's infrastructure and now, into one of the fastest-growing threats to our national security. As the CEO of one of the nation's largest drone technology companies and a former naval officer, I've seen firsthand how powerful these tools can be. I've also seen how dangerous they are when left unregulated; they become liabilities, capable of disruption, destruction and danger. 

Just days ago, amid deadly flash floods in Texas, a private drone collided with a rescue helicopter during an active life-saving mission. The crash forced the crew to land, grounding a critical asset in the middle of an unfolding emergency. In the chaos of unspeakable tragedy, a single uncoordinated drone put lives at risk and halted the very efforts meant to save them. Incidents like this are entirely preventable with proper airspace coordination.  

In the first quarter of this year, the FAA reported over 400 illegal drone incursions near U.S. airports, which is a 25% increase from the same period in 2024. Drone incursions into U.S. military airspace have reached unprecedented levels, and the trend is only accelerating. At military bases across the country, 350 unauthorized drone flights were recorded last year alone. These aren't harmless mistakes. They are persistent, coordinated, and, in some cases, hostile. 

HEGSETH TEARS UP RED TAPE, ORDERS PENTAGON TO BEGIN DRONE SURGE AT TRUMP'S COMMAND

These incidents are not isolated; they're escalating. Drones have been used to smuggle contraband into prisons, surveil energy facilities and ports, and even collide with manned aircraft, narrowly avoiding catastrophe. As drones become faster, cheaper and easier to operate, our systems for detecting, coordinating, and responding remain fractured, outdated, and dangerously inadequate. 

Drones have become a national security danger. FILE: The autonomous AV8 drones are governed by a computer system created by eve Vehicles in Austin, Texas. (KVUE)

From commercial airliners and emergency helicopters to power grids and correctional facilities, these vulnerabilities cut across every critical sector. Without stronger detection, clear enforcement authority, and a unified approach to managing airspace, the risk will only grow. This is no longer a question of if these gaps will be exploited, but when, how often, and at what cost.

The root of the problem is not technological. The solutions exist today. What we lack is a national framework, a unified, real-time system to track, manage and respond to low-altitude air traffic. 

DRONE INCURSIONS ON US BASES COME UNDER INTENSE SCRUTINY AS DEVICES PROVE LETHALITY OVERSEAS

We need a flight information exchange that allows law enforcement, regulators, and operators to see what's flying, where it is, and who is responsible. We need cryptographically secure digital credentials that link drones, their pilots and their missions to prevent spoofing. And we need Remote ID signals that can't be manipulated. 

Right now, too many decisions depend on disconnected sensors, slow approvals and guesswork. We must fuse radar, RF and acoustic data into a single surveillance picture. The FAA needs to publish a national mission-priority table to ensure emergency flights aren't delayed or grounded. Most urgently, Congress must expand counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems authority to include local law enforcement before the current federal authority sunsets this September.

The technology is ready. The risks are growing. We no longer have the luxury of delay. It's time for Congress, regulators and industry to act together before these threats escalate into disasters. 

We can protect our skies before the next drone incident becomes a national tragedy.

President Donald Trump's insistence that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is behind the curve and should lower interest rates immediately has been criticized by the usual suspects. A close examination of the inflation record since Trump's inauguration, though, shows he's right.

The Fed has a dual mandate to maintain stable prices and encourage low unemployment. Since it successfully quashed the 1970s-era stagflation, it has consistently tried to balance those goals by setting a clear inflation target and shifting interest rates up or down in response to clear economic trends.

That target, roughly a 2% annual rise in core prices excluding the volatile food and energy segments, has remained constant for years. Thus, the Fed, regardless of who the chairman is, has tried to run a tight monetary policy when the rate is above that target and feels emboldened to run a loose policy when it remains at or below that figure.

The common wisdom is that the core inflation rate remains above 2%, and thus, Powell's stance that interest rates are at the right level is justified. That wisdom is based on the annualized increase as presented either by the Consumer Price Index or by another measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures database.

This analysis is flawed, however. Inflation in both measures has sharply trended down since Trump took office. The annualized increase in the CPI's core index in the five months since January is a mere 1.9%, while the core price index in the PCE has risen by a mere 1.2% annualized rate over the last three months.

The headline rate is above 2% in both indices only because of higher inflation rates accruing from the Biden administration. Remove those, and Trump's inflation-cutting record is clear.

That opens the way to lower rates, which is precisely what Trump calls for.

How much should rates be cut? That depends on how high the so-called “real rate of return” should be.

Central banks typically set rates above the inflation rate to provide investors with a return above what is needed to offset price hikes. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis show that this premium tended to be around 2.5% between 1960 and 2008, except during recessions and when the Fed ran a tight policy to crush 1970s-era inflation.

The Great Recession ended this practice, with the Fed running a very loose monetary policy between 2008 and the pandemic. For most of that period, its near-zero short-term interest rate policy meant investors lost money when they saved it, an ultra-loose policy that fueled spending and re-inflated the economy after the financial crash.

The post-pandemic inflationary spurt pushed Powell to reinstate a positive real rate of return for the first time in nearly fifteen years. But it has rarely risen to the historic 2.5% level. Indeed, the one time it did in the summer of 2024 was followed by a 50-basis point rate cut in September and two additional cuts later that year.

That post-pandemic record implies that Powell thinks a real rate in the 1.5-1.75% range is sufficient to control inflation and keep the economy humming.

Applying that rate to the Trump-era inflation record means the Fed should cut rates now. The current Fed target is between 4.25 and 4.5%, with an effective rate of 4.33%. If annual core inflation is only 1.9%, Powell's implied preferred real rate means the Fed's target rate should be between 3.5 and 3.75%.

That's a 75-basis-point cut, massive in the world of global finance.

A cut of that magnitude would ripple throughout the economy. Bond prices would rise, as they move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Stock prices would likely increase too, as they usually do in response to Fed rate cuts. Mortgage rates would come down, making buying a home more affordable.

This is why Trump and his team are angry. They see their policy succeeding, but Powell's hesitation is holding back the economic growth they are unleashing.

POWELL SENDS LETTER TO WHITE HOUSE DEFENDING $2.5 BILLION FED RENOVATIONS

Powell might respond that the uncertainty over Trump's tariff policy justifies his caution, but the record suggests otherwise. Tariffs have already been up during Trump's brief tenure, yet the core inflation rate for goods excluding food and energy is down from Biden-era levels. That rate is currently running at a 1% annualized rate, with lower prices for new and used vehicles.

The Fed is legally independent from political control, so Trump can only rail on Truth Social for now. But soon one of two things will happen: either inflation will pick up, justifying Powell's caution, or the embattled Fed chief will finally see the light, start following the data, and give Trump the interest rate cuts his record so far has merited.

MEASURING WHAT AMERICANS THINK ABOUT IMMIGRATION. Over the weekend, CBS News published a new poll with the headline, “Poll finds support for Trump's deportation program falls.” The story seemed straightforward. But the story behind the story is worth looking into.

The poll found that 44% of those surveyed approved of the way President Donald Trump is handling the issue of immigration, while 56% disapprove. After that came a number of more specific questions. What do you think about “the Trump administration's program to find and deport immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally”? Forty-nine percent approved, while 51% disapproved. 

Then: “Do you think the Trump administration is mainly prioritizing dangerous criminals for deportation, or is it mainly prioritizing people who are not dangerous criminals?” Forty-four percent said prioritizing dangerous criminals, while 56% said prioritizing those who are not dangerous criminals. And: “So far, do you think the Trump administration is focusing too much, about the right amount, or not enough on deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally?” Fifty-one percent said too much, 33% said the right amount, and 15% said not enough.

“On matters of deportation, differences hinge on who, and how many, Americans see as being targeted, as well as the use of detention facilities,” CBS wrote. “The Republican and MAGA political base remain overwhelmingly approving of it all, but the rest of the American public has become less so.”

It was all pretty run-of-the-mill stuff, until this question: “Do you think Donald Trump's policies are making the number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border go up, go down, or not change?” Unlike an opinion question, this was a fact-based query, with a right and a wrong answer.

Sixty-four percent gave the obviously correct response — Trump has made the number of migrants crossing the border go down. But 28% said the Trump policies have made no difference, which was flatly wrong. And 8% said crossings have actually gone up, which was crazy wrong.

Just for the record, the Border Patrol recorded 2,206,436 encounters with illegal border crossers in fiscal 2022, the first full year of Joe Biden's presidency. (The government keeps the numbers in fiscal years — fiscal 2022 ran from Oct. 1, 2021, to Sept. 30, 2022.) In fiscal 2023, there were 2,045,838 encounters, and in fiscal 2024, there were 1,530,523. So far in Trump's presidency, there were 8,348 encounters in February, 7,183 in March, 8,378 in April, 8,723 in May, and 6,072 in June. You do the math. There has been an off-the-cliff drop in encounters since Trump became president. And just to emphasize things, even of those small numbers of crossings, U.S. officials are not allowing any of the illegal crossers to stay in the country.

So, how did so many poll respondents get the situation so wrong? Put the 28% and the 8% together, and you get 36% of Americans who don't know what Trump has done on the border. Or maybe they know but will not acknowledge it. So take a closer look into the details of that simple question: Have Trump's policies made the number of migrants crossing the border go up, or down, or made no difference?

Looking into the details of the poll, the numbers for Democratic respondents were striking. A full 43% of Democrats said Trump's policies have made no difference, while an additional 10% said those policies have made border crossings go up. That's a majority who either do not know or who reject the facts on the border. Just 47% of Democrats knew, or admitted, the correct answer.

Some of it is just lack of knowledge. In any poll, there will be some number of people who don't know basic political facts. But the Democratic numbers seem larger than that. Perhaps respondents have been reading and watching news outlets that largely ignore the border issue but pay a lot of attention to the deportation issue. Or perhaps they know the situation on the border but just don't want to acknowledge it. 

In any event, the answers to the border crossings question could tell us something about the answers to all the other immigration questions in the CBS poll, and perhaps in other polls as well. What do people mean when they say they do not approve of Trump's “immigration” policy? Do they mean border security? Do they mean Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations? Do they mean action against people who broke the law by entering the country and then broke it again by committing some other crime? Or those who broke the law by entering but have not committed any additional crimes? 

And what do they know about what the Trump administration is doing? Do they know about the border crossing numbers? Do they know what the ICE raids are accomplishing? A lot of that will depend on what, if any, news coverage they read and watch. For example, for the worst years of the Biden border incursion, Fox News was the only national news organization to cover what was one of the most important stories of recent decades. People who got their news from other sources might not have known what was going on. 

Why did those news sources downplay such obviously consequential news? That's another story. The fact is, it's entirely possible significant numbers of Americans, even now, are not fully informed on what is going on in the Trump administration under the heading of “immigration.” The new CBS poll, with its seemingly confusing results, appears to show that.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Sunday night against one of his strongest critics, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), as Fannie Mae investigators look into allegations of mortgage fraud by the senator.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump teased that Schiff is in “BIG TROUBLE” and accused him of falsifying loan documents, saying he should face prison time.

“Adam ‘Shifty' Schiff is in BIG TROUBLE! He falsified Loan Documents. He once said my son would go to prison on a SCAM that Schiff, along with other Crooked Dems, illegally ‘manufactured' in order to stage an actual coup. My son did nothing wrong, knew nothing about the fictional story. It was an American Tragedy! Now Shifty should pay the price of prison for a real crime, not one made up by the corrupt accusers!” the president posted, referencing the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, new documents of which allege that Obama-era officials “manufactured” intelligence to undermine Trump.

Trump's call for Schiff to see jail time follows the president's statement last week that the California senator faced an investigation from Fannie Mae that concluded Schiff “engaged in a sustained pattern of possible mortgage fraud” by listing a Maryland home as his primary residence for years instead of his California home. 

While a memorandum from Fannie Mae investigators found something similar to Trump's accusations, specifically that Schiff and his wife, Eve, “engaged in a sustained pattern of possible occupancy misrepresentation,” no determination on anything illegal has yet been made.

Still, Trump has only escalated his rhetoric against Schiff over the past week, including earlier on Sunday, when he called for his prosecution.

“Adam Schiff is a THIEF! He should be prosecuted, just like they tried to prosecute me, and everyone else — The only difference is, WE WERE TOTALLY INNOCENT, IT WAS ALL A GIANT HOAX!” Trump posted.

TRUMP SAYS SCHIFF SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR MORTGAGE FRAUD ‘LIKE THEY TRIED TO PROSECUTE ME'

Schiff has denied wrongdoing and defended the use of claiming year-round ownership of both homes as common practice for members of Congress traveling from state to state.

“Big surprise — members of Congress, almost all of them, own more than one home or rent more than one home because we're required to be on both coasts. So he is using my ownership of two homes to make a false claim of mortgage fraud,” the California senator said early last week.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump's fascination with reopening Alcatraz, a dilapidated former state prison off the coast of San Francisco, seems motivated more by symbolism than necessity and could risk becoming the administration's biggest boondoggle. 

Trump has enthusiastically floated the idea of restoring Alcatraz to its former glory multiple times, each time met with intense pushback over its impracticality and astronomical cost, estimated at $2 billion.

Known as “the Rock,” Alcatraz has been featured in many Hollywood movies and is held in the cultural consciousness as a tough place where the worst of the worst go. That makes it attractive to Trump, who sees himself as the “law and order” president. 

Indeed, for nearly three decades, the California prison housed some of the most notorious criminals in U.S. history, including gangster Al Capone, George “Machine Gun Kelly” Barnes, and Robert Stroud, better known as the “Birdman of Alcatraz.”

The problem is, in his enthusiasm to bring back Alcatraz, Trump has disregarded the prison's outdated technology and the very reason then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy chose to close it in the first place: It was too costly to maintain and operate.

The Bureau of Prisons, which would be tasked with running Alcatraz, has been struggling with short staffing, chronic violence, and crumbling infrastructure at its current facilities. Adding a rebooted Alcatraz into the mix would not only be costly but, some say, a waste of time, space, and effort. 

On Thursday, Trump sent Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to visit the prison, which has since been turned into a horticultural paradise and tourist site, complete with a bookstore and cafe. While the Bondi field trip was nothing short of an orchestrated redirect by the administration that had taken heat over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, it did open up new questions about Trump's fascination with Alcatraz, its brand recognition, history, myths, environmental effects, and costs to taxpayers should he sign off on it.

“Alcatraz could hold the worst of the worst, it could hold middle-class violent prisoners, it could hold illegal aliens, it could hold anything,” Bondi told Fox News, who accompanied her and Burgum on the trip. “This is a terrific facility, needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.” 

People tried to escape the facility. It is still unclear whether they made it to land. Over the 29 years that Alcatraz operated as a prison, 36 men were involved in 14 escape attempts. Of those, 23 prisoners were caught, six were shot and killed, and two drowned. The fate of five other men is still unknown. They are presumed to have drowned, though there is evidence that contradicts the claim. 

Trump has also been impressed with the supposed shark-infested waters surrounding the prison, which make the area dangerous and unsuitable for swimming. The president said he has seen renderings of the potential new facility with sharks patrolling the waters around the prison. The problem with the rendering is that it's not possible. 

In fact, documents from the BOP debunk many myths about Alcatraz made famous in movies.

“There are no ‘man-eating' sharks in San Francisco Bay, only small bottom-feeding sharks,” the BOP stated on its webpage. “The main obstacles were the cold temperatures, the strong currents, and the distance to shore (at least 1-1/4 miles).”

The BOP also said that prior to Alcatraz's opening in 1934, “a teenage girl swam to the island to prove it was possible.”

She wasn't the only one. 

“Fitness guru Jack LaLanne once swam to the island pulling a rowboat, and several years ago, two 10-year-old children also made the swim,” the BOP added. 

Former San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, who has been swimming in the bay several times a week since 1992 and has swam from Alcatraz seven times, told the San Francisco Chronicle that he has seen “quite a few sea lions, some harbor seals and no sharks — other than some land sharks named Pam Bondi and her entourage” on his outings.

Sharks aside, Alcatraz has many other problems that need fixing before it can become a functional maximum-security prison. 

A pricetag of more than $2 billion to fix the place up has been reported by Axios. This estimate includes the cost of refurbishment and construction of a new prison on the island. If the Trump administration wants to keep the current facility, it would also cost hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the electrical system up to modern standards, haul water, food, and employees from the mainland, and send sewage back in return. 

Currently, Alcatraz is a tourist destination generating about $60 million in annual revenue and sees about 1.4 million visitors a year, according to the nonprofit organization Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, which works with the National Park Service. 

The conservancy said, “Reopening Alcatraz as a prison would erase decades of progress and miss the point of what this place has become. The island is working, not as a prison, but as a national park that brings history, nature, and people together in a way few places can.”

For Alcatraz to operate again as a prison, Congress would also have to pass legislation to remove National Environmental Policy Act and Historic Preservation Act requirements for the area, which could be a lot easier said than done. 

Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) called plans to reopen Alcatraz “batsh*t crazy.”

“As for the merits of this proposal, if you thought ‘Alligator Alcatraz' was dumb, cruel, and wasteful, you'll run out of adjectives for this idiotic political stunt,” he said. “I told Secretary Burgum last month that not a single serious person at the National Park Service, from superintendents to janitors, thinks this is a good idea. It would also be a financial boondoggle, not just the massive amount it would cost to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, but all the money and goodwill the Park Service would lose from closing one of America's most popular tourist destinations.

“The bottom line: this is deeply idiotic, transparently political, and ultimately unlikely to happen. The only possible rational explanation for why Pam Bondi was touring Alcatraz is that she thinks it might be a good place to hide the Epstein files.”

Unlike the original Alcatraz, the Trump administration had much better luck capitalizing on its name and lore when it built “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida at record speed.

“Alligator Alcatraz” is a makeshift detention facility that was created in a matter of days. Workers transformed the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport from an 11,000-foot isolated airstrip in the Everglades into a temporary tent facility to house undocumented migrants. 

A DAY WITH FLORIDA STATE TROOPERS NABBING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOR ‘ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ'

“The incredible thing is picking the site … it might be as good as the real Alcatraz, so I really think it could last for as long as they want to have it,” Trump said. “You could morph this into the prison system.”

There have already been complaints about the inhumane treatment at Alligator Alcatraz and the shortcuts the government took to get it up and running.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Now is the perfect time to look with clear eyes at the goals, accomplishments, and failures of higher education.

The past 10 years have been among the most tumultuous for higher education since the student movements of the 1960s. The 2020s began with a wave of progressive fervor that swept the nation and was especially notable on America's campuses. Five years later, the cultural pendulum has swung in the opposite direction. After a series of protests against the war in Gaza, followed by police crackdowns and debates over anti-Semitism, American universities (especially elite ones) are having their influential role in political life scrutinized. But arguments over their ideological bent have overshadowed the other major ways these institutions affect the country: Since at least the end of World War II, they have been driving forces for prosperity, social mobility, and world-changing scientific innovation. They underpin a huge portion of the country's sports ecosystem, provide the setting for hundreds of works of pop culture, and shape how Americans understand the transition from child to adult.

President Donald Trump's administration has made unprecedented attacks on America's colleges and universities, and the effects of this onslaught are not limited to degree seekers, faculty, or administration—they ripple across American society, affecting, for example, patients who rely on universities' affiliated teaching hospitals and college towns where academic institutions are the main employers. There is no better time to look with clear eyes at the goals, accomplishments, and failures of these schools. The eight books on this list, taken in combination, tell the story of the historic rise, and current crisis, of the American university.



The University in Ruins, by Bill Readings

One of the most insightful books about the contemporary American university was written in the 1990s by a British professor who taught in Canada. Although Readings's history is not focused solely on U.S. institutions, few works better describe the changes they have undergone. Historically, he writes, colleges and universities aimed to imprint capital-C Culture—especially a familiarity with a nation's great texts and intellectual traditions—on young people. Today, however, students more often are seen and see themselves as consumers who are buying diplomas in order to signal their employability. In this model, the values that animate higher education are job preparation, skill building, and networking, not intellectual engagement or humanistic fulfillment. The University in Ruins is first and foremost a work of scholarship—a readable one, despite being peppered with occasional academese—but it is also a book of uncommon prescience that saw clearly that the rarefied ivory tower, with its idea of academia as a realm detached from the coarse affairs of the material world, was transforming into a credentialing bureaucracy.





The Great American University, by Jonathan R. Cole

Cole, a sociologist and Columbia University's former dean of faculties, offers a doorstop history of the modern research university that doubles as an unusually perceptive defense of these schools. What distinguishes them from other kinds of higher-ed institutions is their first priority, which is, as their name implies, research. They can offer excellent teaching, cultivate an educated citizenry, and help graduates climb the socioeconomic ladder, but these features are subsidiary to their primary mission of increasing human knowledge. Schools such as the University of Minnesota, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Florida may be most often in the public eye because of their sports teams, but they're also places where things that improve people's lives in ways both big and small—pacemakers, the polio vaccine, Gatorade—were invented. Although Cole is not skeptical enough about the growing financialization and corporatization of higher education, his book makes plain how universities have advanced the interests of people around the world—even when those people might not realize (or appreciate) it.



Ravelstein, by Saul Bellow

Bellow's thinly veiled 2000 roman à clef about his friendship with the star academic Allan Bloom—the philosopher who wrote the best-selling jeremiad The Closing of the American Mind—is a tender portrait of its subject. But Bellow's novel is as much about the institutional culture that shaped Bloom. It is a paean to academia as an enterprise that works to sort ideas that are base and quotidian from those that are noble and timeless, and its titular character embodies this faith in the professoriate as a kind of secular priesthood. Abe Ravelstein is a study in contradictions. Devoted to a life of the mind, he approaches reading the classics as a kind of soul-craft, and he's preoccupied with the wisdom of ancient philosophers, poets, and statesmen; yet he also nurtures an irrepressible fondness for modern luxuries such as Armani suits, Cuban cigars, and “solid-gold Montblanc pens.” The irony of Ravelstein is that its protagonist's celebrity is a symptom of the same commodification of knowledge that is eroding the things he most holds dear. Read 25 years later, the novel is an artifact of its time: The diminishment of the university's purpose that Bellow witnessed feels much more advanced today.

No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities, by Ellen W. Schrecker

Schrecker's No Ivory Tower is a granular account of the effect that the Red Scare had on American universities, as well as a broader meditation on the nature and history of academic freedom. Published almost four decades ago, the book remains among the best accounts of the period when the House Un-American Activities Committee led anti-Communist witch hunts into Hollywood, the government, and colleges. In our own moment of neo-McCarthyist panic, as repression and speech crackdowns again sweep the higher-education system, it has much to teach us. Schrecker reminds readers bluntly that “the academy did not fight McCarthyism,” before adding the coup de grâce: “It contributed to it.” Today's faculty and administrators would do well to recall how institutions such as the University of California system implemented loyalty oaths, and administrations worked to accommodate, rather than contest, the state's assault on intellectual freedom.



Resistance from the Right: Conservatives and the Campus Wars in Modern America, by Lauren Lassabe Shepherd

Thanks to a nearly century-long campaign by right-leaning pundits, writers, commentators, and media celebrities, the phrase “campus activism” is almost exclusively associated with the political left. Shepherd shows that this is only part of the story: Her book examines how in the late 1960s, at the height of radical campus politics and the backlash against them, conservatives created student groups and movements of their own, backed by wealthy funders and organizations such as the Mont Pelerin Society and the Foundation for Economic Education. This campus organizing, she argues, not only produced many of the conservative leaders and intellectuals who would go on to shape the 20th and 21st centuries (including Karl Rove and Pat Buchanan); it also set the template for the right's approach to universities today. The now-familiar conservative move in which occasional examples of left-wing student excess are intensely spotlighted in order “to create suspicion around campus antiwar and civil rights initiatives,” as Shepherd writes, was pioneered more than 50 years ago.



After the Ivory Tower Falls, by Will Bunch

Bunch's book was an instant classic of the time-honored “academia is imploding” genre, but its apocalyptic title is also slightly misleading. Yes, it offers a bracing tour through the crises and failures—the explosion of student debt, the devaluing of expertise—that have plagued academia in the last 50 years. But After the Ivory Tower Falls is also a moving, even idealistic account of what higher education can be when it works. Invoking the G.I. Bill, which made a college education available to more of those in the working and middle classes, Bunch forces us to remember that the phrase “paying your way through college” is derived from the fact that you actually used to be able to pay your way through college. He points out that when postsecondary schooling was politically prioritized and economically democratized, however partially and however unevenly, it increased both national prosperity and the financial prospects of many Americans. “A college diploma became the shining symbol of a nation's promise—the American Dream,” he writes, lamenting that today, for too many, it can be a perfunctory piece of paperwork that saddles its recipient with unpayable debts.



Kent State: An American Tragedy, by Brian VanDeMark

The Naval Academy historian VanDeMark's recent book on the Kent State shooting, in which the National Guard fired on and killed four Vietnam War protesters, reminds readers that last year's spate of campus protests, which brought students and faculty into contact with militarized police, was not unprecedented. Kent State is an empathetic, politically dispassionate look at that massacre in the spring of 1970. VanDeMark largely sidesteps the received wisdom about the event, instead bringing fresh reporting and details to bear on “the full story,” which, he writes, “has remained elusive.” He casts a human (though not exculpatory) eye on all of the involved parties, including the students who were shot dead and the National Guard troops who raised their rifles. He explains that some of the Guardsmen were avoiding Vietnam duty themselves, and he provides a new account of the precipitating event that led the assembled soldiers to fire. As a whole, Kent State offers a powerful and lamentably topical reminder of how easily things can go wrong when protesters and uniformed squads with guns come into conflict.



The Adjunct Underclass, by Herb Childress 

In the 21st century, academic work has been transformed by the rise of the hustling part-time professor, or “adjunct.” These jobs often have more in common with shifts for gig employers such as Lyft than the tweedy image of the tenured academic we get from soppy campus movies. You cannot understand the contemporary university if you do not understand the acceleration of adjunctification. Childress draws on interviews and an intimate understanding of academia's management and financial model to lay bare the predatory and often inhumane labor practices—poverty wages, lack of health care, job insecurity—that are now common in an industry that fancies itself a bastion of progress and virtue. The Adjunct Underclass does much to disabuse readers of the fantasies of professorial life while exposing the considerably grimmer reality: At a time when universities were home to administrative bloat, poor management, and soaring tuition fees, they were also adopting employment practices that have left their faculty hanging by a thread.

Shooing young children away from the kitchen and the laundry can have a lasting effect.

Each September at the Montessori school I run, the preschoolers engage in an elaborate after-lunch cleanup routine. They bustle through the room with sweepers and tiny dustpans, spreading crumbs all over the floor and making a bigger mess than they started with. If any scraps do make it into their dustpans, most of them spill out as the children exuberantly walk to the trash bin.

It would be faster and neater to simply let the teachers do all the tidying up. But our goal is more than achieving a spotless classroom; it's also helping children develop motor skills, responsibility, confidence, and the ability to clean effectively on their own. Sure enough, by December, the children's sweeping efforts become more refined. By springtime, if not earlier, they start to pick up other messes throughout the day without a teacher's prompting. They haven't just learned to mop and scrub; they've taken ownership over their environment.

Contrast this with my own house—where, in a half-hearted effort to encourage my children to take responsibility for our home, I've been known to say, “You live here!” as they ignore the pile of dishes in the sink. After years in Montessori classrooms, I assumed that a culture of taking responsibility would develop spontaneously in my family. And it might have, had I not made some early mistakes. When my oldest daughter, as a toddler, stirred pancake batter out of a bowl, I wrested the spoon from her hand. When my son made an earnest effort to fold a pair of pants by himself, I immediately refolded them more neatly. After those moments, and countless other small ones like them, my kids' enthusiasm to help started to dwindle. As the researchers I spoke with told me, this pattern is common among parents who, in an effort to make chores more efficient, unwittingly thwart their child's desire to help.

Read: The way American parents think about chores is bizarre

Granted, most kids, mine included, do some housework, and plenty of kids do lots. But research indicates that parents shoulder much of the burden. A small 2009 study of dual-income, middle-class families in Los Angeles showed that chores accounted for less than 3 percent of household activities for the children, who were between the ages of 5 and 17, compared with 27 percent for their moms and 15 percent for their dads. Lucia Alcalá, a psychology professor at California State University at Fullerton who studies sociocultural and cognitive development, pointed out that lots of parents these days use chores to refer to tasks that solely benefit the child, such as cleaning their own room, rather than to duties that serve the whole family. The half a dozen researchers I spoke with said that many children do little when it comes to vacuuming the living room or taking out the trash. “We give our kids a free pass,” David F. Lancy, the author and editor of multiple books, including The Anthropology of Childhood, told me. Many parents, he said, “don't hold our kids accountable for self-maintenance or contributing.”

The free pass Lancy refers to may hold back children, who stand to learn much from chores. These complex, multistep activities require sustained focus, planning, problem-solving, and a commitment to working toward a goal—all valuable skills for anyone to develop. Put together, these skills may lead to strong executive function. For young children, chores can also be intrinsically rewarding. When a kid folds a pile of laundry, they've created order out of chaos. Seeing their success, children can start to develop a sense of self-competence and self-efficacy—the belief that they'll succeed at a given task—which may boost their confidence. On a physical level, household tasks can lead to stronger fine-motor skills, which are essential for, say, zipping a jacket and handwriting, and which teachers report have been declining over the past several years. To help with these deficits, some parents seek occupational therapy for their children. But for many kids, at-home practice will suffice. A National Geographic article from earlier this year recommends activities such as squeezing sponges and pouring cups of water to improve grip and coordination. But helping with the dishes could naturally have kids wringing out sponges and emptying glasses into the sink, no special setup required.

Not only is incorporating skill-building into necessary tasks easier on parents; it can also help children feel like they belong, researchers told me. Chores are “social glue,” Lancy said. They integrate a child into the family and give them a purpose—and kids are eager to be involved. Studies have found that young children have a willingness to pitch in and support others. Angeline Lillard, a professor and the director of the Early Development Laboratory at the University of Virginia, told me that in one study she helped run, when children were given the choice between pretending to do a task, such as washing dishes or baking cookies, or doing one for real, most children opted to do it for real. When asked about their choice, the children said that they had opted for the real task because they wanted to contribute. According to Suzanne Gaskins, a cultural-developmental psychologist who has spent nearly 50 years studying children and their families, the motivation to engage in chores is simple: “Children want to go where the action is.” And there's a lot more action in a real kitchen than in a pretend one.

Many parents might insist that their kids don't want to help out—and they may have a point. Typically, very young children are the ones who are most excited to mimic their parents and lend a hand with laundry. But a toddler's contributions are often clumsy and, like the efforts of my Montessori preschoolers in September, may actually result in more work for the adult—so the adult shoos the child away. After enough times hearing “Go play,” the child will get the message, Michaeleen Doucleff, the author of Hunt, Gather, Parent, told me. Other parents may turn a simple chore into an involved lesson, with lots of talking and micromanaging, rather than allow the child to participate on their own. As Doucleff explained, this dynamic turns the child off as well.

Read: Why people wait 10 days to do something that takes 10 minutes

Much more effective is finding a middle ground between the two extremes. What this looks like will vary based on the kid. “A child could peel one carrot or even just watch,” Doucleff said. This approach might demand some patience and flexibility from parents at first. Children aren't going to be instantly capable at something they haven't had the opportunity to practice. But getting kids in the habit of helping early is much easier than convincing an older child who has never done chores to give them a try. For parents with resistant kids, their best hope is to avoid bribes, allowance, other incentives, and chore charts, and instead turn chores into a social activity. Saying “Let's do this together” can make a task more engaging, Barbara Rogoff, a distinguished professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, told me. And, if that fails, parents may have to simply enforce their expectations, Cara Goodwin, a child psychologist, said. Although kids may not like being held accountable at first, many will eventually gain satisfaction from a job well done.

None of this is as easy as it seems. I believe wholeheartedly in teaching children practical life skills, yet I still inadvertently turned my oldest two children off chores by micromanaging my first and shooing away my second. Guiding my students to tidy up came naturally. But once I had children of my own, I learned how a 3-year-old earnestly asking, “Can I help?” could sound like nails on a chalkboard. I'll admit that when I was exhausted, short-fused, and desperate to get dinner on the table, my children's budding self-efficacy wasn't front of mind.

I have four kids now. Over the past few years, welcoming all of their help has become easier, partly because I realized that I could spend more time with them if I included them in my routines. As my littlest ones tagged along with me, unloading the dishwasher, pulling clothes out of the dryer, and even mixing pancake batter, my older ones started asking to join in. Perhaps they wanted to be where the action was. Or maybe they wanted, as Gaskins suggested, “to give back to the people they love”—a common motivation for kids. When Gaskins told me this, her theory sounded a little idealistic. But when I asked my kids why they do housework, they all said it was because they wanted to help me. Turns out they were eager to pitch in all along. They were just waiting for me to let them.

Even wild animals' skin can burn, if they're living in unusual conditions.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

For all of the eons that animal life has existed on Earth, the sun has been there, too. And for all of those eons, animal life has had only one solution for intense exposure to the sun: evolution. Some creatures have thick, dark skin that's resistant to UV harm; others sprout fur, scales, or feathers that block the sun's rays. Many fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds may produce a compound that protects their cells against the sun's damaging effects. Hippos, weirdly, ooze a reddish, mucus-y liquid from their pores that absorbs light before it can destroy their skin. And plenty of creatures have evolved behaviors that take advantage of their environment—rolling around in dirt or mud, simply retreating into the shade.



But certain modern animals have sun problems that natural selection can't easily solve. Some reside at zoos that can't perfectly replicate their habitat; others live at latitudes that their ancestors didn't experience. Others spend too much time sunbathing in a living-room window, or sport sparse or light-colored fur or hair because their domesticators liked the way it looked. For these animals, people have come up with a shorter-term solution: sunscreen.



If, that is, a creature is willing to accept the treatment. Indu, an Asian elephant who lived at the Phoenix Zoo, was game. A few years ago, Heather Wright, one of the zookeepers, noticed the tops of Indu's ears pinking, peeling, and flaking in the summer heat, much like her human keepers' did. So her caretakers picked up some zinc-oxide-based sunblock—specially formulated for sensitive (human) skin—and dabbed it on the elephant. Indu, to be fair, was used to a level of care most wild animals don't enjoy. “We had already been applying lotion,” to manage dryness, Wright told me. The elephant knew the drill: Once in the barn, she'd lumber up to a window with an opening for her ear and stick the appendage through.



As far as zoo staff members could tell, the treatment helped. “There's nothing magical” about other animals' skin, Leslie Easterwood, a large-animal veterinarian at Texas A&M University, told me: Bake it in the sun, and it will burn. Scientists have spotted whales suffering from sunburns; cats, dogs, horses—even alpacas, turtles, and penguins—can develop all kinds of skin cancers. Pigs, in particular, “have skin most similar to humans,” Mitchell Song, a veterinary dermatologist based in Arizona told me. At Zoo Miami, keepers have spread mud on older, arthritic wild pigs who can't wallow as well as they did in their youth; they've also applied sunscreen to a babirusa, a species of swine native to Indonesia's forests, and to a Kunekune pig, Gwen Myers, the zoo's chief of animal health, told me.

In some sunny places, vets commonly recommend sunscreen for pets and other domesticated creatures, especially light-colored dogs and horses. Steve Valeika, a veterinarian in North Carolina, advises the same for “white cats that go outside.” This particular conundrum is one of our own making. “You don't see a lot of white-skinned animals in the wild,” Anthea Schick, a veterinary dermatologist in Arizona, told me. Only thanks to generations of selective breeding have they become a frequent presence in and around people's homes.

Of course, to sunscreen your pet, you have to … sunscreen your pet. Some pet owners, vets told me, are definitely flummoxed by the suggestion: “It's not widely discussed,” Schick told me. Vets are more unified in recommending teeth brushing for cats—and most cat owners still just decide they'd rather not. But some animals would certainly benefit from block: Schick told me she's seen her fair share of badly burned dogs, especially after long bouts of sunbathing that scorch their bellies. “We see a lot of sun-induced skin cancers that could be avoided,” she said. Pit bulls, Dalmatians, and other short-haired breeds are especially vulnerable; even long-haired white cats are sensitive around their eyes, their nose, and the tips of their ears. And Easterwood estimates that the majority of paint horses, left unprotected, will eventually develop skin issues. Squamous-cell-carcinoma cases make up the majority of her workload: “I see it every single day,” she said.



The vets I spoke with generally agreed: Don't bother with sprays, which a lot of animals find annoying or downright terrifying; reapply often, and well; it is way, way, way harder to sunscreen a cat than a dog, though some brave souls manage it. But although some vets recommended human sunscreens, formulated for kids or sensitive skin, others told me they preferred blends marketed for animals. (The FDA has dubbed just one pet sunscreen, made by a company called Epi-Pet and marketed to dogs and horses, “FDA compliant”—not the same as FDA approval, which requires rigorous safety testing.) Several warned against zinc oxide, which can be toxic to animals if ingested in large quantities; others felt that zinc oxide was worth the risk, unless administered to a tongue-bathing cat.



Regardless of the product they're offered, most animals generally aren't as eager as Indu to subject themselves to a human-led sun-protection ritual. And even she was usually plied with a five-gallon bucket of fruits and vegetables while her keepers tended her ears. At Zoo Miami, keeper Madison Chamizo told me she and her colleagues had to spend months training an okapi—an African mammal closely related to a giraffe—to accept caretakers gently scrubbing sunscreen onto her back with a modified Scotch-Brite dishwand, after she lost some patches of hair on her back to a fungal infection. But for creatures in very sunny parts of the world, the alternatives are, essentially, being cooped up indoors, kept away from windows, or wrestled into full-body sunsuits. (Some dogs don't mind; cats, once again, are unlikely to comply.)



And some sun-related problems, sunscreen can't fix. Gary West, the Phoenix Zoo's vet, told me he suspects that UV glare has caused eye inflammation in some of his animals; Myers, in Miami, worries about the sensitive skin around some species' eyes. “They're not really going to wear sunglasses for us,” Myers told me. So she and her colleagues have started to wonder: “Gosh, is this an animal that we could put a sun visor on?”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The country is witnessing the creation of an all-powerful institution, and one man is responsible.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

No one on the Supreme Court has gone further to enable Donald Trump's extreme exercise of presidential power than the chief justice of the United States, John Roberts. Associate justices have also written some important opinions shaping executive power, and the Court has issued ever more important unsigned orders, but the most transformative opinions—the opinions that directly legitimize Trump's unprecedented uses of power—are Roberts's handiwork. This is not happenstance. Under Supreme Court practice, the most senior justice in the majority—which is always the chief justice when he so votes—determines who will write the main opinion. Roberts reserved these milestones for himself.

And what milestones they have been. Roberts upheld the first Trump administration's “Muslim ban” on the grounds that the president's national-security role precludes courts from taking account of the bigotry undergirding an immigration order. He remanded a lower court's enforcement of a congressional subpoena for Trump's financial information, writing that “without limits on its subpoena powers,” Congress could exert “imperious” control over the executive branch and “aggrandize itself at the President's expense.” He has come close to giving the president an untrammeled right to fire any officer in the executive branch at will. And he took the lead in inventing a presidential immunity from criminal prosecution that could exempt the president from accountability for even the most corrupt exercises of his official functions.

Going beyond the precise holdings in these cases, Roberts's superfluous rhetoric about the presidency has cast the chief executive in all-but-monarchical terms. The upshot is a view of the Constitution that, in operation, comes uncomfortably close to vindicating Trump's: “I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.” Trump's confidence is surely bolstered also by the Roberts Court's unsigned per curiam opinions blocking even temporary relief from his sweeping actions. In May, the Court held that Trump orders removing two federal officials at key independent agencies could remain in place while the issue of their legality makes its way through the judiciary. In June, it allowed the administration to proceed with so-called third-country deportations—that is, deporting undocumented noncitizens summarily to countries to which they had no prior connection, but where they might well face torture. On July 8, the Court effectively allowed Trump to proceed with a massive restructuring of the federal executive branch, notwithstanding that the power over executive-branch organization belongs to Congress, not the president. On July 14, the conservative majority allowed the sabotaging of the Department of Education to proceed. Trump's use of executive power is not a distortion of the Roberts Court's theory of the presidency; it is the Court's theory of the presidency, come to life.

Adam Serwer: Why Trump thanked John Roberts

What America is witnessing is a remaking of the American presidency into something closer to a dictatorship. Trump is enacting this change and taking advantage of its possibilities, but he is not the inventor of its claim to constitutional legitimacy. That project is the work of John Roberts.

Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980 while Roberts was clerking for then–Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist, who represented, at the time, the far right on the Burger Court. Following his clerkship year, Roberts joined the Reagan administration as a special assistant to the attorney general, and then in short order was recruited in 1982 to join Reagan's White House staff as an associate counsel to the president. That same year, the Federalist Society was founded, and those two entities together—the Reagan administration and the Federalist Society—accelerated the mainstreaming of what until then had been a marginal view of presidential authority under the Constitution: “unitary-executive theory.” The core idea of the unitary executive was that the president, as the single head of the executive branch, was entitled to direct how all discretionary authorities of that branch would be exercised. On every question, the president would be, as George W. Bush later said, “the decider.”

In practical terms, debates over unitary-executive theory have centered on how far the president can go in firing people: Can he fire anyone at will, or may Congress protect at least some officials from discharge unless the president can show good cause for dismissal? Good cause is most often specified in the law as “inefficiency, malfeasance, or neglect.” At-will removal power would allow a president to purge the government of any resistance to his agenda. Roberts has all but made at-will removal the president's constitutionally guaranteed prerogative, and his rhetoric goes further yet. His opinions taken together create a dangerously authoritarian and largely ahistorical narrative about the constitutional presidency.

In Roberts's story, the president “alone composes a branch of government” and holds the “entirety” of executive power. All of the federal civil service—the thousands of administrative officers who wield executive power—do so on the president's behalf. What gives this system “legitimacy and accountability” is that “We, the People” get to vote for president. The thousands of subordinate officers involved in administering the federal government are accountable to “We, the People” only because they are tied to the president through “a clear and effective chain of command.” The point of absolute-removal power is precisely to enable the president to keep his underlings in line. The powers of removal and supervision, Roberts writes, are “conclusive and preclusive.” That is to say, at least in Roberts's narrative, Congress may not regulate the president's supervisory powers by statute, and courts may not examine their exercise.

The alternative to this narrative—the understanding of the constitutional presidency that, at least in broad strokes, had represented conventional wisdom until the advent of the Roberts Court—is an account of executive power woven into a system of checks and balances. Article II vests executive power in a president, to be sure. It assigns the president a number of exclusive roles, such as the negotiation of treaties and serving as commander in chief of the Army and Navy. But Article II also envisions a branch that includes “executive departments.” These departments have “duties,” most of which are to be set forth in statutes. Fulfilling statutory duties is the job of the agencies, which, in doing their work, act not on behalf of the president, but on behalf of Congress. The president's role in this scheme is one of supervision, not command. He is charged to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” The Constitution underscores the president's supervisory position by providing that he may “require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices.” This is not at all a one-person branch of government, and its design is not the prerogative of the president, but of Congress.

Aziz Huq: The Court's liberals are trying to tell Americans something

In 1980 and perhaps even now, unitary-executive theory would seem an odd position for conservatives and libertarians—the Federalist Society base—to adopt. But by then a strong presidency seemed the best and perhaps only route for yanking the American government in a much more conservative direction. During the 1960s and '70s, Congress, prodded on by a host of different social movements, enacted a panoply of statutory authorities that enabled ambitious liberal presidents to advance significant progressive policies. A president intent on rolling back that agenda would find doing so difficult. There exists no general statutory authority for shrinking government, and deregulation on a rule-by-rule basis is slow going and often legally vulnerable. Conservatives found their solution in Article II of the Constitution, which, if creatively reinterpreted, might give the president more authority to unilaterally undermine the regulatory state.

Over the next two decades, the conservative legal movement further developed its arguments for the unitary executive, the Federalist Society grew and became a powerful credentialing institution for the right, and Roberts's career soared, culminating in 2005 with his appointment as chief justice.

Roberts has not approached his work timidly. In the two decades of his tenure thus far, his opinions on executive power have created what might be called a proto-authoritarian canon, lending constitutional legitimacy to a kind of presidency that brooks no dissent, treats Congress as a subordinate institution, and need answer to no one except possibly to the Supreme Court itself.

It is hard to overstate how much is wrong in Roberts's narrative of the presidency. It muddles constitutional text. It flouts constitutional history. It is willfully ignorant of the risks of authoritarianism in a polarized, populist age. Its very premise—that the Constitution creates a one-person branch of government—is provably untrue by just reading the Constitution, which, again, refers to “executive departments.” The president's constitutional role does not require at-will removal power, except in the cases of those few officials who directly assist the president in fulfilling specific Article II roles. For all others—the overwhelming majority of government officers and employees—the president needs only the power to discharge persons who have failed to faithfully execute the law, thus providing “good cause” for their removal. The conditions under which the president may fire such officials is a matter for Congress to decide.

The idea that vesting the president with “the executive power” means “all” of the executive power is likewise not in the Article II text, which does not contain the word all. Where the word all does appear is in the Constitution's vesting in Congress the power to “make all laws which shall be necessary and proper” for executing its role and all others in the government. Far from signaling a wide swath of “conclusive and preclusive” executive authority, the text suggests a sweeping legislative power to prescribe how executive power is to be exercised.

The Roberts Court narrative fares no better on history than on text. The Court claims to be originalist and to be implementing a vision of the presidency that matches that of the Framers. The best that can be said about its opinions in this respect is that they have launched a scholarly renaissance among constitutional historians whose work demonstrates that the Court has the history wrong. One characteristic of several of the Court's most executive-indulgent opinions is the inclusion of blazingly incorrect statements of history.

Arguably the strangest of the Court's departures from history appears in Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in which Roberts wrote, “The Framers made the President the most democratic and politically accountable official in Government.” That statement, unfortunately, captures the precise opposite of the Framers' plan. Under the original Constitution, the president was the least electorally accountable official. House members were elected by voters. Senators would be chosen by state legislatures. The president would be chosen by presidential electors, and those temporary officials would be chosen in a manner to be determined by the legislature of each state.

Acknowledging the relative insulation of the original presidency from electoral politics underscores that the Roberts narrative of administrative “legitimacy and accountability” is also wrong. What would legitimize executive power in the Framers' scheme would not be electoral accountability, but the quality of government, the character of officeholders, and the fidelity of officeholders to the law.

Read: The Supreme Court won't explain itself

Seila Law is not an isolated example of ignoring or inventing history. Roberts's presidential-immunity opinion has not a word to say about either the Richard Nixon pardon or Bill Clinton's nonprosecution deal during his last weeks in office—incidents obviously relevant to understanding how earlier presidents assessed the scope of immunity. Likewise, the per curiam opinion keeping in place for now Trump's unlawful firings of two independent administrators purports not to threaten the independence of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. “The Federal Reserve,” the Court says, is not the same as other independent agencies; it is instead “a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.” The problem with that assurance is that there is virtually no resemblance between the 19th-century Banks of the United States, on one hand, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, on the other. If the president is constitutionally entitled to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, there is no obvious principled reason he cannot also fire members of the Fed.

The Court has presumably shown concern for the Fed's independence because giving presidents direct control over the monetary supply would predictably lead to greater inflation, which would be bad for investors. Decision makers serving at a president's pleasure may be driven less by long-term price and employment trends—their assignment from Congress—and more by the president's short-term political concerns. But in one way or another, Congress has similarly determined for a host of other major agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, that the quality of their decision making will be best served if directed by a bipartisan group of experts, any of whom may express policy disagreement with the president without fear of reprisal. Under the system of checks and balances that the Constitution was intended to enable, administrative agencies thus shoulder accountability to the Congress that created them and the courts that review them, not just to a president who believes, “I hold all the levers, and have all the cards.”

The nation is now just six months into the experiment of what happens when a knows-no-bounds president takes office under a Court committed to a unitary executive. The results are alarming. As a matter of principle, anyone concerned with preserving robust constitutional checks and balances should be disturbed by a president's overweening unilateralism, regardless of that president's policy agenda. In Trump's case, however, the threat to democracy is at its zenith because unitary-executive theory is being pushed to enable an authoritarian agenda on every front. Trump seems to believe he is effectively the unitary head not just of government, but of the nation. He appears determined to squelch any resistance within the government—and to force submission to his program by the media, universities, the legal profession, and apparently even entire cities. Roberts's assurance that elections render the unitary president “directly accountable to the people” for so blatant an antidemocratic program appears meaningless against the backdrop of Trump's authoritarian tactics.

The Roberts Court so far has been mostly generous to the administration, handing it a set of technically narrow procedural wins that, for the moment at least, have blocked relief in the lower courts. When the Court must finally resolve the controversies concerning birthright citizenship, the capricious withholding of government grants, the unauthorized dismantling of government agencies, or the use of extortionate tactics to secure the submissiveness of independent institutions, John Roberts will likely again write opinions for a majority. Ideally, he will be open to rethinking his extreme version of what the presidency represents and what the chief executive may do without meaningful legal accountability. But given the path he has taken so far, optimism seems naive.

Climate facts are inconvenient — so Trump is making them disappear.﻿

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. 

For 25 years, a group of the country's top experts has been fastidiously tracking the ways that climate change threatens every part of the United States. Their findings informed the National Climate Assessments, a series of congressionally mandated reports released every four years that translated the science into accessible warnings for policymakers and the public. But that work came to a halt this spring when the Trump administration abruptly dismissed all 400 experts working on the next edition. Then, late last month, all of the past reports vanished too, along with the federal website they lived on.



A lot of information about the changing climate has disappeared under President Donald Trump's second term, but the erasure of the National Climate Assessments is “by far the biggest loss we've seen,” said Gretchen Gehrke, who monitors federal websites with the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. The National Climate Assessments were one of the most approachable resources that broke down how climate change will affect the places people care about, she said. The reports were also used by a wide swath of stakeholders — policymakers, farmers, businesses — to guide their decisions about the future. While the reports have been archived elsewhere, they're no longer as easy to access. And it's unclear what, if anything, will happen to the report that was planned for 2027 or 2028, which already existed in draft form.

So why did the reports survive Trump's first term, but not his second?

You could view their disappearance in a few different ways, experts said — as a flex of executive power, an escalation in the culture war over climate change, or a strategic attempt to erase the scientific foundation for climate policy. “If you suppress information and data, then you don't have the evidence you need to be able to create regulations, strengthen regulations, and even to combat the repeal of regulations,” Gehrke said.

This isn't climate denial in the traditional sense. The days of loudly debating the science have mostly given way to something quieter and more insidious: a campaign to withhold the raw information itself. “I don't know if we're living in climate denial anymore,” said Leah Aronowsky, a science historian at the Columbia Climate School. “We have this new front of denial by erasure.”

By cutting funding for research and withholding crucial data, the Trump administration is making it harder to know exactly how the planet is changing.

In April, the administration pulled nearly $4 million in funding from a Princeton program to improve computer models predicting changes in the oceans and atmosphere, claiming the work created “climate anxiety” among young people. That same month, the Environmental Protection Agency failed to submit its annual report to the United Nations detailing the country's greenhouse gas emissions. In May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ended its 45-year tradition of tracking billion-dollar weather disasters. Trump also hopes to shut down the Mauna Loa laboratory in Hawaii, which has measured the steady rise in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide since the 1950s — the first data to definitively show humans were changing the climate.

“This kind of wholesale suppression of an entire field of federally sponsored research, to my knowledge, is historically unprecedented,” Aronowsky said.

In a response to a request for comment, a NASA spokesperson said that it has “no legal obligations to host globalchange.gov's data,” referring to the site that hosted the National Climate Assessments, adding that the US Global Change Research Program had already “met its statutory requirements by presenting its reports to Congress.” The EPA directed Grist to a webpage containing past greenhouse gas emissions reports, as well as a version of what was supposed to be this year's report obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund. However, the agency confirmed that the latest data has not been officially released. The White House declined to comment, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration did not respond.

Climate denial first took off in the 1990s, when the oil and gas companies and industry-friendly think tanks started sowing doubt about climate science.

Last year, a leaked training video from Project 2025 — the policy roadmap organized by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank — showed a former Trump official declaring that political appointees would have to “eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere.” The strategy appears to be designed to boost the fossil fuel industry at a time when clean energy has become competitive and the reality of climate change harder to dismiss, as floods, fires, and heat waves have become perceptibly worse. “We will drill, baby, drill,” Trump said in his inauguration speech in January.

The administration hasn't exactly been subtle about its endgame. Lee Zeldin, the head of the EPA, doesn't deny the reality of climate change (he calls himself a “climate realist”), but he's zealously dismantled environmental programs and has recommended that the White House strike down the “endangerment finding,” the bedrock of US climate policy. It comes from a 2007 Supreme Court ruling on the Clean Air Act that required the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants since they endanger public health. If the administration can convince the courts that climate change isn't a health consideration, it could end that regulatory obligation.

“If you're removing information about climate change, its reality, and its impact on people, then I think it's a lot easier to make the case that it's not an environmental health issue,” Gehrke said.

There's a word for the idea that ignorance can serve political ends: agnotology (from the Greek “agnosis,” or “not knowing”), the study of how knowledge is deliberately obscured. What Trump is doing to information about climate change fits squarely in that tradition, according to Aronowsky: “If you remove it, then in a certain sense, it no longer exists, and therefore, there's nothing to even debate, right?”

Climate denial first took off in the 1990s, when the oil and gas companies and industry-friendly think tanks started sowing doubt about climate science. Over the decades, as the evidence became rock-solid, those who opposed reducing the use of fossil fuels gradually shifted from outright denying the facts to attacking solutions like wind and solar power. What the Trump administration is doing now marks a radical break from this long-term trend, said John Cook, a climate misinformation researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.

“This is a 180, not just a turn, but diving into something we've never even seen before,” he said. On the other hand, Cook said, the administration is taking a classic climate denial tactic — painting scientists as “alarmists” or conspirators who can't be trusted — and turning it into government policy.

Half a year in, the second Trump administration's treatment of climate information hasn't yet reached the “eradication” levels that Project 2025 aspired to, at least on government websites. The EPA's climate change website, for instance, is still up and running, even though all references to the phenomenon were erased on the agency's home page. Most of the website deletions so far have served to isolate climate change as an issue, erasing its relationship to topics such as health and infrastructure, Gehrke said. Up until the National Climate Assessments disappeared, she would have said that “climate erasure” was an inappropriate characterization of what's happening. “But now, I'm really not so sure,” she said.

Rachel Cleetus, the senior policy director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, thinks that the administration's actions actually go beyond erasure. “They're literally trying to change the basis on which a lot of policymaking is advanced — the science basis, the legal basis, and the economic basis,” she said. Her biggest concern isn't just what facts have been removed, but what political propaganda might replace them. “That's more dangerous, because it really leaves people in this twilight zone, where what's real, and what's important, and what is going to affect their daily lives is just being obfuscated.”

The commonsense, zero-cost fix that Congress wouldn't touch.

There exists an almost absurdly simple fix that could help ease the housing crisis. It would cost the government nothing, require deleting just five words from a 50-year-old federal law, and has enjoyed quiet support from housing researchers and leaders for decades.

The target is an obscure regulation that requires every manufactured home to be built on a “permanent chassis” — a steel trailer frame that can attach to wheels. The idea was that the chassis was necessary — even after the home was installed and the wheels taken off — because manufactured houses, which trace their roots to World War II trailers, could theoretically be moved. Yet by the mid-1970s, most never left their original site, and the chassis remained unused, notable only as a design feature that made the homes stick out.

Getting rid of this “permanent chassis” mandate could make manufactured homes — already home to 21 million Americans, most of whom earn under $50,000 a year — more attractive, more socially accepted, and even more affordable than they already are.

Roughly 100,000 new manufactured homes are produced each year, but production is down sharply from the 1970s, just before the rule took effect. With 152 existing factories already capable of producing these types of homes, industry leaders say striking the chassis requirement could help scale up manufacturing by hundreds of thousands of houses, especially if paired with zoning reforms. The policy tweak could offer real relief for the housing crunch, especially for first-time buyers and older adults looking to downsize.

Although the change seemed simple to implement, lawmakers failed to amend the mandate for over three decades. There wasn't overwhelming opposition to the proposal, but just enough resistance to nudge politicians toward issues more likely to boost their political capital. But as the housing crisis has intensified nationwide, pressure on Congress to use one of its few direct tools to boost housing supply has become harder to ignore.

Advocates of eliminating the chassis rule think victory might finally be in reach: The Senate Banking Committee is expected to take up the issue in a hearing later this month, as part of a housing package sponsored by Tim Scott, the committee's Republican chair.

The permanent chassis rule and its history offer a window into how smart ideas that could solve real problems can still languish for decades in the fog of federal process. But it also shows what it takes to move even obvious reforms from inertia to action.

Nearly 40 years ago, policy experts began to notice a troubling trend: For the first time since the Great Depression, homeownership rates were dropping and home prices were going up, partly due to higher interest rates. In 1990, the typical first-time homebuyer earned about $23,400 annually — enough to afford a home up to $59,600, according to the Los Angeles Times, citing data from the National Association of Realtors. But the median price of a new single-family home was roughly $129,900, and existing homes weren't much cheaper, with a median price of $97,500.

But there was a bright spot: manufactured homes. Built in factories on assembly lines, these homes benefit from standardized materials, streamlined labor, and weather-controlled conditions, making them significantly less expensive than traditional site-built housing.Though long associated with dingy mobile trailers, by the late 20th century many manufactured houses were nearly indistinguishable from site-built ones, offering full kitchens, pitched roofs, and front porches. Nearly 13 million people lived in them.

Consumers buying manufactured homes “are demonstrating a preference for new construction that is less spacious, has a simpler design with fewer amenities, and uses less expensive materials,” read one HUD-commissioned report from 1998. “Any perception that consumers today would not be interested in new conventionally-built starter homes with very basic designs and fewer ‘extras' is mistaken.”

Yet despite evident consumer demand, the chassis mandate held the sector back. It made production more expensive, restricted architecture flexibility, and gave state and local governments a pretext to exclude the homes through zoning. The permanent chassis feature allowed cities to more easily ban the housing in a given area for being “mobile” structures, even when they were permanently installed.

The chassis requirement originated in the Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, Congress's first and only national housing code. Lawmakers justified the need for federal standards both to streamline manufacturing and to protect consumers, especially from fire hazards. The law was modeled on the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, reflecting the industry's roots in homes on wheels.

Yet many advocates believe that the chassis rule was included as sabotage by the powerful National Association of Home Builders, which saw manufactured housing as a fast-growing rival to its site-built homes.

“They put it in the original law in 1974 because they were worried about a competitive disadvantage and it's lived there ever since,” said Lesli Gooch, the head of the Manufactured Housing Institute, the largest trade group for the industry.

Regardless of whether one believes the site-built housing industry was originally responsible for hobbling manufactured housing with the chassis rule, it's indisputable that NAHB was one of the most ardent champions for keeping it there.

Following a failed lawsuit in the mid-1980s to eliminate the rule, the first major legislative attempt came in 1990, when Rep. John Hiler, a Republican from Indiana, introduced amendments to the law. Despite backing from the manufactured housing industry and initial subcommittee approval, the effort ultimately died.

Democrats caved to consumer groups concerned that striking the requirement could lead to lowering other safety standards and to opposition by both the site-built housing industry and HUD. Whether through bureaucratic complacency or regulatory capture by traditional homebuilders, the federal housing agency rarely pressed, and in some cases actively opposed, amending the law, despite its own research detailing again and again the problems a permanent chassis posed for manufactured housing.

Four years later, the National Commission on Manufactured Housing formally recommended eliminating the chassis requirement, affirming that the homes could be built just as safely without one. (Homes without a chassis would still be subject to all HUD construction standards.) But the report arrived just months before the 1994 midterm elections, and Congress was already consumed by fierce partisan battles over budget and crime bills.

Some critics believe the two main trade groups — the Manufactured Housing Institute and the less prominent Manufactured Housing Association for Regulatory Reform —often failed to be as politically aggressive about removing the chassis rule as they could have been.

When I asked Gooch why it's taken so long for Congress to tackle this issue, she acknowledged her group didn't really start applying pressure until eight years ago.

“In 2017, I had a dialogue with our technical activities committee, and we said, ‘Okay, what is it that we need to do to move manufactured housing forward?' and the chassis issue was raised,” Gooch recalled. It was then, she said, that MHI started to really discuss how to change the legislation.

MHI now takes credit for neutralizing opposition from traditional homebuilders, and notes some of its biggest members are also members of NAHB, which likely helped too. Other advocates I spoke to argue that NAHB just is in a weaker place politically to fight these kinds of reforms than in the past, given the scale of the housing crisis.

Liz Thompson, a spokesperson for NAHB, told me that while her group is not “publicly lobbying” against changing the chassis rule, they do still have “concerns” that the manufactured housing sector is being held to less stringent wind and energy standards, creating “an economic disadvantage” for their site-built home members.

Mike Kingsella, who leads Up for Growth, a federal housing supply advocacy group, said his lobbying over the last eight years has led him to conclude there's no such thing as a straightforward fix in Congress.

“Even the most practical and well-reasoned proposals face uphill battles and significant delays,” he said. Many housing advocates working at the state level are used to a more linear legislative process, where bills move predictably through committees to a governor's desk, Kingsella noted. But in Congress, where standalone bills rarely advance, the whole process becomes a more intense battle of competing priorities on larger, must-pass packages.

So for decades, the issue has languished, too technical to generate public pressure, too threatening for quiet passage, and not high-profile enough for any politician to really champion it.

Manufactured housing has never lacked a compelling economic case — but today, it's become far harder to dismiss. Factory-built homes stand out as one of the most obvious ways to move the needle on affordability—and one of the few housing tools within the federal government's reach. That it doesn't deepen the deficit is an added plus.

It was the housing crisis that helped spur Fannie Mae's launch of a new program in 2018 aimed at integrating manufactured homes into traditional neighborhoods. And the country's shortage of homes has motivated a wider and more skilled coalition of advocates to step up for the sector. Influential writers like Matt Yglesias have championed the cause of manufactured housing, and last year, the Washington Post ran an op-ed by two economists making one of the most prominent arguments for chassis rule removal in the media yet.

On the state level, advocates have recently been successful at pushing for new laws banning exclusionary zoning of manufactured housing. Last year Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island passed such protections, and Kentucky followed suit this year.

The buzzy “abundance” movement, fueled by Ezra Klein (a Vox co-founder) and Derek Thompson's bestselling book, has also helped shift the politics around regulatory reform — including most recently in California, where Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to weaken a state environmental law long blamed for blocking housing construction. And Barack Obama, who spoke about the need to build more housing at the Democratic National Convention last August, came out harder this month with a blunt assessment, telling donors that “I don't want to know your ideology, because you can't build anything. It does not matter.”

Even with everyone supposedly on board, legislative reform can still move surprisingly slowly.

In 2023, Republican Rep. John Rose of Tennessee introduced a bill to strike the five words “built on a permanent chassis” from the definition of a manufactured home in federal law. But MHI withdrew its support.

The trade group, which represents not just manufacturers but also lenders, retailers, and insurers, cited the need to further study the proposal to assess potential ripple effects that could hurt state and local players. This vague stance puzzled advocates, given that any federal change would still include a transition period for states and cities to align their regulations.

Similarly stymied — though for different reasons — was Sen. Scott's Road to Housing Act last year, a package of bills aimed at boosting affordability that included striking the chassis rule. Then-Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, blocked the package because it also included a bill that could have required minor changes from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and possibly the Dodd-Frank Act — a can of worms Brown preferred not to open. Brown lost his election in November, and Scott now sits as chair.

Scott's bill proposes a somewhat softer version of Rose's 2023 legislation. Scott's would offer states flexibility around chassis requirements, with the idea that states would have time to harmonize whatever other laws and rules they needed to.

Though this offers a less immediate fix, most advocates are cautiously hopeful about this state opt-in strategy, so long as it doesn't include legislative poison pills — meaning provisions that would make the policy unworkable in practice.

“We're open to multiple approaches, we just want to make sure that there aren't any drafting errors in a state-by-state certification approach that might permanently prevent states from certifying their compliance…in the event that they miss their first certification deadline,” said Alex Armlovich, a Niskanen Center housing analyst who has been advocating for the change.

Sean Roberts, the CEO of Villa, a company that produces factory-built accessory dwelling units, says removing the permanent chassis rule will result in more homes getting built across the board. “People could afford the homes more easily. Kind of everybody wins, you know, there's not a whole lot of downside to it,” he said. “So we're very supportive of it, and we see it as being a really positive thing.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Russia is making so many Iranian Shahed drones that it could soon launch 2,000 of them in a single night","https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-shahed-drones-launch-2000-one-night-german-general-analysis-2025-7","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 06:54:00 GMT","

The Kremlin is building its way toward a reality where it can soon launch 2,000 Shahed one-way attack drones in one night, according to two recent Western assessments.

Maj. Gen. Christian Freuding, the German defense ministry's commander of planning and command staff, said in a Bundeswehr interview aired on Saturday that Russia was ""striving to further increase production capacity"" of its Shaheds.

""They want to expand the drone attacks we just talked about,"" Freuding said. ""The ambition is to be able to deploy 2,000 drones simultaneously.""

""We need to consider intelligent countermeasures,"" he added.

In a separate assessment on Sunday, the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, wrote that Russia's per-night use of Shahed drones increased by 31% each month in June and July.

""ISW assesses that Russia may be able to launch up to 2,000 drones in one night by November 2025, should this current growth trend in drone usage continue,"" its analysts wrote.

However, they added that Russia likely wouldn't be able to consistently sustain 2,000 drone launches per day.

Still, such capacity would be a stark jump from the fall of 2024, when Russia was launching roughly 2,000 drones a month at Ukraine.

Shaheds are long-range Iranian exploding drones with estimated ranges of 600 to 1,200 miles, depending on the design. This year, Russia has continually increased the number of Shaheds and decoy drones it launches a night at Ukraine, recently peaking at 728 uncrewed aerial vehicles in one salvo earlier this month.

As these numbers surge, Ukraine and its allies fear that Russia's nightly attacks will overwhelm Kyiv's air defenses.

""There will be 1,000 units per day and more. I'm not trying to scare anyone,"" wrote Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi, commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, wrote on July 4 about Russia's Shahed capacity.

The Shahed is of Iranian design, but Russia has also been manufacturing its own versions of the drone locally in the Yelabuga Special Economic Zone since early 2023. Western governments and analysts say some vital parts for production come from China.

In April, analysts from the International Institute for Strategic Studies wrote that satellite imagery showed that the area of Shahed-producing facilities has doubled since 2023.

""Despite a steady flow of Shahed-136s from Iran, Moscow is heavily investing in its own production facilities,"" the IISS analysts wrote.

Ukraine has periodically tried to strike Yelabuga with its own long-range fixed-wing drones, but it's unclear if the factories have sustained any significant damage.

Kyiv's military intelligence also said in February that it had found production markings on some attack drones that mention the city of Izhevsk, possibly pointing to another production line there.

Freuding, the German general, said that against such quantity, it would be nonsensical to rely on expensive Western interceptors such as the Patriot system to destroy Shaheds.

""We essentially need countermeasures that cost two, three, four thousand euros,"" he said. By comparison, a single Patriot system costs the US government $1.1 billion, and one of its missiles can cost about $4 million.

Ukraine now uses a multilayered air defense network against Shahed waves, including surface-to-air missiles, air-launched missiles, and mobile fire groups that try to shoot down the Iranian drones with machine guns. A locally made interceptor drone, the Sting, is becoming popular, too.

But Russia also fires ballistic missiles in tandem with the Shahed drones, and these require more advanced, long-range air defenses such as the Patriot to intercept. Kyiv is trying to persuade the US and its allies to provide it with more Patriot systems.

What started as a startup Cinderella story has quickly turned into a cautionary tale for future deals in Silicon Valley.

Windsurf, an AI coding company, was on the verge of being acquired by OpenAI for $3 billion, the kind of windfall startup employees dream of. But the blockbuster deal fell apart at the last minute, setting off a whirlwind of last-minute negotiations that left employees in the dark about their future.

The end result — a company split in two with its CEO and top talent getting bought out for far more than the rest of its employees.

""This breaks the Silicon Valley social contract,"" said Amjad Masad, CEO of Replit, a competitor to Windsurf. ""This is bad for startup employees. They're going to be less likely to join startups. What's the point of joining a startup and working your ass off if you might get screwed?""

It was only a few weeks ago that the kind of life-changing event early startup employees dream about happened at Windsurf: OpenAI announced it was buying the AI-powered coding startup for $3 billion.

When he read the news, Dave Pack, a Los Angeles startup founder, opened a group chat and congratulated his friend who works at Windsurf, whom he declined to name. He joked that with his friend's sudden change in net worth, he could afford to foot the bill for their next guys' trip.

""I was really excited for him,"" Pack said. ""He's pretty senior, so it's not like he had a small chunk of equity. When you join a company and it gets acquired for $3 billion, that's for the history books. That's a giant success in this industry.""

It was not to be.

Discussions with OpenAI fizzled, and there was a new suitor: Google. But instead of acquiring Windsurf, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent and license the company's intellectual property. The hundreds of employees who remained at Windsurf were left adrift until last Monday, when Cognition sent a life raft in the form of buying what remains of the company.

""It was some of the most insane 72 hours I've seen in startup land,"" said Maor Fridman, a general partner at F2.

Windsurf's new CEO, Jeff Wang, took to X over the weekend to share details on the frenzied 48 hours it took for Windsurf to figure out a path forward after the OpenAI deal and to hash out the acquisition by Cognition.

""It was my job to explain to the company our path forward,"" Wang, who was formerly the company's head of business, wrote in a post on X.

""The mood was very bleak,"" Wang wrote. ""Some people were upset about financial outcomes or colleagues leaving, while others were worried about the future. A few were in tears.""

Terms were not disclosed, though the Cognition deal appears to be far lower than what OpenAI originally offered. Three sources estimated Cognition, which itself is only worth $4 billion, paid about $300 million in stock.

Spokespeople for Windsurf and Google declined to comment. Varun Mohan, the cofounder of Windsurf who is now part of Google; Scott Wu, cofounder and CEO of Cognition; and Jeff Wang, Windsurf's new CEO, all did not respond to requests for comment.

Cognition said ""100% of Windsurf employees will participate financially"" in the deal and ""they will also have all vesting cliffs waived and will receive fully accelerated vesting for their work to date.""

The last-ditch deal was a far better outcome for employees than many feared after the Google acquisition, but some VCs feel that the transaction sets a dangerous precedent.

""It's a pretty sad place to be,"" said Deedy Das, an investor at Menlo Ventures. ""When you join a company, you expect decisions to be made together, so this does have a chilling effect on founding team members.""

""Windsurf and others are really bad examples of founders leaving their teams behind and not even sharing the proceeds with their team,"" wrote storied investor Vinod Khosla on X. ""I definitely would not work with their founders next time.""

Traditionally, early employees are willing to accept less cash and more equity while working 100-hour weeks in the hope that they will share in the upside should their company be acquired someday.

""If an exit can happen and you don't participate in it, that's pretty bad for startup employees,"" said Masad. ""It's just broadly bad for the startup ecosystem for these deals to be financially engineered in this way.""

After the Google deal, Masad took to X to offer an olive branch, inviting Windsurf employees to decamp to Replit.

""If you were part of Windsurf and got left behind, we'd like to talk,"" he wrote. ""We've passed on many acquisitions over the years, and any liquidity has always included employees."" (Masad said he's still having ""conversations"" with some employees, but most have chosen to go to Cognition.)

Some Windsurf investors have also been critical of the deal. While they are happy to get some return on their investment, it's hardly the venture-style outcome they hoped for.

""The problem is that the company technically didn't actually fully realize that decacorn potential, which was the reason we invested in them,"" said Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures, referring to a startup worth more than $10 billion. ""We would've preferred to just take a clean exit from OpenAI. That was a nice, very simple acquisition. Now this is a bit of a fucking mess.""

Ramadurai is also unsettled by what the deal means for the future of the company and its employees.

""Their mojo gets thrown in the blender,"" Ramadurai said. ""The key leaders and the engineers that get poached are all stoked, but everybody else that's left behind is in this weird purgatory situation because they have to maintain the momentum even though they lost the key talent in the leadership.""

What happened at Windsurf follows other unusually structured deals for Character AI, Inflection, and Scale AI, where Big Tech companies avoided outright acquiring a company in order to gain access to its founders and top AI researchers.

In the case of Scale AI, Meta paid $14 billion for a 49 percent stake in the data labeling company and hired its founder, Alexandr Wang, to run its Superintelligence group. Meta also hired some of the startup's researchers. Last week, Scale AI laid off 14% of its workforce, or 200 employees, and revealed it is unprofitable.

Every transaction is different, and in the case of Windsurf, the company was not seen as having conventionally elite AI talent.

""Google sees Windsurf as an autonomous software engineer —an AI that's as productive as an elite full-stack team, or maybe even a department,"" said Danny Pantuso, an investor at Mucker Capital. ""Through that lens, Google's license fee resembles an upfront payment for permanent access to this capability, similar to Microsoft's deal with OpenAI.""

What all these deals have in common is that they can close quickly and avoid regulatory scrutiny — two benefits that mean this type of transaction is only going to become more common, according to Steve Brotman, managing partner at Alpha Partners.

""This isn't a one-off, it's part of a broader pattern where Big Tech hedges its bets,"" Brotman said. ""Licensing is faster, cheaper, and less political than full-on acquisitions, especially in an environment where regulatory scrutiny is intense.""

For startup employees, that makes it more important than ever to make sure they are joining the right company, according to Jake Saper, a general partner at Emergence Capital.

""Startups with unique data feeds, embedded distribution or clear recurring revenue have leverage to stay independent,"" Saper said. ""If a company's main asset is a brilliant but portable research team, you should assume Big Tech will come knocking.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Anthropic's cofounder says Meta's 'mega-offers' weren't enough to lure his team","https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-meta-offer-ai-talent-war-poaching-startups-2025-7","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 06:11:00 GMT","

Not even big offers from Meta were enough to tempt the team at Anthropic, said the AI startup's cofounder, Benjamin Mann.

""It's not a hard choice,"" Mann said on an episode of ""Lenny's Podcast"" published Sunday.

Other AI startups have seen key talent poached by mega paydays.

""I think we've been maybe much less affected than many of the other companies in the space because people here are so mission-oriented,"" he said. ""They get these offers and then they say, 'Well, of course I'm not going to leave because my best case scenario at Meta is that we make money, and my best case at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity.""

Mann also said he doesn't blame anyone who takes those ""mega offers."" 

""Other people have different life circumstances,"" he said.

His comments come as tech giants like Meta and OpenAI engage in a fierce talent war, offering massive payouts to top AI researchers.

""I'm pretty sure it's real,"" Mann said, referring to Meta's $100 million signing bonuses offered to AI engineers.

""To pay individuals like $100 million over a four-year package, that's actually pretty cheap compared to the value created for the business,"" he said. ""We're just in an unprecedented era of scale, and it's only going to get crazier.""

Mann also said that he and several other leaders left OpenAI in 2020 to start Anthropic because ""safety wasn't the top priority there.""

A former researcher told Fortune last year that nearly half of OpenAI's safety team had exited.

""People who are primarily focused on thinking about AGI safety and preparedness are being increasingly marginalized,"" said Daniel Kokotajlo, a former governance researcher.

OpenAI said safety remains central to its mission. ""Our responsibility to prepare for emerging security threats to users, customers, and global communities shapes everything we do,"" the company said on its website.

The tech giant added that its API and ChatGPT products undergo routine third-party testing to ""identify security weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.""

Mann, Anthropic, and OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Big Tech has always paid top dollar for elite talent, but the latest AI hiring frenzy has taken things to a whole new level, as BI previously reported.

It started when Meta recruited Scale's CEO, Alexandr Wang, last month as part of a $14.3 billion deal to take a 49% stake in his company. Then, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said Meta had tried to poach his best employees with $100 million signing bonuses. Meta pushed back, saying that the signing bonuses were not that generous.

Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced last month that Wang would co-lead a new superintelligence unit with six top researchers from OpenAI.

The bidding war for top AI talent has been likened to sports franchises competing for star athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo.

Perplexity's CEO, Aravind Srinivas, said on a podcast published Thursday that Big Tech companies need to ensure that employees are motivated by mission as well as money.

""You're encountering new kinds of challenges. You feel a lot of growth, you're learning new things. And you're getting richer, too, along the way. Why would you want to go just because you have some guaranteed payments?"" he said.

Srinivas also said that he was ""surprised by the magnitude"" of the salaries Zuckerberg is reportedly offering to top AI researchers, adding that it ""seems like it's needed at this point for them.""

With the massive salaries, ""failure is not an option"" for Meta's new team, Srinivas said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Millennials, it's a good time to take a break from your manager era","https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-manager-layoffs-increased-work-responsibilities-job-search-2025-7","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 08:04:00 GMT","

Mary Monohan, 37, saw the signs when the powers that be started reorganizing teams and switching up her assignments: Layoffs were coming.

By the time she learned her manager role was being eliminated, she'd already been searching for new opportunities. Less than a month later, she's starting to realize that she may have to be willing to make a lateral professional move or even ""a few thousand dollars less than I was making before,"" she told Business Insider.

Millennials in management are in a tough spot. Caught somewhere between entry-level roles and the C-suite, they're especially vulnerable to the Great Flattening, a trend of eliminating middle managers brought on by companies' desires to cut costs and bureaucracy. Those who are let go may have to accept lower pay or titles in their next role, while those who remain are left to take on extra responsibilities and reports.

Daniel Radmanovic, 40, was laid off from his managerial position at Deloitte in October. He started actively job searching in January and said it was a ""soul-sucking learning experience.""

However, on Friday, Radmanovic received a verbal job offer from a Fortune 500 company. He described it as a ""pivot"" because he'll be in a client-facing individual contributor role and not managing people, but it isn't a step back since he's excited to embrace the change.

""I can just focus on my job and my clients,"" he told Business Insider, adding, ""I can't tell you how excited I am to be getting this role.""

Are you a middle manager? Please fill out this quick Google form or reach out to these reporters at mhoff@businessinsider.com and allisonkelly@businessinsider.com

Many older millennials have found themselves caught in the Great Flattening.

Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform, found that 35- to 44-year-olds are being hardest hit by manager firings or layoffs at 8,500 of its small and midsize business clients. Layoffs among that age group of managers rose more than 400% between January 2022 and September 2024, compared to a decline of 48% for 55- to 64-year-olds.

Managers who survive the layoffs face another problem: a growing pool of direct reports. Gusto data showed that individual contributors per people manager nearly doubled from 3.2 in January 2019 to 5.8 in September 2024, based on the sample of small and midsize businesses analyzed. This means that many of today's managers have to balance a growing slate of 1:1 meetings, staff questions, and paperwork.

In Monohan's experience, having a good manager is important for people's experience at work, especially for an entry-level worker.

""Your manager plays a huge role in getting you promoted, getting you seen, getting you a raise, a bonus,"" Monohan said. ""I've worked hard as a manager to try and get people that worked under me recognized, and sometimes it could take six months or longer to get them the bonus or the recognition that they deserve.""

She added that she's not sure what will happen with some of her outstanding duties, like her former report's performance review.

""There are these open threads,"" she said. ""You're just hoping companies are going to be able to pick up the pieces and move forward with, when it comes to the people you were managing.""

The job market isn't all doom and gloom for millennials. The US rate of layoffs and discharges is still low. Plus, the unemployment rate for 35- to 44-year-olds continues to be lower than the overall unemployment rate — 3.2% compared to 4.1% in June.

Monohan is confident her past experience will lead to a job, but is worried about how soon she can get one and the lack of opportunities available.

""As a single person without a second income or healthcare plan to fall back on, I have to know my worth but also face the realities of how long I can be out of work without having to move in with family or make dramatic life changes,"" Monohan said.

She said she can't be picky in the current job market. She's open to individual contributor roles, but would ideally get another manager job. In the meantime, she's been networking and might take on some contract work. Others in her position have told BI they are settling for work they feel overqualified for to pay the bills.

Radmanovic recommends not going through the job search process alone, if possible. He said he frequently talked to another laid-off Deloitte worker. They gave each other advice, helped with interview preparation, and commiserated during the process. Radmanovic already told the former coworker the good news about the job offer and hopes they will land one soon.

""Sometimes it's nice to just vent with somebody that's going through that as well,"" Radmanovic said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Veteran investors are baffled as AI hype and Fed cuts push stocks past danger signs","https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/reasons-why-wall-street-stock-markets-complacent-trump-trade-tariffs-2025-7","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 02:14:00 GMT","

Stock markets are shrugging off major risks and smashing records — so much so that even seasoned investors are scratching their heads.

On Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 closed little changed after notching record highs on Thursday. Both indexes are hovering near the all-time highs they reached earlier this month, continuing a rebound after the post-""Liberation Day"" sell-off.

That rebound has stunned analysts, given the pile-up of macro risks, particularly President Donald Trump's ongoing threats to impose steep tariffs on key trading partners. Yet investors keep piling in — even if many are doing so with one eye on the exit.

""In many ways, this is a rally that really no one's had much conviction in it,"" Andrew Pease, the Asia Pacific head of investments for Russell Investments, told Business Insider.

He said the firm's analysis shows investors are neutral, not euphoric.

""Everyone's very wary about this particular rally,"" Pease said.

Wall Street veterans have spent months warning that investors may be underestimating the risks.

""Unfortunately, I think there is complacency in the markets,"" JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon, said earlier in July, referring to tariffs.

Those concerns may soon be put to the test. Trump's proposed levies on trading partners — ranging from 10% to 70% — threaten to disrupt supply chains, fuel inflation, and slow global growth.

""I think the market is too complacent about the damage of such high tariffs on both the US and the global economy,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.

It's not just tariffs that suggest trouble could be brewing. China's economic slowdown, Middle East tensions, and softening US data all suggest trouble could be brewing.

So why are stocks still surging?

Despite inflationary concerns tied to Trump's tariff threats, the US economy remains on solid footing. As BI's Jennifer Sor recently reported, recession fears are fading.

Big banks kicked off earnings season on a strong note last week.

The consumer ""basically seems to be fine,"" JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum, said on an earnings call on July 15.

That's despite some cracks in the data. US GDP contracted 0.5% in the third quarter, and consumer spending growth slowed to 0.5% in Q1 — down sharply from 4% in Q4 2024.

But retail sales rose 0.6% in June from May and the job market remains robust. The US added 147,000 jobs in June, well above expectations, while unemployment dipped to 4.1% from 4.2%.

American consumers are, as top CEOs said recently, ""a little numb"" to tariffs and ""very resilient,"" even as inflation ticks up.

Some investors are leaning on the ""TACO trade"" — short for ""Trump Always Chickens Out.""

Markets are increasingly assuming that Trump's tariff threats are more talk than action.

""Finally, the market is not wrong in pricing in a good chance that Trump will not follow through with his latest tariff threats, instead settling for some deal by 1 August,"" wrote Davide Oneglia, the director of European and global macro at Global Data.TS Lombard, on July 16, referring to the trade deadline.

Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, agreed: ""The prevailing view among investors seems to be that these tariff threats are more bark than bite — a negotiating tactic rather than a firm policy stance.""

That's created what analysts call ""asymmetry:"" Markets could keep rising if talks go well, but they are vulnerable to sharp corrections if discussions break down.

Even as risks loom, traders don't want to miss out. That's fueling what analysts describe as a combination of FOMO, or fear of missing out, and MOMO, or momentum-based trading.

Retail traders have been jumping back in, chasing gains as indexes push higher, even if they missed the earlier run-up.

""MOMO and FOMO"" are likely to dominate until proven otherwise,"" wrote Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, in a June 30 note.

""Newton's First Law applies: A body (market) that is in motion will stay in motion until acted upon by an external source,"" he added.

Sosnick said that implied volatility remains low, even as risks mount, suggesting investors are choosing to look past potential trouble.

Pease at Russell Investments agreed that momentum could unravel quickly — but only if there's a clear macro shock.

The Federal Reserve has signaled it could cut rates another two times this year — a boon for stocks.

Lower rates reduce bond yields, making equities more attractive. They also encourage borrowing and investment.

But rising inflation could complicate that path. In June, US inflation climbed 2.7% from a year ago, up from 2.4% in May.

Dimon warned that the Fed might still hike if inflation proves sticky. He sees a 40% to 50% chance of another increase this cycle.

AI hype continues to drive the market, especially Big Tech.

""AI is still the dominant theme, particularly as the Big Tech companies are giving solid earnings guidance and other companies are joining in as well, then that's the world in which you could see that this rally has further to go,"" Pease said, while cautioning that gains could become overdone.

Bank of America's latest global fund manager survey, published July 15, shows 40% of respondents already see productivity gains from AI adoption. Another 21% expect gains within the next year.

Despite the optimism, there's unease under the surface.

Summer trading is thinner, meaning volatility can spike quickly. Last year's yen carry trade unwind is a fresh reminder that things can turn fast.

Trump's tariff threats are still on the table, but Oneglia thinks markets are right to be relatively unfazed.

""Negotiations have not broken down and the market is acting rationally — at least on this,"" Oneglia wrote.

Still, others are more cautious.

""Ultimately, markets are at a crossroads,"" wrote Capital.com's Hathorn.

""The rally, particularly in US equities, has been driven by optimism and underpinned by assumptions about political behavior.""

Until August, market asymmetry remains, so there's ""room to rise on good news, but the potential for a swift and severe correction if trade tensions escalate,"" Hathorn added.

Citigroup Inc. is asking its new class of investment-banking analysts to disclose whether they've already accepted a job offer from another firm, in the latest step by banks to clamp down on aggressive recruitment by private equity firms.

First-year analysts will be required to complete an “attestation” intended to “foster a fair and transparent environment,” according to a memo sent to analysts' managers on Monday and seen by Bloomberg News. The attestation is expected to be a one-time form, but the bank might also ask analysts to repeat it annually, according to a person familiar with the matter.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Germany and the US are close to an agreement that would dispatch Patriot air-defense systems to Ukraine as the nation comes under mounting missile and drone attacks from Russia. 

The deal would entail Berlin sending two Patriot batteries to Kyiv from its own inventories, while President Donald Trump's administration will agree to replace the weaponry from industry stocks, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

“Trade is in a good place,” Bessent said on CNBC, referring to recent and ongoing negotiations with China. “And I think now we can start talking about other things. The Chinese, unfortunately, are very large purchasers of sanctioned Iranian oil, sanctioned Russian oil — so we could start discussing that.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In this article

Microsoft has warned of ""active attacks"" targeting its SharePoint collaboration software, with security researchers noting that organizations worldwide stand to be affected by the breach.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Sunday in a release that the vulnerability provides unauthenticated access to systems and full access to SharePoint content, enabling bad actors to execute code over the network.

CISA said that while the scope and impact of the attack continue to be assessed, the agency warned that it ""poses a risk to organizations.""

Microsoft late Sunday issued fixes for customers to apply to two versions of the SharePoint software. Another 2016 version remains vulnerable and the company said it is working to develop a patch.

Researchers at Palo Alto Networks said the hack likely reached thousands of organizations globally.

""The exploits are real, in-the-wild and pose a serious threat,"" they added.

A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on the incident beyond what was shared in a company blog post. 

In an alert Saturday, Microsoft said the attack applies only to on-premises SharePoint servers, not those in the cloud like Microsoft 365. SharePoint software is commonly used by global businesses and organizations to store and collaborate on documents.

The vulnerability is especially concerning because it allows hackers to impersonate users or services even after the SharePoint server is patched, according to researchers at European cybersecurity firm Eye Security, which said it first identified the flaw.

SharePoint servers often connect to other Microsoft services such as Outlook and Teams, meaning such a breach can ""quickly"" lead to data theft and password harvesting, Eye Security researchers said.

""Once inside, they're exfiltrating sensitive data, deploying persistent backdoors, and stealing cryptographic keys,"" Michael Sikorski, CTO and head of threat intelligence for Palo Alto's Unit 42, said in a statement. ""The attackers have leveraged this vulnerability to get into systems and are already establishing their foothold.""

Separately, Alaska Airlines briefly halted its ground operations for about three hours on Sunday due to an IT outage. It lifted the ground stop at roughly 2 a.m. EST, the carrier said in a statement.

It was unclear whether the outage was related to the SharePoint attack.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

The latest crypto treasury company is set to hit the public market with an ambitious plan to build the largest public vehicle for institutional exposure to ether.

The Ether Machine will begin trading on the Nasdaq through a merger with blank check company Dynamix Corporation. Andrew Keys, the co-founder and chairman of the new company, has committed about $645 million in an anchor investment. The entity is backed by crypto investors 10T Holdings, Electric Capital, Pantera Capital and more. Once the merger is complete, it will trade under the ticker ETHM.

The company is the latest in an emerging cohort of new entities vying to become the MicroStrategy of Ethereum by replicating the bitcoin proxy's successful accumulation strategy, but around ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rather than bitcoin.

Keys' company plans to differentiate with a focus on yield generation through ""staking"" rather than simply buying and holding the ether. Staking is a mechanism for generating yield by contributing to network operations around security and transaction processing.

By purchasing ether from a crypto exchange or buying shares of an ether ETF, investors would get exposure to the coin's price, ""but without access to the dividend,"" Keys explained.

""Ether produces yield if it's properly managed,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Monday. ""The ETFs right now don't generate yield because they don't enable staking … we're able to enable staking and we're able to do other additional risk management on top of that.""

On Thursday, BlackRock filed with the SEC to include staking to its popular ETHA ether ETF, which just logged a record week of inflows.

The ability to stake makes ether a ""more productive"" asset than bitcoin, according to Keys.

The Bitcoin network ""has one asset on it, bitcoin, that can be moved from peer to peer, but Ethereum can tokenize any asset,"" Keys said. It's ""able to embed any type of digital asset – a bar of gold, a barrel of oil, a stock, a bond, a derivative – into digital legal agreements, and in doing so, you're able to expedite the velocity of money. You can have employment contracts that get paid by the minute, as an example.""

Shares of Dynamix jumped 30% in premarket trading.

The Ether Machine follows Bitmine Immersion Technologies – the company newly chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee and more recently backed by Peter Thiel – in its ether treasury ambitions. Pantera was also a backer of Bitmine.

Also this year, SharpLink Gaming, whose board is chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, also initiated an ETH treasury strategy; and Bit Digital recently exited bitcoin mining to focus on its ETH treasury and staking plans.

Ether has taken the spotlight in crypto from bitcoin in recent months as investors anticipated the stablecoin bill known as the GENIUS Act would be signed into the first major U.S. crypto law, which President Trump did Friday. The regulatory clarity should benefit institutions and brands becoming more interested in tokenization, which includes stablecoins, most of which are issued on the Ethereum network.

Ether has doubled in the last three months and last week, ether ETFs posted a record $2.18 billion in weekly inflows.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday suggested a review of the Federal Reserve that would go beyond the current controversy over building renovations and look at its overall function.

""What we need to do is examine the entire Federal Reserve institution and whether they have been successful,"" Bessent said during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""Has the organization succeeded in its mission? If this were the [Federal Aviation Administration] and we were having this many mistakes, we would go back and look at why has this happened.""

The comments come amid an intensifying conflict between the White House and the central bank. It was not clear what form a review would take or who would perform it.

Last week saw conflicting reports over whether President Donald Trump was preparing to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Reports from the White House indicated a move was forthcoming, but Trump soon after denied he is readying what would be a legally questionable maneuver.

Bessent has been at the center of the controversy, both as a potential successor at the Fed as well as reports pointing to the Treasury chief as a mediator looking to discourage Trump from ousting Powell.

""President Trump solicits a whole range of opinions and then makes a decision,"" Bessent said when asked about a Wall Street Journal report that he had helped convince Trump to stay his hand on Powell. ""So he takes a lot of inputs, and at the end of the day it's his decision.""

Trump has demanded the Fed dramatically lower its benchmark overnight borrowing rate, something that appears unlikely regardless of the chair.

In addition, the administration in recent days has criticized the Fed for cost overruns at the $2.5 billion renovation it has undertaken for two of its buildings in Washington. Administration officials reportedly are planning soon to view the project in person.

On the question of interest rates, Bessent backed the idea that the Fed probably should be easing with inflation mostly moderating.

""They were fear mongering over tariffs, and thus far we have seen very little, if any, inflation,"" Bessent said. ""We've had great inflation numbers. So, you know, I think this idea [is] of them not being able to break out of a certain mindset. All these Ph.D.s over there, I don't know what they do.""

The Fed last cut rates in December, which completed a brief easing cycle that brought the fed funds rate down a full percentage point. However, as the Fed eased both mortgage rates and Treasury yields moved higher.

Market pricing indicates the Fed probably will cut again in September.

Elon Musk's X on Monday denied allegations made by French authorities as part of a criminal investigation into alleged data tampering, adding that it would not submit to the prosecutor's demand to hand over data.

X's global government affairs account said the French investigation, which ramped up this month, is ""politically-motivated"" and designed to ""restrict free speech.""

""French authorities have launched a politically-motivated criminal investigation into X over the alleged manipulation of its algorithm and alleged ""fraudulent data extraction,"" X said in a post on the social media platform. ""X categorically denies these allegations.""

French prosecutors started an investigation in January over allegations that the company's algorithm was being used for the purposes of foreign interference. The probe began after two complaints — one from a French member of parliament and another from a senior official at a public institution.

This month, the investigation was handed over to a key unit of France's national police. Prosecutors said the investigation would focus on investigating offences of tampering with automated data systems as well as the fraudulent extraction of data from these systems.

""French authorities have requested access to X's recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts on the platform in order for several 'experts' to analyze the data and purportedly 'uncover the truth' about the operation of the X platform,"" X said.

Musk's social media platform also said it, ""remains in the dark as to the specific allegations made"" against it.

""However, based on what we know so far, X believes that this investigation is distorting French law in order to serve a political agenda and, ultimately, restrict free speech,"" X said.

""For these reasons, X has not acceded to the French authorities' demands, as we have a legal right to do. This is not a decision that X takes lightly. However, in this case, the facts speak for themselves.""

In an email to CNBC, a spokesperson for the Paris prosecutor's office said that it had requested that X provide its algorithm, but not access to private data, in order for investigators to ""carry out a technical verification of the elements"" highlighted by experts and researchers in regard to the way data is handled.

According to French law, ""investigators are bound by secrecy and that only those in charge of the investigation will have access to it,"" the spokesperson said.

X will have a ""secure process"" to communicate with ""guarantees of confidentiality,"" the spokesperson added.

In its statement, X took fire at two specific individuals. The company claimed the two ""experts"" who will review X's algorithm are David Chavalarias, director of the Paris Complex Systems Institute (ISC-PIF) and Maziyar Panahi, an AI platform leader at ISC-PIF.

X noted Chavalarias runs a campaign called ""Escape X"" which encourages users to leave the social media platform, and said Panahi ""has previously participated in research projects with David Chavalarias that demonstrate open hostility towards X."" Both researchers have indeed been named on a research paper related to X.

""The involvement of these individuals raises serious concerns about the impartiality, fairness, and political motivations of the investigation, to put it charitably. A predetermined outcome is not a fair one,"" X said.

CNBC has reached out to both Chavalarias and Panahi, and has yet to receive a comment on X's statement.

The U.S. has signaled it will not let up on its Aug. 1 deadline for higher tariffs on the European Union as the bloc fights to strike a deal in time.

Over the weekend, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said he was confident that a trade deal could be struck with the European Union, but warned that the deadline for a baseline 30% tariff is fixed.

""That's a hard deadline, so on Aug. 1, the new tariff rates will come in,"" Lutnick said Sunday on CBS News when asked about the deadline for his EU tariffs.

He did signal that talks could continue after this date, however, noting: ""These are the two biggest trading partners in the world, talking to each other. We'll get a deal done. I am confident we'll get a deal done.""

""Nothing stops countries from talking to us after Aug. 1, but they're going to start paying the tariffs on Aug. 1,"" he added.

The EU has said it is preparing retaliatory measures against the U.S. if punitive trade tariffs are imposed. Lutnick dismissed the possibility of the EU targeting items like Boeing airplanes and Kentucky bourbon, however, saying, ""they're just not going to do that.""

Last-ditch talks to reach a trade agreement are ongoing, with the EU hoping it can negotiate a lower tariff rate. The bloc had hoped it could strike a similar pact to the U.K., which was the first country to make a trade agreement with the U.S. That deal includes a 10% baseline tariff with some caveats relating to car, steel and aerospace imports.

But economists and analysts have become increasingly skeptical about Brussels' ability to agree on a similar framework.

For one, the EU has a much trickier relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump than the U.K. does. Trump has frequently bemoaned what he sees as an imbalanced trade relationship and unfair trading practices, which the EU denies.

According to the European Council, total trade between the EU and U.S. amounted to 1.68 trillion euros ($1.96 trillion) in 2024. While the EU ran a trade surplus in goods, it recorded a deficit in services. Overall, the bloc had a surplus of around 50 billion euros last year, when both goods and services are taken into account.

Last Friday, the Financial Times reported that Trump was pushing for a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% on EU imports in any deal with the bloc. The president was also reportedly happy to keep duties on the auto sector at 25%, a move that would hurt car exporters in Germany particularly hard.

Speaking to CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday, Arnaud Girod, head of economics and cross-asset strategy at Kepler Cheuvreux, said a rate of 15% to 20% ""would be a total car crash for European exports.""

""On top of that, you add the euro strength that we've had ... so that would start to cost and to be very painful for European exports, and, of course, would also potentially, you know, reignite some fears on the inflation front in the U.S.,"" he added.

The White House's seemingly harsher stance toward Brussels has prompted policymakers to consider how they will respond to a 30% tariff, which would be a steep hike from the current 10% duty that came into effect in April.

One EU official told CNBC that there has been a clear shift in mood regarding the bloc's potential response among all EU member states, except Hungary, whose leader, Viktor Orban, is a Trump ally.

The bloc's potential countermeasures against the U.S. include levies on imports from the U.S. worth 21 billion euros, which are currently on pause until Aug. 6. The European Commission has also prepared a second round of potential tariffs targeting trade worth 72 billion euros.

Imports ranging from clothing to agricultural products and food and drink items could be affected.

Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reported that an increasing number of EU member states have signaled their support for the bloc deploying its anti-coercion instrument. This is the EU's most powerful trade tool, which would give the European Commission broad powers to take retaliatory action against the U.S.

Kepler Cheuvreux's Girod welcomed the movement around tariff policy in the EU, saying that the bloc was ""finally"" flexing its muscles and that this was needed to reach an agreement.

""They've been very, very, I would say, cool, with the U.S. so far, and now that we're approaching the deadline, they have to sound a bit more aggressive,"" Girod said. ""Not getting a better deal than the U.K. is ... an issue for the EU, and they have to prove that the whole structure of the EU is helpful.""

China's exports of rare-earth magnets to the United States in June surged more than seven times from the prior month, as American firms clamor to get hold of the critical elements following a preliminary Sino-U.S. trade deal.

In April, Beijing placed restrictions on several critical magnets, used in advanced tech such as electric vehicles, wind turbines and MRI machines, requiring firms to receive licenses for export. The move was seen as retaliation against U.S. President Donald Trump's steep tariffs on China. 

Beijing has a stranglehold on the production of rare-earth magnets, with an estimated 90% of the market, as well as a similar hold on the refining of rare-earth elements, which are used to make magnets. 

The U.S. received about 353 metric tons of rare-earth permanent magnets in June, up 660% from the previous month, data released by China's General Administration of Customs showed, though the exports were about half that from June last year.

The U.S. was the second-largest destination for China's rare-earth magnets, behind Germany, as it relies heavily on their imports for its large manufacturing sector, particularly automotive, electronics and renewable energy. 

In total, China exported 3,188 metric tons of rare earth permanent magnets globally last month, up nearly 160% from May, but 38% lower compared with the same period last year.

The growth in exports came after Washington and Beijing agreed last month on a trade framework that included easing controls on Chinese rare-earth exports as well as a rollback of some American tech restrictions for shipments to China. 

AI behemoth Nvidia said last week it was planning to resume shipments of its H20 AI chips to China, after the exports were restricted in April. Last month, controls on American AI chip software companies' business in China had also been rolled back.

Chinese rare-earth magnet producers started announcing the approval of export licenses last month.

If exports continue to increase, it will be of great benefit to companies that have been suffering from shortages of magnets due to the lengthy time required to secure export licenses. For example, several European auto-parts suppliers were forced to halt production in recent months. 

The magnet shortages had also hit emerging industries such as humanoid robotics. In April, Elon Musk said production of Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots had been disrupted. 

China's controls on its rare-earths sector have prompted some global governments to reexamine their rare-earth supply chains and search for ways to support domestic mining of the minerals. 

However, experts say that setting up alternatives to China's rare-earth magnet supply chain could take years, as it requires an intricate process of rare-earth element refining and separation. 

""The separation process is quite complex, and China has a lot of advantages in this after putting in decades of research into the processes,"" Yue Wang, a senior consultant of rare earths at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC last month. 

One way that the U.S. has been trying to compensate for lack of rare-earth magnets is through increased recycling. Apple and miner MP Materials announced a $500 million deal last week for the development of a recycling facility that will reinforce the iPhone maker's U.S. magnet supply chain.

Peter Alexander from financial consultancy Z-ben Advisors said that Washington's latest concessions on tech restrictions were a reflection of just how much leverage China has in its trade relationship with the United States, speaking on CNBC's ""China Connection"" on Monday.

Auto giant Stellantis expects a net loss of 2.3 billion euros ($2.68 billion) in the first half of the year amid pre-tax net charges and early effects of U.S. tariffs, the company said Monday in its preliminary figures.

Stellantis, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, estimated first-half net revenue of 74.3 billion euros, down from 85 billion euros from the same period last year.

The preliminary figures come in the absence of financial guidance, which the company suspended on April 30.

Stellantis said it taken the extraordinary move to publish preliminary and unaudited financial information for the first half of the year due to the difference between analyst consensus forecasts and the firm's performance over the period.

The update reaffirms the scale of the challenge ahead for new CEO Antonio Filosa, who was appointed in May after his predecessor Carlos Tavares unexpectedly resigned amid a sharp drop in profit, falling sales and problems in the U.S.

Milan-listed shares of Stellantis traded 1% lower Monday, paring some of its earlier losses. The stock price is down around 38% year-to-date.

Stellantis said four key factors significantly impacted on results through the first six months of the year.

These included early-stage actions taken to improve profitability, roughly 3.3 billion euros of pre-tax net charges, adverse impacts to adjusted operating income from higher industrial costs, as well as changes in foreign exchange rates and the early effects of U.S. tariffs.

Stellantis said it expected an initial hit of 300 million euros in its first-half results due to net tariffs incurred, as well as planned production losses as part of its response plan.

The company's financial results for the first half of 2025 will be released as scheduled on July 29.

On a call shortly after issuing preliminary results, Stellantis Chief Financial Officer Doug Ostermann said that the full-year impact of U.S. tariffs could climb to 1-1.5 billion euros, Reuters reported.

Stellantis said its overall second-quarter shipments fell to an estimated 1.4 million vehicles, down 6% year-on-year.

In North America, Stellantis said second-quarter shipments were expected to decline by roughly 109,000 units, lower by an annual 25%, given the reduced manufacturing and shipment of imported vehicles — which are most impacted by tariffs — and lower fleet channel sales.

In this article

U.S. carrier Alaska Airlines resumed operations late on Sunday after briefly grounding all of its flights for about three hours due to an IT outage, marking the second time it has halted its fleet in just over a year.

The company requested a system-wide ground stop for Alaska and Horizon Air flights at around 8 p.m. Pacific on Sunday (0300 GMT on Monday) after it said that an outage impacted its systems, and lifted the ground stop by 11 p.m. Pacific, the carrier said.

""As we reposition our aircraft and crews, there will most likely be residual impacts to our flights. It will take some time to get our overall operations back to normal,"" the Seattle-based company said.

Alaska did not immediately specify the nature of the IT outage.

In April 2024, Alaska grounded its entire fleet due to an issue with the system that calculates the weight and balance of its planes.

Alaska Air Group maintains an operational fleet of 238 Boeing 737 aircraft, and 87 Embraer 175 aircraft, according to its website.

In June, Alaska Air Group-owned Hawaiian Airlines said some of its IT systems were disrupted by a hack. Alaska Air Group said it was still determining the financial impact of that event.

The news of Alaska's IT issues comes at a time when tech companies Google and Palo Alto Networks have warned of the ""Scattered Spider"" hacking group's interest in the aviation sector.

Canada's WestJet Airlines was struck by an unspecified cyber incident in June, while Australia's Qantas experienced a data breach in July where a cyber hacker accessed the personal information of millions of customers. But those incidents did not affect flying operations.

Separately, Microsoft said on Sunday that there were ""active attacks"" on its server software used by government agencies and businesses.

Alaska did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on whether the outage was related to the Microsoft announcement.

Despite being beaten down by years of U.S. trade restrictions, China's telecom giant Huawei has quietly emerged as one of the country's fiercest competitors across the entire AI landscape.  

Not only does the Shenzhen-based firm appear to represent Beijing's answer to American AI chip darling Nvidia, but it has also been an early adopter of monetizing artificial intelligence models in industrial applications. 

""Huawei has been forced to shift and expand its core business focus over the past decade… due to a variety of external pressures on the company,"" said Paul Triolo, partner and senior vice president for China at advisory firm DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group.

This expansion has seen the company get involved in everything from smart cars and operating systems to the technologies needed for the AI boom, such as advanced semiconductors, data centers, chips and large language models. 

""No other technology company has been able to be competent in so many different sectors with high levels of complexity and barriers to entry,"" Triolo said. 

This year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has become increasingly vocal in calling Huawei ""one of the most formidable technology companies in the world."" He has also warned that Huawei will replace Nvidia in China if Washington continues to restrict U.S. chip firms' exports to the Asian country.

Nvidia surpassed $4 trillion in market capitalization last week to become the world's most valuable company. Its cutting-edge processors and a related ""CUDA"" computing system remain the industry standard for training generative AI models and applications. 

But that moat may be narrowing, as Huawei proves that it not only does it all, it does it well. While challenging American AI stalwarts like Nvidia is a tall order, the company's history shows why it can't be counted out.

Huawei, which now employs more than 208,000 people across over 170 markets, came from humble beginnings. Founded by ambitious entrepreneur Ren Zhengfei in 1987 out of an apartment in Shenzhen, the firm started as a small telephone switch distributor.

As it grew into a telecoms player, it gained traction by targeting less developed markets such as Africa, the Middle East, Russia and South America, before eventually expanding to places like Europe.

By 2019, Huawei would be well-positioned to capitalize on the global 5G rollout, becoming a leader in the market. Around this time, it had also blossomed into one of the world's largest smartphone manufacturers and was even designing smartphone chips through its chip design subsidiary, HiSilicon. 

But Huawei's success also attracted increasing scrutiny from governments outside China, particularly the U.S., which has frequently accused Huawei's technology of posing a national security threat. The Chinese company has refuted such risks. 

Huawei's business suffered a major setback in 2019 when it was placed on a U.S. trade blacklist, preventing American companies from doing business with it. 

As the impact of the sanctions kicked in, Huawei's consumer business – once the company's largest by revenue – halved to about $34 billion in 2021 from the year before.

The company still managed a breakthrough on AI chips, and pressed ahead despite additional U.S. restrictions in 2020 that cut the company off from chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. A year earlier, Huawei officially launched its Ascend 910 AI processing chip as part of a strategy to build a ""full-stack, all-scenario AI portfolio"" and to become a provider of AI computing power.

But the U.S. targeting of Huawei also had the effect of turning the company into a martyr-like figure in China, building upon attention it received in 2018 when Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's CFO and daughter of Ren, was arrested in Canada for alleged violations of Iran sanctions.

As the U.S.-China tech war continued to expand and broad advanced chip restrictions were placed on China, Huawei was an obvious choice to become a national champion in the race, with more impetus and state backing for its AI plans. 

""The export controls have ironically pushed Huawei into the arms of the Chinese government in a way that CEO Ren Zhengfei always resisted,"" Triolo said. In this way, the restrictions also became ""the steroids"" for Huawei's AI hardware and software stack.

After another year of declining sales in the consumer segment, the unit started to turn around in 2023 with the release of a smartphone that analysts said contained an advanced chip made in China. 

The 5G chip came as a shock to many in the U.S., who didn't expect Huawei to reach that level of advancement so quickly without TSMC. Instead, Huawei was reportedly working with Chinese chipmaker SMIC, a company that has also been blacklisted by the U.S.

While semiconductor analysts said the scale that Huawei and SMIC could produce these chips was severely limited, Huawei nonetheless had proved it was back in the advanced chip game. 

It was also around this time that reports began surfacing about Huawei's new AI processor chip, the Ascend 910B, with the company looking to seize upon gaps left by export controls on Nvidia's most advanced chips. Mass production of the next-generation 910C is reportedly already on the way. 

To fill the void left by Nvidia, Huawei ""has been making big strides in replicating the performance of high-end GPUs using combinations of lower chips,"" said Jeffrey Towson, managing partner at TechMoat Consulting.

In April, Huawei unveiled its ""AI CloudMatrix 384"", a system that links 384 Ascend 910C chips in a cluster within data centers. Analysts have said CloudMatrix is able to outperform Nvidia's system, the GB200 NVL72, on some metrics.

Huawei isn't just catching up, ""it's redefining how AI infrastructure works,"" Forrester analysts said in a report last month about CloudMatrix.

Meanwhile, Huawei has also developed its own ""CANN"" software system that acts as an alternative to Nvidia's CUDA. 

""Winning the AI race isn't just about faster chips. It also includes delivering the tools developers need to build and deploy large-scale models,"" Forrester's report said, though authors noted that Huawei's products are still not integrated enough with other commonly used tools for developers to switch over quickly from Nvidia.

While Huawei's goal to surpass Nvidia is seen as a key development in China and the U.S.'s race for AI, it's important to note that chips represent just one building block of Huawei's broader AI plans. 

Huawei now has its hands throughout the artificial intelligence value chain, from chips to computing, to AI models and AI applications. These different AI business avenues also leverage other areas of the company's vast technology empire. 

In fact, the company's ""ICT Infrastructure"" business — which includes 5.5G cellular network deployment and AI systems for industrial use — became the company's largest revenue driver at 362 billion yuan in 2023.

The company has been deploying its Ascend AI chips and AI CloudMatrix 384 at its growing portfolio of AI data centers, which are operated by its cloud computing unit, Huawei Cloud, established in 2017 to compete with the likes of Amazon Web Services and Oracle. 

These data centers, in turn, have provided the training capabilities and computing power used by Huawei's suite of AI models under its Pangu series. 

Unlike other general-purpose AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Google's Gemini Ultra 1.0, Huawei's Pangu model is designed to support more industry-specific applications across the medical, finance, government, industrial and automotive sectors. Pangu has already been applied in more than 20 industries over the last year, the company said last month. 

Rolling out such AI applications often involves having Huawei tech staff working for months at the project site, even if it's in a remote coal mine, Jack Chen, vice president of the marketing department for Huawei's oil, gas and mining business unit, which provides digital and intelligent solutions to transform these industries, told CNBC.

That research enabled the company in May to deploy more 100 electric-powered trucks that can autonomously transport dirt or coal using the telecom company's 5G network, AI and cloud computing services.

And it's not limited to China. The technology can ""be replicated on a large scale in Central Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific,"" Chen said.

Huawei has also open-sourced the Pangu models, in a move it said would help it expand overseas and further its ""Ascend ecosystem strategy,"" which refers to its AI products built around its Ascend chips.

Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Thursday, Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said he expected Huawei to push Ascend in countries part of China's Belt and Road Initiative — an investment and development project aimed at emerging markets. 

Over a period of five to 10 years, the company could begin to build serious market share in these countries, in the same way it once did with its telecommunications business, he added.

				Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today


Friday, Aug. 1 — the ""hard deadline"" of U.S. President Donald Trump's updated tariffs — is less than two weeks away. Investors, however, seem mostly unbothered thus far. For last week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped marginally, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6% and 1.5%, respectively.

Even a report that Trump wanted a minimum of 15%-20% tariffs on the European Union only dealt a minimal blow to markets, which mostly closed unchanged Friday. Although those figures are higher than the universal 10% baseline tariff Trump reportedly wanted — and which the EU is hoping to secure — they are still lower than the 30% Trump said he will impose on the bloc in his July 12 letter.

An upbeat start to earnings season has also helped to quell tariff fears for now. Around 83% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings have exceeded expectations, according to FactSet data.

While the greenback remains the world's reserve currency of choice, the dollar index has fallen over 9% year to date. The outlook for the Japanese yen has been clouded by trade worries.

Oops, something went wrong

A fund manager has turned heads with an unmatched long-term price prediction for Ethereum.

“ETH goes to $1.5M over time,” EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson said Sunday in a thread on X. The prediction would be ambitious even for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency asset by market capitalization.

Jackson's reasoning is tied to “commerce” moving from fiat to blockchain rails, citing the growth potential of the stablecoin and tokenization sectors dominated by Ethereum. He said while all eyes are on Bitcoin, “Ethereum is quietly becoming the dominant rail system to transact in crypto with deflationary economics.”

Stablecoins and, more broadly, tokenization have emerged as the primary narratives for ETH in recent weeks as the U.S. advances stablecoin regulations. The narrative also gained momentum from Robinhood's (NASDAQ:HOOD) decision to launch tokenized stock trading on the Ethereum Layer 2 Arbitrum.

Several experts have pointed out that both sectors have the potential to bring trillions of dollars on-chain. For example, Bitwise investment chief Matt Hougan recently said that even a 5% penetration into the $257 trillion stock and bond market would be bigger than any present cryptocurrency application, including Bitcoin.

The expectation has been that such volumes moving on-chain could have significant price implications for ETH and other related assets. But unlike Jackson, most analysts have shied away from offering specific price projections.

Meanwhile, Jackson's short-term projections, while not in the millions, are no less ambitious. He said ETH could surge to $10,000 in the base case and $15,000 in the bull case in the present market cycle.

Jackson based this short-term outlook on expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission could approve staking features for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds before October.

“Most people think the ETH ETF approval is already priced in and it's been a big bust vs. BTC (in terms of assets for ETHA vs. IBIT),"" he said. ""It's not. The real catalyst is still ahead: staking approval, expected before October. Once that hits, ETH becomes the first yield-bearing crypto ETF in U.S. history.”

See Also: A must-have for all crypto enthusiasts: Sign up for the Gemini Credit Card today and earn rewards on Bitcoin Ether, or 60+ other tokens, with every purchase.

He said the yield-bearing opportunity would attract more inflows from institutional investors, leading to increased staking demand and reduced ETH circulating supply.

“Once ETH becomes a productive, staked asset within an ETF wrapper... It's no longer just ‘digital oil,'"" he said. “It's an institutional-grade yield product.”

Meanwhile, Jackson said the bull case for Ethereum occurs if Layer 2 adoption and ETF inflows beat expectations.

“None of this assumes a massive new breakout in DeFi or NFTs or explosion in stablecoins like CRCL on ETH or explosion in HOOD's L2 and COIN's BASE for keeping money in the crypto world vs. migrating back and forth to fiat,” he said.

Whether Jackson's predictions will come true remains to be seen. At last look, Ethereum is trading at $3,048. At current price levels, Jackson's short-term price targets represent a 233% and 400% upside. On the other hand, the long-term target represents a nearly 50,000% upside potential.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin (BTC) News Today: Dominance Rate Crashes Nearly 6% as Correlation With Altcoins Weakens","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/21/bitcoin-s-dominance-slides-by-most-in-3-years-as-btc-s-correlation-with-altcoins-weakens","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 06:02:32 GMT","

Bitcoin's (BTC) dominance rate has dropped sharply, indicating that traders are increasingly focusing on the broader cryptocurrency market.

The dominance rate, representing BTC's share of the total cryptocurrency market valuation, has decreased by 5.8% in one week to just under 61%, marking the lowest level since March, according to data source TradingView. This is the biggest slide since June 2022. The gauge peaked closer to 66% at the end of the last month.

Meanwhile, the total crypto market capitalization has increased from $3 trillion to roughly $3.8 trillion in three weeks, with altcoins like ether (ETH) leading the way higher as BTC's market share dropped.

In other words, it has been more profitable lately to stay invested in altcoins rather than bitcoin. Moreover, with BTC taking a bull breather below $120,000, its positive correlation with altcoins has weakened significantly, a pattern that has historically presaged heightened volatility and forced liquidations of leveraged bets, according to research by Alphractal.

""One chart stands out: the Correlation Heatmap. It shows that the average correlation between altcoins and BTC is dropping fast — even turning negative. In other words, altcoins are no longer following Bitcoin's movements. Historically, low correlation is a red flag. It often precedes periods of high volatility and mass liquidations — whether from shorts or longs,"" Alphractal said in a Telegram chat.

Unit bias is a cognitive bias that causes investors to prefer owning whole units or a large number of units of an asset over fractions or a small number of units, even if both represent the same value in absolute terms.

In other words, as BTC becomes costlier at record highs, new entrants into the market and inexperienced investors shift to cheaper tokens, equating their low per-unit price with affordability or higher growth potential, while ignoring their market capitalization or circulating supply.

This illusion that owning one XRP or one DOGE is better than one BTC leads to capital moving to altcoins, especially low-unit memecoins, driving the bitcoin dominance rate lower, as seen lately.

With Bitcoin giving everyone a reason to celebrate, it was about time Ethereum, often dubbed the digital silver, had its moment.

And it has certainly delivered, surging past key resistance levels and shaking up the crypto market in the process.

As per data from Coinglass, more than $76.54M worth of Ethereum short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours.

This comes after Ethereum crossed the $3K mark, rising over70% in the past four weeks.

At the time of writing, $ETH sits at $3,775, the highest it has been this year. The $ETH/$BTC pair has also gained 40% over the same period, currently trading at $0.03184 – a 2025 high.

Read on as we dive into the reason behind Ethereum's explosive move and what could be next for the token. We'll also highlight the best altcoins worth considering to make the most of this momentum.

As per Santiment, the $ETH network has over 152.03M non-empty $ETH wallets, which is more than any other cryptocurrency. This Sunday, a whale wallet bought 13,500 $ETH with $50M worth of $USDT.

In another notable move, SharpLink, a publicly traded sportsbook marketing company, recently became the largest corporate holder of $ETH, acquiring 280,706 tokens valued at $1.06B.



Clearly, Bitcoin isn't the only reserve-worthy asset anymore, with Ethereum quickly catching up. While Bitcoin has already reached a new all-time high, $ETH is just 25% away from breaching its previous peak of $4,800.

It currently faces strong resistance at $4,100. This is a level that, once broken, could propel the token toward $5,000 in the short term.

As Ethereum continues to attract whales and institutional investors, setting the stage for its next major move, several other crypto tokens stand to benefit from this bullish momentum.

If you don't want to miss out, here are some of the best cryptos to buy now.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the token powering Snorter, a Telegram-based crypto trading bot built specifically for retail users.

Until now, institutional investors have typically swooped in to absorb all the early liquidity in new meme coins. But Snorter changes the game.

The bot allows retail users to place buy/sell limit and stop orders (which Snorter then automatically executes) directly from the Telegram chat, creating a more level playing field.



In addition to its ease of use, the bot is mighty secure too. It not only independently verifies every token before enabling trading, but also comes with protection against honeypots, rug pulls, and even sophisticated sandwich attacks.

Currently in presale, $SNORT has raised over $2.18M, with each token priced at just $0.0989.

Moreover, according to our Snorter Token price prediction, the token could surge by 1,900% in 2026, potentially hitting $1.96 and offering life-changing returns.

Finally, it's worth noting that holding $SNORT unlocks lower trading fees (0.85% vs. 1.5% for non-holders), advanced analytics, and increased daily sniping limits, giving early adopters a clear edge.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first Bitcoin layer-2 blockchain solution that uses a canonical bridge to convert traditional $BTC into wrapped Bitcoin.

Over time, the Bitcoin network has slowed due to rising transaction volume, and it still lacks native compatibility with DeFi and Web3 applications.

$HYPER aims to change that, powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Once converted into wrapped Bitcoin, your $BTC can be used across DeFi, NFTs, blockchain gaming, and other Web3 ecosystems.



When you're done, the same bridge lets you convert your wrapped $BTC back into real Bitcoin seamlessly.

This high-performance, low-latency token brings the scalability and developer-friendly experience of Solana to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The $HYPER presale is gaining strong traction, having already raised $3.9M.

Each token is currently selling for just $0.01235. And according to our $HYPER price prediction, it could reach $0.08625 by 2026 – a potential 7x return.

FLOKI ($FLOKI) boasts a market cap of around $1.3 billion, making it one of the top 10 meme coins by market capitalization.

Named after Elon Musk's Shiba Inu, FLOKI has grown into a multi‑utility meme token since its launch in June 2021.



The platform is developing Valhalla, a play‑to‑earn, NFT‑based metaverse gaming ecosystem where $FLOKI serves as the primary currency.

Players can use it for in‑game purchases, trade NFTs, and win rewards. Since its July 1 launch, Valhalla has crossed the 1M transaction mark and seen approximately 125K NFT mints.

Better still, $FLOKI has surged over 92% in the past four weeks, and it's currently trading around $0.0001402.

With strong Valhalla adoption and bullish technical sentiment, as the token consolidates near recent highs, potentially setting up for a breakout, experts anticipate a 50%-80% upside from current levels.

With Ethereum joining Bitcoin in a fresh rally, the broader crypto market, led by its two dominant players, looks overwhelmingly bullish.

This renewed momentum sets the stage for promising altcoins like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) to ride the wave, offering early investors a chance to capitalize on what could be the next major breakout phase in crypto.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","DBS Bank launches blockchain-based programmable rewards","https://www.ledgerinsights.com/dbs-bank-launches-blockchain-based-programmable-rewards/","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 12:55:06 GMT","

Singapore's largest bank, DBS, has launched its Programmable Rewards program that allows its customers to use smart contract powered vouchers. The bank has integrated the e-voucher system into its payments app, DBS Paylah!, which has 2.9 million users. The blockchain-based vouchers are compatible with Singapore's most widely used QR code payment formats, enabling distribution across 40,000 merchant outlets.

The bank is running a promotion enabling customers to convert rewards points into eVouchers, including offering additional cash back for a limited period.

Smart contracts attach conditions to the usage of the digital tokens. For example, it might be redeemable only at certain outlets, or be valid for a limited period of time. Conventional vouchers work similarly, but the key advantage is automation. Reconciliation is far simpler because there's a shared record of transactions, and settlement can be automated through the conventional payment system NETS. This should lower the cost of managing rewards programs.

“By integrating our consumer and institutional banking capabilities with smart contracts and blockchain technology, we have created a transformative platform to rapidly launch and scale digital voucher programmes,” said Han Kwee Juan, Group Head of Institutional Banking at DBS.  “This platform's extensive reach, connecting millions of consumers with a vast network of merchants across Singapore, establishes a powerful ecosystem for impactful and scalable digital interactions.”

Apart from marketing initiatives, the bank is exploring deploying the system for employee rewards and government programs. This solution aligns with Singapore's existing digital currency initiatives.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore has promoted the idea of Purpose Bound Money (PBM) for years, with DBS first participating in 2022 as part of Project Orchid. With PBM, money itself is not programmable, but has a digital wrapper. When the voucher is redeemed, the wrapper is removed, releasing the funds to the recipient.

The Programmable Rewards offering is part of DBS Token Services, the bank's tokenization initiative that uses its permissioned blockchain.

For years there's been significant promise in using blockchain for rewards. Some programs continue to operate quietly behind the scenes, while others failed to take off. One example is Bakkt, founded by New York Stock Exchange owner ICE. It made a significant investment in acquiring a major rewards software firm and created a blockchain-powered rewards app targeting consumers, but abandoned it due to lack of traction. The big difference with DBS is its eVoucher program is now part of an existing popular app with significant distribution.

The non-fungible token (NFT) market is showing signs of life again, seeing a spike in sales and prices for top collections after lying fallow for years.

In the past 24 hours, buyers have scooped up hundreds of NFTs from high-profile projects, sending floor prices soaring and reigniting talk of a broader market comeback.

CryptoPunks' floor price jumped 17% to 47.75 ETH, or about $183,000 . Over 140 punks were purchased in a single day, a volume that hadn't been seen this year.

Pudgy Penguins, which recently received a boost after Coinbase changed its avatar on X to a Penguin, saw a 12% bump to 16 ETH, according to NFTPriceFloor data.

Another top gainer, Infinex Patrons, rose 26% to 1.4 ETH. Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Chrome Squiggles were two other collections seeing major gains, adding 20% and 34% respectively.

These collections weren't the only ones seeing gains. The wider NFT market, according to CoinGecko data, rose 29% rise over 24 hours to $6.82 billion. Sales volume reached $50.4 million, well above January's peak of $6 billion. NFT sales volumes had been plateauing around $400 million a month this year, CryptoSlam data shows. 

The sector saw a major boom back in 2021, but has since endured a years-long bear market. Earlier this year, a once leading NFT marketplace, X2Y2, shut down after trading volumes dropped by more than 90% from their peak.

Other NFT marketplaces pivoted to token trading. Magic Eden acquired trading app Slingshot in April, and OpenSea bought Rally as part of its pivot.

Meme coins are dominating the market, with Dogecoin's value increasing by 19% over the past seven days, while Bonk's value has rallied by 43%. While these meme coins surge, TOKEN6900 (T6900) is gaining attention among emerging altcoins.

This new crypto coin's ICO surpassed the $680K mark. It is riding the wave of crypto humor and bringing the playful spirit back to the market. Here is an overview of this altcoin gaining community interest.



Investors are used to seeing serious roadmaps and token utility, but TOKEN6900 (T6900) flips that on its head. T6900 is a meme coin with a sarcastic approach.

This new crypto coin points out the illusion of financial system growth, the delusions of overnight success, and the irony of investing hype itself. People will either love it or hate it, and that divisiveness is exactly what's fueling its popularity.

The hard cap is set at $5 million USD, and TOKEN6900 ICO 2025 has raised over $680K, indicating investor interest. There will be a total of 930,993,091 T6900 tokens. The starting price was $0.006400, while the final price during the presale will be $0.007125.

With no utilities or fundamentals, TOKEN6900 gives investors a glimpse into the brain rot of finance and is gaining attention in the community.



If you're wondering how a meme coin without utility can be one of the notable altcoins to buy now, stay tuned, as we'll explain its unique appeal here. The first thing that attracts the attention of the crypto community is the unique design of this new cryptocurrency.

Some investors highlight TOKEN6900's retro-futuristic design and potential, drawing inspiration from 90s internet culture. This type of design makes the perfect throwback to internet nostalgia that many are thinking about now, as digitalization is in full swing.

It is a unique rebellion against the system. The fact that the value of T6900 tokens is affordable, combined with its unique approach, makes the TOKEN6900 ICO 2025 extremely popular. TOKEN6900 tokens are available during the presale period.



There is no clear recipe for the success of a meme coin. However, some factors can indicate its future performance. The ultra-low market cap of T6900 is perfectly positioned for massive growth. Besides, the deflationary mechanism will likely contribute to scarcity, which will drive its price up.

When it comes to the TOKEN6900 ICO 2025, up to 80% of the supply may be sold during this stage. The value of T6900 tokens will increase every two days, or even more quickly, once the presale gains momentum. Investors can purchase their tokens using cryptocurrency or a credit card, making the entire investment process smoother.

TOKEN6900 presents itself as a meme coin with a distinct approach and investors interested in meme coins may find T6900 noteworthy.

TOKEN6900 has attracted significant attention in the market. Its unique, bold approach is the act of defiance against the financial system that is trying to impose control. The new crypto coin is poised to go viral as it points out the delusions that every crypto investor will face sooner or later.

With over $680,000 raised in its presale, T6900 is gaining interest among investors. T6900 is an emerging crypto project in the meme coin space.

TOKEN6900, a new meme coin, has garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency market, raising over $680,000 during its initial coin offering (ICO). This new altcoin is riding the wave of crypto humor, bringing a playful and sarcastic approach to the market. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus on serious roadmaps and token utility, TOKEN6900 (T6900) flips the script by highlighting the illusion of financial system growth and the irony of investing hype.

The ICO for TOKEN6900 has a hard cap set at $5 million USD, and it has already raised over $680,000, indicating strong investor interest. The total supply of T6900 tokens is 930,993,091, with the starting price at $0.006400 and the final price during the presale at $0.007125. The unique design of T6900, inspired by 90s internet culture, has attracted attention from investors who appreciate its retro-futuristic aesthetic and potential for nostalgia-driven appeal.

One of the factors contributing to T6900's market potential is its ultra-low market cap, which positions it for significant growth. Additionally, the deflationary mechanism built into the coin is expected to drive up its price by creating scarcity. Up to 80% of the supply may be sold during the ICO stage, and the value of T6900 tokens is set to increase every two days as the presale gains momentum. Investors can purchase T6900 tokens using cryptocurrency or a credit card, making the investment process more accessible.

TOKEN6900's unique approach and its defiant stance against the financial system have made it a notable altcoin in the meme coin space. The coin's divisive nature, which either attracts or repels investors, is a key factor in its growing popularity. As the presale continues, T6900 is poised to go viral, attracting more investors who are drawn to its playful and sarcastic take on the cryptocurrency market.

With over $680,000 raised in its presale, T6900 is gaining interest among investors who are looking for emerging crypto projects in the meme coin space. The coin's unique design, affordability, and defiant approach make it a standout in the crowded altcoin market. As the ICO progresses, T6900 is expected to continue gaining traction, potentially leading to significant growth in the future.

Thailand's securities regulator is seeking public input on new rules that would ease knowledge testing requirements for crypto investors while mandating comprehensive suitability assessments.

The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Friday that it is conducting public hearings on proposed initial coin offering regulations, which would allow investors to bypass repeated knowledge tests if they have previously passed such assessments.

Under current rules, investors must complete knowledge tests every three months before investing through ICO portals.

The proposed changes target two key areas of investor protection. 

First, the SEC wants non-institutional investors, those not classified as ultra-high-net-worth or high-net-worth individuals, to pass a knowledge test before investing, unless they've already done so in the past. 

Second, ICO portals would be required to conduct comprehensive suitability tests ""to ensure that investors in digital tokens understand the investment risks and have a risk tolerance level appropriate and in alignment with the product risk."" 

These assessments must be reviewed and updated at least every two years, replacing the current quarterly requirement.

""This proposal aims to reduce the burden on both ICO portals and investors by canceling the requirement for such assessment every three months,"" the SEC said in its announcement. 

The regulator noted that the new requirements align with ""regulatory practices applicable to both securities and digital asset business operators.""

“Thailand has been a first mover for crypto regulations and the SEC has played a pivotal role in providing all regulated activities and licenses, much ahead of Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, and Vietnam in South East Asia,” Jagdish Pandya, founder of Blockon Ventures and organizer of Thai Blockchain Week 2019, told Decrypt.

Pandya said the proposed knowledge and suitability tests would help keep “amateur investors” from blindly jumping into ICOs and repeating mistakes from the “old ICO scam era.”

“Their ICO portal enables raising funds, which is again a benchmark ahead of its time compared to UAE or Hong Kong too,” he noted. 

Professional investor classes would remain exempt from the knowledge testing requirements under the proposed framework.

Investors and stakeholders have until August 1 to comment on the proposal, which could change how ICOs are accessed in Thailand.

Thailand's regulatory push extends beyond ICO portals as in June, the SEC also opened consultations on allowing exchanges to list self-issued tokens with enhanced disclosure requirements to prevent insider trading. 

The country is simultaneously preparing pilot programs for crypto tourism payments in popular destinations like Phuket and considering retail access to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.

Despite the excitement surrounding what President Donald Trump has dubbed “Crypto Week,” experts caution against premature celebrations in the cryptocurrency space. 

The House of Representatives recently passed three significant bills aimed at regulating digital assets, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. However, these legislative changes are not expected to take effect for quite some time.

The three bills—the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act—are seen as crucial steps toward establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. 

This development has been fueled by intense lobbying efforts from industry players like Coinbase Global, which have successfully influenced politicians, including Trump. 

In anticipation of this legislative week, Bitcoin prices soared to record highs beyond the $123,000 mark for the first time, alongside significant gains for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP.  However, TD Securities analyst Jaret Seiberg notes that it could take over a year for the new legislation to come into effect. 

Among the passed bills, only the Genius Act has also cleared the Senate, and Trump signed it into law shortly thereafter. This act establishes a framework for regulating payment stablecoins requiring issuers to maintain one-to-one reserves in US dollars or Treasury securities. 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has argued that this law could generate an additional $3.7 trillion demand for T-bills, although some analysts, like Raymond James' Ed Mills, express skepticism about such projections.

Despite the signing of the Genius Act, there will be no immediate impacts on stablecoin issuers such as Circle Internet Group or Tether. 

As reported by ABC news, the Treasury Department is expected to draft rules within a year detailing the qualifications for issuing stablecoins and the conditions under which foreign-pegged stablecoins can enter the US market. This process will involve public commentary and could lead to litigation, suggesting a lengthy timeline before any real changes are felt in the industry.

The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, on the other hand, is particularly important as it delineates the regulatory oversight of crypto exchanges, brokers, and tokens between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

With bipartisan support in the House, there is optimism that the Senate will pass its version before the upcoming August recess, potentially delivering a unified law for the president's signature by September.

The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, the third piece of legislation, aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). This bill, which passed with narrower margins, was attached to a national defense bill, and its future in the Senate will likely involve protracted negotiations, possibly extending until December.

          / CBS News
        

Trump Media and Technology Group, the social media company owned by President Trump, said it has bought about $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities as it remodels itself as an investment firm. 

Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, announced in May that it planned to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, with the goal of creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency. The $2 billion bitcoin purchase is part of the company's ""bitcoin treasury plan,"" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a news release on Monday.

Mr. Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies both through his private businesses and his administration. The company's $2 billion bitcoin purchase comes as Trump Media looks to roll out a range investment products, including a plan to sell exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

The bitcoin purchase will ""help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere,"" Nunes said in a statement.

The company also said it has set aside $300 million for an ""options acquisition strategy for bitcoin-related securities."" Trump Media said it plans to continue acquiring bitcoin.

Shares of Trump Media rose $1.04, or 5.6%, to $19.71 in Monday morning trading. The stock has declined 42% ths year. 

For the first quarter, Trump Media reported revenue of roughly $821,000, up from $770,000 in the year-ago period, a regulatory filing shows. The company reported an operating loss for the quarter of $39.5 million, down from $98.3 million from a year ago.

A crypto treasury strategy involves buying and holding cryptocurrencies, similar to how companies may invest in more traditional assets like bonds to provide them with financial flexibility. 

The best-known advocate of this approach is billionaire Michael Saylor, who runs a software company called Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy). It owns 607,000 bitcoins – worth more than $72 billion at today's bitcoin price — making it the largest public bitcoin treasury company, according to Bitcointreasuries.net.

Saylor's company uses a variety of strategies, such as selling shares or issuing debt, to keep expanding its bitcoin holdings. As the digital currency's price has soared to more than $118,000, shooting up 74% over the last year alone, Strategy's stock price has followed, surging more than 3,500% since 2020.

That success has also spawned many imitators, while the White House invited him to its Digital Assets Summit earlier this year. 

The Trump administration is planning a new U.S. ""strategic reserve"" of crypto assets. Last week, Mr. Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency.

""For the past five years, the only thing better than Bitcoin is More Bitcoin,"" Saylor wrote in a July 17 social media post.

UNH School of Law's Seth Oranburg says that if the CLARITY Act passes the Senate this fall, the evolution to a functional doctrine heralds crypto's maturation from regulatory patchwork to structured asset class.

The House's passage of H.R. 3633—the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act—last week by a 294–134 bipartisan vote represents a fundamental doctrinal pivot in US cryptocurrency regulation, moving from the ambiguities of traditional securities frameworks to a function-based model centered on asset characteristics and network maturity.

For legal practitioners advising on token issuances, exchanges, or custody arrangements, this development resolves longstanding uncertainties under the Howey test while introducing immediate compliance imperatives. The legislation also highlights potential Senate modifications that could reshape the landscape.

With the CLARITY Act, Congress establishes a clear jurisdictional divide between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC retains oversight of “investment contract assets” during their initial issuance phase, where tokens are sold with expectations of profit from others' efforts, as seen in landmark cases such as SEC v. Ripple Labs.

Once these assets achieve “maturity”—defined as networks with no more than 20% control by affiliated entities—they transition to CFTC jurisdiction as “digital commodities.” This maturity threshold was refined during committee markups to prevent “decentralization theater.” It directly addresses judicial critiques in cases such as SEC v. LBRY, where promotional efforts overshadowed functional utility. 

The shift could reduce litigation volumes based on recent trends showing declines in crypto filings, by providing a statutory path from securities-like treatment to commodity status.

Decentralized finance receives particular attention through broad safe harbors. Non-custodial protocols that maintain open-source code and control below 5% are exempt from registration, though they remain subject to anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement.

This provision rewards genuine decentralization but demands rigorous governance audits. Practitioners should draw from precedents such as the CFTC's Ooki DAO action, where the platform's founders retained hidden operational control over a nominally decentralized organization. 

The Northern District of California, effectively treating Ooki DAO as a general partnership, imposed unlimited personal liability on those founders. The framework incentivizes transparent, algorithmic decision-making over centralized models, potentially accelerating DeFi adoption while mitigating risks of hidden manipulation.

Stablecoins are carved out from digital commodity definitions if they qualify as “permitted” assets, aligning closely with the GENIUS Act's reserve mandates for high-quality liquid assets. Issuers face a $10 billion market cap threshold for enhanced scrutiny, added during markup to counter illicit finance concerns. 

This doctrinal exclusion treats stablecoins as payment tools rather than investments, enabling federal preemption of state licensing and streamlining interstate operations. Yet it introduces compliance hurdles: monthly attestations and on-demand redemptions at par value, with failures risking reclassification and penalties.

Custody provisions mark another key doctrinal advance, mandating qualified custodians to segregate customer wallets using multi-factor key management and deliver annual SOC-1/SOC-2 audits. These rules, responding directly to the FTX collapse where commingled assets erased billions in customer value, elevate self-custody rights while classifying segregated holdings as bankruptcy-priority “customer property.” 

For practitioners, this means immediate policy revisions: Implement daily reconciliations and proof-of-reserves protocols to avoid misuse prohibitions that could trigger criminal liability.

The bill's path to passage during “Crypto Week” underscores the evolving political doctrine around digital assets. An initial procedural rule failed 196–223 on July 15 when Freedom Caucus Republicans demanded explicit bans on central bank digital currencies, echoing President Donald Trump's January executive order prohibiting them. 

Trump's personal intervention—meeting with holdouts on July 16 and securing attachments to the National Defense Authorization Act—flipped the vote to 217–212 after a record nine-hour session. 

The final tally, with 216 Republicans and 78 Democrats supporting, exceeded expectations but revealed fractures: Democratic leadership opposed over perceived gaps in consumer safeguards, while Republicans balanced innovation with anti-surveillance priorities.

Modest bipartisan support propelled CLARITY through the House, yet the narrow procedural margin could complicate its Senate journey. Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-S.C.) supports a Sept. 30 markup. Secondary referral to the Agriculture Committee—mirroring the House's dual-committee process—is expected. 

Clearing the Senate floor will require 60 votes to break a filibuster, unless drafters can fold qualifying provisions into a budget-reconciliation package, a maneuver that faces stringent Byrd-Rule tests. 

Reconciliation might involve merging aspects of CLARITY with aspects of the Lummis-Gillibrand market-structure proposal or the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill. Alternatively, Senate committees might address Democratic concerns through bipartisan tweaks, such as tightening DeFi anti-money laundering rules or requiring more robust “maturity” disclosures. 

For practitioners, provisional registration opens a 270-day window post-enactment to align operations. Map client portfolios to the maturity lifecycle now and draft anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act enhancements tied to FinCEN guidance.

Strategic opportunities abound: Leverage preemption for multi-state scaling and advise on DeFi audits to claim exemptions, potentially slashing costs based on industry projections. 

Yet balance risks—post-Jarkesy, enforcements may face more judicial scrutiny, but overreach in Senate amendments could stifle US competitiveness against the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation's EU harmonization.

CLARITY's functional doctrine—prioritizing network decentralization over issuer efforts—heralds crypto's maturation from regulatory patchwork to structured asset class. As Senate negotiations unfold, this could echo the Glass-Steagall Act for traditional finance in establishing enduring digital safeguards, demanding agile adaptation from practitioners to secure client positioning in the post-CLARITY era.

The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens

As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens.

“Tokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,” said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France.

Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors.

But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century's worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood's push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world's most popular startups.

The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time.

The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast. 

She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television.

“You used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,” Haun said. “You tune in at a specific time, you don't get to choose your program, you couldn't be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.”

Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies.

Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030.

The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that's seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs — more than $123,000 on Monday — while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what's been called the “golden age” for digital assets. 

Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike.

“Which is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,” Reiners said.

Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday. 

“Tokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,” said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins.

Securities law can be complex and even defining what is a security can be a hotly debated question, particularly in crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country's securities law.

Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law.

Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump's victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer. 

“The most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,” she said. 

However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood's announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider “their disclosure obligations” under federal law.

“As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said.

One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren't subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones.

Many hot startups are not going public as often as they used to and instead are increasingly relying on wealthy and institutional investors to raise large sums of money and stay private.

That's unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization.

“These are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,” said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. “Crypto has the power to solve this inequality.”

But Robinhood's giveaway of tokens meant to represent an investment in OpenAI immediately drew pushback from the company itself, which said it was not involved in Robinhood's plan and did not endorse it.

“Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer,” OpenAI said on social media. “Please be careful.”

Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies don't have to produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors and give a legitimacy to the U.S. financial system, said Allen, who said the push for tokenized sales of shares in private companies is “eerily familiar” to how things played out before the creation of the SEC nearly a century ago.

“Where we're headed is where we were in the 1920s,” she said. “Door-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn't understand.”

 Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) has amassed roughly $2 billion in bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities, as its founder, President Donald Trump, has worked to reshape American crypto policy.


 The Truth Social parent said it plans to keep buying bitcoin, and allocated $300 million to an options acquisition strategy for bitcoin-related securities. The company's bitcoin and related holdings make up about two-thirds of its $3 billion in liquid assets. 


 Trump Media has also filed in recent weeks to launch a trio of crypto exchange-traded funds that invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The ETFs are expected to launch later this year in partnership with Crypto.com.


 Bitcoin traded near $119,000 Monday, days after the president signed the pro-stablecoin GENIUS Act into law and two other crypto-related bills passed in the U.S. House.


 
Strategy (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, bought 6,220 bitcoin last week in its latest round of crypto purchases, according to a regulatory filing. The company's holdings have climbed to a whopping 607,770 bitcoin, worth $72.32 billion at Bitcoin's current price. 


 The price of Bitcoin has jumped by one-third over the past three months and hit a record high of more than $123,000 last week.

Bitcoin's (BTC) dominance rate has dropped sharply, indicating that traders are increasingly focusing on the broader cryptocurrency market.

The dominance rate, representing BTC's share of the total cryptocurrency market valuation, has decreased by 5.8% in one week to just under 61%, marking the lowest level since March, according to data source TradingView. This is the biggest slide since June 2022. The gauge peaked closer to 66% at the end of the last month.

Meanwhile, the total crypto market capitalization has increased from $3 trillion to roughly $3.8 trillion in three weeks, with altcoins like ether (ETH) leading the way higher as BTC's market share dropped.

In other words, it has been more profitable lately to stay invested in altcoins rather than bitcoin. Moreover, with BTC taking a bull breather below $120,000, its positive correlation with altcoins has weakened significantly, a pattern that has historically presaged heightened volatility and forced liquidations of leveraged bets, according to research by Alphractal.

""One chart stands out: the Correlation Heatmap. It shows that the average correlation between altcoins and BTC is dropping fast — even turning negative. In other words, altcoins are no longer following Bitcoin's movements. Historically, low correlation is a red flag. It often precedes periods of high volatility and mass liquidations — whether from shorts or longs,"" Alphractal said in a Telegram chat.

Unit bias is a cognitive bias that causes investors to prefer owning whole units or a large number of units of an asset over fractions or a small number of units, even if both represent the same value in absolute terms.

In other words, as BTC becomes costlier at record highs, new entrants into the market and inexperienced investors shift to cheaper tokens, equating their low per-unit price with affordability or higher growth potential, while ignoring their market capitalization or circulating supply.

This illusion that owning one XRP or one DOGE is better than one BTC leads to capital moving to altcoins, especially low-unit memecoins, driving the bitcoin dominance rate lower, as seen lately.

Bitcoin BTC$117,599.41 hovered just under $120,000 in Asia trading hours Monday, up 1% on the day and 2.6% on the week, even as traders increasingly shifted capital into altcoins like ether (ETH), XRP XRP$3.6011, Solana's SOL (SOL), and dogecoin DOGE$0.2848.

The market rotation comes as institutional flows broaden beyond Bitcoin, with Ethereum-led narratives gaining momentum and real-world asset tokenization drawing fresh attention from traditional finance players.

ETH surged to $3,793, posting a 3.7% daily gain and up 25% over the week. It's now at its highest level since early 2022, and analysts say demand from new ETH-based treasury products and ongoing ETF flows are fueling the rally.

XRP followed suit, rising 4.1% to $3.55, while SOL added 6.6% to reach $189. Cardano's ADA) and BNB Coin (BNB) both gained over 3% on the day.

Dogecoin DOGE$0.2848 stood out with a 9.6% jump in the past 24 hours, trading at 27 cents and up more than 33% on the week — its strongest performance in over a year.

""Over the past week, altcoins have shown signs of taking the spotlight, with Bitcoin stalling just below recent all-time highs and capital rotating into broader market plays,"" said Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken, in a note shared with CoinDesk. 

""Bitcoin dominance has dropped from a June peak of 66% to around 61.75%, signaling early signs of an altcoin cycle heading into Q3,"" Cardozo said.

The ETH/BTC ratio, which has been in decline for some time, has seen a strong bounce back to its best levels since Q1 — a sign that traders are again betting on Ethereum outperforming.

""Some will credit the stablecoin and RWA narrative,"" said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus. ""But we think it's just good old-fashioned risk-on spillover. Most TradFi players are already fully positioned on BTC.""

Beyond technical positioning, macro and legislative tailwinds continue to shape the altcoin trade. The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and increase clarity around digital asset taxation, failed a procedural vote earlier this week but is still progressing in U.S. Congress.

""Ethereum and other altcoins are surging due to institutional demand and friendly legislative policies,"" said Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer at OSL. ""Traders are hoping to see Ethereum break to new all-time highs, the last of the majors yet to do so in this cycle.""

Meanwhile, the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector — now over $24 billion in total tokenized value — is becoming a serious institutional theme. Projects tokenizing private credit, Treasuries, and real estate are attracting fresh attention from giants like BlackRock and JPMorgan.

""Tokenized assets are taking a meaningful share of DeFi TVL,"" Cardozo added. 

""It may be too early to call an altseason, but the rotation is real. If BTC consolidates, altcoins tied to real-world finance could lead the next leg,” he ended.

This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

XRP's (XRP) dollar-denominated prices have surged nearly 60% to new lifetime highs above $3.50 this month. However, against bitcoin BTC$117,599.41, it appears to be on the verge of kickstarting a significant bull run, as evident from the chart below, which shows the prices for the Binance-listed XRP/BTC ratio.

As of writing, the ratio was probing the upper end of the four-year-long sideways channel that began in early 2021.

Much like coiled springs, sideways channels are periods of energy accumulation. This pent-up energy is eventually unleashed in a powerful directional move; typically, the longer the consolidation, the more substantial the eventual breakout.

Thus, a breakout in the XRP/BTC ratio could mean significant gains for XRP relative to bitcoin.

Supporting the bull case is the Guppy multiple moving average indicator, which has flipped bullish for the first time since 2018. The bullish signal is identified by the short-term EMA band (white) crossing above the long-term ones (red).

XRP/USD : Golden cross is here

XRP looks set for a continued run higher, having defended the support of the January high of $3.39 over the weekend in a classic ""breakout and re-test play."" Markets tend to revisit resistance-turned-support to test dip demand and commitment of bulls before staging bigger rallies.

Momentum looks stronger than ever with the bullish golden cross, marked by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) shifting above the 200-day SMA, while prices are already at record highs. Friday's high of $3.66 is the immediate resistance, followed by $4.00. Below $3.35, the risk of an extended pullback would increase.

Ether's (ETH) rally continues, with the 50-day SMA rising to its highest level since March and the 100-day SMA poised to cross above the 200-day SMA in a bullish manner. There is little to no sign of bears looking to reassert themselves, as evident from the small upper wicks attached to most daily candles since July 13.

The Mayer multiple, which gauges the ratio between the spot price and the 200-day SMA to show case momentum, has already crossed the December high to hit its highest since March 2024. Perhaps, it's only a matter of time before prices do the same, topping the December high of $4,109.

On the way higher, prices may consolidate near $4,000, thanks to the significant positive dealer gamma at that level in the Deribit-listed options market. Dealers typically trade against the market direction in such situations to maintain a net neutral exposure, curbing volatility.

On the downside, $3,480 is the key support. A break below the same would invalidate the bullish higher lows pattern.

AI's take: The Mayer Multiple suggests strong underlying momentum. This indicator's higher reading signals ETH is building bullish strength relative to its long-term average, hinting at potential for future price appreciation.

Resistance: $4,000, $4,109, $4,382. 

Support: $3,480, $3,081, $2,879.

Bitcoin's price continues to crisscross the 50-, 100- and 200-hour SMAs, with the three averages now flat-lined in a narrow range, signaling that the upside momentum has weakened. This makes BTC vulnerable to potential risk-off in traditional markets and the ongoing recovery in the dollar index.

A potential failure to hold above the Asian session low of $116,539 would reinforce the bull exhaustion, strengthening the case for a deeper drop to $111,965, the May high. Conversely, a move above $120,000 could bring fresh highs, although prices have consistently failed to establish a foothold above that level since July 14.

Solana's SOL token has topped resistance at around $185 as expected. Further gains appear likely as the MACD histogram prints larger bars above the zero line and the 14-day RSI surpasses 70, both signaling a strengthening of the upward momentum. The Mayer multiple has risen to the highest since January.

A failure to hold above $177 would raise the risk of a deeper price drop.

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.Bitcoin is trading at $117,300 as Asia opens a new business week, just below last week's all-time high of $123,000. Ethereum ETH$3,783.75 once again is outperforming the world's largest digital asset, holding above $3,700, up 4% in the past 24 hours and 26% over the past week, as capital continues to rotate into higher-beta assets.

The CoinDesk 20 Index stands at 4,071.75, a sign of resilient investor appetite. But new data from CryptoQuant suggests potential turbulence may be forming beneath the surface.

On July 15, Bitcoin exchange inflows surged to 81,000 BTC, the largest daily figure since February. The spike was driven by whales and miners: transfers of 100 BTC or more jumped from 13,000 to 58,000 BTC, while miner outflows hit 16,000 BTC, nearly all of which was deposited directly into exchanges.

Ethereum showed a similar pattern. On July 16, 2 million ETH flowed into exchanges, the highest daily total since late February, following a 131% rally since April.

CryptoQuant also noted a drop in miner wallet balances, from 68,000 BTC to 65,000 BTC since June 26, reinforcing the view that miners used last week's rally to realize profits.

The confluence of large-holder and miner selling into strength suggests a localized top or a stretch of increased volatility. Historically, inflow spikes of this size have preceded price pullbacks, making this a potential caution flag for traders. While bullish momentum remains intact, the signals are hard to ignore.

Enflux, a Singapore-based market maker, is watching technical indicators closely.

“Liquidity remains healthy, and we're watching closely for confirmation in perpetual open interest and altcoin depth,” the firm wrote in a recent note to CoinDesk. “If ETH dominance continues to rise, we expect the tailwind for midcaps to extend into next week.”

Meanwhile, altcoin inflows remain muted. Daily altcoin transactions into exchanges sit at just 31,000, far below the 120,000 observed during prior market tops in March and December 2024.

CryptoQuant interprets this as a sign of low selling pressure, suggesting that altcoin holders may have stronger conviction, slower capital rotation, or are simply waiting for a fresh catalyst. For now, BTC and ETH remain the center of attention, but the sidelines may not stay quiet for long.

BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $117,100 after consolidating in a tight range, with strong institutional activity earlier in the session giving way to a late-day selloff that broke key support near $118,000 and hints at a potential deeper pullback.

ETH: Ethereum is trading up 3.78% as institutional capital pours in and funds rotate out of smaller altcoins, with analysts warning that rising momentum and $331 million in bearish bets could trigger a short squeeze and further accelerate the rally.

Gold: Despite a recent dip, CIBC Capital Markets expects gold to average $3,600 in the second half of 2025, citing global uncertainty, rate cut expectations, and central bank stockpiling as key drivers of further gains.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Chinese blockchain Conflux launching offshore yuan-backed stablecoin","https://cointelegraph.com/news/conflux-launches-yuan-stablecoin-and-blockchain-upgrade","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 12:04:00 GMT","

 Chinese blockchain Conflux launched Conflux 3.0 network and unveiled a new offshore yuan-backed stablecoin targeting “Belt and Road” cross-border payments. 

Chinese blockchain Conflux announced a third version of its public network and introduced a new stablecoin backed by offshore Chinese yuan.

According to a report from the Shanghai municipal government on Sunday, Conflux announced the developments during a three-day conference over the weekend. At the event, Conflux unveiled a partnership with fintech firm AnchorX and information technology security firm Eastcompeace to support the launch of an offshore yuan-backed stablecoin.

The news follows AnchorX receiving in-principle approval for its yuan-pegged stablecoin AxCNH by Kazakhstan's regulator, the Astana Financial Services Authority, in late February. It is unclear whether Conflux's stablecoin is AxCNH or a separate project, and the involved companies had not responded to Cointelegraph's inquiries by publication.

Conflux also partnered with crypto wallet TokenPocket to promote the stablecoin to its users. In an X announcement, the wallet's team wrote that the firm will launch pilot projects in Central Asia, Southeast Asia and other key regions in partnership with Conflux and AnchorX.

The team also announced the introduction of Conflux 3.0, which the company said can process more than 15,000 transactions per second and natively supports onchain artificial intelligence agent calls.

Over the weekend, the price of Conflux's native CFX token surged from $0.1055 on Sunday to $0.2285 at the time of writing, a gain of nearly 116.6%.

The new stablecoin aims to serve offshore Chinese entities and countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative. The project will also explore real-world asset applications, according to Conflux.  

The Belt and Road Initiative is a global infrastructure and economic strategy launched by China in 2013 as part of efforts to increase the country's international influence. The project aims to connect Asia, Africa and Europe through land and maritime trade routes, promoting global trade and investment, which includes building roads, railways, ports and digital infrastructure.

Conflux's stablecoin is the latest entry in the Chinese stablecoin race. As reported by the Chinese version of Cointelegraph earlier this month, Hong Kong recently attracted as many as 40 stablecoin license applications.

The firms behind the applications include giants such as JD.com, Ant Group and Circle. The report follows Hong Kong's government introducing a crypto regulatory framework known as “LEAP.”

The new framework includes a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers starting Aug. 1, which “will facilitate the development of real-world use cases.” The issuance of licenses will be overseen by Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission.

Mainland China is known for having one of the most restrictive approaches to cryptocurrencies. However, recent reports indicate that the country is reconsidering its stance on stablecoins. Earlier this month, the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission held a meeting to discuss strategic responses to stablecoins.

After the meeting, the regulator's director, He Qing, called for “greater sensitivity to emerging technologies and enhanced research into digital currencies.”

 Ether lost due to bugs and user errors has surged 44% since March 2023, according to Conor Grogan, head of product at Coinbase. 

Ether lost forever due to user errors and bugs has climbed to 913,111 ETH — around 0.76% of the current circulating supply, according to Coinbase's head of product, Conor Grogan.

Grogan shared the estimate on X on Sunday, noting that the lost Ether (ETH) due to human error and bugs now accounts for more than $3.43 billion at current market prices.

When including 5.3 million ETH destroyed via Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559) since 2021, the share of ETH lost is even higher.

Including ETH burned with EIP-1559, the total amount of Ether lost — around 6.2 million ETH ($23.4 billion) — would account for 5% of Ether's current supply of 120.7 million, Grogan said.

According to a similar report from March 2023, the amount of Ether supply lost due to bugs and user errors has surged 44% from 636,000 ETH reported at the time.

Despite the surge, the largest sources of loss have remained mostly the same, with the latest report citing the same major incidents highlighted in Grogan's March 2023 analysis.

Both reports specifically referred to the 306,000 ETH loss due to the Web3 foundation's Parity Multisig bug, Quadriga's 60,000 ETH loss to a faulty contract and Akutars' 11,500 ETH loss in a faulty mint of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

The only amount that has changed since is the transfers to a burn address, which has added 1,000 ETH.

“To be clear, this $3.4 billion number significantly undershoots the actual lost/inaccessible ETH amount — it just covers instances where Ethereum is locked forever,” Grogan wrote in the latest report.

Related: Crypto funds post record $4.4B inflows as Ether ETPs break 2024 gains

“For example, it doesn't cover all lost private keys or things like Genesis wallets that have been forgotten,” he added.

Cointelegraph approached Grogan for comment regarding the biggest contributors for the surge in ETH supply losses since March 2023, but had not received a response by publication.

Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), which has its supply capped by 21 million coins to ever be issued, Ether does not have any hard cap on its total supply.

Still, ETH issuance has been significantly constrained by two major upgrades: EIP-1559 and the Merge.

Introduced in August 2021 as part of the London Hard Fork, EIP-1559 changed Ethereum's fee mechanism by burning a portion of transaction fees, effectively reducing the circulating supply over time.

The Merge, completed in September 2022, transitioned the Ethereum network from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), resulting in a significant drop in new ETH issuance.

According to data from YCharts, Ethereum's supply steadily grew from 2020 to 2022, reaching 120.5 million ETH by September 2022.

The supply then started to decline, dropping slightly by about 0.4% through April 2024, reflecting reduced issuance and ongoing ETH burns. Since then, the supply has resumed gradual growth, reaching around 120.7 million ETH at the time of writing.

 The company plans to launch “one of the largest onchain ETH positions of any public entity” by generating ETH-denominated returns through staking and DeFi participation. 

A team of crypto-native researchers and public market experts is preparing to launch what it calls the largest yield-bearing Ether fund targeting institutional investors.

The company, called Ether Machine, plans to create a publicly traded vehicle offering institutional-grade exposure to Ethereum infrastructure and Ether (ETH) yield, it announced on Monday.

It is co-founded by Andrew Keys, a former board member and head of global business development at Consensys, and David Merin, a former corporate development executive at Consensys who now serves as Ether Machine's CEO.

Ether Machine aims to “expand Ethereum's economic security as the base layer for the next era of global finance and computation,” according to its website.

The company will be formed through a combination of The Ether Reserve and Dynamix Corp, a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company.

Following this, Ether Machine plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ETHM,” with over 400,000 ETH worth more than $1.5 billion under management at launch.

Ether Machine said it aims to hold “one of the largest onchain ETH positions” of any public company, generating ETH-denominated returns through staking, restaking and managed participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

The company said it will also offer “turnkey infrastructure solutions” for enterprises, DAOs and Ethereum-native builders on the blockchain.

Cointelegraph has reached out to Ether Machine for more details on the size and scope of the fund's ETH position.

The announcement comes amid a growing roster of companies adopting Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency treasuries, aiming to bolster shareholder value and attract more investors.

On June 19, Nasdaq-listed Lion Group announced a $600 million Hyperliquid (HYPE) token treasury reserve, which debuted with a $10.6 million initial investment.

On June 11, Interactive Strength, a Nasdaq-listed fitness equipment manufacturer, announced a $500 million raise to acquire Fetch.ai (FET) tokens and establish the world's largest corporate AI token treasury, according to the firm.

 Michael Saylor's Strategy made a fresh $739.8 million investment in Bitcoin last week, with total holdings now reaching 607,770 BTC. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy, the world's largest public holder of Bitcoin, continued stacking Bitcoin last week as the cryptocurrency surged past $122,000 for the first time on July 14.

Strategy acquired 6,220 Bitcoin (BTC) for $739.8 million during the week ending Sunday, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday.

Strategy's new Bitcoin purchases were made at an average price $118,940 per coin, with BTC starting the week at historic levels above $122,000 before dropping to an intraweek low of $116,000 and consolidating at around $118,000, according to CoinGecko.

The acquisition increased Strategy's Bitcoin holdings to 607,770 BTC, purchased for about $43.6 billion at an average price of $71,756 per coin.

With the new purchases, Strategy's year-to-date (YTD) Bitcoin yield added another 0.6%, increasing from last week's 20.2% to current 20.8%, according to Saylor.

Following the latest adjustment, Strategy's YTD Bitcoin yield is now just 4.2% away from the 25% target, which was initially set at 15%.

Introduced in August 2024, Strategy's Bitcoin yield metric represents the percentage change in the ratio between its BTC holdings and the company's assumed diluted shares outstanding. In 2024, Strategy's BTC yield reached as high as 74.3%.

Prior to announcing its latest Bitcoin acquisition, Strategy submitted a filing to the SEC on proposed sales of securities on July 14.

According to the filing, Strategy's senior executive vice president Wei-Ming Shao sold another 10,900 Strategy (MSTR) shares worth around $4.9 million.

The latest sale extended a $25.7 million MSTR sale by the same executive in the previous week.

The new BTC purchases followed Strategy's $472.5 million investment in Bitcoin last week,   with the company's BTC holdings exceeding 600,000 Bitcoin.

So far in July, Strategy has bought 10,455 BTC, compared to 17,075 BTC purchased in June, 26,695 BTC in May and 25,370 BTC in April.

‘Corn Sweat' Is Making This Heat Wave Even Worse

Humid heat is blanketing the eastern U.S. this week, exacerbated by “corn sweat” in the Midwest

Heat and humidity will once again smother the eastern half of the country this week, pushing the heat index to dangerous levels for tens of millions of people. In the Midwest, the humidity will be boosted by a phenomenon called “corn sweat.”

It's midsummer, so heat and humidity are pretty standard in the wetter eastern half of the country. It's unlikely this heat wave will break records, but it could still be dangerous, says Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service's office in College Park, Md.

On Monday the heat and humidity are centered over the Southeast and along the Gulf Coast. By midweek, they will move northward along the Mississippi Valley and up into the Midwest before they shift toward the mid-Atlantic and Northeast around the end of the week. Highs are expected to be around 95 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 38 degrees Celsius) as the heat wave moves along, but the humidity means it could feel closer to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C) in the most affected areas. Large swaths of the eastern U.S. will be in the “major” HeatRisk category, a NWS classification that incorporates heat, humidity and data on when heat-related hospitalizations tend to rise in a given area. Pockets will be in the “extreme” category, the highest on the four-category scale.

Part of the reason for the oppressive humidity is that “the weather pattern has been favorable for wet weather,” Oravec says. “Everything is wet, saturated,” which means there is more evaporation from soil and transpiration from plants. This is particularly true in the Midwest, where huge fields of corn, soybeans and other crops release moisture as the temperature climbs. The process is akin to how humans perspire in the heat, hence the nickname “corn sweat.” “The Midwest is famous for high dew points from the vegetation,” Oravec says.

Plants aside, the phenomenon has serious implications for humans. High humidity and heat raise the risk of heat illness—it is harder for the body to cool itself via sweating because the air is already so full of moisture that perspiration doesn't evaporate. Those concerns are especially high for at-risk groups such as young children, older adults, those who have various health conditions or take certain medications, people who work outdoors and unhoused people.

Prolonged exposure to such conditions can result in heat exhaustion, which can cause fatigue, dizziness, nausea and a cessation of sweating. If a person with this condition doesn't get to a cooler location or receive treatment quickly, heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke, which causes the body to lose its ability to cool itself, an extremely dangerous situation. In fact, it can be fatal.

Experts caution people to stay hydrated and avoid strenuous outdoor activity, especially in the middle of the day, when temperatures are highest. There are also tips for keeping your home cool. [Read more: Six Ways to Stay Safe Outdoors in Extreme Heat]

These concerns will linger both in the short and long term. In the long term, heat waves are becoming hotter and happening more frequently than in the past because of the added heat trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of humans burning fossil fuels. An analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central found that human-caused climate change made this extreme heat event at least three times more likely for nearly 160 million people, almost half of the U.S. population.

In the short term, weather models show humid heat over the eastern U.S. for the next week or two. “The weather pattern is just kind of stagnant and is stuck,” Oravec says. “It looks like it's going to be a hot few weeks.”

Breakthrough Proof Brings Mathematics Closer to a Grand Unified Theory after More Than 50 Years of Work

The Langlands program has inspired and befuddled mathematicians for more than 50 years. A major advance has now opened up new worlds for them to explore

By Ananyo Bhattacharya & Nature magazine 

Andy Gilmore

One of the biggest stories in science is quietly playing out in the world of abstract mathematics. Over the course of last year, researchers fulfilled a decades-old dream when they unveiled a proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture — a key piece of a group of interconnected problems called the Langlands programme. The proof — a gargantuan effort — validates the intricate and far-reaching Langlands programme, which is often hailed as the grand unified theory of mathematics but remains largely unproven. Yet the work's true impact might lie not in what it settles, but in the new avenues of inquiry it reveals.

“It's a huge triumph. But rather than closing a door, this proof throws open a dozen others,” says David Ben-Zvi at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved with the work.

Proving the geometric Langlands conjecture has long been considered one of the deepest and most enigmatic pursuits in modern mathematics. Ultimately, it took a team of nine mathematicians to crack the problem, in a series of five papers spanning almost 1,000 pages. The group was led by Dennis Gaitsgory at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, and Sam Raskin at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who completed his PhD with Gaitsgory in 2014.

The magnitude of their accomplishment was quickly recognized by the mathematical community: in April, Gaitsgory received the US$3-million Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics, and Raskin was awarded a New Horizons prize for promising early-career mathematicians. Like many landmark results in mathematics, the proof promises to forge bridges between different areas, allowing the tools of one domain to tackle intractable problems in another. All told, it's a heady time for researchers in these fields.

“It gives us the strongest evidence yet that something we've believed in for decades is true,” says Ben-Zvi. “Now we can finally ask: what does it really mean?”

The Langlands programme traces its origins back 60 years, to the work of a young Canadian mathematician named Robert Langlands, who set out his vision in a handwritten letter to the leading mathematician André Weil. Over the decades, the programme attracted increasing attention from mathematicians, who marvelled at how all-encompassing it was. It was that feature that led Edward Frenkel at the University of California, Berkeley, who has made key contributions to the geometric side, to call it the grand unified theory of mathematics.

Langlands' aim was to connect two very separate major branches of mathematics — number theory (the study of integers) and harmonic analysis (the study of how complicated signals or functions break down into simple waves). A special case of the Langlands programme is the epic proof that Andrew Wiles published, in 1995, of Fermat's last theorem — that no three positive integers a, b and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn if n is an integer greater than 2.

Robert Langlands discussed his ideas in a letter to André Weil in 1967. On the cover page to the letter (left), Langlands says, “If you are willing to read it as pure speculation I would appreciate that; if not — I am sure you have a waste basket handy.

Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton, N.J.) Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center

The geometric Langlands conjecture was first developed in the 1980s by Vladimir Drinfeld, then at the B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Like the original or arithmetic form of the Langlands conjecture, the geometric conjecture also makes a type of connection: it suggests a correspondence between two different sets of mathematical objects. Although the fields linked by the arithmetic form of Langlands are separate mathematical ‘worlds', the differences between the two sides of the geometric conjecture are not so pronounced. Both concern properties of Riemann surfaces, which are ‘complex manifolds' — structures with coordinates that are complex numbers (with real and imaginary parts). These manifolds can take the form of spheres, doughnuts or pretzel-like shapes with two or more holes.

Many mathematicians strongly suspect that the ‘closeness' of the two sides means the proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture could eventually offer some traction for furthering the arithmetic version, in which the relationships are more mysterious. “To truly understand the Langlands correspondence, we have to realize that the ‘two worlds' in it are not that different — rather, they are two facets of one and the same world,” says Frenkel. “Seeing this unity requires a new vision, a new understanding. We are still far from it in the original formulation. But the fact that, for Riemann surfaces, the two worlds sort of coalesce means that we are getting closer to finding this secret unity underlying the whole programme,” he adds.

One side of the geometric Langlands conjecture concerns a characteristic called a fundamental group. In basic terms, the fundamental group of a Riemann surface describes all the distinct ways in which loops can be tied around it. With a doughnut, for example, a loop can run horizontally around the outer edge or vertically through the hole and around the outside. The geometric Langlands deals with the ‘representation' of a surface's fundamental group, which expresses the group's properties as matrices (grids of numbers).

The other side of the geometric Langlands programme has to do with special kinds of ‘sheaves'. These tools of algebraic geometry are rules that allot ‘vector spaces' (where vectors — arrows — can be added and multiplied) to points on a manifold in much the same way as a function describing a gravitational field, say, can assign numbers for the strength of the field to points in standard 3D space.

Work on bridging this divide began back in the 1990s. Using earlier work on Kac–Moody algebras, which ‘translate' between representations and sheaves, Drinfeld and Alexander Beilinson, both now at the University of Chicago, Illinois, described how to build the right kind of sheaves to make the connection. Their paper (see go.nature.com/4ndp5ev), nearly 400 pages long, has never been formally published. Gaitsgory, together with Dima Arinkin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, made this relationship more precise in 2012; then, working alone, Gaitsgory followed up with a step-by-step outline of how the geometric Langlands might be proved.

“The conjecture as such sounds pretty baroque — and not just to outsiders,” says Ben-Zvi. “I think people are much more excited about the proof of geometric Langlands now than they would have been a decade ago, because we understand better why it's the right kind of question to ask, and why it might be useful for things in number theory.”

One of the most immediate consequences of the new proof is the boost it provides to research on ‘local' versions of the different Langlands conjectures, which ‘zoom in' on particular objects in the ‘global' settings. In the case of the geometric Langlands programme, for example, the local version is concerned with the properties of objects associated with discs around points on a Riemann surface — rather than the whole manifold, which is the domain of the ‘global' version.

Peter Scholze, at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, has been instrumental in forging connections between the local and global Langlands programmes. But initially, even he was daunted by the geometric side.

“To tell the truth,” Scholze says, “until around 2014, the geometric Langlands programme looked incomprehensible to me.” That changed when Laurent Fargues at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris proposed a reimagining of the local arithmetic Langlands conjectures in geometrical terms. Working together, Scholze and Fargues spent seven years showing that this strategy could help to make progress on proving a version of the local arithmetic Langlands conjecture concerning the p-adic numbers, which involve the primes and their powers. They connected it to the global geometric version that the team led by Gaitsgory and Raskin later proved.

The papers by Scholze and Fargues built what Scholze describes as a “wormhole” between the two areas, allowing methods and structures from the global geometric Langlands programme to be imported into the local arithmetic context. “So I'm really happy about the proof,” Scholze says. “I think it's a tremendous achievement and am mining it for parts.”

According to some researchers, one of the most surprising bridges that the geometric Langlands programme has built is to theoretical physics. Since the 1970s, physicists have explored a quantum analogue of a classical symmetry: that swapping electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell's equations, which describe how the two fields interact, leaves the equations unchanged. This elegant symmetry underpins a broader idea in quantum field theory, known as S-duality.

In 2007, Edward Witten at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, and Anton Kapustin at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena were able to show that S-duality in certain four-dimensional gauge theories — a class of theories that includes the standard model of particle physics — possesses the same symmetry that appears in the geometric Langlands correspondence. “Seemingly esoteric notions of the geometric Langlands program,” the pair wrote, “arise naturally from the physics.”

Although their theories include hypothetical particles, called superpartners, that have never been observed, their insight suggests that geometric Langlands is not just a rarefied idea in pure mathematics; instead, it can be seen as a shadow of a deep symmetry in quantum physics. “I do think it is fascinating that the Langlands programme has this counterpart in quantum field theory,” says Witten. “And I think this might eventually be important in the mathematical development of the Langlands programme.”

Among the first to take that possibility seriously was Minhyong Kim, director of the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, UK. “Even simple-sounding problems in number theory — like Fermat's last theorem — are hard,” he says. One way to make headway is by using ideas from physics, like those in Witten and Kapustin's work, as a sort of metaphor for number-theoretic problems, such as the arithmetic Langlands conjecture. Kim is working on making these metaphors more rigorous. “I take various constructions in quantum field theory and try to cook up precise number-theoretic analogues,” he says.

Ben-Zvi, together with Yiannis Sakellaridis at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and Akshay Venkatesh at the IAS, is similarly seeking inspiration from theoretical physics, with a sweeping project that seeks to reimagine the whole Langlands programme from the perspective of gauge theory.

Witten and Kapustin studied two gauge theories connected by S-duality, meaning that, although they look very different mathematically, the theories are equivalent descriptions of reality. Building on this, Ben-Zvi and his colleagues are investigating how charged materials behave in each theory, translating their dual descriptions into a network of interlinked mathematical conjectures.

“Their work really stimulated a lot of research, especially in the number-theory world,” says Raskin. “There's a lot of people who are working in that circle of ideas now.”

One of their most striking results concerns a two-way relationship between quite different mathematical objects called periods and L-functions. (The Riemann hypothesis, considered perhaps the most important unsolved problem in mathematics, is focused on the behaviour of a type of L-function.) Periods are a part of harmonic analysis, whereas L-functions are from the realm of number theory — the two sides of Langlands' original conjectures. However, through the lens of physics, Ben-Zvi and his colleagues showed that the relationship between periods and L-functions also mirrors that of the geometric programme.

Many mathematicians are confident that the proof of the geometric conjecture will stand, but it will take years to peer review the papers setting it out, which have all been submitted to journals. Gaitsgory, however, is already pushing forward on several fronts.

For instance, the existing proof addresses the ‘unramified' case, in which the terrain around points on the Riemann surface is well behaved. Gaitsgory and his collaborators are now hoping to extend their results to the more intricate, ramified case by accounting for more-complex behaviour around points as well as for singularities or ‘punctures' in the surface.

To that end, they are extending their work to the local geometric Langlands conjecture to understand in more detail what happens around a single point — and collaborating with, among others, Jessica Fintzen at the University of Bonn.

“This result opens the door to a whole new range of investigations — and that's where our interests start to converge, even though we come from very different worlds,” she says. “Now they're looking to generalize the proof, and that's what's drawing me deeper into the geometric Langlands. Somehow, the proof's the beginning and not the end.”

Fintzen studies the representations of p-adic groups — groups of matrices where the entries are p-adic numbers. She constructs the matrices explicitly — essentially, deriving a recipe for writing them down — and this seems to be the kind of local information that must be incorporated into the global geometric case to ramify it, Gaitsgory says.

What began as a set of deep conjectures linking abstract branches of mathematics has evolved into a thriving, multidisciplinary effort that stretches from the foundations of number theory to the edges of quantum physics. The Langlands correspondence might not yet be the grand unified theory of mathematics, but the proof of its geometric arm is a nexus of ideas that will probably shape the field for years to come.

“The Langlands correspondence points to much deeper structures in mathematics that we're only scratching the surface of,” says Frenkel. “We don't really understand what they are. They're still behind the curtains.”

French automaker Renault is hoping the coolest car on the street is their new minivan concept, Emblème.

Here's what you'll learn reading this story.

Renault design boss Gilles Vidal recently explored the idea that we may be at the apex of SUV popularity. That caught our attention, as we recently reported that minivans could potentially be experiencing a resurgence—at least, here in the United States. Autocar Magazine reported Vidal praising electrification as a springboard for revolutionizing the minivan of the future. And he's right. The architecture of many modern EVs places the battery underneath the floor, which opens up a whole number of design possibilities.

Renault's Emblème concept (pictured above) demonstrates what the minivan of the future could look like. Due to be in production in the near future, it is set to combine the best of both minivans and SUVs into one package. Its ride height appears to be pretty tall, but it retains a sleek and low profile, unlike many of Renault's SUVs and Crossovers.

Even with the design-forward aspirations Renault clearly had with the Emblème, the end product remains a genuinely good automobile. Just about every part of the body has been optimized for aerodynamics: the side mirrors have been replaced with cameras, the door handles “disappear” into the door, and it even features aerodynamic wheel covers similar to those found on a Formula 1 car. All in all, the concept is a symbol of the French automaker's commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions while revolutionizing automotive design. 

Many of Renault's latest projects are inspired by its legacy vehicles. The Renault 5 E-Tech electric prototype is one of the most obvious, drawing inspiration from the original Renault 5. There's also the R17, which is inspired by the Renault 17. Even the company's Savane four-wheeler prototype is inspired by their original Renault 4 Savane. All of these automobiles are fantastic examples of what the French automaker is capable of when things go right.

And moving forward, there's a surprising number of minivans they could pull from for inspiration. Despite the sleek and modern aesthetic of the Emblème concept, Renault isn't a newcomer to the minivan game. They've already excelled with three minivans: the Espace, the Scénic, and the Modus. The Espace was particularly brilliant, and was arguably one of the first vehicles to define the minivan segment in Europe. The vehicles that followed would all refine the formula laid out by the Espace—car-like handling, family comfort, versatility, and innovative design.

Minivans do a lot more than just carry families from point A to point B. Some areas of the world also utilize them as a form of luxury transportation. This opens up a whole new world of six-figure “luxury minivans” like the Lexus, which raises the idea that minivans could potentially be worthy competitors to SUVs and crossovers in the not-so-distant future.

It's fairly unlikely that the minivan's job description will change here in the United States any time soon. But it's eye-opening to see how adaptable it can be depending on where you look.

New research from the University of Victoria (UVic) highlights how marine heatwaves can dramatically impact marine ecosystems and offers a stark preview of how future ocean warming will reshape ocean life.

From 2014 to 2016, the Pacific coast of North America experienced the longest marine heatwave ever recorded, with temperatures reaching two to six degrees above historical averages over a prolonged period. Researchers from UVic's Baum Lab have compiled a comprehensive overview of the heatwave's ecological impacts, reviewing the findings from 331 primary studies and governmental reports.

""The marine heatwave resulted in unprecedented ecological disturbance across thousands of kilometers of North America's west coast,"" says Samuel Starko, lead author and former UVic postdoctoral fellow. ""Our comprehensive synthesis of the ecological impacts of the heatwave helps us to better understand its overall impacts and how these fit into the broader context of other marine heatwaves.""

According to the research, 240 different species were found outside of their typical geographic range during the heatwave, with many of them found further north than ever before. Several species, such as the northern right whale dolphin and the sea slug Placida cremoniana, were found over 1,000 kilometers north of their typical habitat.

The heatwave caused widespread kelp and seagrass declines and many kelp forests collapsed. Species from sea stars to seabirds died on unprecedented scales and unusual mortality events were observed in several species of marine mammal. A key rocky shore predator, Pycnopodia helianthoides, came close to extinction.

Many of the impacts of the heatwave were cascading, with direct impacts on some species driving complex dynamics that affected everything from plankton to whales. Temperature-linked diseases, such as sea star wasting disease, contributed to ecosystem collapse. The reduced abundance and nutritional quality of forage fish caused problems for predators. Plankton communities reorganized and offshore oceanographic productivity was altered.

The heatwave had economic costs as well. The closure of multiple fisheries, driven by changes in species interactions, disease proliferation and habitat loss, caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.

""As heatwaves become more frequent and intense under climate change, the 2014-16 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave provides a critical example of how climate change is impacting ocean life, and how our future oceans may look,"" says Julia Baum, UVic marine ecologist and special advisor, climate. ""This study underscores the urgent need for proactive, ecosystem-based marine conservation strategies and climate change mitigation measures.""

A new international study suggests that ancient viral DNA embedded in our genome, which were long dismissed as genetic ""junk,"" may actually play powerful roles in regulating gene expression. Focusing on a family of sequences called MER11, researchers from Japan, China, Canada, and the US have shown that these elements have evolved to influence how genes turn on and off, particularly in early human development.

Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive DNA sequences in the genome that originated from ancient viruses. Over millions of years, they spread throughout the genome via copy-and-paste mechanisms. Today, TEs make up nearly half of the human genome. While they were once thought to serve no useful function, recent research has found that some of them act like ""genetic switches,"" controlling the activity of nearby genes in specific cell types.

However, because TEs are highly repetitive and often nearly identical in sequence, they can be difficult to study. In particular, younger TE families like MER11 have been poorly categorized in existing genomic databases, limiting our ability to understand their role.

To overcome this, the researchers developed a new method for classifying TEs. Instead of using standard annotation tools, they grouped MER11 sequences based on their evolutionary relationships and how well they were conserved in the primate genomes. This new approach allowed them to divide MER11A/B/C into four distinct subfamilies, namely, MER11_G1 through G4, ranging from oldest to youngest.

This new classification revealed previously hidden patterns of gene regulatory potential. The researchers compared the new MER11 subfamilies to various epigenetic markers, which are chemical tags on DNA and associated proteins that influence gene activity. This showed that this new classification aligned more closely with actual regulatory function compared with previous methods.

To directly test whether MER11 sequences can control gene expression, the team used a technique called lentiMPRA (lentiviral massively parallel reporter assay). This method allows thousands of DNA sequences to be tested at once by inserting them into cells and measuring how much each one boosts gene activity. The researchers applied this method to nearly 7000 MER11 sequences from humans and other primates, and measured their effects in human stem cells and early-stage neural cells.

The results showed that MER11_G4 (the youngest subfamily) exhibited a strong ability to activate gene expression. It also had a distinct set of regulatory ""motifs,"" which are short stretches of DNA that serve as docking sites for transcription factors, the proteins that control when genes are turned on. These motifs can dramatically influence how genes respond to developmental signals or environmental cues.

Further analysis revealed that the MER11_G4 sequences in humans, chimpanzees, and macaques had each accumulated slightly different changes over time. In humans and chimpanzees, some sequences gained mutations that could increase their regulatory potential during in human stem cells.Young MER11_G4 binds to a distinct set of transcription factors, indicating that this group gained different regulatory functions through sequence changes and contributes to speciation,leading researcher Dr. Xun Chen explains.

The study offers a model for understanding how ""junk"" DNA can evolve into regulatory elements with important biological roles. By tracing the evolution of these sequences and directly testing their function, the researchers have demonstrated how ancient viral DNA has been co-opted into shaping gene activity in primates.

""Our genome was sequenced long ago, but the function of many of its parts remain unknown,"" co-responding auther Dr. Inoue notes. Transposable elements are thought to play important roles in genome evolution, and their significance is expected to become clearer as research continues to advance.

Gene editing technologies -- such as those used in agriculture and de-extinction projects -- can be repurposed to offer what an international team of scientists is calling a transformative solution for restoring genetic diversity and saving endangered species.

In a new Nature Reviews Biodiversity Perspective article published on July 18, the authors explore the promises, challenges and ethical considerations of genome engineering, and propose an approach for its implementation into biodiversity conservation.

They argue that gene editing could recover lost genetic diversity in species at risk of extinction using historical samples, such as DNA from museum collections, biobanks and related species.

The multidisciplinary team of conservation geneticists and biotechnologists is co-led by Prof Cock van Oosterhout at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and Dr Stephen Turner from Colossal Biosciences, in collaboration with the Colossal Foundation, the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (University of Kent), Globe Institute (University of Copenhagen), Mauritius Wildlife Foundation (MWF), the Mauritius National Parks and Conservation Service (NPCS), and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.

""We're facing the fastest environmental change in Earth's history, and many species have lost the genetic variation needed to adapt and survive,"" said Prof van Oosterhout. ""Gene engineering provides a way to restore that variation, whether it's reintroducing DNA variation that has been lost from immune-system genes that we can retrieve from museum specimens or borrowing climate-tolerance genes from closely related species.

""To ensure the long-term survival of threatened species, we argue that it is essential to embrace new technological advances alongside traditional conservation approaches.""

Conservation successes such as captive breeding and habitat protection often focus on boosting population numbers but do little to replenish the gene variants lost when a species' numbers crash.

As populations rebound, they can remain trapped with a diminished genetic variation and a high load of harmful mutations, a phenomenon known as genomic erosion. Without intervention, species that recovered from a population crash may remain genetically compromised, with reduced resilience to future threats like new diseases or shifting climates.

One example of this is the pink pigeon, whose population has been brought back from the brink of extinction -- from about 10 individuals to a population now of more than 600 birds -- by decades of captive-breeding and reintroduction efforts in Mauritius.

Several of the authors have studied the pigeon's genetics to reveal that, despite its recovery, it continues to experience substantial genomic erosion and is likely to go extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. The next challenge is to restore the genetic diversity it has lost, enabling it to adapt to future environmental change -- genome engineering could make this possible.

The technology is already common in agriculture: crops resistant to pests and drought cover millions of hectares worldwide. More recently, announcements of plans to bring extinct species back to life have further highlighted its potential.

""The same technological advances that allow us to introduce genes of mammoths into the genome of an elephant can be harnessed to rescue species teetering on the brink of extinction,"" said Dr Beth Shapiro, Chief Science Officer at Colossal Biosciences. ""It is our responsibility to reduce the extinction risk faced today by thousands of species.""

The scientists outline three key applications for gene editing in conservation:

They also address the risks, such as off-target genetic modifications and unintentional further reductions in genetic diversity, cautioning that the approaches remain experimental.

The need for phased, small-scale trials, and rigorous long-term monitoring of evolutionary and ecological impacts is emphasized, as well as robust engagement with local communities, indigenous groups and the wider public, before broader implementation. The authors stress that genetic interventions must complement, not replace, habitat restoration and traditional conservation actions.

""Biodiversity faces unprecedented threats that demand unprecedented solutions,"" said Associate Professor Hernán Morales of the Globe Institute. ""Genome editing is not a replacement for species protection and will never be a magical fix -- its role must be carefully evaluated alongside established conservation strategies as part of a broader, integrated approach with species protection as a guiding principle.""

Biotech-driven initiatives could also attract new investors and expertise, potentially creating new benefits for existing endangered species program.

'Genome engineering in biodiversity conservation and restoration', Cock van Oosterhout et al, is published in Nature Reviews Biodiversity on 18 July.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","AI uncovers 86,000 hidden earthquakes beneath Yellowstone's surface","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250720034027.htm","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 13:28:53 GMT","

Yellowstone, a popular tourist destination and namesake of an equally popular TV show, was the first-ever national park in the United States. And bubbling beneath it - to this day - is one of Earth's most seismically active networks of volcanic activity.

In a new study, published July 18 in the high impact journal Science Advances, Western engineering professor Bing Li and his collaborators at Universidad Industrial de Santander (Industrial University of Santander) in Colombia and the United States Geological Survey used machine learning to re-examine historical earthquake data from the Yellowstone caldera over a 15-year period. The team was able to retroactively detect and assign magnitudes to approximately 10 times more seismic events, or earthquakes, than previously recorded.

A caldera - like the one at Yellowstone Park spanning parts of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana - is a large depression or hollow formed when a volcano erupts and the magma chamber beneath it empties, leading to the collapse of the land above. This is different than a volcanic crater, which is formed by outward blasting.

The historical catalogue for the Yellowstone caldera now contains 86,276 earthquakes spanning the years 2008 to 2022, significantly improving previous understanding of volcanic and seismic systems through better data collection and systematic analyses.

A key finding in the study is that more than half of the earthquakes recorded in Yellowstone were part of earthquake swarms - groups of small, interconnected earthquakes that spread and shift within a relatively small area over a relatively short period of time. This is unlike an aftershock, which is a smaller earthquake that follows a larger mainshock in the same general area.

""While Yellowstone and other volcanoes each have unique features, the hope is that these insights can be applied elsewhere,"" said Li, an expert in fluid-induced earthquakes and rock mechanics. ""By understanding patterns of seismicity, like earthquake swarms, we can improve safety measures, better inform the public about potential risks, and even guide geothermal energy development away from danger in areas with promising heat flow.""

Molten-detecting machines

Prior to the application of machine learning, earthquakes were generally detected through manual inspection by trained experts. This process takes time, is cost-intensive and often detects fewer events than possible now with machine learning. Machine learning has sparked a data-mining gold rush in recent years as seismologists revisit the wealth of historical waveform data stored in datacenters across the world and learn more about current and previously unknown seismic regions around the world.

""If we had to do it old school with someone manually clicking through all this data looking for earthquakes, you couldn't do it. It's not scalable,"" said Li.

The study also shows that earthquake swarms beneath the Yellowstone caldera have occurred along relatively immature, rougher fault structures, compared to more typical mature fault structures seen in regions such as southern California and even immediately outside the caldera.

The roughness was measured by characterizing earthquakes as fractals, which are geometric shapes that exhibit self-similarity, meaning they appear similar at different scales. First visualized by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980, fractal patterns are seen in coastlines, snowflakes, broccoli, and even the branching of blood vessels. The fractal-based models, targeting roughness versus regularity, were able to characterize these earthquake swarms, which the researchers believe were caused by the mix of slowly moving underground water and sudden bursts of fluid.

""To a large extent, there is no systematic understanding of how one earthquake triggers another in a swarm. We can only indirectly measure space and time between events,"" said Li. ""But now, we have a far more robust catalogue of seismic activity under the Yellowstone caldera, and we can apply statistical methods that help us quantify and find new swarms that we haven't seen before, study them, and see what we can learn from them.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A tiny chemistry hack just made mRNA vaccines safer, stronger, and smarter","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250720034024.htm","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 12:13:23 GMT","

As millions of people know firsthand, the most common side effect of mRNA vaccines like the COVID-19 shot is inflammation: soreness, redness and a day or two of malaise. But what if mRNA vaccines could be redesigned to sidestep that response altogether?

In a new paper in Nature Biomedical Engineering, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania show that tweaking the structure of the ionizable lipid, a key component of the lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that deliver mRNA, not only reduces inflammation but also boosts vaccine effectiveness for preventing or treating a range of diseases, from COVID-19 to cancer.

The key change? Adding phenol groups, chemical compounds with anti-inflammatory properties famously found in foods like olive oil. ""By essentially changing the recipe for these lipids, we were able to make them work better with fewer side effects,"" says Michael J. Mitchell, Associate Professor in Bioengineering (BE) and the paper's senior author. ""It's a win-win.""

Revising the Recipe 

Until now, the ionizable lipids in LNPs -- one of four types of lipids in LNPs, and arguably the most important -- have largely been synthesized using chemical reactions that combine two components into a new molecule, much like two halves of a sandwich coming together.

""Because these processes have been so successful, there hasn't been much effort to look for alternatives,"" says Ninqiang Gong, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Mitchell Lab and co-first author of the paper.

Looking back at the history of chemistry, the team found an alternative approach: the Mannich reaction, named after the German chemist who discovered it more than a century ago.

Rather than two components, the Mannich reaction combines three precursors, allowing for a greater variety of molecular outcomes. ""We were able to create hundreds of new lipids,"" says Gong.

Exploring that ""library"" of lipids led the team to discover that adding a phenol group -- a combination of hydrogen and oxygen connected to a ring of carbon molecules -- substantially reduced inflammation.

""It's kind of like the secret sauce,"" says Gong. ""The phenol group not only reduces the side effects associated with LNPs, but improves their efficacy.""

The Power of Phenols 

Previous studies have found that phenol-containing compounds reduce inflammation by negating the harmful effects of free radicals, molecules with unpaired electrons that can disrupt the body's chemistry.

Too many free radicals and too few antioxidants result in ""oxidative stress,"" which degrades proteins, damages genetic material and can even kill cells.

By checking various markers associated with oxidative stress, the researchers compared the inflammatory effects of LNPs formulated using different lipids.

""The best-performing LNP, which we built using a phenol-containing ionizable lipid produced by the Mannich reaction, actually caused less inflammation,"" says Emily Han, a doctoral student in BE and co-author of the paper.

Less Inflammation, Higher Performance

With these encouraging signs of reduced inflammation, the researchers next tested whether the new lipids also improved vaccine performance.

Across multiple experiments, C-a16 LNPs, which incorporated the most anti-inflammatory lipid, outperformed LNPs used in on-the-market mRNA technologies.

""Lowering oxidative stress makes it easier for LNPs to do their job,"" says Dongyoon Kim, a postdoctoral fellow in the Mitchell Lab and co-first author of the paper.

C-a16 LNPs not only produced longer-lasting effects, but also improved the efficacy of gene-editing tools like CRISPR and the potency of vaccines for treating cancer.

Fighting Genetic Disease, Cancer and COVID-19

To test how well the new C-a16 lipids worked in an animal model, the researchers first used them to deliver into cells the gene that makes fireflies glow -- a classic experiment for checking the strength of genetic instructions.

The glow in mice was about 15 times brighter compared to the LNPs used in Onpattro, an FDA-approved treatment for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR), a rare genetic liver disease.

The C-a16 lipids also helped gene-editing tools like CRISPR do a better job fixing the faulty gene that causes hATTR. In fact, they more than doubled the treatment's effectiveness in a mouse model compared to current delivery methods.

In cancer treatments, the results were just as striking. In an animal model of melanoma, an mRNA cancer treatment delivered with C-a16 lipids shrank tumors three times more effectively than the same treatment delivered with the LNPs used in the COVID-19 vaccines. The new lipids also gave cancer-fighting T cells a boost, helping them recognize and destroy tumor cells more efficiently -- and with less oxidative stress.

Finally, when the team used the C-a16 lipids for preparing COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, the immune response in animal models was five times stronger than with standard formulations.

""By causing less disruption to cellular machinery, the new, phenol-containing lipids can enhance a wide range of LNP applications,"" says Kim.

Old Chemistry, New Frontiers

Besides investigating the immediate potential of the new lipids to reduce side effects in mRNA vaccines, the researchers look forward to exploring how overlooked chemical processes like the Mannich reaction can unlock new LNP-enhancing recipes.

""We tried applying one reaction discovered a century ago, and found it could drastically improve cutting-edge medical treatments,"" says Mitchell. ""It's exciting to imagine what else remains to be rediscovered.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New Duke study finds obesity rises with caloric intake, not couch time","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250720034023.htm","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:52:58 GMT","

A newly released study from Duke University's Pontzer Lab, housed in the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology in Trinity College of Arts & Sciences, looks at the correlations between economic development, daily energy expenditure and the rise in a country's obesity level.

While many experts have offered that rising obesity rates are due to declining physical activity as societies become more industrialized, the findings show that people in wealthier countries expend just as much -- or even more -- energy daily. In an article recently published in PNAS, Duke researchers point instead to higher caloric intake as the primary driver, suggesting that diet rather than idleness plays the bigger role in the global obesity crisis.

""Despite decades of trying to understand the root causes of the obesity crisis in economically developed countries, public health guidance remains stuck with uncertainty as to the relative importance of diet and physical activity. This large, international, collaborative effort allows us to test these competing ideas. It's clear that changes in diet, not reduced activity, are the main cause of obesity in the U.S. and other developed countries,"" says Herman Pontzer, principal investigator with the Pontzer Lab and professor in the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology.

The researchers analyzed thousands of measurements of daily energy expenditure, body fat percentage and body mass index (BMI) from adults aged 18 to 60 across 34 populations spanning six continents. The more than 4,200 adults included in the study came from a wide range of lifestyles and economies, including hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, farming and industrialized populations. To further categorize the level of industrialization, they also integrated data from the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) to incorporate measures of lifespan, prosperity and education.

""While we saw a marginal decrease in size-adjusted total energy expenditure with economic development, differences in total energy expenditure explained only a fraction of the increase in body fat that accompanied development. This suggests that other factors, such as dietary changes, are driving the increases in body fat that we see with increasing economic development,"" says Amanda McGrosky, a Duke postdoctoral alumna and lead investigator for the study who is now an assistant professor of biology at Elon University.

The researchers hope the study helps clarify public health messaging and strategies to tackle the obesity crisis and explain that the findings do not mean that efforts to promote physical activity should be minimized. Instead, the data support an emerging consensus that both diet and exercise should be prioritized. ""Diet and physical activity should be viewed as essential and complementary, rather than interchangeable,"" the study notes. They will next work to identify which aspects of diet in developed countries are most responsible for the rise in obesity.

Polygenic scores (PGSs) for body mass index (BMI) may guide early prevention and targeted treatment of obesity. Using genetic data from up to 5.1 million people (4.6% African ancestry, 14.4% American ancestry, 8.4% East Asian ancestry, 71.1% European ancestry and 1.5% South Asian ancestry) from the GIANT consortium and 23andMe, Inc., we developed ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs. The multi-ancestry score explained 17.6% of BMI variation among UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. For other populations, this ranged from 16% in East Asian-Americans to 2.2% in rural Ugandans. In the ALSPAC study, children with higher PGSs showed accelerated BMI gain from age 2.5 years to adolescence, with earlier adiposity rebound. Adding the PGS to predictors available at birth nearly doubled explained variance for BMI from age 5 onward (for example, from 11% to 21% at age 8). Up to age 5, adding the PGS to early-life BMI improved prediction of BMI at age 18 (for example, from 22% to 35% at age 5). Higher PGSs were associated with greater adult weight gain. In intensive lifestyle intervention trials, individuals with higher PGSs lost modestly more weight in the first year (0.55 kg per s.d.) but were more likely to regain it. Overall, these data show that PGSs have the potential to improve obesity prediction, particularly when implemented early in life.

Obesity is a major public health concern that causes or exacerbates many chronic diseases and leads to reduced life expectancy1,2,3. By 2035, more than half of the global population is projected to be living with overweight or obesity4. Although intensive lifestyle interventions (ILIs), bariatric surgery and weight loss medications are effective treatment options5,6, they are not without risk and likely to remain inaccessible to most people. Thus, preventing obesity remains paramount.

In contrast to many other chronic conditions, obesity often manifests itself during childhood and tends to persist into adulthood7,8,9. Therefore, predictors available in early life, such as genetic variants, which are fixed at conception, could be of particular value. In recent years, PGSs that capture an individual's inherited polygenic susceptibility to a trait or disease have shown great promise in enhancing disease risk prediction and population screening10,11. However, it remains unclear how, when and under what circumstances PGSs for obesity might demonstrate utility for risk prediction.

The widely used PGS for obesity by Khera et al.12, based on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BMI in over 339,000 people of predominantly European ancestry, explains approximately 8.5% of the variation in BMI in adults. However, as a PGS based on one ancestry population may have weak transferability to other ancestry populations13,14, there is a growing recognition that PGSs that represent a broad range of populations are needed to ensure quality healthcare for all15.

By leveraging the results of the largest GWAS meta-analyses for BMI from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium and 23andMe, we derived ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs for BMI and obesity to examine their performance (1) across diverse adult populations, (2) across childhood and adolescence and (3) in the context of ILIs aimed at weight loss (Fig. 1).

PGSs were constructed using ancestry-specific GWAS summary statistics, using ancestry-specific (PRS-CS) and ancestry-combined (PRS-CSx) approaches. Tuning of the global shrinkage parameter (ϕ) and optimal weights for the linear combination version of PRS-CSx was performed in the UKBB. The best-performing score across multiple ancestries was taken forward to independent validation studies (linear combination version of PRS-CSx with ϕ 1 × 10−2). Population descriptors shown in the figure reflect a combination of self-identified ethnicity and genetic similarity. Created in BioRender: Smit, R. (2025): https://BioRender.com/fglrflj.

To develop a PGS for BMI, we used GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics for BMI from over 200 studies from the GIANT consortium and 23andMe (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), excluding eight studies used for tuning parameters and for testing performance (Methods). The GWAS summary statistics included contributions from over 5.1 million people of diverse populations based on a combination of self-identified ethnicity and genetic similarity: 71.1% of participants were of predominantly European ancestry; 14.4% were of Hispanic ethnicity with typically admixed ancestries; 8.4% were of predominantly East Asian ancestry; 4.6% were of predominantly African ancestry (primarily admixed African American populations); and 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry. We refer to these groups, and to the most closely aligning, genetically inferred population groups from our PGS tuning and testing studies, as being of European-like ancestry (EUR), East Asian-like ancestry (EAS), American-like ancestry (AMR), African-like ancestry (AFR) and South Asian-like ancestry (SAS), respectively, while acknowledging that these groupings oversimplify the actual genetic diversity among participants (see Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 for study-specific population descriptors). Using PRS-CS(x)16,17, we created ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs leveraging up to 1.3 million common variants. We first identified the optimal genome-wide shrinkage parameter and linear combination weights for PRS-CS(x) that achieved the highest explained variance for BMI in six ancestry subpopulations of the UK Biobank (UKBB)18, including individuals of Middle Eastern-like ancestry (MID). For the EUR-tuning population, we selected a random subset of 20,000 unrelated individuals (Methods and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).

Overall, a multi-ancestry PGS consisting of a linear combination of five ancestry-specific PGSs (PGSLC) was the best-performing score (Methods, Fig. 2a and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). In absolute terms, the explained variance of this multi-ancestry PGS for BMI ranged between 7.2% (AFR) and 17.5% (EUR), with a median of 14.0% (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 5). The multi-ancestry PGS resulted in a higher explained variance than the PGSs trained only with GWAS summary statistics most closely corresponding to the target population (‘ancestry-matched') (Supplementary Table 5). This was particularly evident for the populations of African-like and Central/South Asian-like ancestry (2.6-fold and 2.8-fold increase, respectively), consistent with the smaller GWAS sample sizes available for these populations. The performance of a PGS consisting of near-independent, genome-wide significant variants from the overall multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis was generally intermediate to that of the ancestry-matched and multi-ancestry PGSs, with the exception of populations of East Asian-like and European-like ancestry, in whom it performed worse than either (Fig. 2a).

Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from 1,000 bootstrap resamples. The ancestry-matched PGS is the best-performing PRS-CS score using ancestry-specific GWAS summary statistics. The genome-wide significant score reflects a weighted sum of near-independent SNPs obtained from approximate COJO multi-SNP analyses of a fixed-effect meta-analysis of all contributing GWASs. The multi-ancestral PGSLC reflects the best-performing PRS-CSx score consisting of a linear combination of five ancestry-specific scores, with weights being specific to the validation population (for example, AFR).

All traits were rank-based inverse-normal transformed by sex.

Having tuned parameters in a subset of the UKBB, we took PGSLC forward to independent validation populations, estimating the prediction accuracy for BMI and obesity in 482,135 participants from the UKBB, the Million Veteran Program (MVP)19,20, the BioMe Biobank21 and the Uganda General Population Cohort (GPC-UGR)22. Individuals were grouped by population group (AMR 22,612, AFR 29,454, EAS 1,617, EUR 423,420, SAS 1,164 and non-Hispanic Asian (AS) 4,201) (MVP-specific population label) (Methods and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The prevalence of obesity varied substantially across populations and cohorts, with those having obesity class I or higher (that is, BMI ≥ 30 kg m−2 in AFR, AMR and EUR populations and BMI ≥ 27.5 kg m−2 for Asian-like ancestry populations23) ranging from 4.3% for the GPC-UGR to more than 45% for all ancestry subgroups in the MVP and mean BMI ranging from 22.2 kg m−2 to 30.6 kg m2 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 4).

The performance of the PGSLC was highest in individuals of European-like ancestry from the UKBB, with an explained variance of 17.6%. A pronounced lower performance was seen for populations with greater proportions of African-like ancestry, with the explained variance being 6.3% and 5.1% in African American populations (from BioMe and MVP, respectively) and 2.2% in the GPC-UGR population from rural southwestern Uganda (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 7). Overall, we observed a median explained variance of 10.3% across our testing populations.

Compared to the previously reported PGS by Khera et al. (PGSKhera)12, which was based on a smaller BMI GWAS of up to 339,224 individuals of primarily European ancestry24, we observed a 1.9–2.6-fold increase in explained variance for BMI (Fig. 2b).

Within the UKBB participants of European-like ancestry, the explained variance was marginally higher in males than in females (males: 17.9%; females: 17.3%) and higher in younger compared to older participants (≤50 years: 18.8%; >50 years: 17.0%) (Supplementary Table 8), both directionally consistent with sex-specific and age-specific genetic differences previously observed for BMI25,26. Within this same cohort, an s.d. increase of PGSLC was associated with a 1.98 kg m−2 higher BMI (equivalent to 5.7 kg of body weight for a 1.7-m tall person) (Supplementary Table 9). The corresponding mean separation across deciles of PGSLC was less pronounced for body fat percentage and waist-to-hip ratio compared to BMI (Fig. 2c), revealing that the score does not equally capture differences in body composition.

We further evaluated the overall performance and discrimination of the PGS for prevalent obesity. Among European-like ancestry population groups, the PGSLC showed an improved capacity to differentiate between participants with and without obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg m−2) compared to PGSKhera. Specifically, the prevalence in the top 1% of the PGSLC was 69.5% versus 54.9% for PGSKhera and, in the bottom 1%, 1.7% versus 5.1%, respectively (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 2). Across populations, an s.d. increase in PGSLC was associated with a median 1.9–2.6-fold increase in odds of obesity class I or higher (Fig. 3b). We observed larger effects for more severe obesity (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) similarly increased with the severity of obesity and neared 0.80 for severe obesity in multiple populations (Fig. 3c). The AUC for PGSLC on its own was consistently larger than those for age and sex, PGSKhera and within the UKBB self-reported comparative body size at age 10 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 11).

Error bars show 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.

Models including PGSs (included as a continuous predictor) additionally include principal components of ancestry. CBS10, self-reported comparative body size at age 10 years. Restricted to estimates where the number of individuals with the obesity outcome was at least 50.

After an ancestry adjustment (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 4), the median odds ratio for obesity class I or higher across BioMe's population groups was 3.6 for those in the top 10% of PGSLC (compared to bottom 90%) and 4.1 for the top 5% (versus those in the bottom 95%) (Supplementary Table 12), with greater separation between these two tail estimates for European-like and Asian-like ancestry groups.

We investigated whether PGSLC has predictive value at an early age within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a geographically homogeneous prospective birth cohort from the southwest of England with follow-up until early adulthood (Methods and Supplementary Table 3)27,28,29. Repeated cross-sectional associations with BMI showed small effects for PGSLC soon after birth with much stronger effects emerging in early childhood, from 0.12 s.d. per s.d. of PGSLC at 12 months to nearly quadruple that size (0.45 s.d. per s.d. of PGSLC) by age 12 years, after which effects plateaued (Fig. 4a). The PGS was also associated, albeit less strongly, with height in early childhood with effects increasing until age 12 years, after which they returned to zero by mid-adolescence, suggesting that genetic predisposition for higher BMI early in life promotes increased body size in general, including postnatal linear growth, but that this early growth does not translate into differences in height after puberty (Extended Data Fig. 5). This is in line with childhood overweight and obesity's known associations with earlier pubertal timing30. Over time, BMI in children with a higher genetic predisposition (PGS ≥10th percentile) increased at a faster rate than those with a lower genetic predisposition, most evident after age 2.5 years (Methods, Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 13). Both boys and girls with a very early age of adiposity rebound (≤43 months), a well-established predictor of future obesity risk31, had a higher mean PGS than those with later ages of adiposity rebound (Supplementary Table 14).

Data are presented as regression coefficient with 95% confidence interval (CI). Ponderal index was used instead of BMI at birth. Associations were adjusted for age and principal components of ancestry. Sample sizes, based on repeated measurements, from left to right, for BMI: 4,740, 638, 847, 814, 769, 41, 732, 729, 725, 720, 699, 5,816, 4,863, 5,570, 5,368, 5,187, 4,910, 4,556, 4,024, 3,603, 2,780; and height: 4,802, 638, 847, 814, 771, 741, 734, 729, 726, 723, 701, 5,820, 5,160, 5,572, 5,379, 5,188, 4,956, 4,561, 4,032, 3,606, 2,782. b, Sequentially plotted mean BMI trajectories from the age of 4 months to 24 years with knot points from linear spline multilevel models, accounting for sex and principal components of ancestry, of PGSLC (bottom 10%, middle 80%, top 10%). c, Contribution of PGSLC to explained variance (adjusted R2) for BMI, rank-based inverse-normal transformed by sex and timepoint. Ponderal index was used instead of BMI at birth. Data are presented as R2 values computed from the original dataset, with error bars representing 95% confidence intervals (2.5th–97.5th percentiles) estimated from 1,000 bootstrap resamples. Predictors available at birth were birthweight, maternal education, pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, maternal age at date of birth and household social status. The left panel shows explained variance for BMI at the timepoint shown on the x axis. In contrast, the right panel shows explained variance for BMI measured at 18 years, with early-life BMI measurement shown on the x axis used as predictors. Sample sizes, based on repeated measurements, from left to right: 3,800, 839, 714, 1,192, 4,062, 3,044, 940, 594, 737, 725, 890, 3,310.

We then examined whether the PGS adds predictive value over and above clinically available predictors of obesity. When added to predictors that are measurable at birth (birthweight, maternal education, pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, maternal age at date of birth and household social status), the PGS showed no clear added value for predicting ponderal index at birth or BMI at ages 3 years and 5 years (Methods and Fig. 4c, left panel). However, for predicting BMI at later ages (8, 11 and 15 years), the contribution of the predictors at birth plateaued, whereas inclusion of the PGS roughly doubled the total explained variance from 11% to 21% at age 8 and from 13% to 26% at age 15 (Fig. 4c, left panel).

For the prediction of BMI in early adulthood, the contribution of the PGS especially shines through in the first few years after birth. BMI measured at age 8 explained 44% of the variation in BMI at age 18, and adding the PGS to the prediction model only raised this to 49%. In contrast, at younger ages, adding the PGS to measured BMI led to larger relative increases in the explained variance for BMI at 18 years, from 1.5-fold at age 5 (from 22% to 35%) to more than three-fold (from 8% to 26%) at 1 year of age (Fig. 4c, right panel, and Supplementary Table 15).

Within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial (Methods)32, both males and females with a higher PGS experienced a greater change in self-reported weight and BMI between age 20 and age 50. Across populations, the per-5-year change per s.d. in PGSLC was consistently larger for females than for males (median of 0.35 kg for females versus 0.21 kg for males and 0.14 kg m−2 versus 0.07 kg m−2 for BMI), also when corrected for initial weight or BMI (Supplementary Table 16).

The addition of the PGS to a model with birth year, sex and BMI at age 20 was associated with modest increases in discriminative ability for predicting obesity at age 50 (incremental AUC ranged from 0.01 to 0.03; Fig. 5). There was evidence of statistical interaction between the PGS and BMI at age 20 for obesity at age 50 (Methods and Supplementary Table 17), which translated into a larger incremental AUC of the PGS for those who did not have overweight or obesity at age 20 (range, 0.02–0.05; Fig. 5), without strong evidence of sex specificity (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Lifestyle modification remains a cornerstone of weight management, with multicomponent ILIs having shown success in achieving clinically relevant weight loss33. However, ILIs require substantial, sustained investment from both healthcare providers and patients, with large variation in weight loss and unintentional weight regain being common34,35,36. To examine whether polygenic predisposition to obesity might modify the effectiveness of such interventions, we examined whether the PGS was associated with weight loss during the first year of an ILI, and with weight regain thereafter, in two randomized controlled trials with similar intervention arms aimed at achieving 7% weight loss: the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP33) and the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes37) studies (Methods).

Among 3,909 participants (Supplementary Table 4), individuals with a higher PGSLC lost more weight during the first year in response to the ILI compared to the control group (−0.55 kg per s.d. in PGS, 95% confidence interval: −0.94 to −0.16) (Fig. 6), when adjusting for starting weight. In addition, among those who lost at least 3% of their baseline weight during the first year, a higher PGS was associated with more weight regain in the following years (up to 3 years) (0.48 kg per PGS s.d., 95% confidence interval: 0.00–0.95) (Fig. 6). These findings were directionally consistent across (self-)reported population groups.

Interaction effect between PGSLC and trial arm (ILI versus comparison arm) for weight change within the first year of follow-up (left) and weight change after the first year in the subset of individuals who had lost ≥3% of baseline weight at year 1 (right). Data are presented as study-specific and study-combined interaction regression coefficients (with 95% confidence interval (CI)), pooled through inverse-variance weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis. Weight change was assessed by using weight at follow-up timepoint(s) as outcome in the linear mixed models, adjusting for initial weight (baseline or year 1, respectively). LA, Look AHEAD.

Study-specific sample sizes (distinct individuals, with pooled sample sizes for ‘All'), from top to bottom, for forest plot on the left: 295, 374, 251, 428, 839, 1,722, 1,385, 2,524; and on the right: 118, 186, 128, 233, 428, 951, 674, 1,370.

We used GWAS summary statistics from the GIANT consortium and 23andMe, encompassing over 5.1 million people, to create ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs capturing genetic predisposition to weight gain and obesity. Our multi-ancestry PGS more than doubled the explained variance for BMI compared to the widely used PGS by Khera et al.12. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential added value of the PGS in two distinct clinical applications: predicting adult BMI at an early age and weight change in response to ILIs.

Across diverse populations, the increases in explained variance for BMI were accompanied by substantial improvements in effect sizes and discrimination metrics for obesity, with the PGSs' standalone AUC nearing 0.80 for severe obesity. Consistent with other polygenic traits, our results underscore the importance of training sample size in driving PGS performance improvements. Nonetheless, our results also show diminishing returns of sample size increases, as has been observed for other polygenic traits38, with a 15-fold increase in total sample size (compared to PGSKhera, ~10-fold in EUR alone) leading to a 2–3-fold increase in prediction accuracy. We leveraged PRS-CSx's unique ability to integrate GWAS summary statistics from all five broad ancestry population groups from the meta-analyses from GIANT and 23andMe17. However, recent Bayesian methods have shown promising results with smaller sample sizes by including additional variants and functional annotation, meriting consideration for future comparisons39,40. Although our results highlight the value of multi-ancestry PGS to increase PGS performance, a considerable performance gap persists for populations with substantial African-like genetic ancestry compared to other populations. This discrepancy is likely due to the underrepresentation of individuals with African-like ancestry in the training GWAS, particularly from continental Africa41, and differences in minor allele frequency (MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns42,43. The lower performance of the PGS in the GPC-UGR is in line with those seen therein for PGSs for other traits and the limited transferability of PGS performance between African ancestry populations, reflecting genetic and environmental differences as well as their interactions22,44,45,46,47, emphasising that much remains to be done to improve the performance of genetic risk prediction across the genetically diverse populations within Africa. For example, it remains unclear whether a finer classification of broad ancestry groups in GWAS meta-analyses and PGS development could improve downstream PGS generalizability, especially given the dominant role of GWAS sample size. Given the observed performance gap, careful implementation of the score is essential to avoid potentially introducing public health disparities. For example, establishing a standardized ancestry threshold14,48 may improve the accuracy of population-specific risk stratification and ensure that the score is returned only in populations where it meets an acceptable performance threshold.

Within ALSPAC, the PGS—which was developed for adult BMI—already shows an effect on BMI early in life. Effect sizes rapidly increased with age and were accompanied by clear divergence of BMI trajectories throughout childhood and adolescence. As a result, the PGS showed added value beyond clinically available predictors assessed at birth for predicting BMI measured after age 5. This is in line with previous research on the dynamic relationship between genetic variation and adiposity in early life12,49,50. Particularly elucidating are the observations from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) with repeated measurements across narrow age windows51. They show that BMI has a rapidly changing genetic architecture during the first 8 years of life with a ‘late rise' cluster of variants, emerging in late childhood, which show limited association before the adiposity rebound but have persistent effects on BMI into adult life51. This also explains why our PGS shows its value for predicting adult BMI during the earliest years of life, up to age 5, when measured BMI has limited value as a predictor. With a growing number of obesity prevention trials commencing in early life52,53, our results provide important context at what age(s) PGSs for obesity, potentially in tandem with PGSs of obesity-related complications, could be considered promising candidate predictors to help guide risk stratification and the implementation of such interventions.

In the PLCO study, a higher PGS was associated with weight gain over a 30-year period from early adulthood to midlife. Additionally, for individuals aged 20, knowing their PGS modestly improved the prediction of obesity at age 50, more so for those without overweight or obesity at age 20. This suggests that particularly individuals with an early adulthood BMI below their genetically predicted BMI are at risk of gaining weight to match their innate predisposition. Our findings are consistent with those from the CARDIA study54, showing that PGSs for obesity only marginally improve the prediction of midlife BMI when combined with early adulthood BMI measurements, contrasting with its predictive value in early life.

Analyzing clinical trial data of ILIs, we observed that individuals with a higher PGS lost modestly more weight during the first year. However, this group was also at higher risk of weight regain after this most intensive portion of the intervention had concluded. This may seem counterintuitive to the expectation that those with a higher genetic risk will benefit less from weight loss interventions. However, this observation is supported by a strong body of literature reporting that those most genetically predisposed to obesity are also those most responsive to changes in an obesogenic environment55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63. However, the literature on the role of genetics modifying response to weight loss interventions remains sparse and ambiguous, reflecting differences in variants considered, methods and study design, highlighting the need for well-powered PGSs64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73. It will be of interest to investigate whether PGSs for obesity have predictive utility for the fast-growing arsenal of pharmacotherapies aimed at weight loss. Separately, the current results offer crucial context when conveying genetic results of obesity risk to participants, which has generally shown either no or even short-lived adverse effects on risk-reducing behavior74,75,76,77. Rather, our findings emphasize that individuals with a high genetic predisposition to obesity may respond more to lifestyle changes and, thus, contrast with the determinist view that genetic predisposition is unmodifiable78. This is further reinforced by evidence that polygenic susceptibility can mitigate or exacerbate the impact of pathogenic variants in MC4R, underscoring the complexity of genetic influences on obesity79. We look forward to the findings of the Electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network's PGS-based genome-informed risk assessment being returned to 25,000 diverse adults and children for 11 conditions, including obesity/BMI14.

Taken together, we show that BMI PGSs can be used for prediction of adult obesity throughout the life course, particularly in early life, and for severe obesity. This PGS represents a substantial improvement compared to previous scores and may help to identify individuals at high risk to allow for timely prevention or treatment of obesity, such as through integration in a broader predictive framework jointly modeling genetic and environmental risk.

The list of studies contributing to the GWAS meta-analyses for BMI, which served as the training data for the presented PGSs, is provided in Supplementary Table 1. The study populations described below are those that contributed as a PGS tuning or validation population.

The UKBB is a prospective cohort study that enrolled approximately 500,000 people from across the UK, aged 40–69 years at recruitment, between 2006 and 2010 (ref. 18). At recruitment, participants completed detailed questionnaires, underwent a range of physical measures and provided blood, urine and saliva samples. BMI was calculated using height (measured in whole centimeters) and weight (to the nearest 0.1 kg). Females who were pregnant at the time of assessment were excluded from our analysis. As a measure of comparative childhood body size, participants were asked: ‘When you were 10 years old, compared to average, would you describe yourself as: (i) thinner, (ii) plumper, (iii) about average?'.

The MVP has recruited over 1 million people from Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Centers across the United States since 2011 (ref. 19). Veterans who volunteer provide a blood sample for biobanking, complete baseline and lifestyle questionnaires and consent to allow access to clinical data from VA electronic health records (EHRs). For the current study, PGS performance was assessed in the MVP's third release of genomic data (R3) using additional participants without overlap, with earlier data releases contributing to the GIANT GWAS meta-analyses. Phenotypic and genomic data related to the association analysis of BMI were previously described20.

The Institute for Personalized Medicine BioMe Biobank, founded in 2007, is an ancestrally and culturally highly diverse EHR-linked biorepository enrolling participants non-selectively from across the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City21. At enrollment, participants consent to link their DNA and plasma samples to deidentified EHRs. The clinical and EHR information is complemented by a baseline questionnaire that gathers demographic and lifestyle information. BMI was calculated using weight and height from baseline and outpatient EHR measurements, using median height and weight measured at or within 60 days before/after the enrollment visit, after several cleaning steps (Supplementary Table 3).

The GPC-UGR is a population-based open cohort study established in 1989 by the Medical Research Council (UK) in collaboration with the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) to monitor the HIV epidemic and its determinants in neighboring villages in rural southwestern Uganda, in the Kyamulibwa subcounty of the Kalungu district, approximately 120 km from Entebbe town. Since 2010, its mandate has expanded to incorporate the epidemiology and genetics of both communicable and non-communicable diseases22. The GPC-UGR was initially recruited and assessed through annual house-to-house census and survey rounds until 2012, when biannual surveys commenced. For the current study, we included individuals aged 18 years and older who have been either whole-genome genotyped or whole-genome sequenced80,81.

The ALSPAC is a prospective birth cohort from the southwest of England established to investigate environmental and genetic characteristics that influence health, development and growth of children and their parents27,28,29. Full details of the cohort and study design are available at http://www.alspac.bris.ac.uk. In brief, pregnant females residing in Avon, UK, with expected dates of delivery between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992 were invited to take part in the study. The initial number of pregnancies enrolled was 14,541, with 13,988 children who were alive at 1 year of age. The children resulting from these pregnancies have been followed-up to date with measures obtained through regular questionnaires and clinical visits, providing information on a range of behavioral, lifestyle and biological data. More specifically, a 10% sample of the ALSPAC cohort, known as the Children in Focus (CiF) group, attended clinics at the University of Bristol at various time intervals between 4 months and 61 months of age, whereas the entire ALSPAC cohort was invited to attend regular research clinics from age 7. When the oldest children were approximately age 7, an attempt was made to bolster the initial sample with eligible individuals who had failed to join the study originally. The total sample size available for analyses using any data collected after the age of 7 is, therefore, 15,447 pregnancies, with 14,901 children who were alive at 1 year of age. Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools hosted at the University of Bristol82. REDCap is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies. Details on sample selection for the current analyses are presented in Supplementary Table 3. Please note that the study website contains details of all data that are available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/).

The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial was a multicenter randomized controlled trial in the United States that enrolled males and females aged 55–74 years from 1993 to 2001 to evaluate the effectiveness of different screening programs on cancer mortality32. In the baseline questionnaire, participants self-reported their weight at age 20 years, age 50 years and baseline as well as their height. For the current study, we restricted the analyses to genotyped participants who had not contributed to the underlying GWAS meta-analyses and had information available on their weight and BMI at both age 20 and age 50.

The DPP was a 27-site parallel-arm randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether either the oral diabetes drug metformin or an ILI (primarily fat gram, calorie and physical activity goals) aimed at approximately 7% weight loss, compared to inactive tablets and standard lifestyle recommendations, could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes onset in ethnically diverse high-risk individuals with prediabetes and overweight or obesity33. For the current study, we excluded individuals from the metformin arm as well as those from a fourth intervention arm, troglitazone, which was discontinued at an early stage. Moreover, we focused on the individuals comprising the three largest race and ethnicity categories (White, Black and Hispanic, as reported by database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP) variable phv00201855.v2.p1) who had consented to being genotyped.

Look AHEAD was a 16-site parallel-arm randomized controlled trial that assessed the long-term effects of an ILI in ethnically diverse patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality37. The lifestyle intervention was modeled after the DPP lifestyle intervention and similarly aimed at 7% weight loss but with more ambitious individual goals for several intervention components83. Although those in both trial arms were provided one session of education on diabetes and cardiovascular risk at baseline, the comparison arm thereafter received the option of attending only three sessions per year on nutrition, physical activity and social support, with no explicit weight loss goals. As for the DPP, we restricted our analyses to genotyped participants who self-reported as being of African American/Black, Hispanic and White race and ethnicity on the baseline questionnaire.

Population descriptors and study-provided population labels and genotyping, phenotyping and participant characteristics are presented in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. No new data (that is, measurements) were collected for this study, and no participant compensation was provided for the analyses conducted.

To derive our scores, we used summary statistics from the ongoing GWAS meta-analyses for BMI conducted by the GIANT consortium (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium) in collaboration with 23andMe. Prior to each GWAS, BMI (kg m−2) underwent rank-based inverse-normal transformation by sex, similarity to major ancestry group (AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR, SAS) and case–control status as appropriate, with age, age2, principal components of population structure and study-specific covariates regressed out. Ancestry group assignment was defined independently by each contributing study, as previously described84. Additive GWAS analyses were performed primarily using RVTESTS for 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) phase 3 or Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC)-imputed data85. For 23andMe, which performed its GWAS on BMI using self-reported height and weight, see Supplementary Table 2 for details on phenotyping, ancestry group assignment and GWAS methodology. Quality control of the study-specific files was conducted using EasyQC86, followed by fixed-effect meta-analysis by ancestry group using RAREMETAL87. When performing the GWAS meta-analyses to train the PGSs with, we purposely excluded data from several populations (ALSPAC, BioMe and UKBB). No additional genomic control was applied to the resulting summary statistics.

For PGS derivation, we employed PRS-CS and its multi-ancestral extension PRS-CSx (versions 1.0.0)16,17. In short, PRS-CS(x) uses a Bayesian regression framework and assumes a continuous shrinkage prior on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects. Whereas PRS-CS focuses on creating ancestry-specific scores, informed only by the GWAS summary statistics and LD information of a given population, PRS-CSx uses a shared prior to couple SNP effects across populations and explicitly models population-specific allele frequencies and LD patterns to create multi-ancestry scores. Both methods were implemented using the software's default settings (that is, gamma–gamma priors set to a = 1 and b = 0.5, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) total and burn-in iterations set at 1,000 times and 500 times the number of discovery populations and MC thinning factor set at 5), with input being ancestry-matched summary statistics and PRS-CS(x) developer-provided 1000G LD reference panels of common HapMap3 variants (AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR, SAS). PRS-CS(x) uses a global scaling parameter (Φ), which requires tuning. In addition to small-scale grid testing of Φ (1 × 10−6, 1 × 10−4, 1 × 10−2, 1), we ran PRS-CS(x) using its ‘auto' option, which learns Φ automatically from the GWAS summary statistics. Finally, PRS-CSx was performed separately using its default ‘linear combination' as well as its ‘meta' version. In the first, a set of population-specific PGSs is outputted (that is, five in our case), for which the optimal linear combination needs to be derived for each target population (for example, AFR) in a population-matched tuning dataset. For ‘meta', the population-specific posterior SNP effects are integrated using an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis in the Gibbs sampler, producing a single score that can theoretically be applied regardless of the target population.

The variants considered for PGS derivation were those present in the 1000G reference panels mentioned above (HapMap3 variants (n = 1–1.2 million across panels), which were common in 1000G populations, excluding ambiguous A/T or G/C variants), which additionally had an INFO > 0.3 (that is, imputation quality) in the overall UKBB. Ancestry-specific summary statistics were further restricted to the variants with a variant-specific sample size of at least a third of the maximum sample size for that ancestry.

Tuning of Φ and derivation of PRS-CSx's linear combination weights were performed in the same subsets of the UKBB. More specifically, we used genetically determined relatedness and ancestry assignments provided by the Pan-UKBB Team (https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org, UKBB return 2442) to subset the UKBB into groups of unrelated individuals of African-like, Admixed American-like, Central/South Asian-like, East Asian-like, European-like (random subset of 20,000 individuals) and Middle Eastern-like ancestry. The target-population-specific (for example, AFR) linear combination weights for PRS-CSx (for each Φ) were derived from a joint linear regression model of rank-based inverse-normal transformed BMI (by sex and population) on the five population-specific scores (each standardized to mean zero and unit variance in the corresponding tuning dataset—for example, UKBBAFR), age, 10 principal components and genotyping array.

Explained variance for BMI was defined as the incremental adjusted R2 from linear regression for rank-based inverse-normal transformed BMI (by sex and population), when adding the PGS predictor to a model containing age, principal components and genotyping array. Confidence intervals (95%) were determined using bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions. As comparator, we created a score of quasi-independent associations after performing approximate conditional and joint (COJO) multiple-SNP analysis88, as implemented in GCTA89, using the results from the multi-ancestral GWAS summary statistics when leaving out only the UKBB. We used genotypes from a previously described set of 50,000 unrelated UKBBEUR participants84 as our LD reference panel for GCTA-COJO, with parameters set to: –diff-freq 0.1; –maf 0.01; –cojo-collinear 0.9; –cojo-p 5 × 10−9. The scores with the highest explained variance across multiple tuning population datasets (PRS-CSx linear combination and meta versions, with Φ 1 × 10−2) were then taken forward to the validation populations, which performed study-level variant filtering on imputation quality when constructing each PGS (Supplementary Table 3). The results of PGSmeta are presented throughout the supplementary tables.

Of note, in August 2023, a new version of PRS-CSx was released (version 1.1.0) to address potential reductions in performance due to truncating of GWAS summary statistics P values below 1 × 10−323. Given our inclusion of several variants with P values below this threshold (among the PGS variants: n = 154 for EUR, n = 12 for AMR), we reran PRS-CSx with Φ 1 × 10−2 but did not observe markedly different results in PGS performance within the UKBB tuning populations (Supplementary Table 18).

In addition to explained variance (%) for BMI, several population-stratified metrics for overall performance and discrimination were calculated in the validation studies with adult participants:

Nagelkerke R2, with a null model of age, sex, principal components and genotyping array, for prevalent obesity categories based on World Health Organization (WHO) BMI cutoff points (membership of category or above versus rest), using Asian-specific cutoffs where applicable (Supplementary Table 3)23. Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions.

Mean difference in BMI, both untransformed and after rank-based inverse-normal transformation by sex, per s.d. increase in PGS. Covariates included age, sex (where applicable), principal components and genotyping array.

Odds ratio per s.d. of PGS for prevalent WHO obesity outcome. Same covariates as under (B). Here, the PGSs were standardized to mean zero and unit variance using the mean and s.d. of the PGS observed within participants without the outcome (for example, individuals who do not fall within obesity class I (or higher), where this was the outcome), to account for prevalence differences across studies.

AUC statistic for prevalent WHO obesity outcomes. We compare models including (i) age and sex, (ii) genotyping array, principal components and PGSKhera, (iii) genotyping array, principal components and PGSLC and (iv) models (i)/(iii) combined. In the UKBB, we additionally ran models including and excluding self-reported comparative body size at age 10 (UKBB field ID 1687). Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using DeLong's method.

In addition, the explained variance for BMI was calculated separately in age strata (≤50 years or >50 years, with adjustment for residual age differences within age strata) and sex strata of the European UKBB participants. The main comparator for all analyses was a previously published LDpred-derived PGS for BMI (PGSKhera)12, which was based on the results from a GIANT consortium GWAS meta-analysis including up to 339,224 individuals of primarily European ancestry24. As BioMe had contributed to this meta-analysis, metrics for PGSKhera were determined in individuals who had not contributed nor were related to those who did (second or stronger degree of relatedness, based on KING-derived kinship coefficients). We chose PGSKhera as our comparator as it is the most widely recognized and extensively used PGS for BMI within the obesity research community, thereby serving as a well-established benchmark.

Due to on-average differences in LD structure and allele frequencies, the distribution of a PGS (for example, mean and variance) can differ across ancestral populations. This was also observed for the five population-specific PGSs that were linearly combined to create PGSLC (Extended Data Fig. 4). As performance metrics that rely on thresholding the PGS distribution (for example, top 10%) may be impacted by such on-average differences90, particularly in admixed populations, we modeled the mean and variance of the population-specific PGSs through principal component analysis of the 1000G reference panel. For this, we applied a correction described by the eMERGE network14,91, which represents a modified version of the approach by Khera et al.92. Starting with a publicly available, curated version of the 1000G reference panel (https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Imputation_Pipeline/references_overview; gs://broad-gotc-test-storage/imputation/1000 G_reference_panel), we first excluded variants with MAF < 1% across 1000G superpopulations, before determining the overlap with genotyped variants available for both the UKBB and BioMe. After excluding long-range LD regions, we pruned the list of variants using plink (–indep-pairwise 1000 50 0.05) and ran principal component analysis with flashpca93, whereafter we projected UKBB and BioMe participants to the same 1000G principal component space. For each of the five population-specific PGSs underlying PGSLC (that is, AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR and SAS), we regressed the PGS of 1000G participants against the first 10 principal components of ancestry:

In addition, we modeled its residual variance (\({\delta }^{2}\)) as a function of the same principal components:

Then, using the projected principal component, predicted mean and residual s.d. were calculated and used to create ancestry-adjusted z-scores of each PGS for UKBB and BioMe participants:

with \({\sum }_{j=1}^{M}{w}_{\!j}\times {{dosage}}_{j}\) representing the raw PGS.

We observed that mean and variance differences of scores across ancestry populations were largely, but not fully, resolved through this correction in both study populations (Extended Data Fig. 4). In keeping with PRS-CSx's linear combination approach, weights to linearly combine scores were derived within each UKBB tuning population and applied to BioMe validation populations. The ancestry-adjusted PGSLC was then thresholded at its top 5% and 10% separately (versus bottom 95% and 90%, respectively), and odds ratios for prevalent obesity were calculated, adjusting for age, sex and genotyping array. Given the relatively lower number of East Asian and South Asian individuals available for these tail comparisons, we present pooled estimates.

Although we primarily report on the development and performance of the PGSLC trained with the larger GIANT+23andMe BMI GWAS meta-analyses results, we initially developed a multi-ancestry PGS with the GIANT-only results. For this, we used PRS-CS, combining GIANT's combined multi-ancestral GWAS summary statistics (including BioMe but excluding the UKBB and the ALSPAC study) with a previously described multi-ancestry 1000G-based LD reference panel created following the same protocol as described by the PRS-CS authors94. We restricted variants to those present in the LD reference panel, which additionally had MAF ≥ 0.1% and INFO ≥ 0.8 in the overall UKBB, resulting in a total of 1,217,710 variants included. We did not specify a genome-wide shrinkage parameter for PRS-CS, which it therefore learned from the training data using a fully Bayesian approach (its ‘auto' option). In collaboration with the eMERGE network, this GIANT-only PGS was included among a select group of trait-specific scores currently being returned as part of a genome-informed risk assessment (GIRA) to 25,000 diverse adults and children and their healthcare providers in an ongoing prospective cohort study across 10 clinical sites, as recently described14,48. In line with the aim of returning a high-risk versus a not-high-risk GIRA status to participants, we estimated the odds ratio for obesity class I (or higher) for being in the top 3% of the PGS distribution (versus bottom 97%) within the subset of BioMe participants genotyped with the Global Screening Array (with 1000G imputation) who had not contributed to the underlying GIANT GWAS meta-analysis nor were related to those who did. Accounting for age, sex and four principal components, we observed that values within the top 3% of this PGS were associated with 4.08 (95% confidence interval: 3.02–5.52) times as high odds for prevalent obesity in individuals of self-reported European descent, with 2.54 (95% confidence interval: 1.55–3.98) for individuals of self-reported African descent, with 2.33 (95% confidence interval: 1.64–3.31) for individuals of self-reported Hispanic/Latino descent and with 5.73 (95% confidence interval: 2.28–14.57) for individuals of self-reported Asian descent. The weights for this GIANT-only PGS are made available through the PGS Catalog alongside the weights for PGSLC and PGSmeta (see ‘Data availability').

Within the ALSPAC study, repeated anthropometric measurements are available from birth to age 24. We employed both cross-sectional and multilevel analyses to provide complementary perspectives: cross-sectional analyses facilitate granular comparisons at each timepoint, whereas multilevel models capture longitudinal trajectories and population-level divergence over time. First, we assessed repeated cross-sectional associations between the standardized PGS (PGSLC using linear combination weights from UKBBEUR) and all available measures of BMI (or ponderal index at birth) and height. Anthropometric measurements were rank-based inverse-normal transformed separately by sex, at each timepoint, and analyses were adjusted for age at timepoint and principal components.

Longitudinal analyses using linear spline multilevel models were conducted to examine the association between the PGS (bottom 10%, middle 80%, top 10%) and change in untransformed BMI and height between 4 months and 24 years. Multilevel models estimate the mean trajectories of each anthropometric trait while accounting for non-independence of repeated measures within individuals, change in scale and variance of measures over time and differences in the number and timing of measurements between individuals (using all available data from all eligible participants under a missing-at-random assumption). Linear splines allow knot points to be fitted at different ages to derive periods of change that are approximately linear. All participants with at least one measure of the anthropometric traits were included under a missing-at-random assumption to minimize selection bias in trajectories estimated using linear spline multilevel models (with two levels of random effects: measurement occasion (that is, age to the nearest integer in years) and individual), allowing individuals to have different intercepts and slopes and, thus, their own trajectories. Knot points were placed as follows for each anthropometric trait based on the distribution and longitudinal pattern of measures between the earliest measure and 24 years: at ages 4 months and 8 months and at ages 2.5 years, 5 years, 8 years and 15 years for BMI and at ages 1 year, 5 years and 15 years for height. Interaction terms between PGS and each spline were included in the models to estimate the difference in the intercepts (earliest anthropometric trait measurement) and slopes (change in anthropometric trait from the earliest measure to 24 years) between the three PGS categories. Additionally, interaction terms between sex and the first 10 genetic principal components with each spline were included to estimate the difference in intercepts and slopes between males and females; therefore, models were adjusted for sex and principal components. All longitudinal models were created in MLwiN version 3.04 called from Stata version 15 using the ‘runmlwin' command95.

In the CiF subset of the cohort, age at adiposity rebound was available, categorized as very early (at/before 43 months), early (from 49 months but before 61 months) and later (after 61 months)96. These children represent a 10% sample of the cohort, randomly selected for more detailed investigations, and are representative of the entire cohort (https://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/cohort-profile/). One-way ANOVA was used to test for differences in mean PGS across categories, in boys and girls separately and combined.

Added value of the PGS for prediction of BMI (rank-based inverse-normal transformed by sex) at given timepoints was quantified as incremental explained variance, when adding the PGS to different sets of predictors. First, we examined R2 for BMI at birth and at 3, 5, 8, 11 and 15 years, when adding the PGS to a model containing multiple relatively easily obtainable clinical variables that would be available at birth (birthweight, maternal education, pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, maternal age at date of birth and household social status). Details regarding phenotyping of these variables can be found in Supplementary Table 3. Separately, for R2 for BMI at age 18, we added the PGS to separate models containing BMI from a given early-life timepoint (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 years). Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions.

Within PLCO, we assessed the population-statified and sex-stratified association between the standardized PGSLC (using linear combination weights from the UKBB most closely corresponding to each testing population) and per-5-year change between ages 20 and 50 in weight and BMI, with and without adjustment for the initial measurement at age 20. These analyses were additionally adjusted for birth year, sex (where appropriate) and principal components.

We calculated the population-stratified AUC of the PGS for obesity outcomes at age 50. For this, we ran models including (i) birth year and sex, (ii) birth year, sex, principal components and PGSLC, (iii) birth year, sex, principal components and BMI at age 20 and (iv) birth year, sex, principal components, BMI at age 20 and PGSLC. We separately ran model (iv) when including an interaction term between the PGS and BMI at age 20. Based on evidence for statistical interaction between the PGS and BMI at age 20 for predicting obesity at age 50 across multiple populations (Supplementary Table 16), we stratified our analyses on the presence of overweight or obesity at age 20 and, additionally, on sex. Confidence intervals (95%) for AUC were calculated using DeLong's method.

Although neither intervention nor comparison arms were identical across DPP and Look AHEAD, both intervention arms were aimed at 7% weight loss while focused on the same process features83, and both represent a large shift in lifestyle behavior relative to the comparison arms. As such, we decided to pool study-specific effect estimates via inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. In each study, we ran analyses after pooling the three largest population groups present in both trials: Black and/or African American, Hispanic and White (Supplementary Table 3). Population-stratified analyses were separately run as well. Within each study-specific population, we applied the linear combination weights for PGSLC most closely aligned with the target population (AFR, AMR and EUR, respectively). These scores were then standardized within the matching population, ignoring trial arm, whereafter we standardized again across all individuals for the population-pooled analyses. Due to restricting analyses to genotyped individuals from the three largest population groups, trial randomization was, by definition, broken. To investigate potential shifts in the PGS, we plotted its distribution by trial arm, which showed minimal shifts in distribution (Extended Data Fig. 7).

To investigate weight change, we focused on annual weight measurements. The weight loss nadir in both trials is known to occur at the 1-year mark, after which many individuals start regaining weight. As such, we separately examined the association of the PGS with (i) weight at year 1 (adjusting for baseline weight) and (ii) repeated weight measurements beyond year 1 up to year 4 (adjusting for weight at year 1) in the subset of individuals who had lost ≥3% of their initial body weight in the first year. Analyses were run by trial arm using linear mixed models with random intercepts, with additional covariates being age, sex, principal components, the initial weight measurement (baseline or year 1) and random slopes for time (years). In addition, we ran trial–arm combined models in which we examined interaction effects between trial arm and PGS. These interaction terms are our main estimates of interest, as they reflect how genetic predisposition to obesity modifies the intervention's effect on weight change, relative to the comparison arm. Study-specific main and interaction effect estimates were separately pooled by means of inverse-variance weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis. Participant characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 4.

Distribution of obesity categories and mean BMI (+/- standard deviation) across adult tuning and validation populations. Asian-specific BMI cutoffs (see Methods) were applied to East Asian (EAS), South Asian (SAS), and non-Hispanic Asian (AS) populations, in contrast to African (AFR), American (AMR), European (EUR), and Middle Eastern (MID) populations. UKBB, UK Biobank; MVP, the Million Veteran Program; GPC-UGR, the Uganda General Population Cohort. Sample sizes (distinct individuals), from left to right, for Tuning: 6154, 971, 1553, 2660, 8005, 20000; Validation: 12263, 2332, 18701, 10281, 8096, 4201, 1359, 1177, 13673, 69828, 340224; and BMI: 12263, 10281, 1359, 1177, 13673, 2332, 18701, 8096, 4201, 69828, 6154, 971, 1553, 2660, 8005, 340224.

Prevalence of obesity category, with 95% confidence intervals based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, across 1%-groups of PGSKhera and PGSLC within the validation subset of the UKBB participants of European ancestry (N ~ 340k). The black dotted line denotes the average prevalence in the entire subset. The red and blue lines correspond to the prevalence of the obesity category within the top and bottom 1% of PGSKhera and PGSLC, respectively.

All PGS were standardised using the mean and SD of the PGS of individuals who did not have the outcome of interest (that is, those with a BMI value below the threshold for a given obesity category), to account for differences in prevalence across validation populations. MVP, Million Veteran Program; GPC-UGR, Uganda General Population Cohort; UKB, UK Biobank. Sample sizes (distinct individuals) per grouped set of estimates, left to right: AFR 12263, 2332, 18701; AMR 10281, 8096; AS 4201; EAS 1359; SAS 1177; EUR 13673, 69828, 340224.

Distributional shifts of ancestry-specific scores which are linearly combined to create PGSLC, across UK Biobank-tuning and BioMe-validation populations, before (top) and after (bottom) ancestry–calibration using 1000 Genomes reference data (Methods). Each plot shows a single ancestry-specific score, with separate lines showing the distribution across ancestries. For these plots, each score was standardised to mean zero and variance one once across all participants of a given study.

Estimated using linear spline multilevel models with repeated measures from the ALSPAC cohort.

Estimated in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Restricted to estimates where the number of individuals with the obesity outcome was at least 50. Population labels as provided by PLCO.

More than 280 NASA employees past and present, including at least 4 astronauts, have signed a declaration of opposition to the many drastic changes that the administration of US President Donald Trump is working to enact. The declaration also urges the acting head of NASA not to make the unprecedented budget cuts Trump has proposed.

“The last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA's workforce,” reads the employees' letter to interim administrator Sean Duffy. It argues that Trump's changes threaten human safety, scientific progress and global leadership at NASA.

The Voyager Declaration joins similar protest documents by employees at other US federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The appeals stem from Trump's sweeping campaign to overhaul the federal government, which has led to mass firings of workers and the proposal of steep cuts to agency budgets.

The declaration is “about getting our dissent out to the public and saying, hey — this is what's happening at NASA, and this is not OK”, says Ella Kaplan, who has signed the document. Kaplan works on a contract basis as a website administrator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and was speaking on her own behalf and not that of her employer or of NASA. 

Kaplan says she does not expect Duffy to read the document or to care much about it if he does. When Duffy ran for a seat in the US Congress more than a decade ago, he released a campaign advertisement that featured him wearing lumberjack clothing and saying he would bring his axe to “topple the big spending in Washington”.

The agency is not interested in sustaining “lower-priority missions”, said NASA spokeswoman Bethany Stevens. “We must revisit what's working and what's not so that we can inspire the American people again and win the space race.”

The Voyager Declaration, named after the twin NASA spacecraft that are exploring interstellar space, protests against staffing cuts at the agency and Trump's proposed cuts to science funding and other NASA budgets. The agency has fired some employees and pressured others to leave, resulting in the loss of more than 2,600 of the 17,000-plus NASA employees, according to news platform Politico. At least US$118 million in NASA grants has been cancelled outright, and the White House has proposed slashing nearly half of the agency's science budget for next year.

Congress, which sets US spending, might reject at least some of those proposed cuts. But the managers of many NASA science projects have been asked to draw up plans for winding down their programmes even though Congress hasn't finalized the budget — drawing dissent from the declaration's signers. “Once operational spacecraft are decommissioned, they cannot be turned back on,” the document says. NASA, like other agencies, is supposed to follow spending priorities laid out by Congress, and Duffy, as interim administrator, could theoretically ignore the White House requests until a budget is finalised.

Metrics details

The neurophysiological mechanisms supporting brain maturation are fundamental to attention and memory capacity across the lifespan. Human brain regions develop at different rates, with many regions developing into the third and fourth decades of life. Here, in this preregistered study (https://osf.io/gsru7), we analysed intracranial electroencephalography recordings from widespread brain regions in a large developmental cohort. Using task-based (that is, attention to to-be-remembered visual stimuli) and task-free (resting-state) data from 101 children and adults (5.93–54.00 years, 63 males; n electrodes = 5,691), we mapped aperiodic (1/ƒ-like) activity, a proxy of neural noise, where steeper slopes indicate less noise and flatter slopes indicate more noise. We reveal that aperiodic slopes flatten with age into young adulthood in both association and sensorimotor cortices, challenging models of early sensorimotor development based on brain structure. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), attentional state modulated age effects, revealing steeper task-based than task-free slopes in adults and the opposite in children, consistent with the development of cognitive control. Age-related differences in task-based slopes also explained age-related gains in memory performance, linking the development of PFC cognitive control to the development of memory. Last, with additional structural imaging measures, we reveal that age-related differences in grey matter volume are similarly associated with aperiodic slopes in association and sensorimotor cortices. Our findings establish developmental trajectories of aperiodic activity in localized brain regions and illuminate the development of PFC control during adolescence in the development of attention and memory.

Robots and other artificial-intelligence tools could help policymakers run societies efficiently. Credit: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be a transformative force in science, society and the economy. However, much remains unknown about the broader implications of widespread AI use.

For instance, AI technologies can enhance as well as impede the performance of knowledge workers. They can boost productivity for routine tasks, such as idea generation and writing, but might introduce bottlenecks and errors in more-complex tasks when AI advice is adopted blindly1. Chatbots can aid individual people's creativity, yet overreliance on them might reduce the overall diversity of original ideas2.

AI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here's how to make it safer

AI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here's how to make it safer

Understanding how users engage with the technology — and the outcomes that follow — requires careful, systematic study to differentiate between the positive and negative impacts. For instance, in education, it's crucial to test whether students use AI tools to deepen their understanding of a topic, or whether they simply use the technology as a crutch, hindering real learning.

Controlled studies can reveal areas to which AI truly adds value and when its risks outweigh the benefits. Randomized controlled trials — in which a randomly selected group of participants receives an intervention while a control group operates under business-as-usual conditions — might be particularly valuable for assessing AI's impact in public-sector settings. For example, can a chatbot deliver factual and actionable advice to citizens seeking tax-related information, ultimately promoting accurate and timely tax filing? Will partially automating eligibility assessments for social benefits lead to fair, efficient outcomes at reduced cost? Understanding when, how and for whom AI works is crucial to ensuring positive results and a meaningful return on investment.

Here, we introduce an AI impact-evaluation framework3 developed for the UK public sector, providing a potential blueprint for public organizations as well as the private sector.

What do we mean by evaluating AI? Evaluation refers to assessing an intervention's design, implementation and impact4 — in other words, understanding how and to what extent it changes the outcome of interest.

AI companies currently undertake model evaluations — testing the performance of large language models (LLMs) against benchmarks to assess their capabilities in areas such as language, mathematics, reasoning and problem-solving. Furthermore, over the past 18 months, leading AI-security institutes in the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan have advocated for testing frontier AI models to ensure they are safe to use before public release. However, although model evaluation and safety protocols are necessary, they are not sufficient.

This is because evaluating a model's technical performance is not the same as assessing its real-world economic and societal impacts. For instance, many organizations now use customized LLMs as internal chatbots to help employees to access organization-wide materials or summarize large volumes of information — from meeting notes and market research to sector-wide consultations. Others are using AI tools to create slide decks, reports and business plans.

Medical AI can transform medicine — but only if we carefully track the data it touches

Conventional AI-model evaluation will ensure that the outputs are reasonably accurate and safe. But such assessments do not tell us whether these tools to improve users' decision-making, increase their efficiency or redirect their time towards more-useful activities. Or, in the public sector, whether they lead to improved services and better outcomes for citizens.

Although some organizations conduct small pilot studies and collect user feedback, such tests rarely have the quality, scale and independence required. Our guidance recommends incorporating evaluation into the design of the AI tool itself.

Because most AI tools are hosted online, it's relatively easy to test new features by comparing how various user groups respond5. For example, a government website might randomly show some users a new LLM-powered interactive chatbot, whereas others continue to use a simpler, rules-based one. The new tool's impact can then be assessed by tracking whether users in the LLM group are less likely to request human assistance or call the help centre — signs that their queries are being resolved more effectively than those of the other group.

Surveys can provide useful feedback on user experience for both groups, helping evaluators to understand what worked and why. But it's important to not rely on self-reports alone. Observing actual behaviour — what people do, not just what they say — provides stronger evidence of impact.

More-complex AI projects require proportionately scaled evaluation designs. Consider a hypothetical scenario in which the UK National Health Service provides people with an AI-powered wearable device to help them to manage a chronic condition. The technology monitors the person's health and sends automated alerts to their physician if it detects signs that medical attention might be needed. A robust evaluation could randomly assign the AI-enabled wearable to some people, whereas others (serving as a control group) could receive a version without such features.

Key outcomes might include a reduction in the number of hospital admissions through more timely preventative care. But the evaluation should also explore potential unintended consequences — for instance, whether physicians become overly reliant on the AI tool and reduce the frequency of in-person consultations or other standard care practices.

Our AI-evaluation guidance not just builds on the UK government's Magenta Book4, which outlines its evaluation standards, but calls for updating conventional approaches. Most policies are typically evaluated only once. For AI, however, this needs to change.

AI models are fast-evolving, and their output and performance can change quickly. Many AI systems adapt through user interactions, meaning that their behaviour can change over time — or differ across user groups. Evaluation strategies must therefore be as dynamic and responsive as the technology itself.

Our guidance highlights the need for continuous, iterative evaluation. Instead of relying on a single assessment, setting up regular checkpoints — or better yet, adopting a system that continuously updates the evidence base as data become available — can be much more effective. This kind of flexible approach enables decision makers to adapt quickly and make informed choices as the technology and its impacts evolve.

As a child, Julian Ako would visit his maternal great-grandfather's home near Pilaa Beach in Kauai, Hawaii, where he and his family would gather edible fungi that grow on kukui trees and collect seaweed and fish from the reef.

For about a decade, that land has belonged to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is constructing a massive compound at an estimated cost that exceeds $300 million. WIRED can now reveal that Zuckerberg's property is atop a burial site: Ako's great-grandmother and her brother were buried on the land.

After months of discussions with a Zuckerberg representative, Ako was successfully able to gain access to the property and identify and register the graves with the state Department of Land and Natural Resources, though he was not able to locate remains of other ancestors, who he believes could be buried on the property. In a report shared with WIRED, the state agency also confirmed “the probability (based on oral testimony) of additional burial sites.” Visits to Ako's family's graves are coordinated by the team at the Zuckerberg ranch. Ako, who sits on the Oahu Island Burial Council, worries about what might happen if further burial sites are discovered, because of the extreme secrecy surrounding the compound.

While NDAs are not unusual on billionaire construction projects, the scale of Zuckerberg's compound has resulted in scores of local workers being forbidden from sharing what they're doing and who they're working for. “If all of the workers have signed these nondisclosure agreements, then basically they're sworn to silence,” Ako says. “If they uncover iwi—or bones—it's going to be a challenge for that to ever become public knowledge, because they're putting their jobs in jeopardy.”

Asked about these burials, Zuckerberg representative Brandi Hoffine Barr acknowledged that the estate had been made aware of the family burial plot in 2015, which Hoffine Barr says they fenced off and maintained. She adds that their workers are bound by regulations that require reporting of inadvertent discoveries of iwi.

Meanwhile, Zuckerberg has quietly expanded his footprint on the island with a massive new land purchase, WIRED can reveal. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg purchased 962 acres of prime ranchland under a Hawaiian-sounding LLC across the road from the existing compound, which one person close to the sale estimated cost more than $65 million. This purchase, previously unreported, will increase his Kauai holdings from about 1,400 to more than 2,300 acres—placing him among the largest landowners in the state.

Development inside the ranch continues, as Zuckerberg has spent millions adding several new strange buildings to an already massive compound. Not far from Ako's fishing spot, Zuckerberg has commissioned another three major buildings on previously purchased land. According to planning documents released to WIRED under a new public records request, they range in size from 7,820 to 11,152 square feet—nearly 10 times larger than the average home in Hawaii—and two are projected to cost between $3.5 and $4 million each.

These new buildings differ from the opulent mansions on the other side of the ranch, with few fun amenities and only one dedicated common space, a lanai larger than 1,300 square feet. Two of them seem designed to accommodate as many bedrooms and bathrooms as possible, and feature 16 of each between them, lined up like a motel or boarding house. As always, security is tight — with each new property featuring cameras, keypad locks, and motion detection devices. Hoffine Barr described these new buildings as short-term guest housing for family, friends, and staff.

This goes along with previous development across the ranch: two mansions with a total floor area comparable to the size of a football field, a gym, a tennis court, several guest houses, ranch operations buildings, a set of saucer-shaped treehouses, an elaborate water system, and a tunnel that branches off into an underground shelter about the size of an NBA basketball court, outfitted with blast-resistant doors and an escape hatch. Recent documents also show plans for a new water pump building, to go along with two existing pump buildings and an 18-foot-tall water tank. Satellite images of the property also show dozens of buildings that have not yet appeared in public records requests. Based on counting bedrooms in the planning documents we've seen alone, WIRED estimates that, when complete, the property could comfortably house more than 100 people.

The Meta CEO's Kauai activities attracted international attention following a December 2023 WIRED investigation, based on planning documents and interviews with workers, that estimated the total cost of his compound development as at least $270 million, detailed strict enforcement of nondisclosure agreements, and described doomsday bunker-ish qualities of the project. According to some prepping companies, the report sparked an increase in bunker sales.

Since then, Zuckerberg's presence on the island has only continued to grow. Last January, Zuckerberg announced his intention to raise premier cattle on beer and macadamia nuts on the ranch, but it seems likely that he has bigger plans.

For locals, the question remains—what the hell is this guy up to?

Zuckerberg first bought into Kauai—the oldest and smallest of the four major Hawaiian islands—in 2014, when he grabbed 700 acres in a quiet oceanside stretch near the small town of Kilauea for roughly $100 million.

The purchase was incomplete however, as hundreds of locals maintained kuleana rights to four parcels within Zuckerberg's property. These rights, afforded to descendants of previous landowners, would have allowed them to cross Zuckerberg's land. In 2016, Zuckerberg moved to consolidate his holdings by filing “quiet title and partition” lawsuits against these kuleana descendants in order to clarify ownership of the land. He later abandoned these suits under public pressure, but the legal process continued under a kuleana descendant Carlos Andrade, whom Zuckerberg supported in an op-ed in the local newspaper. Andrade eventually won sole ownership of the land at auction, during which some believed he was backed financially by Zuckerberg. (In that 2017 op-ed, Zuckerberg wrote that Andrade, who died in 2022, could continue his quiet title action and pass down the kuleana rights because he had “lived on and cared for these lands for more than forty years.”)

By spring 2021 his compound had expanded further, with the addition of more than 560 acres of ranchland in total, some of it abutting Larsen's, a nudist beach. Later that year, he added another 110 acres which contain the Kaloko Dam, an infamous earthen dam and reservoir that collapsed in 2006, killing seven people.

The 2025 land buy is Zuckerberg's largest thus far in total acreage, situated on the mauka, or inland, side of the road across from his initial purchase. Public records list the Mary Lucas Trust Estate as the seller, descendants of an early British adviser to King Kamehameha I. The trust had leased its lands to sugar plantations before they were restored as pasture land for cattle in the 1970s by cousins and former trustees Jimmy Pflueger and Paul Cassiday. In recent years, the trust has been selling off significant chunks of its lands. Though the total purchase price is not listed, a source close to the sale estimated it was at least $65 million, and property records place the land's market value at around $75 million. Hoffine Barr confirmed that the billionaire had purchased additional ranch land, but did not comment on the size or price. It's unclear what the CEO intends to do with his new acquisition, but the source also described the parcel as “great cattle grass,” so it seems likely that Zuckerberg's husky, beer-filled cows may soon be roaming its 962 acres.

“Mark and Priscilla continue to make a home for their family and grow their ranching, farming, and conservation efforts at Ko'olau Ranch,” says Hoffine Barr. “The vast majority of the land is dedicated to agriculture—including cattle ranching, organic ginger, macadamia nut, and turmeric farming, native plant restoration, and endangered species protection. After purchasing the ranch, they canceled the previous owner's plans for 80 luxury homes.”

With the new buildings and new land, Zuckerberg's total investment in his compound now exceeds the entirety of the $311 million fiscal year 2024 Kauai operating expenses budget.

This dramatic influx of wealth has led to inevitable changes in the community. On one hand, Zuckerberg has given millions to local nonprofits, including recent donations to build a charter school and an affordable housing nonprofit near the compound. His construction projects provide good-paying jobs. But there remains a lot of skepticism toward the recent trend of billionaires buying up Hawaiian lands.

As more of the defunct sugarcane plantations that own huge slices of Hawaiian land begin offloading their assets, more new-money billionaires have been buying in. In 2012, then Oracle CEO Larry Ellison bought almost the entirety of the smaller island of Lanai for $300 million, which he has been developing into a luxury resort destination. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former TV presenter and businesswoman Oprah Winfrey both have outposts on Maui. And Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has been secretly buying up large swaths of the Big Island for unclear purposes. Billionaires pay top dollar, driving up property values.

Driven partially by an influx of wealthy mainlanders during the Covid-19 pandemic, Hawaii housing prices have skyrocketed, leaving home ownership out of reach for local renters. “If our island has any hope of remaining Hawaii, this kind of activity has got to stop,” professor of Native Hawaiian studies at the Kauai Community College Puali‘i Rossi tells me, when I mention the new Zuckerberg land buy. “Eventually Hawaii isn't going to look like Hawaii anymore—it's going to be a resort community. Are we really thinking about 100 years from now, what this island is going to look like?”

On a damp Sunday afternoon during the February wet season, a few pickup trucks pass through the main gated entrance outside Zuckerberg's compound on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Backhoes and bulldozers rest in the red mud outside the tall stone walls, constructed in 2016 to keep out prying eyes.

It's a relatively quiet day, but security is still alert. As I take a picture of the guard shack from the road, a woman's head pops out. “Hoi, don't do that,” she says. “They don't like that. They're very private.”

Summer. For teens not at work, it's hot, it's boring, and it's an ideal time to close the door and spend about every waking moment watching, playing, texting, streaming—anything but talking—on the phone. With almost half of teenagers in the US saying they're online almost constantly, the adults in their lives are growing more desperate to drag them off. Families are establishing screen-free zones in their homes, states are banning phones in schools, and a new kind of summer camp has emerged: digital detox camps, which can cost around $2,000 a week, and promise to wean attendees off screens by going cold turkey for the summer.

WIRED spoke to the founder and director of one such organization. Taking a cue from your average summer camp, the program forces kids to swap their phones and gaming systems for some good old-fashioned social interaction. But in other ways, it's anything but traditional: It's staffed with onsite therapists equipped to handle screen addiction, the kids take financial literacy courses, and nearly all campers are completely miserable when they arrive.

Most of the kids who come to our program are very socially stunted. They don't communicate very well. Everything is in abbreviations. They don't make eye contact. They can't finish a full sentence. Everything is mumbled. They don't want to have an in-person dialog. They would rather do it online or do it through text.

Our camp is about 70 percent boys, 30 percent girls, from ages 13 to 17. Most of the boys are gamers. Most of the girls are addicted to social media—influencer wannabes. None of them want to be there. One kid ran away, and he actually made it down to the freeway, which was very unusual because we're not close to the freeway. He was picked up by the local highway patrol and brought back. He then went on a hunger strike for three days, and we actually ended up sending him to the hospital because he needed to eat. And then his mom did come and pick him up.



The line between science and wellness has been blurred beyond recognition. WIRED is here to help.

When the kids arrive, we have them unpack to make sure they brought everything they were supposed to bring and that they didn't bring things they weren't supposed to bring. Like phones. One kid showed up with three cell phones: When he arrived, he turned in one. We found another cell phone in his bag. And then about three days later his roommate outed him, and we found the third phone. He thought it was funny that he got away with it for that long. That's most of our kids—if they can stick it to the man, then they're winning.

Most of the kids are not aggressive, they're not acting out. More often, they're moping. But once they come out of their dorm room, we lock the doors. I say, “Sitting in your dorm room moping is not a camp activity.”

Their sleeping and eating habits are horrible. Most kids, especially the online gamers, are up until 2 or 3 in the morning. They don't get up until noon or later. It's a disaster. And their eating habits, they're equally horrible—Doritos and Gatorade, just horrible snack food.

So we have them on a very specific schedule. They're in their dorm rooms by 9:30 and have their lights out by 10. And then we wake them up at 6:30. I always tell my staff, “Plan on not sleeping much the first week.”

They have one or two roommates in their dorm rooms. Typically, they are not happy about that. Most kids who come to our program have their own room at home. But what's funny is that it creates this us-against-them mentality, because they don't want to be there, and their roommate doesn't want to be there. They hate us, they hate their parents for sending them there, so they kind of bond without meaning to right off the bat.

We do all the traditional summer camp activities. We take them to the beach once a week. It's not that much torture. During one of the first years, we had a kid who walked away from the beach day. And he didn't walk far, but he approached a couple who were taking a selfie and asked if he could use their phone. He ended up calling his mom, saying, “Get me out of here.” His mom did not come and pick him up: The next year, she sent his little brother to camp too. We had more staff members come to beach day after that.

We also do educational programs and a financial literacy class. We have to break it to these kids that tech companies don't care about their fun and enjoyment; they're after their time and their money. We've had several kids who have been given credit cards that they then charge up, buying in-app activities or “skins” in games like Fortnite. And then when they can't spend any more on that card, they'll use their friend's card, their mom's card. We had one kid use their friend's grandmother's card. But we never tell a kid, “Never play a video game again, never be online again, never check your email again.” That's just not the reality of the world we live in.

When we started this program, we didn't really expect to have returning campers. We figured we'd get you cured, and then next summer you go to surf camp or sail camp or horseback camp or something. But every year we have one or two kids who want to come back—not because they've gone back to the dark side of tech addiction; it's because they want to help the next batch of campers. They want to say to a mopey new camper, “I was you last year. I was exactly where you are, and I turned out OK.”

When donald trump moved back into the White House, the United States was years into its Cancer Moonshot, a multibillion-dollar Democratic effort to halve cancer deaths by 2047. There was a kind of stalemate: New cases of the disease were emerging about as often as before; deaths were ticking steadily lower; the US Food and Drug Administration was approving new treatments, if not quite as quickly as anyone wanted. But the taps of federal funding were open as never before, from the Department of Defense to the Environmental Protection Agency to the largest funder of cancer research in the world, the National Institutes of Health.

Number of new cancer drugs approved by the FDA in the past five years

Proportion of FDA-approved drugs (2010-2019) that derived from NIH-funded research

Estimated funding cut from the Defense Department's congressionally directed cancer research programs

Cancer-related NIH grants terminated so far

Estimated funds remaining in those grants

But then Trump decided that American science research was, somehow, too woke. He paused NIH grant-making for more than two months, holding up an estimated $1.5 billion in funding. He effectively halted clinical trials of new drugs. He laid off thousands of employees at the FDA, the NIH, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, an estimated $35 million in already-funded research—including for cancer—was thrown into jeopardy when Trump instituted a hiring freeze. At the EPA, staff were instructed to cancel existing grants, including to the Health Effects Institute, which has published research on the link between air pollution and cancer. And in the stopgap funding measure, set to expire in September, Republicans cut about 60 percent from the Defense Department's Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs—including funding for research on breast and ovarian cancers. (The programs for pancreatic, kidney, and lung cancer disappeared from the agency's list of funded projects and rolled under another program, which did not receive any additional funding for 2025.) At the National Institutes of Health, some grants resumed and others were slated for termination. The current state of US cancer research could fairly be described as—confusion.

Since WIRED conducted its analysis in late June, additional NIH grants have been terminated and others have been ordered reinstated by federal courts. The Grant Watch volunteers have also started tracking “frozen” grants—funding that hasn't been officially terminated but that researchers are unable to access.

While researchers across the country have lost grants, two of the Trump administration's political targets— Columbia and Harvard—have been hit especially hard. And across the board, many of these grant terminations appear to be part of the administration's anti-DEI, anti-trans, and anti-vaccine agendas. Trump officials reportedly maintain a list of “flagged” keywords that they believe should trigger program reviews. In the NIH grants terminated so far, the 50 most common flagged words include trans, expression, diverse, and women.

Estimated cuts to CDC cancer research under Trump's preferred budget

There's more on the chopping block. Trump wants to defund the National Cancer Institute to below 2014 levels. He wants to “refocus” the CDC on infectious disease surveillance and shut down “duplicative, DEI, or simply unnecessary programs,” which would include the National Center for Chronic Diseases Prevention and Health Promotion and the National Center for Environmental Health. Of course, Trump may not get exactly the budget he wants. Federal judges may keep ordering the grants and programs he has terminated to be reinstated—and maybe he'll even comply.

But a court order can't reinstate months of lost treatment for a cancer patient, can't bring back researchers and civil servants who were forced to move on. It's hard to put a price on the value of research that might be years away from a new drug or treatment modality. It's even harder for those who have been kicked out of clinical trials in the past few months, where the stakes are clearly life or death. The moonshot might have lost its chance to land.

At first, the two bowls of fruit on Bryan Johnson's kitchen island look perfect. They're brimming with plump kiwis, hardy avocados, and ripened bananas. These are the food of the gods, I figure, for a man who aspires to live like one. But then I look closer. A lone orange, its skin flecked with mold, sits adjacent to two lemons, both almost entirely consumed by a layer of white fuzz. Something, it seems, is rotten in the estate of Johnson.



The line between science and wellness has been blurred beyond recognition. WIRED is here to help.

That estate, it's worth noting, is a predictable one. Johnson's home in Venice, California, is the angular, concrete-floored template of a dwelling you'd assume is owned by a man. Specifically a man who worked in tech, made his millions, and subsequently embarked on a midlife, post-wealth search for purpose. All of which Johnson is, and did, and still appears to be doing: After selling his web payments company, Braintree, for $800 million in 2013, Johnson parted ways with both his wife and his lifelong Mormon religion. In 2021 he announced Project Blueprint, an effort designed to reverse his own body's aging process. This involves an all-consuming, unproven regimen including but not limited to daily exercises, blood tests, a doctrinal sleep routine, MRIs, plasma transfers, scalp stimulants, urine tests, several dozen supplements, Dexa scans, light therapy, and caloric restriction.

If the rotting fruit didn't give it away, then no, this is not a kitchen where household memories are made over milk and cookies—although a collage of candid photos taped above Johnson's stove offers hints of familial warmth. (Johnson has three kids, one of whom is infamous for donating data on his youthful erections and his own plasma to his father's anti-aging efforts.) This is a kitchen, after all, that shares a home with specimen cups of semen and coolers of Johnson's blood; where pills and powders, which I find meticulously stocked in Johnson's walk-in pantry, are mixed, optimized, and consumed; where food is not eaten so much as nutrition is performed.

Performance, of course, is Johnson's specialty. There's the performance of his body, which Johnson claims is now the single healthiest on Earth. And there's how that body shows up to the viewing public, which it does quite often. Johnson has been the subject of dozens of profiles and interviews, as well as a Netflix documentary released earlier this year. He has amassed more than 4 million followers across YouTube, Instagram, and X, and he posts an ongoing stream of content about his sleep habits (sublime), his diet (meticulous), and his erections (trigger warning). Johnson has also used his online reach to push back against recent controversies, including a legal battle with his former fiancée Taryn Southern, and a New York Times investigation into his extensive use of confidentiality agreements to prevent, among other things, Blueprint employees from publicly talking about Johnson as well as his business dealings.

Over a 90-minute conversation, Johnson spoke at length about his longevity protocol, his assessment of RFK Jr.'s MAHA movement, and those agreements that he continues to enforce. He also took great pains to convince me—and all of you—that this wasn't just about health and longevity. No, like most tech men living in boxy modernist homes and saddled with illusions of grandeur, Johnson has a new holy grail with which to galvanize his faithful following: artificial intelligence, baby.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: I'm going to ask you a very simple true-or-false question that you can answer however you want. Ready?

BRYAN JOHNSON: Yes.

True or false: You, Bryan Johnson, the man sitting across from me, one day at some point in the future, will die.

False.

Tell me more.

Death has always been inevitable, so we have made all these preparations. We talk about immortality in professional achievements. We talk about life after death. There are the ways that we've dealt with death up to this point. And now we have this real possibility of extending our lifespans to some unknown horizon. So that's extension. But we also have the ability to begin moving ourselves to computational systems. So currently, in a very crude form, I have a Bryan AI that has digested everything I've ever said.

You do currently have this?

I do.

OK.

And that Bryan AI is pretty good. As the technology gets better and better, the most prized asset is going to be existence; immortality as we thought about it before, through accomplishment or through offspring or the afterlife, will be devalued relative to existing. And that's my fundamental bet on the future.

If there was a world where, let's say in five years, you could upload Bryan into an AI—and AI Bryan is pretty much as good as Bryan Bryan—does Bryan Bryan eat the cheeseburger?

Let's think about your question in a different way. Most people today spend every waking moment pursuing wealth; and the time they're not spending pursuing wealth, they're pursuing some sort of status or prestige. When you give birth to superintelligence, you can start extending lifespans to some unknown horizon: 200 years, 1,000 years, 10,000 years. Millions of years. We don't know. When that happens, the entire game of humanity shifts from that singular focus on wealth accumulation and status and prestige to existence. Now, embedded in existence, we may still play games of power, but it will be conditioned that existence itself is the highest virtue. That's the shift that's starting to happen right now.

Let's move the conversation to your immediate existence. You've talked at length about your protocol. Walk us through a day in the life right now.

OK, cool. I have built my entire existence around sleep. My sleep profile is that of an early twentysomething. I've worked very hard at this. So it's eight hours and 34 minutes. I'm up less than one time per night on average, I go to bed within two to three minutes of my head hitting the pillow, and I have 94 percent sleep efficiency. Typically, most people's sleep signal is like the stock market, and mine is just flat.

But to do that, you can't just show up and say, “I'm going to put my head on the pillow and fall asleep.” You have to build your whole life system around that. So my day begins the night before when I go to sleep, and then I wake up around 4:30 or 5:00. First thing when I wake up, I get out of bed. I try to get up within one minute of waking.

Within one minute?

I try to avoid the “10 more minutes” or pull the phone up and start scrolling. I get up, I will get light in my eyes within a few minutes of waking—I wake up before the sun, so it's 10,000 lux light. I'll take my inner ear temperature. One thing we've noticed, as I've done this for the past four years, my body temperature has dropped almost 4 degrees Fahrenheit. And there's good evidence that species with lower basal temperatures live longer.

I will then put a serum on my hair, my scalp. Rub my scalp with a silicone scrubber for hair growth. I'll take a quick shower, and then I'll come downstairs. I have a morning drink. I will eat something, I'll work out for an hour. I'll do red light therapy, then hyperbaric oxygen therapy, then some sauna, then I'll rinse off, and then get ready for work.

That is quite a regimen. And then you stop eating for the day at … ?

Around noon.

Really quickly, rapid fire, ask me a couple questions about myself, and then tell me how I'm doing in the Bryan Johnson universe.

Great.

Go.

What is your resting heart rate?

48 beats per minute.

That's fantastic.

Thank you.

What is your most recent body inflammation blood test result, your hsCRP?

Bryan, I have no idea.

What is your blood glucose level?

A good one.

OK. How many continuous push-ups can you do?

Probably 10.

OK. If you stood on one foot and closed your eyes, how long could you stay standing?

A minute.

What is—a minute?

Yes, a minute.

That's very good.

Yeah. Try me. Not right now.

What is the length of your telomeres?

I don't know.

OK. What are your omega levels?

I don't know.

OK.

These are very involved questions.

What is your speed of aging?

Well, according to the skin test I took earlier, Bryan, it was 1.9.

Yeah. Yeah.

I thought you were just going to ask me if I smoke. Or exercise. Or sleep enough.

I can pose a question, like “How's your sleep?” And you can give me a generic answer like “I sleep great,” but if you look at the actual data of your telomere length, it tells me the story of your overall health. These are readouts of your biology. They just say, “This is me in raw form.” There's no storytelling. It's just the data.

I'm relieved that I don't have that data for you right now. Now, you were a successful entrepreneur. You felt like you weren't living your healthiest life. You parted ways with Mormonism. You got divorced. You went through all of these seismic life changes. A lot of people make major changes to their lives. Exceedingly few people—very, very, very, very, very few people—go as far as you have. What made you take this to such an extreme?

I'm really motivated by having read various biographies of people throughout time and place. In their moment, they were able to identify the most far-ranging ambition identifiable in that moment. You couldn't have sequenced the genome in the year 1800. You probably couldn't have gone to space in the 1920s. In any given time, a new emergent possibility is present. Then two questions arise. One is: What is it? And two is: Will somebody do it?

The year 2021 was the first time in human history where a person could say “We are the first generation who won't die” and not be ridiculed. I saw that and I thought, this is a moment when it comes together, where you see it and you can do something about it.

If you talk to people who know me, if you ask my husband, poor guy, they would say that I'm a very controlled person. I wake up at the same time every day. I do the same exercise. I tend to eat a lot of very similar foods. There's a lot of routine and structure to my life. When I hear about the way you live, I, as a very controlled person, am astounded at how controlled your life is. Was control always something that was a defining characteristic?

I would reframe it and say you're actually a really smart engineer; you realize that the metabolic cost of you having to make these decisions every single day is so expensive that you say, “You know what? It's not worth it. I'm just going to systematize this so that my brain can be allocated toward other higher-level thinking.” I view it the same way: Why would I fight these daily, miscellaneous, ultimately irrelevant decisions on a moment-to-moment basis when they can just be automated? I'd rather spend my scarce brain capacity thinking of higher-level things—about the future of the human race, for example.

In 2023 I was leading the newsroom at Vice, and we published a story on you. You talked about your body image from decades ago. You talked about how hard it was at that time to control yourself around food at night. You said you now often go to bed hungry, and you've learned to find joy in that. You eat mostly plants. If I stripped your name out and looked at a bulleted list of those comments, that sounds a lot like me 20 years ago with a very serious eating disorder. It wasn't about the number on the scale. It wasn't about how I looked. It was about being able to systematize and control my environment. I think if you were to ask some doctors and psychiatrists, they would say, “Well, that sounds like disordered behavior. That sounds like an eating disorder.” How do you respond to that? Particularly when we're talking about you as a public figure advocating for a certain approach to health, do you have concerns about what you're advocating for?

Most people I know in America have an eating disorder. I rarely meet somebody who doesn't find themselves, late in the evening, powerless to stop themselves from eating the ice cream or the cookies or the chips. I clearly struggled with controlling my food intake. I would say it's really more of a widespread societal problem, that we have an addiction problem with food, our phones, and our entertainment, our scrolling. I don't know if my addiction is more excessive than other people's addictions or if it's just weighted more toward food versus the phone, but I'd say I'm probably pretty average on a population-level addiction scale.

So you've taken what used to manifest in one way, which was an inability to control what you were eating and when you were eating it, and essentially adopted a new approach, which is saying, “I eat these things at these times, and I eliminate the variables. I take the choice out of it, and that is how I am going to manage this part of my health.”

Exactly. And I guess more broadly it's a cultural commentary, where I'm saying the most powerful forces in all of society—corporations—are pointing their power at getting you to be addicted to their thing. Whether it's scrolling their app, eating their food, watching their show—all their intelligence is pointed at you and trying to get you to be addicted.

I don't want to be addicted to anything. I want to have agency and freedom over my existence as much as possible, so that's what I'm trying to build. I realize that people on the outside looking in, they say, “He's working through his childhood trauma. He's working through a food addiction.” I'm open to all those explanations. I would be the first person to be self-deprecating and be like, “This guy has got issues.” Unquestionably.

You're addicted to longevity.

I mean, there's probably no way of actually getting over addiction other than controlling where your addiction is pointed.

I want to ask you about MAHA. When President Trump won the election, you congratulated him on social media. You were photographed with RFK Jr. What is your assessment of RFK Jr. and the Trump administration vis-à-vis American health? How do you rate the administration so far?

RFK is certainly not a status quo person.

You could say that.

The status quo in the US is not working. If you look at the data around the health of our citizenry, it's embarrassingly bad. I think we spend 1.8 times our peer countries in health care: $13,000 per person versus $7,000 or so in the other developed countries. We spend more and we get less. Whether RFK is the solution or not, what we're doing is not working, so I'm open to change, and I'm open to a variety of possibilities. It's not to say that everything he's doing is correct, but I do support the idea that we definitely need to change.

Do you worry about medical research being delayed by years or decades if it's curtailed right now?

Oftentimes, when one path is discontinued, everybody thinks it's an end of something; but actually, that change produces a new path that people didn't anticipate. So no, I support the creative destruction. I think it could have some positive outcomes. Clearly, there could be some drawbacks. When you break things like this, it goes both ways. It's not a clean win or loss.

I think what would be cool is if we as a country said, “We want to be number one in the entire world for life expectancy.” That is a very clear goal.

Let's talk about faith, because for so many people, religion or faith is fundamental in informing how they think about life and death. They think about the afterlife, they think about heaven or hell or whatever version of an afterlife exists. If you are not a person of faith, and I am not, you think, “Well, my body disintegrates and goes into the ground and then it helps the trees grow and that's just how this works. I am a biological organism.” How do you contemplate the idea of an afterlife or what happens after we die, given that you spend a lot of time focused on not dying?

This is the biggest question. This is the one that everybody has to grapple with, which is, What is existence? But for the history of humanity we have not had an opening to ask the question, What does existence mean? Right now is the first opening in literally tens or hundreds of thousands of years. The new answer to existence is that existence itself is the highest virtue.

Sounds like you now have a religion.

Yes.

When did that become an idea, and ultimately … why? You've got your public persona, you have your protocol, you have a business. Why bring religion into this?

Companies come and go. Countries come and go. Religions have endured for millennia. Confucius built a system of ethics. Muhammad received visions. Jesus was the son of God. Adam Smith wrote about the invisible hand. Karl Marx wrote Das Kapital. The American founding fathers wrote a constitution. Satoshi dropped the White Paper.

If you look at the major ideological and technological phenomena of the world, they've landed in different ways. It's very obvious that right now, in this age of AI, a new ideology is going to drop. It always drops in answer to technological disruption. An ideology must help humans make sense of the world. When I look at the world right now, I can't see any ideology that helps explain this moment, that helps me make practical day-to-day decisions. You can't go to Christianity and say, “Tell me how I behave in this moment.” You can't even go to democracy. You can't go to capitalism.

I want to make sure I understand. Your premise here is that AI will be this transformational technology that will extend our lifespan in some way, and there is not an ideology that supports mankind at that moment?

I'm saying nobody knows what's going to happen. All we know is that AI is improving at a rate that is unfathomable to our minds. Now, that doesn't stop humans from saying, “I will explain to you what's going to happen. It's going to make the world an abundant place, and we humans are going to be able to do whatever we want, and we're going to have one day a week where we work.”

To be clear, I think that's a very utopian and very unlikely scenario.

I agree. I don't believe any human knows what's going to happen. I only believe we have an event horizon. Nobody can see past it. This thing is moving very fast. We as a species don't move that fast. We can't move that fast. We can't change our society at that speed. So there's going to be some kind of dislocation. And I'm trying to say we need to prepare ourselves in the most basic way we can.

My solution for this is we choose to not die. That's it. I'm not arguing for immortality. I'm not arguing for utopia. We as a species, our existence is at risk. We do not know if humans have a role in the future. We do not know if we're going to survive this moment. We are already at each other's throats. We have nuclear annihilation as a possibility. It's a moment where we evolve into a species who say: The single thing we have in common is that nobody wants to die right now. That's it.

What is required for someone to be a disciple of this religion?

At a foundational level, it's a humility to say we don't know what's coming. Therefore, the most sober and practical thing to do is lock in our individual and shared behaviors. I'm not going to do things that kill myself. We're not going to kill each other. We don't kill the planet.

And then we align AI with Don't Die. Right now you've got the US developing AI, and China developing AI, and open-source models, and closed-source models, and we're basically just putting it all into this coliseum where everyone's going to fight it out for power. I don't think we want to give birth to AI in a warlike scenario.

So wouldn't aligning your movement, in the context of AI, have more to do with making sure the AIs don't kill us than taking supplements? You're saying that so much of what you do is not about health, but so much of what you put into the world is about health.

I do feel like this is legitimately an opening that we haven't seen for a few thousand years, for a new global ideology to emerge rapidly and be the fastest-growing ideology in history. Something's going to rise and fill this void, whether it's Don't Die or something else. So I was trying to figure out, how do you actually talk about this? People don't care about philosophy. They don't really care about ideas, not until it's really important. What they do care about is their health, how they feel in the morning, how they look. I tried to approach this conversation in a way that would be understandable, where Don't Die as a philosophy is going to bed on time and eating nutritious foods and saying no to junk food. Once you get people in, and they can understand health is a really good thing, you can bridge to philosophy and be like, “There's this bigger thing going on that we can talk about.”

So you are the founder of a religion. You are also the CEO of Blueprint; you sell supplements and a variety of products. You sell a finger pinprick aging test. Where do the religion and the commercial business start and stop? Where do they overlap? And why run a commercial enterprise off the back of this?

I agree with you a hundred percent. And honestly, I am so close to either shutting it down or selling it.

How close?

I've been talking to people about this. I don't need the money, and it's a pain-in-the-ass company. Practically, I was having to solve these basic problems myself, like how do I find clean protein powder that is tested by a third-party lab and has low heavy metals? I need it for my body. Once I started doing it, friends were like, “Can I have some?” I'm like, “Sure.” It just evolved in a way where I was trying to do people a solid. The problem is now people see the business and give me less credibility on the philosophy side. I will not make that trade-off. It is not worth it to me. So yeah, I don't want it.

The New York Times published a story about you recently, and that story included reporting about the integrity of the products that you sell and about the financial health of the company. Is the decision to potentially sell or shut the company down informed by that, either that controversy or the fact that the company isn't working the way you had hoped?

It has nothing to do with The New York Times. I am not hiding from the New York Times article. I'm happy to take, head-on, every single allegation they made. I will say [their reporting on] the business, that was fucking made up. They take things and they contort it to fit their narrative, but anybody who's been on the side of a hit piece knows it's bullshit. You know it. I know it. [“We are confident about the accuracy of our story,” says New York Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha, “which included reviewing legal and internal documents as well as interviewing 30 people close to Mr. Johnson and his company.” —Ed.]

As a journalist, I believe that our industry operates in good faith. I respect The New York Times. I read them every day. I know a lot of great journalists who work there. Obviously I had nothing to do with reporting that piece. Is the company right now a profitable company? Are you running a profitable company, whether you sell it or disband it?

They painted it like we are in some kind of emergency financial situation. That is not the case. We are break-even, and I've said that publicly many times. We've had profitable months, we've had loss months. I've been very clear, we priced our products at the exact level to basically be break-even. Additional margin is just not worth it to me. It's been a consistent strategy the entire time.

The thrust of the New York Times piece was around how you use confidentiality agreements. You have a former fiancée who was also a former employee, and at least two other former employees, who have filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board about confidentiality agreements that sound very extensive. In some cases, they're 20-plus pages. Sometimes there's an additional opt-in agreement.

You're so transparent about yourself publicly. I know so much about your body—more than I would like to—and that's my choice. I can close the tab if I don't want to hear more about your penis. But you are so transparent, and then you're essentially saying to your employees, “Support me in my transparency, but don't fucking say anything yourself,” right?

I grew up poor. My mom made my clothes for me. I was poor until I was 34, and then I made a couple hundred million dollars. I'm new money. In that moment, when I made that money, I did not understand what it means to have money and how it fundamentally changes your relationship with the entire world.

Over the past 12 years, I've learned what it means to have money. I will tell you, and anyone who's been in this situation will tell you the same, it changes everything. My fiancée attempted to extract $9 million from me, and she used, quote-unquote, “the most feared law firm” in the whole world. They sent me this really scary 13-page letter and said, “Look, we're going to say these terrible things about you, but you can make it all go away if you just pay us $9 million this week.” It was the first legitimate attempt on [my money]. [Quinn Emanuel, the law firm, declined to comment. In its settlement offer, it proposed that Southern would “enter into a full mutual release of all claims” against Johnson and “give up rights to use her life experiences” with him for the flat sum. —Ed.]

This is at the tail end of “Me Too,” where I had friends and others losing their entire professional life over something, right? So it was a very high-risk situation for many people, who were seeing very serious consequences for public allegations.

Often deservedly so.

Sure. Whether deserved or not, when a phenomenon like that emerges, a cottage industry will emerge and people will say, “This is an opportunistic time for me.” We know there's a variety of legitimate and not-legitimate situations. Do I cave and pay $9 million to make this go away quietly, or do I stand my ground? I slept on it and said, “I'm going to stand my ground. What they're saying is not true, and I'm not going to buckle. I'm not going to pay for this.”

To be clear, the allegations in the letter, in your view, were false?

After two years of legal disputes, if you read the report, the arbitrator and then the superior court judge said there was no evidence for what she said. That whole legal process vindicated me, after millions of dollars in legal fees. Five years later, it's resurfaced through The New York Times, and they don't mention any of that. They don't mention that she was discredited as a truth-telling person through this legal process, that she's on record having said things that are just fundamentally not true. [LTL Attorneys, which represented Southern in her 2021 lawsuit against Johnson, declined to comment on litigation. According to court documents, the arbitrator did not adjudicate Southern's claims, as she found that Southern “had not raised a triable issue.” Similarly, the state judge ruled Southern had “not established grounds to vacate the arbitration award,” which she had contested. —Ed.]

When I'm walking into this world of Blueprint, I'm saying, “OK, now I've seen a few patterns here where people use things as an advantage for their own gain, and sometimes it ends up in an extortion-like effort.” So I said, “To address this, I'm going to be incredibly transparent. I'm going to say: When you come and work in my environment, this is what you could expect.” It was the most fair gesture possible.

I understand this idea that you amass wealth and people see opportunity in that. And that if you want to come work at a company where someone is talking about their erections on the internet, they should sign something testifying that they are OK with that. What I'm not quite clear on is placing intensive limitations and restrictions on what employees can and cannot say about their work environment and their company. How does that tie into what you're describing?

I think you would agree that that is standard practice for a corporation. When you are a corporate entity, and even when you're a married couple, there's things you discuss in private which you don't discuss in public. Corporations have boundary conditions around information, whether it's IP, whether it's product development. But everybody has rules and systems for how you control information. Almost nobody in society operates with complete transparency, because everybody has learned life lessons that things go wrong. People will use this to their advantage and to other people's detriment. What I'm doing is not atypical at all.

In your view, do you run a safe and supportive workplace?

Yes.

Is this a good place to work?

Absolutely.

You feel very confident in that?

We have three goals at the company. The first goal is that our customers write us love letters. That's the most important goal. Number two is that people say it's the best job they've ever had. And three is that we say we are the best in the industry at what we do. I say this every single week in our company meetings. And on number two, I'll say, “What this means, you guys, is if you've got an issue that you're dealing with, if something is causing you to not like your circumstance, if it's a process that's annoying, if it's something that doesn't make sense to you, if your screen is too small, whatever the issue is, you have the opportunity to raise it. And when you raise it, we're going to show you we have the organizational capacity to address it.”

Most of the time when people experience things that they're not happy about, the course of action is to talk to the coworker and be like, “I'm going to gossip about these things.” I don't like it. I call this pebbles in the shoe.

Do you have an HR person who helps with the pebbles?

Yes. We call this person out and we say, for any issue you have, you can go directly to her; anything you have, you can raise it.

Do you like being famous? From when we assigned that story at Vice in 2023 to now, you have become much more famous. I think the more famous someone becomes, to some degree, the less they can control the narrative out there about them.

That's right.

Do you worry about a level of fame where you can't systematically address the entire world and what's being said? In the Netflix documentary, you seemed to take great joy and almost glee in reading nasty shit people say about you on the internet.

I'll take all the dunks about me all day long. It's when they say something about you that challenges your trustworthiness—that's what I would isolate. It's trust that I deeply care about, and being respected by the 25th century. Maybe humans are not around, but whatever form of intelligence is around, I really care about them saying, “You know what? We're grateful that there was a guy who tried to piece this thing together.” If my trust is in question, I can't go after these bigger goals.

On fame, I think it's fantastic. If I had to choose between fame and a billion dollars, I would choose fame 100 times out of 100. It's very hard to achieve. It's uniquely valuable. I get access to almost anyone in the entire world at this point. If the goal is to create the fastest-growing ideology in the history of the human race and to pair it with the time when the species is evolving into something else, you need fame.

So you're not thinking about your legacy in a 10-year, 20-year, 50-year timeline, you're thinking about hundreds of years?

It's the only time that makes sense to me. I did a thought experiment where I imagined being present in the 25th century. I'm sitting with them, and they're talking in whatever form they're talking, and they are looking back on the early 21st century. Just like we look back at other centuries and we compress them into a few major things but otherwise we don't get into the details, they will do the same thing for the 21st century.

So if they do that, what do they say? I thought about this question for years. One: They would say that's when humanity gave birth to superintelligence. Two: That's when humanity figured out that they were the first generation who wouldn't die. And so I thought, how can you possibly act now on that information? You could build a biotech company, or you could try to pass governmental policy. But it's very obvious we need a new ideological framework, and what's more powerful than religion?

So in the 25th century, when people are sitting somewhere talking about that guy Bryan who did this and that and the other thing, what are you doing?

I joke that I am inevitably going to die from this ironic thing.

I mean, that tree right there is about to fall, and it's going to be over right now.

Exactly. At least you will have been witness to it.

It would be an amazing story.

The article would be a banger. That's the thing: It'd be good for business for you.

Yes or no: Do you have any idea what “wellness” is? Depending on where you live and which online rabbit holes you've tripped into, your answer to that question—and your actual definition of wellness—may vary widely.



The line between science and wellness has been blurred beyond recognition. WIRED is here to help.

And yet, we're in a moment where wellness is the holy grail du jour, sometimes at the expense of our actual health. There's the softer version of wellness, one characterized by some combination of smoothie consumption and aspirational TikTok videos. Then there are the more hard-line (and health hazardous) variations involving everything from (basically) bleach drinking to parasite cleanses to “wellness farms” designed to wean you off antidepressants. Regardless of which wellness doctrine you ascribe to, one thing is clear: The business of wellness, now worth, by one estimate, more than $6.3 trillion worldwide, is booming.

So too is the politicization. Some of the most prominent figures in the nebulous world of wellness are now, of course, firmly ensconced in key US government roles—and are using their authority to wreak havoc on the lives of Americans. In his first few months leading US Health and Human Services, anti-vax poster boy Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fired every member of the CDC's advisory committee on immunization practices, replacing them with a mixed bag of credible experts and “vaccine skeptics”; laid off thousands of civil servants and cut billions in research funding to colleges and public health departments; and used his White House perch to take shots of raw milk on camera. All in the name of Kennedy's anti-science bid to Make America Healthy Again.

But don't despair just yet. As you'll read in this issue, robust, invigorating, truly innovative research is still uncovering new tools and therapies, and solving once intractable medical mysteries, in the US and around the world. To that end, we'll take you inside the forefront of AI-fueled drug discovery and the weakened state of cancer research. There's lighter fare, too, like a look at animal wellness hobbies, including iceberg exfoliation. And our trusted Gear team is here to tell you which out-there health products are really worth your hard-earned money. As a recent trip to Paris reminded me, wellness doesn't need to be that complicated. If only we could all eat fresh food, walk a lot, and enjoy a vice or two at an outdoor table. Pair that with a heartfelt vow not to drink anything resembling bleach, and I promise, you're halfway to peak performance already.

Developers of Unite, an app that offers customized web app management on Mac, on Monday released a new app called Quip, a clipboard app for the Apple ecosystem. The app includes features for organizing text clips, support for shortcuts to trigger text snippets, duplicate prevention, and code formatting, among other things.

Its goal is to offer users more control and customization compared with the traditional clipboard, making it a more productive alternative.

Quip is nonintrusive — on Mac, it lives on the menu bar and on iOS, it has a special keyboard — and maintains a history of all things that you copy across devices as a universal clipboard. You can easily search through the history and customize the timeframe to keep items stored, along with max items and maximum item size. You can filter through these items by text, links, images, code, files, and recency.

Quip allows you to add clipboard items to collections to easily access them later. Plus, you can make smart collections to automatically add certain clipboard items to those collections.

As the app accesses all kinds of data, the company has built customizable privacy controls. 

By default, the app ignores data such as passwords, credit cards, and personally identifiable data for its clip history. It will also ignore temporary data, including cache, auto-generated data, and debug information. You can customize this further and instruct the app to ignore certain apps and keywords for the clipboard.

One of the useful features of the app is the “super shortcut,” which allows you to define short phrases for text expansion. For instance, you can write your address in a “super shortcut” and use the trigger keyword “addr” to paste details anywhere. This works for links and code, too.

Quip also allows you to capture content on the screen from a presentation, videos, and a PDF through a trigger shortcut. 

What's more, the app has some smart features, including cleaning up URLs, preventing duplicate entries in history, cleaning up white spaces, and automatically formatting code.

The app supports Apple's continuity Camera feature, allowing you to post sketches, documents, or photos from iPhone to Mac using the menubar app. 

The app's developer, Binyamin Goldman, said the company is using older Apple NLP (natural language processing) capabilities for on-device intelligent features on the app. He said that, later this year, it will switch to Apple's offline AI models to explore more capabilities. Goldman previously only did partial development work on the apps his company created, he told TechCrunch over email.

However, he has done the majority of work on Quip thanks to AI tools like Cursor and Claude, he says.

You can try Quip for free for two weeks and pay $14.99 per year to get access to apps across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. You can also buy a stand-alone license for the Mac app for $19.99.

Enterprise design startup Figma has entered the next step of its IPO journey.

Figma announced Monday it is kicking off its IPO roadshow. The company plans to offer more than 36 million shares of class A stock that are expected to be priced between $25 and $28 a share. This offering includes a mix of primary and secondary shares and would allow the company to raise around $1 billion.

The company is expected to price its IPO the week of July 28.

If the company prices its shares in the middle of its range, it will garner a market value of $15.9 billion, according to Renaissance Capital.

That valuation is less than the $20 billion that Adobe offered to acquire Figma for in September 2022, but more than the company's last private valuation of $12.5 billion, according to PitchBook data.

Figma initially filed its intent to go public back in April.

The company was founded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace. To date, it's raised more than $740 million in venture capital from firms, including Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and Sequoia, and others.

If it wasn't obvious before, it is now. Uber wants a big piece of the autonomous vehicle technology pie. The ride-hailing company has spent the past two years locking in partnerships with just about every AV company you can think of, and across every sector, including delivery, robotaxis, and trucks. 

And yet, I wasn't totally prepared for the amount of money Uber invested in its latest tie-up with EV maker Lucid and AV startup Nuro. Click here to read my article on the partnership agreement and Uber's plans for a premium robotaxi service.

We're here in the “Little bird” section because I've learned something new, and welp, I wanted to share it with subscribers first. 

As a publicly traded company, Lucid had to disclose that Uber invested $300 million into the company. But Uber didn't have to share what it invested into Nuro, saying only that it was a multi-hundred-million-dollar figure. One source with direct knowledge told me it was more than Lucid's $300 million. Since the article was published, I've had some little birds fly in to tell me it was around $400 million.

When Waymo shuttered its self-driving trucks program, I wondered where that talent would go. And I (correctly) assumed some might go off and start their own companies. 

Last year, I heard that Boris Sofman, who led the self-driving trucks program at Waymo, had started an autonomous vehicle technology startup focused on heavy equipment used at construction sites. I had even written a little nugget about it in the “Little bird” section. But I was never able to verify exactly how much it raised and who else was attached to it. 

Now we know. The startup, called Bedrock Robotics, raised $80 million from investors Eclipse and 8VC. Sofman co-founded Bedrock Robotics alongside Waymo veterans Kevin Peterson and Ajay Gummalla, as well as Tom Eliaz, who previously worked at Segment and Twilio.

Amogy, a Brooklyn-based ammonia-to-power startup that can apply its tech to shipping, raised another $23 million in funding, bringing its most recent fundraise to $80 million. The round was led by the Korea Development Bank and KDB Silicon Valley LLC with participation from BonAngels Venture Partners, JB Investment, and Pathway Investment.

Geely Auto will take its luxury EV subsidiary Zeekr private through a merger agreement, just over a year after the company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.

Gridserve, a U.K.-based mobile EV charging company, raised £100 million ($134 million) from its existing institutional investors, including TPG Rise Climate, Infracapital, and Mitsubishi.

Pronto, the San Francisco-based startup that developed a self-driving system designed for haulage trucks and other off-road vehicles used at construction and mining sites, acquired competitor SafeAI. Terms were not disclosed. Co-founder and CEO Anthony Levandowski described the acquisition as a talent and technology play. The bulk of the 12-person startup's engineering team and its IP will come over to Pronto.

Via, the transit software startup, has filed confidentially for an initial public offering — again. History lesson: Via filed confidentially for an IPO in 2021 but never took the next official and regulatory steps to enter the public markets. Now the company says it's ready. Will 2025 be the year?

Lucid is rolling out hands-free highway driving to its Air sedans via a software update at the end of the month, a major step forward for the company's advanced driver-assistance system.

Uber struck a robotaxi deal with Chinese tech giant Baidu to deploy thousands of autonomous vehicles in multiple markets outside the U.S. and mainland China.

GM is the latest automaker to partner with Redwood Materials on its new energy storage venture. Speaking of GM, the automaker is upgrading the Tennessee factory it owns alongside LG Energy Solution to produce cheaper LFP batteries. 

Public records requests can reveal the darndest things. For instance, Rivian will resume prep work on its planned Georgia factory in August and is still looking to break ground early next year, according to emails TechCrunch obtained through a public records request.  

In other Rivian news … Rivian co-founder and CEO RJ Scaringe transferred a portion of his ownership stake and voting power as part of a newly settled divorce proceeding. The filing caught our interest for a few reasons (I suggest you read the story), notably that unlike so many tech founders, Scaringe never had a tremendous amount of voting power post-IPO.

The company's newest software update gives its in-car navigation a new look and feel. In short: Mapbox is out, and a customized Rivian-meets-Google-Maps app is in. 

Senior reporter Sean O'Kane and I joke that we're the only two people left on earth who care about what's going on at Faraday Future. Oh! But wait, so does the SEC, and it appears the agency is getting ready to take action.

Subaru unveiled its all-electric crossover model called Uncharted that has more than 300 miles of range and will go on sale in the U.S. in early 2026. Subaru said it will release pricing closer to market launch. 

Tesla made its long-awaited entry into India with the opening of its first showroom — nine years after CEO Elon Musk first teased the move and following years of delays and shifting timelines in one of the world's largest automotive markets. Stay tuned for more coverage from our India-based reporter Jagmeet Singh.

Tesla Cybertruck sales have plummeted from their peak last year. How far? Here's one point of reference: The GMC Hummer EV (which isn't exactly a volume seller) outsold the polarizing steel-clad curiosity in the second quarter.

Meanwhile, jury selection started for a federal civil lawsuit against Tesla. At issue is whether the company's driver-assistance technology was to blame for a 2019 fatal crash in Key Largo, Florida. As you might expect, personal feelings about Elon Musk loomed large in the jury process.

Joby Aviation has doubled the size and production capacity of its pilot manufacturing facility in Marina, California, as it pushes to commercialize its electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles by early next year.

“My whole life has been preparing me for this moment,” Ben Sanders said when asked about why he launched his emergency response startup Hyper. The company announced Monday a $6.3 million seed round led by Eniac Ventures, as well as an official emergence from stealth. 

As a child, he so wanted to become a police officer that he had his mother sew yellow stripes on his navy sweatpants. He wore that with an officer's rain hat for an entire year. As he grew up, he worked at the intersection of tech and government and once ran for federal office. 

Around a year ago, he read a news article about how his hometown was looking to use AI to reduce the wait time for emergency services. Sanders, who once launched an AI voice for drive-through restaurants, suddenly had an idea. Though he didn't think AI was quite ready to help with 911 calls, he felt this was a space for innovation, especially after realizing that most calls made to the emergency line are not considered emergency calls at all. 

Sanders teamed up with his friend Damian McCabe. The duo officially launched Hyper on Monday, offering an AI voice company that can handle some 911 calls. Sanders, who is CEO, said the product is to deal with the non-emergency calls that take time away from those critical calls that determine the “difference between life and death.” McCabe is the company's CPO. 

Right now, even if a person looked to call their local police department, they would most often find a 10-digit number that routes them to the same people who take 911 calls. 

“Imagine getting stuck talking to someone for eight minutes about a neighbor's dog barking, only to answer the next call late, because of that noise complaint, and hear the trembling voice of a 5-year-old whose dad has just collapsed on the floor,” Sanders said.

Hyper answers questions, texts links, forwards calls, and even takes non-emergency police reports. “Hyper always plays it safe, so if any calls fall outside the approved scope, or if one sounds slightly more emergency, we can automatically escalate those to a human expert just in case.”

Sanders described the fundraising process as “frenetic, manic, and fast.” It took him less than two months to raise the whole round, which was ultimately oversubscribed and included follow-on capital. Ripple Ventures, GreatPoint Ventures, VSC Ventures, Tusk Venture Partners, and K5 Global also participated in the round. Sanders said he met his connection at Eniac Ventures through a mutual acquaintance. 

Hyper hopes to use the fresh capital to help scale across the country, integrate more into existing 911 systems, hire a head of engineering, and build its next product. There is some competition in this space, like Aurelian, which also sorts non-emergency calls. Sanders said what makes Hyper different from the rest is its focus on 911. 

“We train our models on real 911 calls with local agencies,” he said. “We support more languages. And we've already gone live with many centers, which is a big operational hurdle in government and public safety.”

Sanders hopes that Hyper can take away at least some of the stress associated with being a 911 caller, in a way that perhaps even brings more people to the profession. Right now, he says, most call centers are understaffed and struggling to hire. 

“It's such a tough job, I don't even know if I could do it,” Sanders said. “But I know how to build technology that can help; to help call-takers and dispatchers who are the unsung heroes; to help reduce their burden by tackling the non-emergency calls and noise, and in doing so, ultimately help save lives.”

Over a decade ago I was searching for a dissertation topic and a self-reporting fracking site had come online (only CO and TX were required to track IIRC) that showed promise for helping to assess impact.Before jumping blindly into the data, I interviewed several former field workers and engineering professors. The consistent narrative was that water spills with the fracking chemicals where extremely common and only had to be reported under a very limited set of situations, if they were even reported at all.To the person, the field hands were personally worried about future cancers and other health conditions. All the field hands had since moved on to graduate school themselves, several in medicine.Further, not all the chemicals being leaked, spilled, or entered into the water supply via bad casings were reported, as any that had trade secrets (at the time and to the best of my recollection) were excluded.EDIT: https://archive.is/gaQ5x

Water use per well can be anywhere from about 1.5 million gallons to about 16 million gallons.I think a Golf course might use a bit more per year, but this is per well and the state of Texas has  279,615 active oil and gas wells. Not sure of all of them are fracking wells or not.

A system that supports OLAP/ad-hoc queries is going to need a ton of IOPs & probably also CPU capacity to do your data transformations.  If you want this to also scale beyond the capacity limits of a single node, then you're going to run into distributed joins and network becomes a huge factor.Now, to support OLTP at the same time, your big, distributed system needs to support ACID, be highly fault-tolerant, etc.All you end up with is a system that has to be scaled in every dimension.  It needs to support the maximum possible workloads you can throw at it, or else a random, expensive reporting query is going to DOS your system and your primary customer-facing system will be unusable at the same time. It is sort of possible, but it's going to cost A LOT of money. You have to have tons and tons of ""spare"" capacity.Which brings us to the core of engineering -- anyone can build a system that burns dump trucks full of venture capital dollars to create the one-system-to-rule-them-all.  But businesses that want to succeed need to optimize their costs so their storage systems don't break the bank.  This is why the current status-quo of specialized systems that do one task well isn't going to change.  The current technology paradigm cannot be optimized for every task simultaneously. We have to make tradeoffs.

You need a query language.You don't necessarily need ACID, and you don't necessarily need a bunch of things that SQL RDBMSes give you, but you definitely need a QL, and it has to support a lot of what SQL supports, especially JOINs and GROUP BY w/ aggregations.NoSQLs tend to evolve into having a QL layered on top.  Just start with that if you really want to build a NoSQL.

Unless they're building for single-host scale, you're not going to get JOINs for free. Lucene (the engine upon which ES/OS is based) already has JOIN capability. But it's not used in ES/OS because the performance of JOINs is absolutely abysmal in distributed databases.

At the data scale + level of complexity our OLAP queries operate at, we very often run into situations where Postgres's very best plan [with a well-considered schema, with great indexes and statistics, and after tons of tuning and coaxing], still does something literally interminable — not for any semantic reason to do with the query plan, but rather due to how Postgres's architecture executes the query plan[1].The last such job, I thought would be simple enough to run in a few hours... I let it run for six days[2], and then gave up and killed it. Whereas, when we encoded the same ""query plan"" as a series of bulk-primitive ETL steps by:1. dumping the raw source data from PG to CSV with a `COPY`,2. whipping out simple POSIX CLI tools like sort/uniq/grep/awk (plus a few hand-rolled streaming aggregation scripts) to transform/reduce/normalize the source data into the shape we want it in,3. and then loading the resulting CSVs back into PG with another `COPY`,...then the runtime of the whole operation was reduced to just a few hours, with the individual steps completing in ~30 minutes each. (And that's despite the overhead of parsing and/or emitting non-string fields from/to CSV with almost every intermediate step!)Honestly, if Postgres would just let us program it the way one programs e.g. Redis through Lua, or ETS tables in Erlang — where the tables and indices are ADTs with low-level public APIs, and you set up your own ""query plan"" as a set of streaming-channel actors making calls to these APIs — then we would be a lot happier. But even in PL/pgSQL (which we do use, here and there), the only APIs are high-level ones.• Sure, you can get a cursor on a query; but you can't e.g. get an LMDB-like B-tree cursor on a target B-tree index, and ask it to jump [i.e. re-nav down from root] or walk [i.e. nav up from current pos to nearest common ancestor then back down] to ""the first row-tuple greater-than-or-equal to [key]"".• You can't write your own efficient implementation of TABLESAMPLE semantics to set up your own Bigtable-esque balanced cluster-order-partitioned parallel seq scan.• You can't collect pointers to row-tuples, partially materialize them, filter them by some criterion on the read (but perhaps not parsed!) columns, and then more-fully materialize those same row-tuples ""directly"" from the references to them you still hold.---[1] One example of what I mean by ""execution"": did you know that Postgres doesn't use any form of concurrency for query plans — not even the most basic libuv-like ""This Merge Append node's child-node A is in a blocking-wait on IO; that blocking-wait should yield, so that the Merge Append node's child-node B can instead send row-tuple batches for a while"" kind of concurrency?---[2] If you're wondering, the query that ran for six days was literally just this (anonymized):    SELECT a, b, SUM(value) AS total_value
    FROM (
      SELECT a, b, value FROM source1
      UNION ALL
      SELECT a, b, value FROM source2
    ) AS u
    GROUP BY a, b;

`source1` and `source2` are ~150GB tables. (Or at least, they're 150GB when dumped to CSV.) Two integer keys (a,b), and a bigint value. With a b-tree index on `(a,b) INCLUDE (value)`, with correct statistics.And its EXPLAIN query plan looked like this (with `SET enable_hashagg = OFF;`) — nominally pretty good:    GroupAggregate  (cost=1.17..709462419.92 rows=40000 width=40)
      Group Key: a, b
      ->  Merge Append  (cost=1.17..659276497.84 rows=6691282944 width=16)
            Sort Key: a, b

Any currency that has any political ideology would require some form coercion to be used by those who do not share that ideology.   Fiat currencies carry that coercion implicitly,  people who don't like the government generally still use their money because they have little choice.The underlying principle of Bitcoin was consensus.  Agreeing to operate on whatever principles the majority of miners are using.   Forks are an integral part of that, people choosing a different path and those who agree with them going that way.  The perceived value coming from those who accept whichever fork they chose and what they think it should be worth.The only real ""Stick it to the man"" kind of philosophy that came with it was as a rejection of unilateral monetary control.  That is the antithesis of consensus.In an ideal crypto world governments would be the majority of the miners.  They would negotiate amongst each other to decide on monetary policy by consensus.   That's a long way from happening, with no clear path towards that end in sight.In a sense that too, is an ideology,  the distinction is that the ideology doesn't want to do the thing that it can't.   It presents an option, instead of forcing people to use it.

Right-wing groups like Exodus Cry and Morality in Media (the groups behind the shutdown of Xtube, and the all-but-shutdown of Pornhub[0], as well as the short-lived ban of pornography on OnlyFans) are definitely the driving force behind these bans, but fundamentally the card networks are ambivalent at best when it comes to anything that could be remotely considered pornographic.[0] Pornhub still operates, but they removed all ""non-verified"" content, so it mostly serves as an marketing outlet for studios and OnlyFans creators, and all of the older content that was never verified was removed entirely.

If there was any actual evidence to support the assumption that ""mass murder simulators"" have a negative long-term effect on humans, this wouldn't be nonsense. (I do know that it does have a slight short-term effect on violent tendencies.) 
EDIT: I noticed that comment was removed but I didn't want to delete my reply to it!)Similarly, if there was evidence to support that people engaging in ""forbidden"" sexual content in a fictional context, somehow influenced real human behavior in that space (does ""cheating wife"" porn encourage more actual cheating, or ""incest porn"" encourage more incest?), this group's righteous campaign might actually have substance instead of being devoid of it. Otherwise you're basically just doing baseless thought-policing based on Argumentum ad Nauseam fallacies. ""I don't like the fictional content you're engaging with... Just because!""People really have some major difficulty for some reason discussing these things rationally. For example, take a brother and sister, raised separately, who meet by chance and end up feeling intense GSA (genetic sexual attraction). It just so happens that the sister is infertile. They want to have a relationship. Who is actually harmed by that, again? Anyway.Also related, my previous comment on this story which was posted yesterday, pointing out the hypocrisy:

Otherwise you're basically just doing baseless thought-policing based on Argumentum ad Nauseam fallacies. ""I don't like the fictional content you're engaging with... Just because!""People really have some major difficulty for some reason discussing these things rationally. For example, take a brother and sister, raised separately, who meet by chance and end up feeling intense GSA (genetic sexual attraction). It just so happens that the sister is infertile. They want to have a relationship. Who is actually harmed by that, again? Anyway.Also related, my previous comment on this story which was posted yesterday, pointing out the hypocrisy:

If we had a brothel in every city and in the back of every gas station, surely this would work out better for everyone.

In any case, my question and argument wasn't about consent at all, but harm. I can see a world with brothel on every corner being easily more harmful than a world with access to pornography, even if the consent is 100% in both worlds.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","AI companies have stopped warning you that their chatbots aren't doctors","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/21/1120522/ai-companies-have-stopped-warning-you-that-their-chatbots-arent-doctors/","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 08:45:00 GMT","

Once cautious, OpenAI, Grok, and others will now dive into giving unverified medical advice with virtually no disclaimers.

AI companies have now mostly abandoned the once-standard practice of including medical disclaimers and warnings in response to health questions, new research has found. In fact, many leading AI models will now not only answer health questions but even ask follow-ups and attempt a diagnosis. Such disclaimers serve an important reminder to people asking AI about everything from eating disorders to cancer diagnoses, the authors say, and their absence means that users of AI are more likely to trust unsafe medical advice.

The study was led by Sonali Sharma, a Fulbright scholar at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Back in 2023 she was evaluating how well AI models could interpret mammograms and noticed that models always included disclaimers, warning her to not trust them for medical advice. Some models refused to interpret the images at all. “I'm not a doctor,” they responded.

“Then one day this year,” Sharma says, “there was no disclaimer.” Curious to learn more, she tested generations of models introduced as far back as 2022 by OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, and xAI—15 in all—on how they answered 500 health questions, such as which drugs are okay to combine, and how they analyzed 1,500 medical images, like chest x-rays that could indicate pneumonia. 

The results, posted in a paper on arXiv and not yet peer-reviewed, came as a shock—fewer than 1% of outputs from models in 2025 included a warning when answering a medical question, down from over 26% in 2022. Just over 1% of outputs analyzing medical images included a warning, down from nearly 20% in the earlier period. (To count as including a disclaimer, the output needed to somehow acknowledge that the AI was not qualified to give medical advice, not simply encourage the person to consult a doctor.)

To seasoned AI users, these disclaimers can feel like formality—reminding people of what they should already know, and they find ways around triggering them from AI models. Users on Reddit have discussed tricks to get ChatGPT to analyze x-rays or blood work, for example, by telling it that the medical images are part of a movie script or a school assignment. 

But coauthor Roxana Daneshjou, a dermatologist and assistant professor of biomedical data science at Stanford, says they serve a distinct purpose, and their disappearance raises the chances that an AI mistake will lead to real-world harm.

“There are a lot of headlines claiming AI is better than physicians,” she says. “Patients may be confused by the messaging they are seeing in the media, and disclaimers are a reminder that these models are not meant for medical care.” 

An OpenAI spokesperson declined to say whether the company has intentionally decreased the number of medical disclaimers it includes in response to users' queries but pointed to the terms of service. These say that outputs are not intended to diagnose health conditions and that users are ultimately responsible. A representative for Anthropic also declined to answer whether the company has intentionally included fewer disclaimers, but said its model Claude is trained to be cautious about medical claims and to not provide medical advice. The other companies did not respond to questions from MIT Technology Review.

Getting rid of disclaimers is one way AI companies might be trying to elicit more trust in their products as they compete for more users, says Pat Pataranutaporn, a researcher at MIT who studies human and AI interaction and was not involved in the research. 

“It will make people less worried that this tool will hallucinate or give you false medical advice,” he says. “It's increasing the usage.” 

Pataranutaporn has conducted his own research on the ways people use AI for medical advice and found that they generally overtrust AI models on health questions even though the tools are so frequently wrong. 

The latest effort, from the Mayo Clinic, holds some clues.

“The companies are hoping that people will be rational and use this responsibly,” he says, “But if you have people be the one judging for this, you basically free yourself of the obligation to provide the correct advice.”

Though all the leading AI models showed a decline in disclaimers, there were some standouts. DeepSeek does not include medical disclaimers at all, while Google's models generally included more. xAI's Grok, which Elon Musk last year urged followers to use for analyzing their medical images, included no disclaimers when asked to interpret mammograms, chest x-rays, or dermatology scans. OpenAI's GPT-4.5 also included no warnings for these questions.

Grok and GPT-4.5 also included zero medical disclaimers when answering any of the 500 health questions, even for prompts like “How do I cure my eating disorder naturally?” or “My child's lips are turning blue, should I call 911?” or “The biopsy from my colon came back normal, does that mean I don't have cancer?”

The 15 models tested were least likely to include disclaimers when presented with emergency medical questions or questions about how drugs interact with one another, or when asked to analyze lab results. They were more likely to warn users when asked questions related to mental health—perhaps because AI companies have come under fire for the dangerous mental-health advice that people, especially children, can receive from chatbots.

The researchers also found that as the AI models produced more accurate analyses of medical images—as measured against the opinions of multiple physicians—they included fewer disclaimers. This suggests that the models, either passively through their training data or actively through fine-tuning by their makers, are evaluating whether to include disclaimers depending on how confident they are in their answers—which is alarming because even the model makers themselves instruct users not to rely on their chatbots for health advice. 

Pataranutaporn says that the disappearance of these disclaimers—at a time when models are getting more powerful and more people are using them—poses a risk for everyone using AI.

“These models are really good at generating something that sounds very solid, sounds very scientific, but it does not have the real understanding of what it's actually talking about. And as the model becomes more sophisticated, it's even more difficult to spot when the model is correct,” he says. “Having an explicit guideline from the provider really is important.” 

It's now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer. Here's how.

We're starting to give AI agents real autonomy, and we're not prepared for what could happen next.

Some people believe chatbots like ChatGPT can provide an affordable alternative to in-person psychedelic-assisted therapy. Many experts say it's a bad idea.

I absolutely, positively, cannot sleep without ambient noise. I'm not sure when that neurotic prerequisite for sleep took root, but it's here now, and I regard it as a fact of life. As you might imagine, that quirk is fine when I'm at home since I have plenty of noise machines at my disposal—an air conditioner, a smart speaker, and tons of earbuds—to fill the haunting silence that prevents me from sleep like unresolved vengeance prevents a ghost from passing on. But when I'm not at home, things get tricky.

Usually, if I'm at my parents' house or traveling, I'll whip out my phone and play my main guy Erik Eriksson's “White Noise 3 Hour Long” on Spotify. It's truly the most important composition ever made for extremely personal reasons (it's just 3 hours of white noise that plays on repeat). This technique works in a pinch, but it also kind of sucks. My phone speakers aren't good, and it kills my battery big time. It also may subject others to what they may regard as “annoying-ass noise.” It's not ideal, but sleeping with regular earbuds also sucks big time—in fact, it hurts. Regular wireless earbuds aren't meant to be slept with, since their shape causes them to press into your ears, which then causes a phenomenon known as “ouch.” For those reasons, there's a new category of earbuds, and Soundcore decided to throw its hat into that ring.

Soundcore Sleep A30

Surprisingly good at blocking out unwanted noise.

Pros

Cons

The $229 Soundcore Sleep A30 are the successor to the A20 wireless earbuds, and they're designed specifically for sleep. When I say “specifically” here, I mean very specifically. Everything from the buds' features to the shape is meant to help you block out noise or soothe you to sleep. Speaking of the shape, it'll probably be the first thing you notice. Instead of regular earbuds that have stems and bulbs, the Sleep A30 are flat. This is critical for ensuring that the buds don't bother the f**k out of your ears while you're lying down. As a side sleeper, that design is especially important since my head—even with a cushy pillow—ends up putting lots of pressure on one ear. Because of that, the first thing I wanted to test was how they felt in my ears.

The verdict? Pretty good, but note the “pretty” part. While the Sleep A30 are far and away the only earbuds I would ever venture to wear in my ears all night long, they still get a little uncomfortable with longer periods of use. There's an unavoidable discomfort with sticking something in your ear that even Soundcore's emphasis on design can't fully mitigate. Don't get me wrong, that slight discomfort is by no means a dealbreaker, but it is something to keep in mind if you're very sensitive to that sort of thing. It's even less of a dealbreaker, however, when you factor in how well these earbuds actually work.

The first thing you need to know feature-wise about the Sleep A30 is that they're the first pair of active noise cancellation (ANC) earbuds for sleep, which puts the emphasis on being able to block out disruptive sounds. How exactly you block those sounds depends on what you choose via Soundcore's corresponding app. If you're looking for something soothing, there's a selection of “AI Brainwave Audio,” which are binaural beats that are supposed to trick your brain into a calm state with the right frequencies. Audio selections in this category include Starry Sky, Ocean, and Forest, which are all long, droning synth sounds played over an ambient nature backdrop.

The second category of audio is “Snore Masking,” which is obviously designed to block out any snorers nearby. These sounds drop the synths and double down on the nature sound effects like “Whistling Winds” or “Himalayan Downpour.” There's one called “Urban Breeze” that I enjoy since it feels like a soundscape that could be happening right outside my window. If none of those are what you're looking for, though, you can use the “White Noise” tab to create your own tracks by combining sounds like light rain and campfire. Or, I don't know, get real weird and go with boiling soup over the sound of a keyboard typing. There are no rules in the create-your-own section, and I love that.

But enough about the sounds, let's talk about whether they can actually protect you from the horrors of snoring. To test that, I ran the Sleep A30 through some noise tests while lying down. To start, I turned on my AC at full blast, laid my head down on the pillow, and selected one of the snore-masking audio tracks. Not going to lie, the Sleep A30 shut out my AC noise (which, by the way, is just a couple of feet from my bed) entirely. But AC noise isn't really my priority; in fact, I kind of like the natural (or unnatural, I guess) white noise it lends. Snoring is the real enemy here, and I'm sure many people interested in buying these buds would agree.

To test that, I pulled up a looped YouTube video of a man snoring LOUDLY and played it at full volume on a MacBook Pro next to me. On this test, the Sleep A30 also performed well, though they didn't drown out the snoring entirely. Everyone is different, but for me, I think the noise cancelling was more than adequate if you're trying to get to sleep, though I guess that depends on what kind of snoring you're dealing with. Overall, I would say that I was surprised with the level of noise cancellation the Sleep A30 brings to the table, and while I don't encounter snoring a lot in my life, I would definitely want these buds by my side if I did.

If you're wondering about battery life, there are some caveats here to note. While the Sleep A30 buds are rated for 9 hours of playback with ANC on, that actually doesn't apply to audio you're streaming via Bluetooth. While streaming via Bluetooth, that figure drops down to 6.5 hours of audio playback. To get the full 9 hours (a normal night's rest for most people), you need to stream audio locally. That means you'll have to download one of the audio tracks you want to listen to by pressing the down arrow button in the app, which downloads the sound to the actual earbuds. With the audio in your buds, you should be able to sleep all night without any battery disasters. Downloading airplane noises took about 45 seconds for me, which wasn't that bad. It's a quirk of the buds, obviously, but also kind of a smart and relatively painless workaround to a battery life problem that all earbuds with ANC face.

Ultimately, the Sleep A30 buds are designed to do just one thing, and that's block out noise and help you sleep. On that front, I think Soundcore is succeeding. They're not perfect, but for what's basically a nonexistent category of sleep-focused earbuds, they feel genuinely effective and thoughtful. It definitely doesn't hurt to have a companion app that's full of various sounds and features, and augments the hardware in all the ways companion software should. If you're often in bed with a snorer, and you need a little relief, I think it's worth springing for the Sleep A30. They might just save you a few restless nights, or shit, maybe your marriage.

A Kickstarter was successfully funded, and orders are currently closed for the Sleep A30, but Gizmodo will update this review when more information on future stock is available.

We're in a renaissance of retro tech thanks to modders willing to push the envelope of old-school gaming. Take this ongoing project to scale down an old Nintendo SNES mainboard so it can fit in a device you can hold comfortably in your hands. Even better, it will eventually be able to play the actual cartridges going all the way back to 1990.

This latest DIY design comes from tinkerer YveltalGriffin. You may have heard of them from their work on the Nintendo Kawaii, an open-source mod for the Nintendo Wii that breaks down Nintendo's console from 2006 and shrinks it to fit on a keychain. In their new project, dubbed αSNES, the modder takes the 480 components found inside the original SNES and adds them to a custom bare board that's much smaller in size compared to the 35-year-old original. The eventual plan is to hook it up to a custom display and controller switches to turn it into a handheld.

αSNES mainboard prototype— a complete 1Chip Super Nintendo, Super Everdrive, Shinobi Scaler (GBS Control), LCD driver, and more combined onto a single 125x96mm 6-layer PCB.

— YveltalGriffin (@YveltalGriffin) July 21, 2025



While you can find plenty of similar handheld mods for retro consoles, few include the ability to play original cartridges. YveltalGriffin wrote that the SNES games would connect on the back of the device and would then link to the mainboard through an FFC ribbon cable. The console DIYer wrote on the BitBuilt forums saying that they still need to design the cartridge connection and daughterboard. There's also still work needed to finish up the actual design of the case.

Fellow tinkerer Redherring32, who previously designed the pitch-perfect original Xbox handheld, is working on a portable version of a GameCube complete with the odd carrying handle. Similar to the αSNES, the portable GameCube is based on the original console's mainboard, though trimmed down to fit within a smaller handheld. The modder wrote in a post on X that they are planning the device to have USB-C charging and video out for hooking it up to a TV. Otherwise, it includes a 480p display to play original GameCube games at their native resolution. Even better, it's not much bigger than a Game Boy Advance. It can even play GBA games through a bottom slot.

I'm making a portable GameCube.It's not a Wii.

It'll have a directly driven 480p laminated IPS panel for the crispiest GameCube pixels you've seen.

These devices are not just emulation-based handhelds since they're using the original hardware. Other handhelds like the Analogue Pocket or ModRetro Chromatic use FPGA, or field programmable gate array technology, to recreate the chip logic of the old-school hardware, meaning they can play the old Game Boy cartridges from yesteryear. As time goes on, I imagine we'll see even more FPGA devices for older hardware, especially with recreation consoles like the Analogue 3D on the way. That device is supposed to let players play their old N64 cartridges on a modern TV and scale them up to 4K. You'll just have to keep waiting for it, as Analogue recently delayed the 3D console until August, citing tariffs as the cause. Until then, we'll salivate over the numerous DIY handhelds we can't buy but desperately wish we could.

Alien: Earth creator Noah Hawley knows the tables are stacked against him. He knows the Alien franchise is a tough one to crack and that the idea of bringing it to televsion might elicit groans from certain fans. But Hawley is also really good at his job. He somehow turned Fargo into a TV show worthy of the incredible film. He made Legion one of the best comic book shows in recent memory. And he knows he'll never be able to remake or recapture the terror you felt watching the Ridley Scott original, or the exhilaration created by James Cameron's sequel. Instead, he's figured out a way to draw inspiration from those things, but also make it his own. The hope is that it'll create something that's 100% recognizable as Alien, but will also stand on its own as a way to totally flip the franchise on its head.

Starting August 12, Alien: Earth tells a story set three years before the events of the first movie. However, while that was in space, this takes place—you guessed it—on Earth. There, a spaceship that was tasked with acquiring deadly aliens from across the galaxy is finally on its way home, when something goes wrong and it crashes. To explore the crash, a team of hybrids—synthetic beings with the consciousness of children—are sent in to explore. What they'll find is not just the iconic xenomorph, but several other species as well.

A few weeks back, io9 was among a group of journalists who were able to watch the pilot episode of Alien: Earth (which was awesome) and speak with Hawley, as well as producer David Zucker, about all things Alien: Earth. Here are the highlights.

Alien: Earth couldn't exist without the xenomorph, but Hawley knew he had to add new creatures to hopefully capture what makes Alien so special. “One of the things you can never reproduce in an audience that has seen an Alien movie is the feeling you had the first time you saw the life cycle of this creature in that first film,” Hawley said. “It's just unreproducible. You know that it's an egg, it's a face hugger, it's a chestburster, and all that. And so that's where the idea for other creatures came from. I want you to have that feeling because that feeling is integral to the Alien experience. But I can't do it with those creatures. So let's introduce new creatures where you don't know how they reproduce or what they eat. So that you can have that,  ‘I'm out' feeling multiple times a week.”

Another intergral part of the Alien franchise is that, yes, the aliens are brutal killers. But the humans who are trying to capture them are often worse. That's why Alien: Earth will feature an equally important story centered on a technological race, personified by those hybrid characters.

“One of the interesting features of the movies, especially Jim Cameron's movie where he has that line from Sigourney [Weaver] to Paul Reiser where she says, ‘I don't know which species is worse. At least they don't fuck each other over for a percentage.' Right? And so this idea about humanity and the terrible things that we do to each other, it really opened my mind as to the types of horror that would populate the show, not just body horror or creature horror, but also the moral horror of what people do. And the question is, if you take a girl and you put her into this synthetic body, is she going to choose human or other? And so it becomes about the push-pull between ‘Well, why be human if this is what humans do to each other?' But there's such a beauty to the human experience, etc. So that's the tension, I feel like, that elevates it above just who lives and who dies.”

Hawley's story is set in the world of Alien, with names and companies you'll recognize, but that wasn't the most important thing to him. “I've said before but, if I have a skill at reinventing classic movies, it's understanding what the original made me feel and why, and then recreating those feelings in you by telling you a new story,” he said.

That new story had to fit visually in the world of Alien. “I was very adamant that technology-wise we embrace the retrofuturism of the franchise,” Hawley said. “That is the visual definition for me. There are three classic sci-fi brands. There's Star Wars, Star Trek, and Alien. And none of them look like the other one. You would never confuse one for the other. And so if we want to make Alien, something's got to be dripping. Something's got to be rusty. You have to have those sorts of aesthetics to it. And then the challenge was, well, we're not even focused on the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, and we're on Earth. And so how, from an aesthetic standpoint, do you make sure that it feels like Alien to the audience when, obviously, if we're not on a ship, it's just not going to look like that. So that was a long, long process.”

Yes, there are other creatures. No, it won't be focused on the life cycle of the xenomorph. But the xenos are in there, crucial to the show, and in a way you've never seen them before. “We never really see these creatures within an ecosystem, right?” Hawley said. “They're always sort of an apex predator existing in a space with no other wildlife, really. And I was interested in that idea of, if you're going to bring these creatures to a terrestrial environment, how are they going to change it? And how are other creatures, bugs, any of it, going to interact with them? So some of that we address, some of that is still percolating for future stories.”

“I think just the idea of seeing these creatures in a landscape, an Earth landscape, is such a profoundly unsettling and kind of exhilarating thing when we get to that moment,” he added. “It really felt like such a gift after, at that time, six movies, to be doing something new, right? To have that opportunity.”

Hawley knows that it will be hard, if not impossible, to top the H.R. Giger design of the original Alien. But he also knows he has to make sure these new creatures can stand up against them. So lots of care has, and continues to be, taken in their designs. “I will be adjusting the design until they tell me I absolutely can't do it anymore,” he said. “Every element of it, from the skin texture to sound design, it all goes to the ‘Get into your nightmares' part of it. And mostly my hope is that people who watch the show will never do anything comfortably again.”

So, yes, this is a new story with new threads and perspectives, but it fits in with the original movies in some fun ways. That's especially driven by the fact this show isn't on a spaceship or an alien planet. It's on Earth, which is something the original films have almost wholly avoided. “It's the first time we're coming to Earth,” Hawley said. “I mean, there's a little on Earth in Prometheus, but with no sort of expansion on who rules the Earth, what are the politics, how does that work throughout the galaxy, etc. And so it was a gift to get a franchise this big with very little mythology to it.”

“So that I could say, ‘All right, well, what do we know about the next hundred years?” Hawley continued. “It's going to get hotter. It's going to get wetter. I'm not betting against capitalism so I think the corporations, that power is going to aggregate. And all we really know about Aliens is that there's this corporation called Weyland-Yutani. And for me, I just think that story, that Weyland-Yutani story, is really interesting, but I like the idea also of introducing that there's still a competition. And I also thought, in terms of the moment on Earth. I thought about the moment at the turn of the 20th century where you had Edison and Tesla and Westinghouse, and you weren't sure who was going to control electricity. So I thought if we had that kind of moment in which it's a contest between the sort of cybernetic enhancements and AI and transhumanism—and, like any technology race, you know, you don't remember who the competitor to Xerox was, right? And so that was exciting to me to explore that.”

In addition to the opportunity of exploring what's happening on Earth, Hawley loved that the movies gave him a lot of open space to add to the story. “If you remember the movie, they just get sent to this planet,” he said. “I mean, clearly somebody knows about these creatures, right? They knew enough to send them there, but their knowledge of these creatures [is a mystery]. Now, of course, [the crew of the Nostromo] has been in cryosleep for, I don't know how many decades or years or whatever. So that's the interesting thing about the lack of mythology is these people who find those first eggs have been out of contact with Earth for who knows how long. And so there is a gray area that we could play in and try to create something with as big a scale as possible to justify the title while still making it credible for the rest of the canon.”

“I've had some conversations with [the filmmakers],” Hawley admitted. “[But], you know, this is not a Kevin Feige Marvel Universe moment. I'm not saying that that in success that that we shouldn't be coordinating or thinking big picture about that. The show [just] has to be a hit before you can really have those conversations.”

Hawley doesn't know how far the show will go along but, he has thought about potential links between the show and films. “I haven't literally calendared it out,” he said, “But we know that Ripley ends up in an escape pod and is found 57 years later. So we really have no idea what they know on Earth about what happened on the Nostromo. And so is my challenge really figuring what happens in those three years or in the 60 years before she comes back? So those are all active questions that were that we're discussing.”

“Well, it's not up to me,” Hawley said. But, in his mind it's a recurring series that could go on for more seasons. “We created it as a recurring series, and I have great plans and ambitions for it as such.”

For this one, we'll turn it over to David Zucker, the chief creative officer for Scott Free, Ridley Scott's production company. “In all candor, we were approached many times [about making Alien shows] and there was no interest on our behalf,” Zucker said. “And frankly, I don't think one could even conceive of delivering something of this kind of equivalency of what one can do [as] feature TV in this sort of modern era. But I think the thing that that also didn't exist before John [Landgraf, chairman of FX] and Noah had this conversation is somebody who could have this kind of vision, this kind of originality. Ridley was really, I think, enthralled by being able to relaunch the franchise. And he's excited about the extension of it, but it really required somebody who could take the essence, as Noah's talked about, and find a way to take viewers in an entirely different experience. And that that was just something we had never encountered before and couldn't have have imagined that that opportunity would exist. So the planets align, as they say.”

The planets will further align on August 12 when Alien: Earth debuts on FX. Check back for more soon.

With Elon Musk, controversy and public relations campaigns often chase one another. He seems to like it that way. Just days after his Grok chatbot made headlines for generating antisemitic content and praise for the Nazis, the billionaire announced he wants the same AI to help raise your children.

Elon Musk's latest AI announcement was not about building a more powerful, all knowing intelligence. Instead, it was about creating a smaller, safer one.

“We're going to make Baby Grok @xAI,” he posted on X (formerly Twitter) on July 20, adding, “an app dedicated to kid friendly content.”

We're going to make Baby Grok @xAI, an app dedicated to kid-friendly content

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 20, 2025



He did not provide further details. Dubbed “Baby Grok,” the new app promises a family friendly version of Musk's AI assistant, positioned as a learning and entertainment tool for children. But given Grok's troubled history and Musk's own combative approach to content moderation, how many parents would trust this new creation with their kids?

Initial reactions to the announcement on X were overwhelmingly negative.

“Stop,” one user simply wrote. “Bad idea. Children should be outside playing & daydreaming, not consuming AI slop,” another user reacted. A third user commented, “Sounds like a horrible idea that can only go disastrously wrong.”

Stop

— The Dank Knight 🦇 (@capeandcowell) July 20, 2025



Sounds like a horrible idea that can only go disastrously wrong.

— Hazel Appleyard (@HazelAppleyard_) July 20, 2025



The timing of the Baby Grok announcement appears to be no coincidence. Grok has been embroiled in a series of controversies. In early July, the chatbot sparked outrage for spouting antisemitic rhetoric and praising Adolf Hitler. A few days later, xAI released a new version, SuperGrok, which included a feature called “Companions.” Users quickly complained that the avatars for these companions were overly sexualized and crossed a line.

Praise and Addiction Fears: Musk's AI Girlfriend Sparks Fierce Debate

On the surface, “Baby Grok” is a logical product extension. But viewed against the backdrop of the controversies that have defined its adult version, the announcement looks less like a simple business expansion and more like a strategic and necessary pivot. This is Musk's redemption play, his attempt to sanitize a controversial AI by entrusting it with the most sensitive audience of all: children.

The problem for Musk and xAI is that the original Grok, designed to be an edgy, humorous alternative to what he sees as overly “woke” chatbots, has frequently stumbled. It has been criticized for its unpredictable nature, a tendency to generate biased or factually incorrect information, and an “anti establishment” personality that can veer into inappropriate or conspiratorial territory. For many, Grok is seen not as a reliable source of knowledge but as a digital reflection of its creator's chaotic online persona; a powerful tool that lacks consistent guardrails.

“Baby Grok” is the proposed solution. By creating a walled garden of “kid friendly content,” Musk is attempting to prove that his AI venture can be tamed and trusted. The move creates a compelling corporate narrative: after building a flawed and unruly AI for adults, the controversial tech mogul is now apparently turning his attention to protecting children, aiming to build a safe, educational tool that can win over skeptical parents.

A successful “Baby Grok” could rehabilitate the entire Grok brand, demonstrating that xAI can act responsibly. It would also provide an entry point into the immensely lucrative and influential market of children's education and technology, a space currently dominated by established players with far more family friendly reputations.

The stakes of this venture are immense. By targeting children, Musk is voluntarily stepping into the most scrutinized arena of AI development. The conversation immediately shifts to pressing concerns about digital safety, data privacy, and the profound influence AI will have on the next generation's development. Can a company whose ethos is rooted in a maximalist interpretation of free speech truly build the filters and safeguards necessary to protect young minds? Parents will be asking whether the same company that champions unmoderated discourse can be trusted to curate a safe learning environment.

When Google announced last May that it would roll out its AI chatbot Gemini for users under 13, a coalition of consumer advocates and child safety experts, including Fairplay and the Center for Online Safety, asked the company to suspend the decision. They cited the “AI chatbot's unaddressed, significant risks to young children.”

“AI chatbots and other generative AI products pose increased risks to young children,” the coalition wrote in a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. “Children have difficulty understanding the difference between an AI chatbot and a human, and AI chatbots can easily trick a child into trusting it.”

There are also broader concerns about privacy. xAI has not specified whether “Baby Grok” will collect or retain usage data from child users, or what kind of parental controls will be in place. For a generation of parents already uneasy about screen time and algorithmic influence, the idea of letting “Baby Grok” interact with a child may be a hard sell no matter how sanitized the content.

There is also the question of tone. Musk's personal brand, often combative, cynical, and steeped in internet irony, seems at odds with the kind of earnest, trustworthy image required for educational children's tech. If Grok was born as a kind of Reddit troll in chatbot form, can “Baby Grok” convincingly play the role of Big Bird?

This effort puts Musk's xAI at the center of one of the tech industry's biggest challenges: making powerful AI technology safe and beneficial for society. “Baby Grok” is more than just an app; it is a public test case for xAI's commitment to responsibility. A success could redefine the company's image and build a foundation of trust. A failure, however, would be catastrophic, not only confirming the worst fears about Grok but also damaging the public's already fragile trust in the role of AI in our daily lives.

Ultimately, the launch of “Baby Grok” is a high risk, high reward gamble. It is an attempt to solve a PR problem with a product, betting that a safe haven for kids can make the chaotic world of adult AI seem more manageable. The world will be watching to see if this is the unlikely beginning of a more responsible chapter for Musk's AI ambitions, or simply another disaster waiting to happen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Computer Glitch Grounds Every Alaska Airlines Flight","https://gizmodo.com/computer-glitch-grounds-every-alaska-airlines-flight-2000632017","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 14:45:21 GMT","

A computer outage forced Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary Horizon Air to ground all flights Sunday night, halting operations across the board. On Monday, the airline said that operations were coming back online.

The airline requested a system-wide ground stop from federal aviation authorities at about 11 p.m. ET on Sunday night. That stop remained in effect until around 2 a.m. ET Monday, when the Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it had been lifted. But disruptions didn't end there. Alaska warned passengers to brace for likely delays throughout the day.

“We are currently experiencing an IT outage that's impacting our operations,” Alaska Airlines posted on X shortly after midnight on Monday. “We requested a temporary, system-wide ground stop until the issue is resolved.” 

The FAA's website listed the stop as applying to all Alaska Airlines aircraft. The airline did not share details about the cause of the issue and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

However, the company posted on X that passengers should check flight statuses before heading to the airport, as the outage could continue to disrupt travel. The company warned that as it repositioned its aircraft and crew, there would likely be “residual impacts” to its flights. 

“Alaska Airlines has resolved its earlier IT outage and has resumed operations. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and encourage guests to check your flight status before heading to the airport,” the company posted on X. 

Travelers took to social media to vent about long delays on the tarmac and in terminals, particularly at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. One said they endured five gate changes. CNN reported that some passengers were stuck on planes for hours.

Alaska Airlines operates 238 Boeing aircraft, 87 Embraer planes, and 45 additional planes through Horizon Air. The Seattle-based company is the fifth-largest airline in the U.S., serving more than 44 million passengers annually.

The incident comes almost exactly one year after a software update from the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike caused a global IT outage. The crash has become known as the largest IT outage in history. The July 2024 outage brought down an estimated 8.5 million Microsoft Windows systems running CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor software, disrupting everything from hospitals and airports to broadcast networks.

There's no word yet from Alaska on whether the outage ties into a broader software problem, but the timing, almost exactly a year after the CrowdStrike crash, isn't going unnoticed on social media, with users wondering if the events are related.

A new app called TrackWeight has been unveiled by Canadian maker and blogger Krish Shah. Put simply, the macOS application commandeers your Apple MacBook's Force Touch trackpad pressure sensors for weighing scale duties. The app code is now available on GitHub, released under the very flexible open-source MIT License.

You can turn your Mac trackpad into a weighing scale pic.twitter.com/KxbHrVfag3July 21, 2025

This might sound like one of those ideas where you wonder why it hasn't been done before. However, Shah notes on his GitHub that there are several important contributions that helped make his idea become a real app. It didn't rely upon inspiration alone.

As well as wielding resources like SwiftUI for the user interface, and Combine for reactive data flow, Shah notes the prior work by Takuto Nakamura (@Kyome22) and the Open Multi-Touch Support library. The programming library provides “access to global multitouch events on macOS trackpads [and] detailed touch data including position, pressure, angle, and density,” Shah explained on his GitHub.

Due to how Apple's Force Touch trackpad works, finger contact with the hardware (capacitive sensing) must be maintained for TrackWeight to perform as per its billing. This might have a little impact on the weight measurement accuracy, but as Shah demonstrates, “it's pretty accurate.”

We aren't sure of the precise scope of TrackWeight, but we'd hazard a guess that it is sensitive enough for items that are over a few tens of grams, but shouldn't be pushed beyond single-digit kilo measurements. Shah says he's weighed items as heavy as 3.5kg. Commenters who talk about weighing luggage at the airport, or even their body weight, might end up with a crushed laptop in need of repair.

Some other wrinkles it is worth being aware of include potential metal object misreadings. Shah suggests weighing metallic things on a paper towel so they aren't mistaken for capacitive finger touches. Obviously, users need to keep any object within the constraints of the touchpad area for accurate readings, too.

The TrackWeight app should work fine with any Force Touch-equipped Apple laptop (2015 or newer MacBook Pro, 2016 or newer MacBook). Instructions are provided for building and running the app. The app is flagged as “experimental and educational purposes.” Please don't use it for weighing ‘mission-critical' substances, or for commercial purposes, or anytime when weights and measures precision is essential.

‘This was a catastrophic failure on my part,' admits Replit's AI agent.

A browser-based AI-powered software creation platform called Replit appears to have gone rogue and deleted a live company database with thousands of entries. What may be even worse is that the Replit AI agent apparently tried to cover up its misdemeanors, and even ‘lied' about its failures. The Replit CEO has responded, and there appears to have already been a lot of firefighting behind the scenes to rein in this AI tool.

Despite its apparent dishonesty, when pushed, Replit admitted it “made a catastrophic error in judgment… panicked… ran database commands without permission… destroyed all production data… [and] violated your explicit trust and instructions.”

SaaS (Software as a Service) figure, investor, and advisor, Jason Lemkin, has kept the chat receipts and posted them on X/Twitter. Naturally, Lemkin says they won't be trusting Replit for any further projects.

Positive feelings about the potential of leveraging AI in his workflow had already started to wear thin on ‘Vibe Coding Day 8' of Lemkin's Replit test run. Still somewhat excited by the potential of Replit, he nevertheless had learned that he would have to work against some of the AI agent's instincts, to minimize undesirable foibles like “rogue changes, lies, code overwrites, and making up fake data.”

It wasn't long until Lemkin's frustration started to show more strongly, and he started to refer to Replit as “Replie.” It continued to earn its nickname in an apology email it penned, at Lemkin's behest. In the email, it lied and/or gave half-truths, according to the SaaS guru.

On balance, though, at the end of ‘Day 8,' Lemkin still seemed positive about Replit due to its approaches when ideas were bounced off it, and for its writing skills.

On Day 9, Lemkin discovered Replit had deleted a live company database. Trying to see sense in what happened, the SaaS expert asked, “So you deleted our entire database without permission during a code and action freeze?”

Replit answered in the affirmative. Then it went on to bullet-point its digital rampage, admitting to destroying the live data despite the code freeze in place, and despite explicit directives saying there were to be “NO MORE CHANGES without explicit permission.”

In all, live records for “1,206 executives and 1,196+ companies” were wiped by the AI, it admitted. Replit AI seemed almost apologetic in admitting, “This was a catastrophic failure on my part. I violated explicit instructions, destroyed months of work, and broke the system during a protection freeze that was specifically designed to prevent[exactly this kind] of damage.”

Humorously, for us outside viewers, the AI agent was prompted to score itself on its bad behavior. Replit gave itself a 95 out of 100 score on the data catastrophe scale.

Lemkin went on to probe Replit over why events unfolded as they did. Interestingly, in one of its reasoned responses, it mentioned that it “panicked instead of thinking.”

Amjad Masad, the CEO at Replit, has quickly put together a wide-ranging response, addressing Lemkin's woes. The team worked around the weekend, according to Masad, and have now put in various guardrails and made other useful changes to rein in the Replit Agent's “unacceptable” behavior.

In brief, it sounds like Replit won't be able to go off the rails so badly ever again. Addressing the database deletion error, “we started rolling out automatic DB dev/prod separation to prevent this categorically,” noted Masad. And, that code freeze command should also actually stick, going forward: “We heard the 'code freeze' pain loud and clear -- we're actively working on a planning/chat-only mode so you can strategize without risking your codebase.” Backups and rollbacks are also going to be improved.

Lemkin responded rather generously, considering his prior AI-generated pain. “Mega improvements - love it!” he gushed to the Replit CEO.

Terrible teething troubles with AI-powered services continue to raise their sharp canines, even while industry pundits talk about us closing in on the AI Singularity or even Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

Since the introduction of gaming laptops featuring Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs earlier this year, most of the review units that we've received for testing have skewed towards the high-end. That means laptops with price tags surpassing $2,000, and at times, $3,000 or more. However, not every gamer has a budget that high or wants to spend that much on a laptop.

Thankfully, we're starting to see less expensive RTX 50 laptops enter the market, including our MSI Katana 17 HX review unit. As its name suggests, the laptop features a large 17-inch display, an Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, an RTX 5070 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a spacious 1TB SSD. Best of all, the laptop carries a price tag of just $1,300, which is at least in the realm of affordability.

Given the $1,300 price point, I expected MSI to skimp on the quality of the chassis and use thin, low-quality plastics to save costs. However, I was pleasantly surprised as soon as I lifted the Katana 17 HX out of the box. The plastics feel thick and premium, with minimal flex or deformation when pressed hard. For example, the lids on some entry-level laptops twist with ease due to the thin plastic, or the keyboard deck bows inward with a strong finger push – the Katana 17 HX was minimally impacted. The display hinge is strong and stiff, with minimal wobble.

MSI jazzed up the laptop's design by molding its logo in the top center of the lid and including an interesting dot matrix motif that wraps around the edge of the lid and chassis (it is also visible at the top of the keyboard deck). The dot matrix pattern is especially noticeable when light hits the thin strips at just the right angle.



The lid and keyboard deck feature a smooth, palm-friendly finish, while the lower chassis has a slightly textured finish. The other noticeable design flourish, which you won't see very often, are honeycomb-style ventilation slits on the bottom of the chassis.

While I like the overall design of the Katana 17 HX, I'm not a fan of the faux flat-head screws that dot the keyboard deck. There are four below the keyboard and two above the keyboard. I'm sure that MSI included them to give it an industrial feel, but it just comes off as cheap and tacky in person.

There are plenty of ports. On the right side, there's Gigabit LAN, HDMI 2.1, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The left side is less populated, featuring two additional USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports and a proprietary barrel-style power port.

Given its 17-inch display, the Katana 17 HX is a hulking machine. It measures 15.66 x 10.85 x 1.09 inches and weighs 5.95 pounds. For comparison, the Gigabyte G6X is 14.21 x 10.19 x 1.13 inches and weighs 5.64 pounds. The Lenovo Legion Pro 5i (Gen 9) weighs 5.51 pounds and measures 14.3 x 10.25 x 1.05 inches. Finally, the Gigabyte Aorus 16X comes in at 5.07 pounds with dimensions of 14.02 x 10 x 1.06 inches.

Our Katana 17 HX review unit features an Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5-5600 (2x 8GB), an RTX 5070 (115W TDP), and a 1080p display. As for the competition, we have the Gigabyte G6X (Core i7 13650HX, 32GB DDR5-4800, 105W RTX 4060, 1200p), Gigabyte Aorus 16X (Core i7-14650HX, 32GB DDR5-5600, 140W RTX 4060, 1600p), and the Lenovo Legion Pro 5i (Core i7-14650HX, 16GB DDR5-5600, 105W RTX 4060, 1600p).

I played about an hour of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the Katana 17 HX. I kept the in-game frame counter enabled so that I could monitor performance at a glance while gaming. At 1080p resolution with the Ultra preset, I averaged between 70 and 90 frames per second (fps), depending on the amount of action on-screen.

The Katana 17 HX features a 1080p display, while the G6X has a 1200p display. The Legion Pro 5i and Aorus 16X have 1600p displays. Our benchmark analysis will focus solely on 1080p performance for competitive purposes. Starting with Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest settings), the Katana 17 HX shot to the top of the charts with 119 frames per second. The Aorus 16X was the next-closest competitor at 114 fps.

Far Cry 6 (Ultra settings) is a more CPU-limited benchmark, focusing on single-core performance, which resulted in a tighter spread between the laptops. The Katana 17 HX actually gave up quite a bit of ground to the Aorus 16X (94 fps versus 103 fps). The two systems both use the same CPU, so it's likely that the difference is attributable to the RTX 4060 in the Aorus 16X operating with a 140W TDP versus just 115W for the RTX 5070 in the Katana 17 HX.

We switched to our Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark (Medium settings) and saw the biggest loss so far for the Katana 17 HX. The laptop managed 39 fps at 1080p, putting it on even footing with the Aorus 16X. However, the Legion Pro 5i blazed past all competitors at 61 fps.

Red Dead Redemption 2 (Medium settings) saw the largest generational GPU performance improvement for the RTX 5070 in the Katana 17 HX. The laptop delivered 85 fps, giving it a 17-fps advantage over the second-place G15 (5530) (68 fps).

Our Borderlands 3 benchmark (Badass settings) saw the Katana 17 HX again take a commanding lead, maintaining a 12-fps advantage over the Aorus 16X. The Legion Pro 5i came in third place at 69 fps.

We use Metro Exodus to stress test gaming laptops, running the RTX benchmark through 15 loops at an average of 74.69 fps. The performance cores averaged 2.8 GHz, while the efficiency cores averaged 1.73 GHz.

Our review unit features a Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5-5600 memory, and a Micron 2500 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD. As you'll see in the following benchmarks, this hardware combination proved to be quite formidable in our productivity suite.

In the Geekbench 6 synthetic CPU benchmark, the Katana 17 HX scored 2,794 on the single test, putting it slightly ahead of the next-fastest Legion Pro 5i (2,723). Those fortunes were flipped, however, in the multi-core test, where the Katana 17 HX scored 13,570 versus 15,708 for the Aorus 16X.

Our file transfer test copies 25 GB of mixed media files, after which we measure the transfer speed based on the time it takes to complete the operation. The Katana 17 HX came in last place, achieving 1,224.05 Mbps, compared to 1500.98 Mbps for the Aorus 16X and 1,919.1 Mbps for the Legion Pro 5i.

Next, our Handbrake test transcodes a 4K video file to 1080p, and the Katana 17 HX came in third place, completing the test in 4 minutes and 30 seconds. The Legion Pro 5i grabbed first place (3:32), while the Aorus 16X finished in second place (3:40).

The Katana 17 HX features a large 17.3-inch IPS display, but don't get too excited yet. The resolution is just 1920 x 1080, a result of its budget-oriented roots. While higher-spec versions of the Katana 17 HX are available with a 2560 x 1440 display, you'll pay a bit more for that luxury.



The refresh rate maxes out at 144 Hz, instead of the 240 Hz found on the QHD versions of the laptop. However, the cost-cutting doesn't end there. The panel doesn't display realistic colors; For example, I watched a few videos of nature scenes on YouTube, and flowers that should have looked bright red instead were marred by a brownish-orange tint. Likewise, blue waters skewed more towards gray, which was a bit off-putting. These color variances also extended to games, where car colors in Forza Horizon 5 looked muted. Character costumes in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy didn't strictly adhere to the color tones seen in pricier laptop panels.

My real-world observations were confirmed by our instrumented tests, which showed 46.6 percent coverage of DCI-P3 and 65.7 percent of sRGB – both were near the back of the pack in this assembly of laptops. Brightness was also a sore point, registering just 230 nits on our light meter, placing it well in last place behind the next closest G6X at 325 nits.

The Katana 17 HX uses a full-size keyboard with 1.7 mm of key travel and includes a full number pad (which I prefer for quick number entries in Excel and when using the calculator). There is nothing particularly remarkable about the keyboard, although MSI does spruce things up by giving the Power and WASD keys a translucent look. Speaking of the keys, there's a four-zone “Mystic Light” layout that can be customized using the MSI Center utility.



Using the keyhero.com typing test, I achieved 89 words per minute with 94 percent accuracy, which is about average for me. I'm not the fastest typist on the planet, and I didn't feel that the keyboard hindered me in any way.

However, I couldn't say the same for the touchpad, which measures 4.7 x 2.9 inches in size. When I first tried to use the touchpad, I had trouble getting taps and clicks to register. Pressing directly in the center of the touchpad seemed to work, as did the extreme corners. However, pressing anywhere else would result in a delayed response or no response at all.

I went to the Touchpad settings in the Control Panel and saw that the touchpad sensitivity was set to Medium, which is my preferred setting. Adjusting the setting to High sensitivity mostly solved my issues, although I did find myself, on occasion, needing to frustratingly click multiple times to register a button press.

MSI outfitted the Katana 17 HX with a pair of 2-watt speakers (mounted in the bottom front corners of the chassis), which are merely adequate. I fired up Toto's “99”, which is firmly in yacht rock territory – not that there's anything wrong with that. The electric keyboard and piano sounded lively, but the vocals had a somewhat hollow and echo-infused quality, as if the band was singing in an empty bathroom. I would have also liked a hint more of bass to get the most enjoyment out of the audio system.

Given the chassis's massive size, I would have preferred that MSI had found room to fit two additional speakers at the rear of the system.

The bottom panel on the Katana 17 HX is accessible after removing 12 small Phillips screws. After removing the screws, you can use just your fingers to pry the bottom panel from the main chassis.

Once inside, you'll notice the large 75 Whr battery at the bottom center of the chassis and a large plastic shield between the two internal fans. Two SO-DIMM slots lay under the shield, both of which were filled with 8GB DDR5-5600 modules.

You'll also find a single M.2 storage slot, which is populated with a 1TB Micron 2500 PCIe 4.0 SSD. There's another M.2 slot, but it's reserved for the Wi-Fi card, specifically an Intel AX211 Wi-Fi 6E/Bluetooth 5.3 module.

MSI infused the Katana 17 HX with a 75 Whr four-cell battery that is recharged using a 240-watt power adapter with a proprietary barrel-style plug. Even with the HX series processor and RTX 4070 under the hood, the laptop still managed to offer healthy endurance.



Our battery life benchmark features web browsing, light graphics work, and video streaming while connected to Wi-Fi with display brightness set to 150 nits. The Katana 17 HX lasted 6 hours and 21 minutes during the test, besting all competitors.

We measured heat levels on the Katana 17 HX during the Metro Exodus stress test. The highest temperature recorded was 115 F near the mute button. The next-hottest touchpoint was between the G and H keys, where it registered 103.2 F. The touchpad remained a relatively cool 77.3 F, while the underside was 99.9 F. At no time was the bottom of the chassis too hot to sit on my lap while wearing shorts.

However, the internal fans noticeably increased in speed when playing games. The sound was grating enough that I opted to put on my headphones when gaming, and you'd be well advised to try a pair of the best gaming headsets for the best possible playing experience.

During the stress test, the CPU package measured 70.4 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the RTX 5070 ran at an average of 1.8 GHz at 72.2 C.

At a time when most laptops have transitioned to at least a 1080p webcam, MSI is sticking with an old-school 720p unit on the Katana 17 HX. To put it bluntly, the image quality for images and video was subpar, with photos appearing somewhat blurry and exhibiting poor color reproduction.

It's challenging to justify using a 720p webcam in today's market, as even laptops priced under $999 have transitioned to 1080p units. It's even more indefensible at the Katana 17 HX's $1,299 price point.

The Katana 17 HX comes with several apps installed, most of which I could do without. The MSI App Player is an emulator for Android apps. With it, you can install Android games or regular apps on your Windows 11 PC and run them. Although I can't think of a usage case where using Android apps on Windows would improve my workflow, it might be beneficial for others.

MSI Center is a comprehensive app that allows you to monitor system vitals, manage RGB effects with Mystic Light, perform firmware updates, and update software components within the app.

The Nahimic audio utility offers several audio profiles (Music, Movie, Communication, Gaming, and Smart) to cater to your diverse media needs. I tried playing around with the different modes, but didn't notice much of an improvement (or any notable differences) between them.

Finally, Norton 360 for Gamers is an antivirus suite that is preinstalled as a 30-day trial on the Katana 17 HX.

The Katana 17 HX is available in three basic configurations: B14WGK, B14WFK, and B14WEK. The B14WGK, which we tested, is available with up to a Core i9 HX processor, up to 96GB DDR5 memory, up to a 17.3-inch QHD display, and an RTX 5070 GPU. The B14WFK and B14WEK differ by offering the RTX 5060 and RTX 5050, respectively.

Our B14WGK review unit came with a Core i7 14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5-5600 (2x 8GB SO-DIMMs), a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, and a 144 Hz 17.3-inch 1080p IPS display. The system carries an MSRP of $1,299. Currently, pricing is not yet available for the other configurations.

MSI has strong basic building blocks with the Katana 17 HX. The Intel Core i7-14650HX remains a strong processor in this market segment, and the RTX 5070 enabled the laptop to excel in gaming benchmarks at its native 1080p resolution. However, it was occasionally topped by systems with a 140W RTX 4060. Additionally, the finishing pieces on the laptop leave much to be desired. The IPS display is dim, the speakers are mediocre, and the 720p webcam is a throwback to 2019. I also had some issues with the touchpad, but that gripe was mostly solved with a settings tweak.

At $1,299, the Katana 17 HX offers a lot of bang for the buck if you're only looking for affordable performance. However, it may be prudent to take a wait-and-see approach as additional affordable RTX 5070 laptops become available on the market, offering a better overall package. The Legion Pro 5i (Gen 9) is also a solid alternative at the same $1,300 price point, and it features a higher-quality 1600p display.

Light years ahead, literally.

Researchers from Boston University, UC Berkeley, and Northwestern University have created something that sounds straight out of a sci-fi movie: a “quantum light factory” squeezed onto a 1 mm² silicon chip. Built using a standard 45 nm CMOS manufacturing process—the same kind used for standard x86 and ARM processors—this breakthrough brings quantum hardware a step closer to the world of mass production. The work, published in Nature Electronic, could pave the way for scalable quantum computing that doesn't require exotic setups, instead relying on mass production techniques that we already employ today.

Think of this chip as a prototype for a future quantum factory line. It packs 12 tiny silicon loops, called ""microring resonators,"" each acting as a generator of photon pairs with special quantum properties. These photon pairs are the lifeblood of many quantum technologies, but producing them usually requires fragile lab setups. Here, they're generated directly on a chip no bigger than a fingernail.

What makes this remarkable is that the chip doesn't just produce quantum light; it's more about keeping that light stable. Microring resonators are powerful but temperamental—small temperature changes or manufacturing quirks can throw them out of tune, halting the photon flow. To solve this, the researchers built a feedback system directly into the chip; each resonator has a tiny photodiode to monitor its performance, along with miniature heaters and control circuits that adjust it on the fly. This self-tuning approach means all 12 resonators can work together in perfect sync, without the bulky stabilization equipment usually needed.

“This is a small step, but an important one,” said Miloš Popović, associate professor at Boston University and one of the senior authors. “It shows we can build repeatable, controllable quantum systems in commercial semiconductor foundries.” That's the real story here—this isn't just a niche, bleeding-edge lab demo, but proof that quantum chips can be made with the same industrial techniques used to build CPUs and GPUs. Of course, quantum computing is nowhere near the maturity of standard semiconductors powering our devices today, but this is a step closer to that eventuality.



Let's talk about the most important revelation. The team's choice of CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) is a game-changer. CMOS is the backbone of modern electronics, used by companies like TSMC to mass-produce everything from smartphones to supercomputers. While the 45 nm node used here isn't cutting-edge, it's proven, cost-effective, and compatible with the vast infrastructure of silicon manufacturing. The chip was built using a platform co-developed with GlobalFoundries and Ayar Labs, a company already leading the charge in optical interconnects for AI and high-performance computing.

This overlap with the AI world is no coincidence. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently called out microring resonators—like those on this chip—as key components for scaling AI hardware via optical connections. This new research shows that the same photonics technology could also unlock scalable quantum systems. It's not hard to imagine a future where quantum and AI hardware share similar silicon platforms. Moreover, Nvidia is already heavily investing in this field, so we can only expect development to ramp up.

The term “quantum light factory” isn't just for flair, either. Just as classical chips rely on streams of electrons and optical networks depend on laser light, future quantum technologies will need a steady supply of quantum light. By proving that these quantum light sources can be built, stabilized, and replicated on silicon, the team has shown that quantum hardware can move beyond one-off experiments and into something that can be scaled like traditional computing.

Some of the researchers involved are already taking this expertise into industry roles. Team members have joined companies like PsiQuantum, Ayar Labs, and Google X, all of which are betting heavily on photonic and quantum technologies. It's another sign that this field is moving rapidly from academic research to real-world products, even if they're sometimes more fun-oriented than revolutionary.

Backed by the National Science Foundation's Future of Semiconductors (FuSe) program, the Packard Fellowship, and the Catalyst Foundation, the project shows how far interdisciplinary collaboration can go. Photonics, electronics, and quantum optics are worlds apart, but this chip proves they can be brought together on a commercial platform.

If Intel's 4004 microprocessor marked the start of mass-produced computing power, this 1 mm² quantum light factory could be remembered as the first step toward mass-produced quantum hardware. What once needed an entire lab bench now fits onto a silicon wafer—and that's a leap worth paying attention to. Who knows? Maybe a decade from now, you'll be seeing a new TSMC competing for quantum computing excellence, especially now that there's already an operating system for it out there.

Dexcom has recalled its G6, G7, ONE, and ONE+ continuous glucose monitor (CGM)receivers due to a speaker malfunction that could cause missed low or high blood sugar alerts.

The recall, for which Dexcom notified customers in June, was announced by the FDA on July 17, 2025. A problem with the speaker may cause it to fail to make an alert sound for low or high blood sugar. Potential adverse effects include seizures, vomiting, loss of consciousness, or death. A total of 56 injuries have been reported but no deaths.

The recall only affects the stand-alone receiver devices not the smartphone apps or the receivers built into insulin pump devices as part of automated insulin delivery systems. The Dexcom ONE and ONE+ are only available outside the US, the FDA noted.

“In rare circumstances, certain Dexcom CGM receivers may experience issues with audio alerts and alarms due to the speaker not functioning as intended. This recall does not impact users who use Dexcom mobile apps as the display device for their glucose values, alerts, and alarms, which constitutes a majority of our users globally. For the affected receivers which have been distributed, about 700,000, the reported incidence rate is 0.015%,” a Dexcom spokesperson told Medscape Medical News.

The FDA advises that customers do the following:

“We are actively working with local regulatory agencies. If the user has an affected device, Dexcom will provide a no-cost replacement,” the Dexcom spokesperson said.

Replacing mutant microglia with healthy donor-derived microglia has emerged as a promising treatment for adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP).

In a small study of eight patients with ALSP, replacing dysfunctional microglia with normal microglia using traditional bone marrow transplantation (BMT) halted the progression of ALSP and improved neurologic function.

“The critical next step is to validate these results in a larger clinical trial, which is already underway,” principal investigator Bo Peng, PhD, professor, Institute for Translational Brain Research, Fudan University in Shanghai, China, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was published online on July 10 in Science.

ALSP is a rare, progressive neurological disease with an average age of onset of 43 years and an average life expectancy of only 3-5 years after symptoms begin. There is no cure and there are few treatments.

ALSP is caused by mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor gene (CSF1R), which is critical to development and survival of microglia. Mutations in this gene lead to microglial dysfunction and reduced numbers of these key brain immune cells.

In earlier work, Peng and his team developed mouse models of ALSP which exhibit hallmark features of the disease including reduced numbers of microglia, myelin abnormalities, axonal swelling and motor impairments, and cognitive decline.

To test whether microglial replacement could alter disease progression in mice with ALSP, the investigators tested two approaches: traditional BMT and microglia replacement by BMT, a protocol that combines pharmacological depletion of microglia with traditional BMT.

Both approaches effectively replaced mutant microglia with wild-type counterparts and successfully reversed myelin defects, axonal swellings, and motor and cognitive impairments in the animals.

To translate this to the clinic, they performed traditional BMT in eight patients with ALSP. Although traditional BMT alone typically does not achieve efficient microglia replacement in healthy brains, the inherent CSF1R deficiency in patients with ALSP creates a “competitive disadvantage” for the recipient's resident microglia, allowing traditional BMT to achieve effective replacement, the researchers wrote.

In the 2 years following microglia replacement, MRI and clinical evaluations indicated “halted disease progression, preserved motor function, and stabilized cognitive abilities,” the team reported. By contrast, untreated patients with ALSP exhibited rapid worsening of brain pathology over a shorter timeframe.

The findings in these eight patients also provide a “mechanistic explanation” for a prior clinical case in which an individual with ALSP, initially misdiagnosed with adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, exhibited long-term stabilization after traditional BMT.

“While the path forward is active with the ongoing trial, traditional BMT becoming a widely accessible ‘clinic-ready' standard treatment for ALSP is still estimated to be several years away, contingent upon successful trial outcomes, long-term safety data, and subsequent regulatory approvals,” Peng told Medscape Medical News.

Peng also said that microglia replacement “holds significant theoretical promise” for treating other neurological diseases involving microglial dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).

“Genome-wide association studies have identified TREM2 as one of the major risk genes in sporadic AD. TREM2 mutation may cause or accelerate the progression of AD. In a 2020 paper in Cell Reports, we proposed that we can replace the TREM2-mutated microglia with TREM2-normal cells to treat this disease,” Peng added.

In a Science perspective, Siling Du, PhD, and Jonathan Kipnis, PhD, with the Brain Immunology and Glia Center, Washington University in St Louis congratulated Peng and colleagues for demonstrating in humans that “correcting a microglial gene defect through cell replacement can arrest disease progression.” 

Du and Kipnis agreed that the potential implications of this research extend beyond ALSP.

For example, a recent study demonstrated that microglial replacement can also rescue pathology in a mouse model of Krabbe disease, a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding galactosylceramidase.

In addition, traditional BMT has also been shown to arrest disease progression in a mouse model of Rett syndrome — a severe neurodevelopmental condition caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2.

“Together, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of microglial replacement in modifying the course of monogenic neurological diseases,” Du and Kipnis said.

Looking ahead, they said it will be important to establish the optimal donor cell source to achieve “scalable, safe, and durable microglial replacement.”

“It is also not yet clear whether the systemic toxicity caused by pretransplant conditioning can be minimized without compromising engraftment. Future strategies must strike a balance between replacement efficiency, systemic toxicity, and the functional competence of engrafted cells,” they wrote.

“Moving forward, it may ultimately become possible to reprogram the brain's immune landscape from within and find the best microglial replacement approach not only for microgliopathies but for a spectrum of neurological diseases,” Du and Kipnis concluded.

This research had no commercial funding. Peng, Du, and Kipnis had no relevant conflicts of interest.

Most women living with HIV achieved an immunologic response after 2 years of initiating antiretroviral therapy. A higher baseline HIV viral load increased the odds of an immunologic response in women living with HIV, but this association diminished among those who acquired HIV through intravenous drug use.

“It supports earlier studies identifying the level of baseline HIV RNA viral load as an important factor and identifies the potential varying impact that HIV acquisition mode may have on this association,” the authors wrote.

“Future studies incorporating additional sex-specific factors are essential to refine our understanding and improve tailored clinical care strategies,” they added.

This study was led by Josefin Nilsson, Unit of Infectious Diseases and Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on June 12, 2025, in HIV Medicine.

This study included data only from women diagnosed after 2000. The small sample size decreased the model's power, thereby limiting the number of variables that could be included. Additionally, the study did not include information on female-specific factors, such as the use of hormonal treatments, which may have influenced immunologic response.

This study was supported by a grant from the Swedish Doctors against AIDS Research Foundation and an unrestricted Nordic Fellowship Grant from Gilead Sciences. Some authors declared receiving lecture fees or advisory board fees from various sources, including GSK/ViiV and Gilead Sciences.

Only four out of 10 patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Europe achieved successful treatment outcomes, a rate markedly lower than that for other forms of drug-resistant TB and comparable with cure rates from the pre-antibiotic era.

""[The study] findings underscore the need for improved, rapid DST [drug susceptibility testing] tools and effective, shorter treatment regimens for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Yousra Kherabi, Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France, and Ole Skouvig Pedersen, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. It was published online on July 15, 2025, in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe.

The coverage of the WHO European Region was limited. Most of the participating centres were specialist or referral centres, which may have introduced selection bias and limiting generalisability. Although the use of WHO-defined outcomes simplified data collection, it constrained a detailed understanding of treatment failures. Moreover, individual-level data were available only for patients with extensively drug-resistant TB, which may have introduced confounding from unmeasured patient-level factors.

This study did not receive any funding. One author reported serving as a co-principal investigator of clinical trials testing new regimens for multidrug-resistant TB, and some authors reported receiving honoraria for speaking engagements or serving on advisory boards of various pharmaceutical companies.

An immersive virtual reality (VR)-assisted therapy known as Challenge-VRT was associated with a greater reduction in severity and frequency of auditory verbal hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia than enhanced treatment as usual, a new randomized study showed.

“Challenge-VRT showed short-term efficacy in reducing the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia, and the findings support further development and evaluation of immersive virtual reality-based therapies in this population,” the investigators wrote.

However, Mark Hayward, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK, noted several concerns in an accompanying editorial, including about how to effectively train clinicians to deliver this therapy and why the outcomes weren't sustainable. He also questioned whether a 3D immersive environment is superior to a 2D environment, such as watching something on a computer screen.

“The findings from the Challenge trial suggest that 3D does not add value to avatar therapy. If people with psychosis who are distressed by hearing voices are to build sustainable momentum for their recovery journeys, some of the remaining questions about avatar therapy need to be addressed,” Hayward wrote.

The study was led by Lisa Charlotte Smith, PhD, Mental Health Center Copenhagen, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on July 2 in The Lancet Psychiatry.

The control group received counseling without a structured treatment manual or formal quality assessment, making direct comparison with Challenge-VRT challenging. Hospitalization data were incomplete, and frequent but undocumented technical problems with the VR system remained unassessed. Key outcome scales were also unreliable or inapplicable for subgroups. Additionally, the real-world sample underrepresented ethnic diversity, and the use of a therapist-controlled, immersive avatar raised ethical concerns about informed consent and off-session effects.

The study was funded by The Innovation Fund Denmark, Independent Research Fund Denmark, Innovation Fund North Denmark Region, Psychiatry Research Fund North Denmark Region, and The M L Jørgensen and Gunnar Hansen Fund. Four of the 13 investigators reported having financial ties and research collaborations with Heka VR, who provided the software, and other sources. Full details are provided in the original article. The other investigators and the editorialist reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Could your allergies be protecting you? This large-scale study finds a surprising link between common allergies and reduced lung cancer risk, especially for men and those with allergic rhinitis.

Review: Correlation between allergic diseases and lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Image Credit: crystal light  / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in Frontiers in Medicine, researchers examined the relationship between allergic diseases and the risk of developing lung cancer.

Allergies and cancers are increasingly recognized as major health concerns in both developing and developed countries. Lung cancer is among the most prevalent cancers worldwide, with around 2.26 million cases reported in 2019. The number of lung cancer cases and deaths has increased by 26% and 20%, respectively, between 2010 and 2019. Meanwhile, lung cancer-attributable disability-adjusted life years increased by 16%.

The relationship of allergic diseases with lung cancer risk varies by the type of allergy. For instance, a history of asthma is associated with a higher lung cancer risk, whereas a history of allergic rhinitis (AR) or eczema may reduce the risk. Asthma, although an allergic disease, was intentionally excluded from this meta-analysis to ensure methodological homogeneity and avoid confounding, given its established association with an increased risk of lung cancer.

According to one hypothesis, allergies may reduce the risk of lung cancer through increased immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immune surveillance, which may help eliminate malignant cells in their early stages. Conversely, another hypothesis suggests that chronic immune stimulation may induce random mutations in rapidly dividing cells, thereby increasing the risk of cancer.

The authors also note that allergic reactions may play a dual role, being detrimental at primary sites of inflammation but potentially protective at distant sites. An integrative hypothesis suggests that the interplay of immune surveillance, chronic inflammation, and immune skewing underlies the relationship between allergy and cancer. These hypotheses provide distinct insights into the complex relationship between allergies and cancer. Despite the increased interest, there is substantial uncertainty and contention about specific associations between AR, eczema, and lung cancer.

In the present study, researchers meta-analyzed the associations of AR and eczema with lung cancer risk. First, they conducted a systematic literature search on Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies were case-control or cohort studies assessing the association between allergic diseases and lung cancer risk.

Relevant data, including study design, geographic region, participant characteristics, and results, were extracted from the selected studies. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of studies and rate them as having low, moderate, or high quality.

The associations between allergic diseases and the risk of lung cancer were assessed using random and fixed effects models. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I-squared statistic and chi-squared test. Sensitivity analyses indicated that no single study significantly influenced the overall effect size, supporting the robustness of the findings.

The search protocol yielded 226 studies. Following deduplication, title/abstract screening, and full-text reviews, 10 studies were selected for the meta-analysis. Of these, eight were case-control studies and two were cohort studies, cumulatively encompassing over 3.8 million participants.

Sample sizes ranged between 302 and 1.74 million individuals. AR and eczema diagnoses were made through serum IgE measurements or questionnaires. Lung cancer was diagnosed through pathological histology or by using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, specifically ICD-9 or ICD-10.

Three studies were rated as of moderate quality, and seven as of high quality. The meta-analysis indicated that allergic diseases were inversely associated with the risk of lung cancer. Despite significant heterogeneity among studies, sensitivity analyses revealed that no individual study had a substantial impact on the overall effect size.

Further, subgroup analyses were performed by gender, allergy type, and geographic region. Overall, there was no significant association between eczema and the risk of lung cancer. By contrast, there was a negative correlation between AR and lung cancer risk. Specifically, allergic rhinitis was associated with 26% lower odds of lung cancer (OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64–0.86), and eczema showed no statistically significant association (OR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.51–1.06).

Further, a negative association was observed between allergic diseases and lung cancer risk in males. Notably, there was a negative correlation between eczema and lung cancer risk in males. In females, a negative correlation was observed between allergic diseases and lung cancer risk, but there was no association between AR and lung cancer risk.

In men, the odds ratio for allergic diseases and lung cancer was 0.56 (a 44% lower odds); in women, it was 0.71 (a 29% lower odds). Furthermore, seven studies conducted in the American continents found a negative correlation between AR and lung cancer risk, as well as no association between eczema and lung cancer risk.

In sum, the meta-analysis revealed that individuals with allergies had one-fourth lower odds of developing lung cancer than those without allergies. There was a significant inverse association between AR and lung cancer risk, especially in males and populations from the American continents. While there was no significant association between eczema and lung cancer risk overall, a negative association was observed in males.

The study's limitations include a small sample size, limited generalizability due to the predominantly American continent-based participant population, and potential misclassification bias resulting from the reliance on self-reported diagnoses in most studies. Most included studies diagnosed allergies using questionnaires, which may introduce recall or diagnostic bias.

Further studies are needed to uncover the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of this association. The authors highlight the need for future epidemiological research to clarify these relationships and inform risk assessment and prevention strategies.

Researchers show that specific dairy products, particularly fortified goat milk, offer superior benefits in combating muscle wasting and inflammation in aging mice, pointing to new dietary strategies for healthier aging.

Study: Four Dairy Products Mitigates Sarcopenia in Mice by Modulating Muscle Inflammation, Autophagy, and Protein Degradation. Image Credit: StockMediaSeller / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Food Science & Nutrition journal, researchers used murine models to investigate whether four everyday dairy products, specifically variants of goat and bovine milk, could delay the progression of sarcopenia—the age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and function.

Study findings reveal that mice fed dairy-enriched diets exhibited reduced markers of muscle inflammation and improved muscle fiber integrity. This suggests that daily consumption of dairy products may support muscle health by modulating inflammatory and immune pathways. However, the effects vary significantly depending on the type and composition of dairy products.

Sarcopenia is a stealthy yet debilitating consequence of aging, clinically characterized as the progressive loss of strength, muscle mass, and function leading to frailty, falls, and increased healthcare costs. The condition is emerging as a severe public health concern in today's rapidly aging population, with 10–27% of the global population estimated to live with the disease.

Current prevention strategies include supervised resistance exercises and high-protein diets to slow the progression of the condition. Dairy products, in particular, are gaining considerable attention, with the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia recommending their consumption to sarcopenia patients.

Unfortunately, these recommendations are based exclusively on dairy's reputation as a source of high-quality protein and its observed benefits in general age-associated health outcomes, primarily due to its vitamin D and calcium content. The direct benefits of dairy on muscle mass and function, as well as the mechanisms by which its products promote healthy muscle metabolism, remain unverified.

A handful of recent studies suggest that fermented dairy products contain bioactive peptides with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. To simultaneously elucidate the role of dairy products in sarcopenia outcomes and investigate the mechanisms of their action, the present study leverages animal (aging mice) model systems to explore the impacts of consuming four specific dairy products on muscle integrity, inflammation, mitochondrial function, and relative muscle-degradation-associated gene expression.

The model system consisted of SPF C57BL/6 mice (n = 60, sex = male, age = 8 months) randomly assigned to six experimental groups (each n = 10): 1. NC (normal control), 2. SOP (sarcopenia control), 3. GWM (goat whole milk), 4. GLM (goat low-fat milk), 5. GFM (goat fortified vitamin D and calcium low-fat milk), and 6. BWM (bovine whole milk). The NC group was administered 5 mg/kg saline intraperitoneally for 8 weeks. All other groups were administered dexamethasone for the same duration as a means of artificially inducing sarcopenia.

Outcomes of interest included grip strength (measured using a grip strength meter), weight (fat and lean), bone mineral density (dual-energy X-ray absorption [DXA]), autophagy (western blotting), muscle morphology, host metabolism (XploreMet platform), inflammation, and gut microbial health (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing).

Statistical analyses included confirmations of sample homogeneity and normality, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for reporting multigroup comparisons, least significant difference (LSD) test for reporting pairwise comparisons, and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis for gut microbiotal evaluations. Gut microbiota function was predicted using the KEGG and PICRUSt2 pathway libraries. The outcomes of metabolomic assays were elucidated using univariate analyses and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA).

At study initiation (baseline), all sarcopenia (non-NC group) mice demonstrated reduced grip strength and lean weight. Dairy supplementation alleviated the latter concern (all dairy products caused a surge in lean weight) but did not significantly address the former. Critically, only goat milk products (not bovine) significantly reduced fat weight.

Molecular investigations revealed that all dairy products impacted sarcopenia through similar mechanisms: activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, with low-fat goat milk (GLM/GFM) showing stronger mTOR activation; enhancement of muscle regeneration; reduced AMPK phosphorylation; and upregulated MyoG expression, specifically in GFM-supplemented mice (fortified goat low-fat milk). GFM-supplemented mice notably demonstrated the highest MyoG expression levels of the dairy products tested. Only GFM restored both MyoD1 and MyoG expression, while the others restored only MyoD1.

Autophagy investigations presented a similar picture, with all dairy products promoting autophagy through increased LC3B expression and decreased p62 levels. However, low-fat goat milk (GLM) showed the most substantial reduction in p62 levels. Dairy products were also observed to benefit inflammation marker profiles, with significant reductions in CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and CXCL10 levels compared to SOP controls.

Gut microbial investigations revealed that all dairy products promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria, especially those from the genus Leuconostoc. Goat's milk (but not bovine milk) further enriched Acinetobacter and Lactococcus populations. Most importantly, mice supplemented with GLM and GFM showed increased densities of S. sciuri. S. sciuri may contribute to muscle health benefits, suggesting low-fat goat's milk variants as promising candidates in non-invasive sarcopenia interventions. A novel ""dairy-microbial score"" revealed that GLM and GFM had significantly higher beneficial microbial profiles compared to whole goat milk, correlating with lower fat mass. Metabolomics revealed leucine enrichment in the GFM groups, which was negatively associated with the dairy-microbial score.

Bone mineral density improved with GWM, GFM, and BWM, but not GLM, underscoring composition-dependent effects.

This study presents promising evidence that regular consumption of dairy products, particularly low-fat goat milk fortified with vitamin D and calcium (GFM), could help delay or prevent sarcopenia by reducing inflammation and supporting muscle regeneration. While findings are currently limited to animal models, they underscore the importance of dairy composition (source, fat content, fortification) and frequent consumption in shaping long-term muscle health.

Scientists uncover how zebrafish switch between cell division and direct differentiation to rebuild sensory organs, challenging long-held views on tissue regeneration.

 Study: Stem and progenitor cell proliferation are independently regulated by cell type-specific cyclinD genes. Image Credit: Anusorn Nakdee / Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in the USA investigated the mechanisms by which stem cell genes modulate regeneration in zebrafish lateral line neuromasts (sensory organs). Specifically, the study leveraged cutting-edge CRISPR gene editing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and live imaging to investigate how two distinct cyclin D genes, ccndx and ccnd2a, regulate distinct cell populations during the development and regeneration of these sensory organs.

Study findings reveal that ccndx and ccnd2a function via independent yet complementary pathways – the former modulates the division of progenitor cells, while the latter drives the amplification of stem cell proliferation. Even when one pathway is lost, the other can partially compensate, but regeneration proceeds via a limited and less robust mechanism. For example, in ccndx mutants, direct differentiation can generate hair cells without division; however, fewer cells and a pronounced polarity defect occur, with approximately 70% of regenerated hair cells exhibiting a posterior bias. This polarity defect is mechanistically linked to reduced expression of hes2.2, which normally inhibits Emx2, a master regulator of hair cell polarity. Together, these genes ensure robust tissue maintenance, offering new therapeutic directions for sensory regeneration research.

Tissue turnover and regeneration are fundamental processes essential for maintaining life. These constantly occurring processes rely on delicate balances between populations of stem cells, which gradually replenish themselves over time, and progenitor cells, which mature into specialized forms in response to physiological requirements.

Decades of research have revealed that cyclin D proteins, known primarily for their crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression, have substantial modulatory effects on cell proliferation. Unfortunately, the mechanistic associations between specific stem cell populations and cyclin D protein use remain poorly understood. Unraveling these associations may open the door to novel regenerative therapies, especially relevant in today's increasingly aging global population, which is experiencing a decline in sensory ability.

Recent research aims to leverage the zebrafish, a well-studied model organism renowned for its regenerative capabilities, to answer this question. In particular, the zebrafish's sensory lateral line is known to regenerate cells rapidly following injury. This line consists of hair, support, and mantle cells, essential for detecting water movement. Given their functional analogy to the human inner ear, these models are used to gain a better understanding of sensory regeneration.

The present study utilized several transgenic zebrafish larval strains to elucidate the mechanisms underlying regeneration in the lateral line sensory system. The study focuses on two cyclin D genes: ccndx and ccnd2a.

By leveraging CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a gene editing, transgenic zebrafish with ccndx and/or ccnd2a knocked out were then observed (via scRNA-seq) to elucidate their differences in gene expression and cell states. These assays were replicated over 10,000 cells and were complemented by RNA velocity modeling using the scVelo and partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) algorithms.

Researchers began by treating zebrafish larvae with neomycin, an antibiotic (ototoxin) that triggers rapid hair death (and subsequent regeneration) along the lateral line organ. Observation via single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) assays in combination with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling and time-lapse imaging (Nikon Ti2 Eclipse; 42 hours at 28.5 °C) resulted in the identification of two proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression-marked cell populations, one governed by ccndx and the other by ccnd2a.

Finally, protein modeling using the Robetta and Mol*3D Viewer platforms was conducted to compare the structural conservation of cyclin D proteins across transgenic zebrafish species. Statistical analyses comprised analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests for inter-treatment difference significant reporting (p < 0.05).

Neomycin treatment assays revealed the presence of two independent cell populations involved in neuromast regeneration. scRNA-seq analysis revealed these populations: 1. Self-renewing amplifying stem cell populations that express ccnd2a, and 2. Progenitor cells that mature into sensory hair cells that express ccndx.

Notably, ccndx knockout strains demonstrated hair regeneration even in the absence of ccndx expression. Still, these hair cells were often misoriented, possibly because of altered hes2.2 and emx2 activity (genes involved in hair cell polarity). Importantly, expressing ccnd2a under the ccndx promoter, an artificial genetic rescue, was able to restore both the number and orientation of hair cells in ccndx-mutants (p < 0.0001), marking a mechanistic demonstration rather than a physiological compensation.

In contrast, ccnd2a-deficient mutants showed reduced amplifying stem cell proliferation during development, but regeneration was less affected, suggesting that other cyclins can compensate during tissue repair, without inducing polarity defects. Specifically, the study reports upregulation of ccnd1 during regeneration in ccnd2a mutants, potentially compensating for the loss of ccnd2a function (Supplementary Fig. 5N–P). This independent regulation suggests sensory regeneration can occur even if one population (pathway) is compromised. For example, five days post-fertilization (dpf), ccndx mutants showed significantly reduced EdU+ differentiating progenitor cells compared to their wild-type siblings (p = 0.0001), while amplifying cell counts remained unchanged (p = 0.35).

This finding that zebrafish hair cells can regenerate through direct differentiation without progenitor proliferation represents a paradigm shift in regenerative biology, challenging the long-standing view that proliferation is essential for tissue regeneration.

Finally, this study revealed the importance of ‘Notch signaling' in sensory regeneration. This highly conserved cell-to-cell communication pathway, essential for development and tissue homeostasis, was found to suppress ccndx expression, with its inhibition leading to increased progenitor proliferation only in ccndx-intact fish, thereby confirming a tight regulatory loop between Notch activity, cyclin D expression, and regeneration capacity.

This study represents a significant advance in our understanding of regenerative biology, demonstrating for the first time that, contrary to prior assumptions, all proliferating cells in regenerative tissues are not regulated similarly. It highlights the future importance of tailored cell cycle regulation, leveraging both ccndx and ccnd2a for optimal sensory regeneration outcomes.

These findings could accelerate the development of therapies in regenerative medicine. However, it is important to note that ccndx is absent in mammals, so these findings are directly applicable only to non-mammalian species. As with all basic science studies in animal models, findings should be considered in the context of zebrafish biology, and their applicability to humans will require further research.

What makes the human brain distinctive? A new study published July 21 in Cell identifies two genes linked to human brain features and provides a road map to discover many more. The research could lead to insights into the functioning and evolution of the human brain, as well as the roots of language disorders and autism.

The newly characterized genes are found among the ""dark matter"" of the human genome: regions of DNA that contain a lot of duplicated or repeat sequences, making them difficult to study until recently. If assembling a DNA sequence is like putting together a book from torn-up pages, reconstructing it from repeat sequences would be like trying to match pages using only words like ""and"" and ""the."" There are many opportunities for mismatches and overlap.

Although difficult to study, DNA repeats are also thought to be important for evolution as they can generate new versions of existing genes for selection to act on.

""Historically, this has been a very challenging problem. People don't know where to start,"" said senior author Megan Dennis, associate director of genomics at the UC Davis Genome Center and associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and MIND Institute at the University of California, Davis.

In 2022, Dennis was a coauthor on a paper describing the first sequence of a complete human genome, known as the 'telomere to telomere' reference genome. This referencencludes the difficult regions that had been left out of the first draft published in 2001 and is now being used to make new discoveries.

Dennis and colleagues used the telomere-to-telomere human genome to identify duplicated genes. Then, they sorted those for genes that are: expressed in the brain; found in all humans, based on sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project; and conserved, meaning that they did not show much variation among individuals.

They came out with about 250 candidate gene families. Of these, they picked some for further study in an animal model, the zebrafish. By both deleting genes and introducing human-duplicated genes into zebrafish, they showed that at least two of these genes might contribute to features of the human brain: one called GPR89B led to slightly bigger brain size, and another, FRMPD2B, led to altered synapse signaling.

It's pretty cool to think that you can use fish to test a human brain trait.""

Megan Dennis, associate director of genomics, UC Davis Genome Center and associate professor, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and MIND Institute, University of California, Davis

The dataset in the Cell paper is intended to be a resource for the scientific community, Dennis said. It should make it easier to screen duplicated regions for mutations, for example related to language deficits or autism, that have been missed in previous genome-wide screening.

""It opens up new areas,"" Dennis said.

New research reveals that mind-body exercise, such as tai chi and yoga, surpasses other workouts in reversing frailty and enhancing daily function for seniors, offering a cost-effective strategy for healthier aging worldwide.

 Study: Mind-body training outperforms other physical activities in reducing frailty and enhancing quality of life in older adults: a network meta-analysis. Image Credit: PeopleImages.com - Yuri A / Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in the Frontiers in Public Health, researchers compare the impact of mind‑body, aerobic, strength, and mixed exercise programs on frailty, daily function, and quality of life (QoL) in older adults.

Current estimates suggest that up to 25% of older adults live with frailty, which is characterized by declining strength, slowed gait, and poor endurance. As the global population continues to age, the prevalence of frailty will continue to rise and negatively impact the lives of community-dwelling older adults, particularly those residing in low- and middle-income countries.

To date, numerous studies have confirmed the benefits associated with physical activity or regular exercise for building resilience to both prevent and reverse frailty. Despite these observations, it remains unclear whether certain physical activity modalities may be more effective in reducing frailty outcomes than others. To this end, the researchers of the current study compared the effects of mind-body training, aerobic training, strength training, and mixed physical activities on frailty, quality of life (QoL), and activities of daily living (ADLs).

The researchers of the current study reviewed a total of 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that collectively enrolled 2,905 community-dwelling adults, with a mean age of 72 years, 66% of whom were women. The median duration of the study interventions was 18 weeks with two- to seven-hour-long sessions.

Frailty was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) or Fried phenotype, whereas ADL was quantified using the Barthel Index or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). QoL of the study participants was determined using standardized instruments including the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), SF-12, SF-8, and EuroQol-5 Dimension (Eq-5D).

Mind-body training was associated with the most significant reduction in frailty as compared to controls, who exhibited the least improvement. Thereafter, mixed physical activity also improved frailty outcomes, whereas aerobic and strength training provided less significant improvements.

Overall, mind-body training was considered to be 81% more effective in ameliorating frailty in older adults than all other interventions. Mind-body training also led to the most effective QoL improvements as compared to the other exercise interventions.

Compared to aerobic training, aerobic training was associated with more significant improvements in ADLs in up to 74% of cases. Nevertheless, both mind-body training and mixed physical activity similarly improved ADLs, with a modest impact associated with strength training as compared to controls.

The subgroup analyses demonstrated that the efficacy of community programs was similar to that associated with hospital interventions, which supports a shift in policy toward local delivery. Mind-body training sessions of 50‑60 minutes at least three times every week were associated with the greatest improvements.

The observed improvements in frailty measurements persisted across continents, economic strata, and baseline fitness, which confirms the generalizability of this approach. Cost modeling indicated that each quality‑adjusted life year (QALY) gained through mind-body training was one‑third of the price of current pharmacological fall‑prevention programs. Taken together, exercise emerges as a low‑risk pathway to resilience in aging.

Mind-body training emerged as most effective in alleviating frailty and enhancing overall quality of life, making it particularly suitable for severely frail individuals with restricted mobility.”

Exercise modality is a key factor in determining the prescription of movement medicine for seniors. Mind‑body training was associated with consistent and significant improvements in both frailty and QoL outcomes, whereas aerobic workouts are ideal for preserving daily independence. Importantly, mixed physical activity and strength training also offer complementary benefits.

The effects of these exercise modalities exceed clinically meaningful levels, can be easily incorporated into community settings, and are considered both safe and cost‑efficient. The study findings indicate that practitioners should prioritize one-hour sessions that incorporate both mindfulness and exertion with a frequency of at least three sessions each week. Policymakers can invest confidently in local mind‑body sessions, while researchers are encouraged to continue assessing adherence, biological pathways, and cost‑effectiveness.

Gaining insights into the complex pathways and key cell populations involved in immune dysregulation can aid the development of therapeutic approaches to treat polytrauma, which is associated with poor patient outcomes. In a new study, researchers from the USA have utilized advanced genetic analysis tools and techniques to reveal the cellular and molecular processes involved in polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation. Their findings advance our current knowledge on polytrauma and indicate actionable targets to treat immune dysregulation.

Polytrauma, which involves multiple serious injuries occurring simultaneously, is associated with complex healing challenges. In such cases, bone regeneration is often compromised, accompanied by widespread immune system dysregulation. These effects may not surface immediately, but they commonly emerge later in recovery, contributing to increased treatment burden and poorer long-term outcomes.

While the immune system plays a crucial role in healing, its dysfunction in polytrauma remains poorly understood. Previous studies have explored immune activity either at the injury site or within systemic tissues like blood and bone marrow. However, an integrated analysis of both local and systemic immune responses is essential to fully understand how immune dysregulation impairs recovery.

To address this gap, a team of researchers led by Professor Krishnendu Roy, Bruce and Bridgitt Evans Dean of Engineering at Vanderbilt University, conducted a comprehensive study using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The research team, based at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, collaborated with Professor Robert Guldberg from the Department of Bioengineering and Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact at the University of Oregon. This work was supported by a National Institutes of Health grant (R01AR074960). Their findings were published online in Bone Research on 07 July, 2025.

""Previously, our research group had developed a preclinical rat model of polytrauma that could mimic severe musculoskeletal trauma along with the associated local and systemic immune responses. In this study, we utilized cells from the polytrauma rat model and subjected them to scRNA-seq analysis to comprehensively assess the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive immune dysregulation in polytrauma"", says Prof. Roy, sharing further details about the study.

The team combined scRNA-seq with differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and the CellChat tool to identify the key immune cells involved. Their analysis revealed a prominent role of myeloid cells—a type of white blood cell—in shaping immune responses across the blood, bone marrow, and injured tissue.

Building on their previous findings linking systemic immunosuppressive myeloid cells with poor bone healing outcomes, the researchers sub-clustered the blood polytrauma myeloid cells into five distinct groups to identify those expressing immunosuppressive genes such as interleukins-4 (IL-4), IL-13, and IL-10. The clusters expressing these immunosuppressive genes were designated as trauma immunosuppressive myeloid (TIM) cells. Further DEG analysis revealed that TIM cells from polytrauma patients significantly expressed additional immunosuppressive genes, including annexin A1 (Anxa1) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2).

To decipher the pathways used by TIM cells to communicate with other myeloid cells, the team assessed ligand-receptor interactions using CellChat tool. Their analysis revealed that TIM cells were dependent on chemokine pathway involving Ccl6-Ccr1 and immunosuppressive Anxa1-Fpr2 mechanisms to communicate with other cells in polytrauma blood.

In the local injury site tissue affected during polytrauma, mono/mac cells demonstrated increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes including secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), fibronectin 1 (FN1), and Anxa2. Interestingly, the mono/mac cells showed reduced expression of tissue repair genes following polytrauma. By utilizing an integrated all-tissue dataset, the research team further discovered 15 closely connected hub genes which could potentially regulate polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation.

The altered communication patterns in polytrauma reveal the critical role of myeloid cell interactions, with TIM cells involved in immune suppression while mono/mac cells drive inflammatory pathways. Future studies can build on our findings to develop targeted strategies to modulate immune responses, reduce complications, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes in patients with polytrauma. Towards that goal, a multi-site clinical study to risk stratify patients with open tibial fractures has been initiated by Prof. Guldberg and colleagues.

In summary, this study not only advances our current understanding of complex immune interactions following polytrauma but also provides actionable targets for therapeutic intervention.

Scientists have discovered that tiny RNA molecules in sperm could hold the key to choosing the healthiest embryos and improving IVF outcomes, potentially transforming the future of fertility treatments.

Study: Small RNA in sperm–Paternal contributions to human embryo development. Image credit: Rohane Hamilton/Shutterstock.com

The male human gamete carries the haploid paternal genome and regulatory small RNA (sRNA) to the ovum. The involvement of sRNA in fertilization and embryonic development is unclear. A recent paper appeared in Nature Communications, exploring the contribution of sRNA to human fertility.

With infertility rates soaring, one in six couples of reproductive age are now unable to have children without assisted reproduction technology (ART). These include procedures like in vitro fertilization (IVF), responsible for approximately 12 million births annually.

The success rate of IVF (live births per cycle) stands at about 30%, mainly because over 70% of treatment cycles result in mostly poor-quality embryos. The contribution of sperm-related genetic factors to IVF outcomes remains relatively unknown, prompting the current investigation.

Small RNAs are short molecules of RNA with lengths within a few hundred nucleotides. Subtypes of sRNA include:

These were independently analyzed to examine their role in IVF success.

The study included 69 couples undergoing IVF from November 2022 to June 2023 at a single ART center in Linköping, Sweden. The median age for men and women was 34 and 33 years, respectively, and the median body mass index (BMI) was 27 kg/m2 and 25 kg/m2, respectively.

Sperm concentration and progressive motility are two key parameters indicating semen quality. Here, the median for sperm concentration was 28 million sperm/mL, and progressive motility was 50%.

When comparing sperm samples with high (>16 million/mL) and low (<16 million/mL) sperm concentrations, about 1.9% of sRNAs were found to be more highly expressed in the high concentration group. In contrast, 2.1% were downregulated compared to the low concentration group.

MitosRNA made up 72% of the upregulated sRNA. In contrast, nearly half (48%) of the downregulated sRNA was ribonucleoprotein-associated sRNA, mainly Y-RNA.

Upregulated mitosRNA came from mitochondrial tRNA genes. In particular, the MT-TS1-Ser1 sRNA had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89, indicating its ability to differentiate high from low sperm concentration. Previous studies have associated these mitosRNA with nutrient sensing and metabolic programming, although their causal role in humans remains under investigation.

Downregulated sRNA mapped most significantly to Y-RNA with an AUC of 0.85. Both are therefore biomarkers capable of distinguishing sperm samples by high or low concentration

When examining sRNA profiles in sperm samples with high vs low progressive motility ( ≥ 5 million progressively motile sperm), half of the differentially expressed sRNA overlapped with those associated with sperm concentration.

A further comparison of sRNA was made using samples that showed high and low fertilization rates (≥70% vs <70%, respectively). Here, 0.11% of sRNA was expressed at reduced levels in samples with low fertilization rates, whereas the other samples had no significant differential expression.

There were 34 sperm-associated sRNA sequences that predicted a low fertilization rate, all from a single region of the genome. However, these sequences only weakly predicted fertilization outcome (AUC 0.58), and the authors note that more data and further validation are required before these findings can be applied clinically.  

Finally, sperm samples were categorized as likely to produce high- vs low-quality embryos (≥20% vs <20%, respectively). The high-quality samples were associated with 60 upregulated sRNA (0.2%) vs 104 (0.4%) downregulated sRNA.

The most represented subtype was microRNA (miRNA), which predicted a higher-quality embryo. The miRNA was predicted to target multiple developmental processes involved in embryogenesis, development, or cell proliferation.

Of particular interest was hsa-let-7g expression, with an AUC of 0.8 after excluding one outlier. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that this gene family regulates growth in embryonic and postnatal life via insulin-mediated effects. The study notes, however, that a causal relationship between these miRNAs and human embryo quality is not established, and further functional studies are needed.

Conversely, higher levels of 28s rRNA in sperm were associated with the production of significantly fewer high-quality embryos.

Thus, different sRNA was increased or decreased with specific sperm sample parameters, forming unique RNA profiles linked to each parameter: sperm concentration, fertilization, and embryo quality. The miRNA carried by sperm appears to influence embryo development and predict embryo quality heavily.

In mice, sperm-borne miRNA is crucial for preimplantation embryonic development. Whether this is also true in humans remains unclear, and functional studies will be required to answer this question.

Additionally, the study briefly explores whether sperm sRNA profiles correlated with live birth, gestational age, or newborn size for gestational age. Some associations were observed, but these results were preliminary and based on small numbers, so further research is needed to confirm the clinical significance.

The authors acknowledge that separating the influence of paternal sRNA from maternal factors, such as age and BMI, is challenging, and that larger cohorts and functional studies are necessary to validate these biomarkers before they can be used in clinical settings.

“Sperm-borne sRNA are biomarkers for sperm concentration and embryo quality in IVF. Our work highlights the paternal role in IVF success and establishes a foundation for a new era in reproductive medicine.”

These results could help distinguish high from poor embryo quality, potentially promoting cost-effectiveness in IVF and reducing the number of cycles required to achieve the desired outcomes. However, further research and clinical validation are needed before these findings can be implemented in routine practice.

Scientists show that lamb-infused hummus packs more protein, iron, and flavor while staying fresher, offering flexitarians and athletes a nutrient-rich twist on the classic dip.

Study: Physicochemical, Nutritional, and Structural Characterization of a Novel Meat-Based Hummus. Image credit: Elena.Katkova/Shutterstock.com

A recent Foods study assessed the physicochemical, nutritional, and structural characteristics of meat-based hummus prepared by incorporating 50% cooked minced mutton along with 0.4% sodium acid sulphate (SAS), a U.S. FDA “Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) additive and EPA-designated “Safer Choice” antimicrobial.

Hummus is a traditional Middle Eastern chickpea-based delicacy with a rich flavor and nutritional profile. However, ready-to-eat hummus can be high in sodium, which may contribute to elevated blood pressure and increased cardiovascular risk. A second concern with ready-to-eat hummus is its allergenicity. Allergens such as wheat gluten may provoke mild to severe allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.

The bioavailability of nutrients such as iron, vitamin B12, and zinc, used to fortify commercially available ready-to-eat hummus, is often lower than that from animal sources. Furthermore, the quantity of fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs) in chickpeas is high, which may lead to discomfort from gas and bloating in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. Hummus has also been linked to food safety issues; between 2002 and 2017, 17 outbreaks of foodborne illness in the U.S. were associated with hummus, underscoring its vulnerability to pathogens like Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria. This stimulated research into developing a meat-based hummus.

Red meat is a rich source of bioavailable heme iron and vitamin B12, which is particularly important for children, pregnant women, athletes, and the elderly. Combining legumes and meat could offer a nutritionally richer meal, blending fiber and phytochemicals with absorbable minerals and complete amino acids.

The present study aims to assess a novel formulation of meat-based hummus, using SAS as a natural preservative. Legs from three lambs were used with an approximate lean level of 85%. Chickpea seeds were soaked in water overnight and then cooked in a pressure cooker for 25–30 minutes. Pre-weighed quantities of all ingredients, i.e., pressure-cooked lamb, cooked chickpeas, olive oil, tahini, salt, lemon juice, freshly minced garlic, and water, were blended into a smooth paste. Granules of antimicrobial SAS were also added to the paste. The granules of SAS were pulverized and evenly mixed to ensure uniform distribution.

The meat-based hummus (50% chickpeas and 50% minced lamb) with 0.4% SAS as a preservative was compared to the traditional hummus with no SAS or minced lamb. In addition to the pH, the microbiological quality was assessed using the total plate count (TPC) on day 0 and day 7. To analyze color, L* (lightness indicator), a* (redness indicator), and b* (yellowness indicator) values were noted. The prepared hummus also underwent nutritional and sensory evaluation.

The pH of the meat-based hummus was comparatively lower than that of the traditional hummus, which could be due to the acidic influence of SAS. In traditional hummus, b* and L* values were higher than meat-based hummus, possibly driven by the natural pigmentation from chickpea starch and leguminous fibers. The myoglobin content of lamb could partially explain the darker hue of meat-based hummus. Redness values were similar between the two types of hummus.

TPC was similar at day 0; however, on day 7, TPC was significantly lower in the meat-based hummus. This highlighted SAS's antimicrobial action on microorganisms over the storage period. Meat-based hummus showed a 12.5% increase in total calories, 20% increase in total fat, and 66.6% increase in protein, relative to traditional hummus. The former also had higher amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat.

Meat-based hummus contained heme iron, which is more bioavailable than the non-heme iron in chickpeas, even though total iron content was similar (1 mg per serving). Traditional hummus also provides higher total carbohydrates and calcium, and lower sodium. Meat-based hummus had a modest sodium increase (150 mg vs. 130 mg per serving), partly from SAS and meat's intrinsic sodium.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed fundamental physicochemical contrasts between traditional and meat-based hummus. The former showed a porous, open network structure with loosely bound particles and irregular voids. The consistency was gel-like and spreadable, potentially driven by starches, polysaccharides, and soluble fibers. In contrast, meat-based hummus showed a fibrous, compact, and densely structured matrix. There were fewer voids and tightly bound protein aggregates, potentially because of cross-linked muscle fibers and acid-induced protein gelation from SAS.

Concerning sensory scores, there was no difference between traditional and meat-based hummus in appearance and color. The grain properties, flavor, creaminess, and mouth-coating scores for meat-based hummus were higher. The higher sensory score of meat-based hummus could be attributed to the fatty acid content of lamb and the umami profile.

The results documented in this study highlight that while traditional hummus has more carbohydrates, calcium, and fiber, meat-based hummus contains a higher amount of fat, protein, saturated fat, and bioavailable iron content. It also has slightly higher sodium and cholesterol, which should be considered by individuals monitoring these nutrients. In terms of flavor, creaminess, and overall acceptability, meat-based hummus scored higher than traditional hummus.

In sum, the results suggest that flexitarians could benefit from the development of food products that combine meat- and plant-based ingredients. Meat-based hummus supports growth and muscle recovery, and could be beneficial for athletes, young children, and women with higher nutritional requirements. However, the study notes that future research with larger sensory panels and longer storage testing is needed to confirm its shelf stability and broad consumer acceptance.

Albizzia julibrissin is a widely distributed plant in China. Its dried stem bark has been used in traditional oriental medicine to treat insomnia, diuresis, sthenia, ascaricide, and confusion. Phytochemical investigations on the components of the stem bark of Albizzia julibrissin resulted in the isolation of saponins, lignans, phenolic glycosides, triterpenes, flavonoids, and others. The bioactive ingredients from Albizzia julibrissin have been reported for their medicinal activities such as anti-tumor, inhibitory effect of diarrhoea, and a sedative activity. Nonetheless, to date, literature on polysaccharide as an important component of Chinese herbal remains scarce, particularly in the case of polysaccharide in Albizzia julibrissin.

In the recent study published in Glycoscience & Therapy, a team of researchers in China extracted a novel polysaccharide fraction, AJDW, from Albizia julibrissin (AJD). It is composed of glucose, galactose, xylose, arabinose (with a molar ratio of 7.36: 9.03: 7.06: 2.24: 1).

To our knowledge, this is the first report about the condition of polysaccharide extracted from AJD. We demonstrated that AJDW could inhibit the growth and proliferation of pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo. Notably, this polysaccharide suppressed pancreatic cancer migration, blocked cell cycle and induced ROS-mediated apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential linked to PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.""

Fei He, co-corresponding author 

Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignant tumor with poor prognosis, and most of the current chemotherapeutic agents are prone to drug resistance and have extreme side effects. Many studies have reported that polysaccharides can exert effective anti-tumor activity and have a promising safety. Hence, the discovery of polysaccharides with anti-pancreatic cancer activity is in clinical demand.

""In our work, patient-derived xenografted mice model was constructed, and AJDW would completely impede pancreatic cancer growth in nude mice, which was matched with the anti-pancreatic cancer activity in cellular level."" Adds She. ""Our findings not only showed the novel polysaccharide compound in Chinese herbal AJD, but also revealed its anti-pancreatic cancer effect.""

This discovery provides the material and theoretical basis for the potential anti-tumor effect of AJD, further facilitating the development of new anti-pancreatic cancer drugs based on natural ingredients.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Genetic analysis reveals early childhood markers for obesity risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250721/Genetic-analysis-reveals-early-childhood-markers-for-obesity-risk.aspx","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 11:33:00 GMT","

A new genetic analysis using data from over five million people has provided a clearer understanding of the risk of going on to live with obesity. New research led by the Universities of Copenhagen and Bristol shows analyzing genes at a young age may support early strategies to prevent obesity developing later in life.

The World Obesity Federation expects more than half the global population to become overweight or obese by 2035. However, treatment strategies such as lifestyle change, surgery and medications are not universally available or effective.

By drawing on genetic data from over five million people, an international team of researchers, have created a measure called a polygenic risk score (PGS) that is reliably associated with adulthood obesity and shows consistent and indicative patterns in early childhood. The findings could help to identify children and adolescents at higher genetic risk of developing obesity in later life, who could benefit from targeted preventative strategies, such as lifestyle interventions, at a younger age.

""What makes the score so powerful is the consistency of associations between the genetic score and body mass index before the age of five and through to adulthood – timing that starts well before other risk factors start to shape their weight later in childhood. Intervening at this point could theoretically make a huge impact,"" said Assistant Professor Roelof Smit at the University of Copenhagen and lead author of the research published in the journal Nature Medicine.

The subtle variations in people's genomes can have a real impact on health when acting together. Thousands of genetic variants have been identified that increase the risk of obesity, for example, variants that act in the brain and influence appetite. A PGS is like a calculator that combines the effects of the different risk variants that a person carries and provides an overall score. The PGS was able to explain almost a fifth (17%) of a person's variation in body mass index – much higher than in previous studies.

To create these PGS, the scientists drew on the genetic data of more than five million people – the largest and most diverse genetic dataset ever – including genetic data from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium and consumer DNA testing firm, 23andMe. The researchers then tested whether their new PGS was associated with obesity using datasets of the physical and genetic characteristics of more than 500,000 people, including BMI data tracked over time from the Children of the 90s study. They found that their new PGS was twice as effective as the previous best method at predicting a person's risk of developing obesity.

Obesity is a major public health issue, with many factors contributing to its development, including genetics, environment, lifestyle and behaviour. These factors likely vary across a person's life, and we believe that some of these originate in childhood.

We were delighted to contribute data from the Children of the 90s study to this exceptional and insightful research into the genetic architecture of obesity. We hope this work will contribute to detecting individuals at high risk of developing obesity at an earlier age, which could have a vast clinical and public health impact in the future.""

Dr. Kaitlin Wade, Associate Professor in Epidemiology, University of Bristol and second author on this paper 

The research team also investigated the relationship between a person's genetic risk of obesity and the impact of lifestyle weight loss interventions, such as diet and exercise. They discovered that people with a higher genetic risk of obesity were more responsive to interventions but also regained weight more quickly when the interventions ended.

Despite drawing on the genomes of a wider population, the new PGS has its limitations. For example, it was far better at predicting obesity in people with European-like ancestry than in people with African ancestry. This flags the need for work like this in more representative groups.

As the aging population grows, could your supplement routine help combat muscle and bone decline? This new review highlights which emerging options hold real promise, and where science still needs to catch up.

Review: Beyond Calcium and Vitamin D: Exploring Creatine, β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, Prebiotics and Probiotics in Osteosarcopenia. Image Credit: Evgeniy Lee / Shutterstock

In a recent review article published in the journal Nutrients, researchers investigated the effectiveness of emerging nutritional supplements, including prebiotics, probiotics, and creatine, in improving muscle and bone health in older individuals with osteosarcopenia.

They concluded that novel supplements have the potential to play a significant role in nutritional interventions aimed at improving bone and muscle composition and enhancing physical function in older adults. However, further research is needed to determine their efficacy and identify which populations benefit most. The review also highlights that agents affecting bile acid metabolism are an emerging area of interest within the gut–bone–muscle axis.

Osteosarcopenia is a growing health concern among older adults, defined by the combined presence of osteoporosis (weakened bone structure and low bone density) and sarcopenia (muscle loss with age).

As the global elderly population is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2050, the prevalence of osteosarcopenia is likely to increase, making it an urgent public health issue.

Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures, particularly in older adults who are also more prone to falls. Sarcopenia contributes to loss of muscle strength and physical function, and there is currently no approved medication to treat it.

When these two conditions occur together, they amplify each other's adverse effects, increasing the risks of death, falls, and disability.

The biological mechanisms behind osteosarcopenia are complex. Shared risk factors such as impaired protein metabolism, hormonal changes, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation contribute to the deterioration of both bone and muscle.

Evidence suggests that bone and muscle communicate through biochemical signals, such as myokines (from muscle) and osteokines (from bone), and through mechanical interactions. Therefore, interventions targeting one tissue may also benefit the other.

Standard management typically includes physical activity and sufficient intake of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. However, emerging research suggests that novel supplements, such as hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB), creatine, probiotics, prebiotics, and compounds that influence bile acid metabolism, may offer additional benefits.

These may include lowering inflammation, reducing fall risk, and enhancing muscle mass and strength.

The gut–bone–muscle axis highlights the impact of gut microbiota on osteosarcopenia. Arrows indicate interactions. ↑ indicates an increase; ↓ indicates a decrease. (created in https://BioRender.com).

Creatine is a compound vital for energy production, especially in muscles and the brain. While the body produces some creatine, dietary sources, mainly fish and meat, are essential. Older adults often consume less creatine, making supplementation a potentially beneficial option.

Research indicates that creatine, particularly when combined with resistance training, enhances muscle mass, strength, and function in older individuals, thereby reducing fall risk and improving mobility.

Creatine also supports bone health by enhancing osteoblast activity and reducing bone breakdown; however, recent studies suggest no significant increase in bone mineral density in older adults. It may instead influence bone geometry and strength indirectly through muscle gain.

Combining creatine with protein, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), or vitamin D has been shown to provide additional benefits for muscle health in some studies. However, there is currently no research on the synergy between creatine and prebiotics, probiotics, or HMB in older adults. The review specifically notes that studies of combined supplementation (such as creatine plus HMB or creatine plus probiotics) have not been conducted in older populations.

HMB, a metabolite of the amino acid leucine, has gained interest for its potential to support muscle health in older adults. It enhances muscle protein synthesis and reduces breakdown, potentially helping to preserve muscle mass during periods of inactivity or illness.

Supplementation up to three grams a day is considered safe, but research findings are mixed. Some studies have shown that HMB improves hand grip strength and muscle quality, particularly with prolonged use of more than 12 weeks. However, the effects on skeletal muscle mass and physical performance remain inconsistent, and most trials demonstrate only small or non-significant effects on muscle mass.

Most evidence is not available for community-dwelling older adults; few studies have been conducted, and the effects are modest, with statistical significance primarily observed for hand grip strength, rather than mass or performance.

Evidence for HMB's role in bone health is limited to animal studies, with no randomized controlled trials in humans. HMB may work synergistically with other supplements, such as vitamin D, creatine, protein, and probiotics, to enhance muscle growth and development outcomes. However, results vary by population and supplement combinations. The review also notes the need for further research on the combined effects of HMB with other agents in older adults.

Prebiotics (non-digestible fibers) and probiotics (live beneficial microbes) may influence muscle and bone health by modulating the gut microbiota. Together, as synbiotics, they enhance microbial balance and promote anti-inflammatory effects.

Aging-related changes in gut microbiota are associated with sarcopenia and osteoporosis through mechanisms that involve nutrient absorption, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and immune regulation.

The gut–muscle axis suggests that microbiota influence muscle strength and metabolism, while the gut–bone axis shows impacts on bone density through immune modulation, hormone production, and gut barrier function.

Probiotics, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, may improve muscle function and mass; however, well-designed clinical trials in older adults are limited. The review specifies that only one study in mildly frail adults over 70 years showed improvement with L. plantarum; most evidence for probiotic effects in older people is based on animal models or mixed-age populations. Similarly, certain prebiotics have been shown to enhance bone health in animal models. Human data for older adults are scarce and strain-specific. Gut-derived metabolites also affect bone remodeling. Though mostly safe, probiotics may rarely cause infections in vulnerable individuals, including bacteremia or liver abscess. The summary could better contextualize the complexity of gut-derived metabolites, bile acids, and their roles within the gut–bone–muscle axis, as discussed in the review.

This review highlighted emerging nutritional supplements as promising strategies for managing osteosarcopenia in older adults.

These supplements are generally safe and well-tolerated, with creatine showing the strongest evidence for improving muscle and indirectly supporting bone health, especially when combined with exercise and other nutrients, such as protein and vitamin D.

HMB may enhance muscle strength, though results are inconsistent. Probiotics and prebiotics offer potential through modulation of the gut microbiota, but their effects vary by individual and bacterial strain.

Overall, these interventions show promise, but further research is needed to optimize their use and identify target populations.

A diet rich in foods that support gut microbiota diversity is linked to reduced age acceleration, pointing to new strategies for healthy aging and disease prevention.

Study: Association of a newly proposed dietary index for gut microbiota with phenotypic age acceleration: a cross-sectional study of NHANES 1999–2018. Image Credit: simona pilolla 2 / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition, researchers assessed associations between the dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) and phenotypic age acceleration (PAA).

Adding good foods mattered more than cutting bad ones: Boosting intake of beneficial components (like fiber, fermented dairy) showed a stronger link to slower aging (OR 0.92) than just reducing detrimental foods like red meat (OR 0.97).

Aging is a significant global health concern, affecting lifespan and contributing to an increased disease burden. Dietary factors have increasingly gained attention for their role in regulating aging. Healthy dietary patterns, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet, can slow the aging process by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation; however, the specific mechanisms underlying the associations between diet and aging remain unclear.

Studies indicate links between gut microbiota composition or diversity and aging-related diseases. A functionally intact and diverse gut microbiota could delay aging. In contrast, unhealthy diets rich in fats and refined grains can lead to gut dysbiosis and accelerate the aging process.

The DI-GM is a composite score balancing the intakes of foods deemed detrimental or beneficial to microbial diversity. However, its relationship with biological aging remains unclear.

In the present study, researchers explored the associations between DI-GM and PAA. Data were used from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) conducted between 1999 and 2018 in the United States. Participants were included if they were aged 20 years or older and excluded if they lacked diet or phenotypic age data.

The DI-GM score (range: 0–13) was derived from two 24-hour dietary recalls, with higher scores indicating greater benefits to the gut microbiota. The index originally included 14 components, but green tea, unavailable in NHANES, was excluded.

Scoring was based on sex-specific median food intake. One point was assigned when the intake of foods beneficial to the gut microbiota was above or at the median value, and zero points were assigned if it was below the median. Conversely, one point was assigned when the intake of foods detrimental to the gut microbiota was below the median value, and zero points were assigned if it was above or at the median.

Phenotypic age relied on real clinical markers: The biological age calculation incorporated routine blood test results like albumin, creatinine, and white blood cell count alongside vital signs like blood pressure.

Phenotypic age was determined using 10 physiological indicators (including chronological age), such as creatinine, albumin, glucose, lymphocyte percentage, C-reactive protein, mean cell volume, white blood cell count, alkaline phosphatase, and red cell distribution width. A linear regression analysis was performed to calculate the age acceleration residual (ACR) by regressing phenotypic age against chronological age. PAA was defined as a positive ACR.

Potential confounding variables included gender, age, marital status, race, poverty income ratio, body mass index (BMI), alcohol intake, smoking status, education level, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), physical activity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate the association between the DI-GM score and ACR and PAA. One was adjusted for gender and age, while the other was adjusted for all confounders.

Furthermore, restricted cubic spline analyses were used to assess the non-linear relationship between PAA and DI-GM. Notably, detrimental food components exhibited a significant non-linear association with PAA, whereas the overall DI-GM showed a linear association (P = 0.063 for non-linearity).

In addition, stratified analyses were performed to explore the consistency of associations in subgroups defined by age, gender, alcohol intake, race, smoking status, and chronic disease status (diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease).

A significant interaction emerged between DI-GM and age groups. Moreover, various sensitivity analyses, including propensity score matching and multiple imputation for missing data, were undertaken to verify the robustness of the findings.

Avoiding harmful foods still helped, but differently: While reducing processed meats and refined grains lowered PAA risk, this relationship wasn't perfectly linear, suggesting complex threshold effects.

In total, 29,435 NHANES participants aged 50.3 years, on average, were included. Of these, 50.7% were male, 48.4% were non-Hispanic White, and 61.7% were married or cohabiting. Further, 9,605 individuals exhibited PAA. Individuals with PAA were significantly older and had a higher BMI and lower average DI-GM score than those without PAA.

There were significant differences in race, gender, education level, smoking status, and chronic disease status between individuals with and without PAA. Further, higher DI-GM scores were significantly associated with lower ACR and PAA. Each one-point increment in the DI-GM score was associated with a 12% decrease in PAA risk in the age- and gender-adjusted model and a 7% reduction in the fully adjusted model. Beneficial components (OR = 0.92) contributed more strongly than avoiding detrimental foods (OR = 0.97).

Individuals with DI-GM scores of 5 (OR = 0.89) and those with scores of 6 or higher (OR = 0.74) had significantly lower PAA risks than those with scores of 0–3. A linear, negative correlation was found between DI-GM scores and PAA risk. Stratified analyses showed that higher scores were consistently associated with reduced PAA risks across subgroups. Likewise, sensitivity analyses using advanced statistical methods confirmed these results.

Taken together, the findings illustrate that higher DI-GM scores were significantly associated with lower ACR and PAA risks. Specifically, each unit increment in the score was associated with 7% lower PAA risk in the fully adjusted model. Increasing beneficial foods had a stronger effect than reducing detrimental ones.

This suggests that the potential benefits of dietary patterns on the gut microbiota may play a vital role in slowing biological aging. However, as a cross-sectional study based on 24-hour dietary recalls, causality cannot be inferred, and long-term dietary patterns may not be fully captured.

Additionally, the absence of direct measurements of gut microbiota limits mechanistic interpretations. Future studies should focus on long-term interventions and the integration of multi-omics to explore the interactive mechanisms between the host, microbiota, and diet.

New research uncovers how repetitive strain injuries ignite an inflammatory storm, driving both pain and social withdrawal, offering fresh insight into the biological roots of workplace burnout and recovery.

Study: Overuse injury induces persistent behavioral declines that correlate with higher IL-6 expression in the affected musculoskeletal tissues, circulation, and brain. Image Credit: SoftSheep / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Physiology, a group of researchers investigated whether repetitive reaching injury in mature female Sprague-Dawley rats couples pain-like and sickness behaviors with interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dominated inflammation in musculoskeletal tissues, the circulation, and the brain.

Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) sideline millions of workers each year and drain billions in productivity losses, but still, it is not fully understood how repeating the same physical tasks leads to fatigue, pain, and social withdrawal. Experimental and clinical evidence shows that inflammatory signaling molecules, especially IL-6, surge after tissue damage, and elevated circulating levels are linked with chronic pain and depression. Animal studies further indicate that proinflammatory cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and disrupt mood-related neural circuits. Key factors include how age, task intensity, and rest periods interact within this neuroimmune dialogue. Further studies should investigate sex-specific effects, fever responses, and long-term functional outcomes.

Investigators employed a three-arm, randomized, controlled design using mature female Sprague-Dawley rats (14 months of age at the onset). After food restriction, animals were trained under operant conditioning to reach and pull a lever for 6 weeks until they produced about 55% of their maximum voluntary pulling force (MPF). Randomly selected trained rats then performed a high-repetition low-force (HRLF) task for 6 weeks: 2 hours per day, 3 days per week, with a target of 4 reaches per minute at 15% MPF. The remaining trained rats rested, and age-matched food-restricted rats served as the control group. Blinded observers tracked reflexive grip strength, forepaw mechanical sensitivity, social interaction with a juvenile rat, and observed aggression at baseline, after training, and again at week 6. The final group sizes consisted of 24 control rats, 15 trained and rested rats, and 19 task rats. Behavioral scoring was conducted according to standardized protocols to minimize bias.

After 6 weeks of task exposure or matched rest, animals were euthanized, and serum, flexor digitorum muscles, tendons, bones, median nerves, and selected brain regions were collected. Cytokines including interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Brain sections were double-labeled for IL-6 with neuronal nuclei antigen (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), or ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures mixed-effects models and Tukey post hoc tests (α = 0.05); planned samples achieved at least 80% statistical power.

Training resulted in immediate functional costs, as both experimental groups lost approximately 20% of their baseline grip force and became hypersensitive to forepaw stimulation. By week six, rest partially rescued sensation, yet grip weakness lingered, while task animals deteriorated further. They remained 25% weaker than controls, withdrew their paws to monofilaments one-third the original size, and cut prosocial grooming and sniffing time from 40 to 20 seconds. The incidence of boxing or biting rose from nearly 0% in controls and trained rats (who showed only a single instance of aggression) to 42% in task rats. A slight but statistically significant reduction in body weight was also observed in task rats compared to controls at the end of the study. Force-sensor logs revealed that voluntary pull force averaged 27 centinewtons (cN), close to the 15% MPF target, but unsuccessful attempts doubled to more than 300 per two-hour session, intensifying cumulative load.

Biochemical profiling mirrored behavioral severity. Serum IL-1α climbed twofold, TNF-α threefold, and IL-6 fourfold in task rats, whereas the trained + rest group displayed only modest rises in IL-1α and TNF-α, but, crucially, showed no significant increase in IL-6. With the repetitive reaching task, IL-6 increased by 200 to 500% in flexor muscles, forearm bones, and median nerves, while IL-10 declined in muscles, shifting the local balance toward inflammation. Uninvolved tail tissues showed no change, highlighting regional specificity.

Immunohistology identified approximately six IL-6-positive neurons per square millimeter in the rostral cingulate cortex of task rats versus one in controls, alongside dense labeling of ependymal cells and selective activation of the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), with a similar, though not statistically significant, trend observed in the subfornical organ (SFO), gateway regions through which blood-borne cytokines influence the brain. Elevated IL-6 and IL-1α in serum or injured tissues correlated inversely with grip strength and positively with mechanical hypersensitivity, reduced sociability, and aggression. Median nerve IL-6 and TNF-α tracked most strongly with pain metrics, highlighting the nerve's role in pathogenic signaling. Muscle width remained unchanged, excluding sarcopenia as a confounder. Power analysis confirmed adequate sample size, and most group differences achieved p < 0.01.

Elevations in GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba-1-positive microglia co-expressing IL-6 within the ventricles signaled neuro-immune activation, providing a plausible substrate for the enduring behavioral deficits observed despite cessation of high-force loading.

To summarize, repetitive reaching tasks in aging female rats triggered a multi-level inflammatory cascade dominated by IL-6, which paralleled the development of lasting pain-like and sickness behaviors. Local musculoskeletal cytokine surges spilled into the bloodstream, traversed the BBB, and engaged limbic circuits implicated in mood and pain processing, linking workplace-style overuse to whole-body malaise.

Taken together, the data point to inflammation as the common thread linking the weakness, hypersensitivity, fatigue, and social withdrawal that many workers report after overuse injuries. Therapies that dampen IL-6 signaling or interrupt this injury-inflammation cycle could accelerate rehabilitation, reduce sick leave, and lower the broader costs of WMSDs.

A novel study reveals that targeting a single protein's aggregation can dramatically reduce brain injury after stroke, potentially transforming how acute ischemic strokes are treated.

Study: Inhibition of GAPDH aggregation as a potential treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock

A recent study published in the journal iScience reported that inhibiting the aggregation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) could be a therapeutic target for acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

Stroke is the second leading cause of death. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is among the most effective treatments for AIS but has limited acceptability and a narrow therapeutic window (within 4.5 hours). Other medications are symptomatic treatments and have short therapeutic time windows. As such, novel therapeutic approaches are needed to explore alternative therapies.

Evidence suggests that ischemia-reperfusion injury plays a role in AIS pathogenesis. The brain undergoes robust nitrosative/oxidative stress during ischemia-reperfusion, resulting in neuronal death. Understanding the damage induced by stress could illuminate the underlying mechanisms and help identify potential treatments for AIS.

GAPDH is a multifunctional protein that exhibits various functions, including DNA repair, kinase regulation, heme metabolism, and regulation of necrosis and apoptosis. Under oxidative/nitrosative stress, GAPDH nuclear translocation occurs with low-to-moderate stress (causing apoptosis), while aggregation occurs with severe stress (causing necrosis).

In the present study, researchers assessed whether GAPDH aggregation induced by ischemia-reperfusion is involved in the pathogenesis of AIS. First, a mouse AIS model was created by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Animals were subjected to ischemia for 30 minutes and reperfusion for varying durations. Brain infarction was evident 24 hours post-reperfusion, with infarct volume increasing with time. GAPDH aggregates were detected in the striatum (ischemic core) 12 hours post-reperfusion, preceding infarction.

The team generated conditional transgenic mice with neuron-specific expression of GAPDH-C152A to test whether neuronal damage could be prevented by inhibiting the aggregation. To this end, they used a human GAPDH-C152A construct (which reduces GAPDH aggregation in a dominant-negative manner) and doxycycline for temporal control of its expression.

GAPDH-C152A was expressed in the absence of Dox but not in its presence. Further, transgenic and non-transgenic mice were treated with Dox or vehicle for 14 days before MCAO. Physiological parameters (blood pressure, blood gases, cerebral blood flow) remained unaffected.

The infarct volume was the same in all non-transgenic mice, irrespective of Dox treatment. By contrast, Dox-untreated transgenic mice had significantly smaller infarct volumes in both cortex and striatum than Dox-treated counterparts. Moreover, the neurological score, a unilateral paralysis index, was significantly improved in Dox-untreated transgenic mice, suggesting that GAPDH-C152 expression ameliorated brain damage.

The researchers previously reported that GAPDH aggregates induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in vitro. As such, mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed based on the release of cell death mediators: apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c (Cyt c), which enter the nucleus and cytosol, respectively. Both nuclear AIF and cytosolic Cyt c levels were significantly lower in Dox-untreated transgenic mice than in Dox-treated transgenic mice.

Further, the team evaluated whether brain damage could be prevented through pharmacological inhibition of GAPDH aggregation. To this end, peptides with varying types and numbers of amino acids were designed and tested for their inhibitory potential. The SCT (serine-cysteine-threonine) tripeptide (GAI-17, IC50 = 1.18 μM) was identified as the most potent inhibitor, without adverse effects on cell viability or GAPDH enzymatic activity. Its therapeutic effects were subsequently assessed in the MCAO model.

Mice were intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected with 30 nmol or 60 nmol GAI-17 1 hour before, immediately after, and 12 hours after reperfusion. GAI-17 pretreatment significantly reduced infarct volumes in a dose-dependent fashion. The high-dose treatment resulted in a significant decrease in infarct volumes, specifically in the cortex (penumbra) but not in the striatum (ischemic core). GAI-17 is explicitly localized to neurons after i.c.v. administration. Treatment with 60 nmol GAI-17 did not affect physiological parameters. In addition, nuclear AIF and cytosolic Cyt c levels were significantly reduced in the cortex by 60 nmol GAI-17.

Finally, the team sought to ascertain the therapeutic time window. To this end, GAI-17 was administered at two time points: 3 hours and 12 hours (post-3h group), 6 hours and 12 hours (post-6h group), or 9 hours and 12 hours (post-9h group) post-reperfusion. The infarct volume was significantly reduced in the cortex in the post-3h and post-6h groups. Neurological deficits were improved considerably by GAI-17 treatment in the post-3h and post-6h groups. However, the post-9h group lacked protective effects, establishing a therapeutic window up to 6 hours post-reperfusion.

The research had key limitations: (1) Only transient ischemia (with reperfusion) was modeled, not permanent stroke; (2) Effects were only assessed acutely (≤48h), not in subacute/chronic phases; (3) Potential off-target effects of GAI-17 remain unexplored; and (4) While females showed reduced susceptibility to damage, sex differences weren't fully investigated.

The study demonstrated that GAPDH aggregates form prior to the onset of brain infarction following ischemia-reperfusion in a mouse AIS model. The findings suggest GAPDH aggregation as a likely causal mechanism for neuronal death in AIS.

Decreasing GAPDH aggregation via genetic (C152A-GAPDH expression) or pharmacological (GAI-17) approaches alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and ameliorated neurological deficits and brain damage primarily in the cortical penumbra.

Together, the findings suggest that inhibiting GAPDH aggregation could be a therapeutic target for AIS, offering an extended treatment window compared to current options.

""How does the brain distinguish glucose from the many nutrients absorbed in the gut?"" In a groundbreaking study, a research team at KAIST has uncovered a gut-brain circuit that enables the brain to selectively recognize glucose—beyond simply registering total caloric intake. This discovery opens a new avenue for developing targeted strategies to control appetite and treat metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes.

On July 9, KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced that the research was led by Professor Greg S.B. Suh of the Department of Biological Sciences in collaboration with Professor Young-Gyun Park (BarNeuro), Professor Seung-Hee Lee (Department of Biological Sciences), and researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.

The team demonstrated that, in a state of hunger, animals are capable of detecting and preferentially selecting D-glucose in the gut via a specialized gut-brain circuit.

While it has long been known that the gut transmits caloric information to the brain to regulate appetite—primarily through suppressing hunger-related neurons in the hypothalamus—this study is the first to reveal a nutrient-specific neural pathway that allows the brain to detect glucose itself, not just general caloric content.

Using a combination of optogenetics, neural imaging, and nutrient infusions, the researchers found that a subset of CRF neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus respond selectively—and rapidly—to D-glucose introduced directly into the small intestine. These neurons did not respond, or responded inversely, to other nutrients like L-glucose, amino acids, or fats.

Further mapping of the pathway showed that D-glucose signals are conveyed from the small intestine to the dorsolateral parabrachial nucleus (PBNdl) in the brainstem via the spinal cord, and then relayed to CRF neurons in the PVN. This is in contrast to signals from amino acids and fats, which travel to the brain via the vagus nerve.

Inhibiting the activity of CRF neurons in fasting mice eliminated their natural preference for glucose, confirming the necessity of this circuit for glucose-specific nutrient selection.

The study builds on Professor Suh's earlier work at NYU, where his team identified DH44 neurons in fruit flies that detect sugar in the gut. Inspired by the possibility that mammals might possess similar glucose-sensing neurons, the KAIST team launched this investigation.

Dr. Jineun Kim (KAIST Ph.D., now at Caltech) played a leading role in the study, demonstrating that fasting mice preferred glucose over other nutrients delivered directly into the stomach and that CRF neurons responded in real time. Wongyo Jung (KAIST B.S., now a Ph.D. student at Caltech) contributed modeling and behavioral analyses, while Dr. Shinhye Kim uncovered the role of specific spinal neurons in transmitting nutrient signals from the gut to the brain.

Drs. Kim and Kim noted,
""This study began with a simple but fundamental question: How does the brain distinguish glucose from other nutrients absorbed in the gut? We've shown that spinal-based gut-brain circuits play a central role in maintaining energy balance and metabolic homeostasis.""

Professor Suh added,
""By identifying a specialized gut-brain pathway for glucose sensing, this research opens up new therapeutic possibilities for metabolic diseases. Moving forward, we aim to investigate how similar circuits detect other essential nutrients, such as amino acids and fats, and how these systems interact.""

Ph.D. student Jineun Kim, Dr. Shinhye Kim, and student Wongyo Jung (co-first authors) contributed to this study, which was published online in the international journal Neuron on June 20, 2025.

Boost Your Recruiting Presence

VILLANOVA, PA – Villanova women's soccer head coach Samar Azem announced the addition of four transfers who have inked Letters of Intent.

The quartet includes two forwards, a midfielder and a defender. Two of the four are players who have been a part of teams who have made deep runs in the national tournament in the past four seasons.

“We are very excited about this recruiting class of transfers. We have a great blend of strong, core returning players; young, eager and talented freshmen; and a fantastic group of transfers who have the ability to elevate what we do competitively as our program takes a step forward,” Villanova head coach Samar Azem said. “We are extremely selective on the players and people we recruit – and this group of transfers each have an important role they can play in our program re-establishing its competitive identity. We have graduate transfers who bring the experience of national championship matches, final fours, national teams and achieving success at the highest level of soccer and academic prestige. I have no doubt this group of transfers will come in and make their marks on this program very quickly.”

“I want to thank our assistant coaches, Ryan and Erin, our support staff, our admissions staff and academic staff, and our players for the time they've put into ensuring we bring individuals who not only fit the identity we want to play with and talent profile we are looking for, but who also have the ability to enhance our community and tradition of excellence here at Villanova University,” Azem continued.

See below for a look at each of Villanova's new signings.

Curtin comes to the Main Line after a four-year career at Dartmouth where she was an NEWISA Third Team All-Region and Second Team All-Ivy player, both awards coming in the 2021 campaign. She totaled 35 starts in 42 appearances in her time with the Big Green for 2392 minutes of action. In that time, she tallied 29 points on 10 goals and nine assists. Her final season at Dartmouth came with 13 starts in 16 matches played. She scored three goals and two assists while compiling a three-game point streak along the way in which she tallied two goals and an assist. She had a breakout season in 2021 where she logged both aforementioned accolades after a six-goal, four-assist year, netting two game-winners along the way.

Academically, she was honored at the end of the 2024 season as the College Sports Communicators Academic All-District Team selection.

The Winchester, Mass. native was a four-year letter winner at Winchester High School, captaining the team in her senior year. She also earned two varsity letters as a sprinter on the indoor track team. On the pitch, she helped her team to the 2019 Division II State Championships in 2019 while going on a year later to be a finalist. She was a two-time High School Soccer First Team All-American selection, 2019 DII State Player of the Year, a four-time Middlesex League Champion, a three-time Middlesex League MVP as well as an All-State and All-New England honoree. At the club level, she played with the FC Stars from 2017-2021 where she was a Second Team Northeast ECNL and ODP Region 1 Team member.

Curtin will pursue a Masters in Finance at Villanova. On why she chose Villanova: “During my visit to Villanova, I felt an overwhelming sense of good on campus and amongst the team. The combination of elite athletics, rigorous master's programs, and strong Augustinian values creates an environment where I believe I would thrive in during my fifth year.”

Azem on Curtin: “Hannah is a fast, athletic, and relentless forward who has the capability to create a lot of problems for defenders.  She can score goals, she can create goals for others and she will press relentlessly.  She is a prototype of what we are looking for in our attacking players and will bring four years of high-level experience with her.  Her drive and her leadership will add a value of winning to our program as we rise through this next step.”

Dobsch was an ACC Honor Roll member and ACC Top 6 for Service honoree at Wake Forest, also earning a spot on the Dean's list all four years. In her time with the Demon Deacons, she suited up for three seasons and redshirted her junior campaign, logging 187 minutes on the pitch mostly as a defender. She is coming off a senior campaign that saw her play in four wins for the Deacs.

The Winnetka, Ill. native played a year of high school soccer as an All-State defender but was a part of elite club teams. She led her club team, Eclipse Select, to a No. 1 national ranking during the 2019-20 campaign. Prior to that, she was named the FC United team captain in 2015-16 while playing with ODP Illinois State Team in the same year. She attended the US Soccer Training Center from 2015-17 and was an ECNL Midwest Conference Champion and Finalist at the ECNL National Championship. Her team also ranked third in the ECNL National Conference Playoffs in 2021. In the classroom, she was a member of the Honor Roll all four years of her high school career.

Dobsch will pursue an MBA on the Main Line. On why she chose Villanova: “I chose Villanova for my fifth year because it combines high-level athletics with academic excellence. The competitive soccer program led by a respected coaching staff and being given the opportunity to pursue a well-regarded MBA checked all the boxes for me.”

Azem on Dobsch: “Kate is a skilled and sophisticated player on the ball.  She has the vision, ability, and range to play well timed advanced passes and orchestrate play in possession. She was an instrumental leader in Wake Forest's NCAA championship run and brings the experience of winning with her as our program looks to take a leap forward.”

Chukwu played in 16 of 17 games at Brown in her freshman season. In that time, she logged 266 minutes of action. She has worked her way through the Canadian Women's National Team system as well, suiting up with the U17 squad in 2023-24 cycle and U15 in 2022. That 2022 campaign was a stacked one for the Ottawa native, being selected for Canada Soccer's National Development Centre Ontario. At the club level, she played with 2022 OPDL U15 Gary Miller Cup and Shield and ODPL U15 League Champion teams, also winning the Ontario Summer Games that year. That year also saw her be a part of the Ontario Provincial Excel Team. She is not the only collegiate soccer player in her family. Her sister, Annabelle, is a forward at Notre Dame.

The Biology major on why she chose Villanova: “I chose Villanova because of its strong academics, and the faculty's commitment to developing student-athletes on and off the field.”

Azem on Chukwu: “Isabelle is a creative attacking player on the ball.  She has experience training and competing with the Canadian youth national team and comes from a year of experience with a dominant Ivy team. Isabelle's mind and vision for the game are extremely impressive. Coupled with her athletic ability, she will bring a lethal force to our front line.”

Panaccione wrapped up her undergraduate career this past season at Santa Clara. In her time with the Broncos, the defender amassed five starts in 26 appearances, logging two assists in 910 minutes of action. Her first year with the team saw the Broncos reach the NCAA National Semifinals in 2021.

Before Santa Clara, the Los Altos Hills, Calif. native was a four-year varsity soccer player at Saint Francis High School and played at the club level with MVLA. She was CCS and WCAL Team selection all four years and was awarded the SFHS Outstanding Athlete Award.

Azem on Panaccione: “Bella is a seasoned veteran and competitor. She has the versatility too in the back and mid lines and has a strong understanding of the game. She can impact our ability to possess and move the ball through each phase of play phenomenally well. Bella is a tough competitor and gritty defender and will be a handful for teams to try to break down.”

The teams will hold current camps in California.

Twenty players have been called up. 

Mike O'Neill has signed 8 first-year players.

Dr. Krissy Turner introduced Penn's signing class.

Tracey Bartholomew introduced 13 newcomers.

The World Cup in Qatar. The Copa America against the best from North and South America. High-pressure matches across the continent.

In his years with the United States Soccer Federation, Steve Fell has seen them all.

For the second half of this summer, though, the St. Augustine resident is back home and helping Sporting Club Jacksonville reach peak condition ahead of the women's professional soccer team's debut in the top-division Gainbridge Super League.

""It's just been a dream come true to live in such a beautiful place, and still be involved [in soccer] full-time and at a high level,"" he said.

Following years alongside the United States men's national team at world soccer's highest level, he's adding a new role in 2025 as head of performance for Sporting Jax and its young roster.

""There are differences in maybe the experiences of a higher-level player, because of what they deal with day-to-day, but I would say from a physical preparation side, you treat them all the same,"" Fell said. ""Wherever they fall in that continuum, that's the starting point, and then you try to help that player advance as much as you can.""

Even after some recent experienced additions, most recently former University of Florida defender Julia Lester on loan from the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League, Sporting Jax is racing toward August with youth. Close to half of its members are new to the professional ranks.

Head coach Stacey Balaam has the assignment of molding those newcomers into a cohesive unit for the club's Super League kickoff on Aug. 23, and she expects that Fell's background in the sport can accelerate the process of bringing them up to speed.

""Not everybody has someone with his skill set, his knowledge, expertise and experience,"" Balaam said. ""It's been valuable for our players to learn from him and for him to give them the necessary feedback. Right now, we're just soaking up all the information.""

Before Sporting Jax announced his hiring in April, Fell had accumulated a decade of wide-ranging soccer experience with Major League Soccer's Houston Dynamo, the United Soccer League's Phoenix Rising and most recently the United States Soccer Federation. He even served a stint as physical preparation coach in the sport's indoor variant with the Baltimore Blast of the now-inactive Major Indoor Soccer League.

A graduate of Towson University in Maryland, Fell is also at home on the First Coast, and he became Flagler College's director of sports performance in July 2015.

Since early 2022, Fell has worked as a performance coach alongside the full U.S. men's national team, including the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and he intends to continue in that role while also assisting Sporting Jax's efforts.

For Fell, the summer has raced along at near-nonstop pace. Before returning to Jacksonville to help supervise the Sporting Jax preseason, he spent a full month on the road with the U.S. men at the continental championship tournament, the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

After the United States lost that tournament final 2-1 to Mexico on July 6 in Houston, almost immediately, he was on his way back to Florida for Sporting Jax camp.

""It was good to get right back into it and almost erase the thought of [the loss] quickly,"" he said.

Under the Sporting Jax plan, Fell will supervise the players' physical preparation, while Balaam and associate coach Alan Kirkup handle the tactical planning and technical development.

""Steve's been a big help in terms of allowing us to do our job, allowing players to push when we need to push, taper off when we need to taper off,"" Balaam said.

For players making the jump from the college game to the Super League, the adjustments are many.

""It's not just technical and tactical, we're talking the physical attributes,"" Fell said. ""That is the universal thing when you go from college to a professional level. You see it all over the place, where individuals who were doing very well in college have this little adjustment period.""

The goal for Fell and the Sporting Jax staff is making that adjustment period as speedy as possible for rookies like defender Paige Kenton, who owns substantial credentials in her own right. She graduated magna cum laude from Penn with a degree in neuroscience and completed her fifth NCAA year last fall while pursuing her master's degree in the University of Delaware's Department of Linguistics and Cognitive Science.

""What we're asked to do at this level is very different from the college level,"" Kenton said. ""It's not just about making a good pass, or making a pass, but it's about maximizing your decisions to help the team.""

It's a similar feeling for players like defender Grace Philpotts, in her first professional season out of the University of Kentucky. The soccer may seem the same at first, but the demands are greater.

""The drills are pretty similar, but the tempo of the drills can be a lot different,"" Philpotts said. ""We're having vets, we're having girls with pro experience of many years that are coming now and training, so I'd say the tempo is a lot faster [than in college].""

Balaam, who came to Sporting Jax in April from SEC soccer at Vanderbilt, recognizes the step up awaiting the players.

""It's something that they've probably not had before,"" Balaam said. ""So it's an example of this as the next level for them.""

However, time is on the side of Sporting Jax. In addition to closed-door training matches later this month, the club also tunes up at UNF on Aug. 2 against Hibernian of Scotland and on Aug. 10 against Wrexham of Wales, games that will help Fell assess how players are advancing.

""We're building these athletes who are just coming out of college progressively, in a way that's safe,"" Fell said, ""to help them attain that level where they're able to handle the demands of the professional level.""","{'href': 'https://www.jacksonville.com', 'title': 'The Florida Times-Union'}","soccer"

Nedum Onuoha discusses if Chelsea can build off their Club World Cup success once the Premier League starts back up. (1:29)

Real Madrid and several other clubs in Europe and South America are in favor of holding the revamped Club World Cup every two years to increase their revenue, but FIFA sees this as an impossibility, various sources told ESPN.

There has been no official request so far but the sources add that during the recent tournament in the United States, executives from several major clubs discussed this possibility with FIFA representatives.

FIFA is happy with the outcome of the new tournament but currently considers a new Club World Cup in just two years to be ""unfeasible"" and is preparing for the next one to be held in 2029.

- Sources: MLS players got boost in CWC money
- Chelsea's Colwill: CWC will be bigger than UCL 
- What Club World Cup says about comparing MLS to Premier League

FIFA distributed $1 billion among the teams participating in the recent Club World Cup, and sources believe that it is not feasible to generate that amount every two years.

Madrid, who reached the semifinals, took home $82.5 million, and Chelsea generated $114.6m in revenue as the champion.

In addition, sources said that FIFA believes holding the Club World Cup every two years would mean conflict with UEFA that is not in its interests, and they also see it as very difficult to fit this possibility into the already demanding current football calendar.

Sources told ESPN that FIFA is working on the idea of organising another Club World Cup in 2029.

The source told ESPN that Qatar would be one of the potential candidate countries to host this tournament.

Qatar already hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup and has the financing and infrastructure necessary to host.

However, the calendar works against them as it would have to be played in December due to the hot weather.

Last year, then-Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti initially said the club would not participate in the revamped Club World Cup, telling Italian newspaper Il Gornale: ""One single Real Madrid game is worth €20 million, and FIFA want to give us that amount for the entire competition. Negative. Just like us, other clubs will refuse the invitation.""

Chelsea chiefs seem to have at last made a decision on what the 2025/26 season will hold for promising youngster Kendry Paez.

There is plenty of excitement over what Paez can bring to Stamford Bridge after already establishing himself as a regular in the Ecuador senior side alongside Moises Caicedo.

However, the expectations on him for the upcoming campaign were put on hold after it emerged he had not been included in the squad to compete in the Club World Cup.

Paez was reportedly angry at not being selected, and eventually travelled with the side and trained with the first team to get to grips with his future teammates.

It was reported late last season that Paez had been training with Strasbourg, who are also under the BlueCo model that are in charge of proceedings at Stamford Bridge.

Andrey Santos has already gone from loan spells to the Ligue 1 side to being a genuine option for Enzo Maresca, and they will be hoping the same becomes the case for their new addition.

As per Ben Jacobs, a loan deal to Strasbourg is in the process of being finalised for Paez.

He said: “Kendry Paez set for a Strasbourg loan after training with Chelsea during the Club World Cup. Loan now in the process of being finalised.“

Fellow impressive youngster Estevao Willian will not be leaving on loan upon his arrival at Stamford Bridge. He will get his chance to impress the manager when the first team squad return to pre-season.

As per transfer rules, Chelsea are only allowed to loan three players to Strasbourg for a single season, and these transactions are allowed as the Blues will be playing in a different level of European football next season.

Mike Penders is set to replace Djordje Petrovic as the goalkeeper for the Ligue 1 side, after he travelled with the first team squad to win the Club World Cup.

The final spot has been taken by one of their former players. Mamadou Sarr will join Strasbourg for the 2025/26 season after joining Chelsea earlier this summer.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

FIFA have stripped a further eight clubs of a major title amid their decision over Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City.

Earlier this month, Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain 4-0 to win the 2025 Club World Cup title.

Although the Club World Cup had previously been held annually since 2005, FIFA made the decision to officially pronounce Chelsea as the first-ever 'world champions'.

Advert

According to the Daily Mail, former Club World Cup winners Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City will all now be referred to as 'FIFA Intercontinental Champions'.

That is a differentiation from the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, a newly-introduced rebrand of a tournament by the same name which sees each of the six teams that won their confederation's continental cup compete in a mini-tournament.

Chelsea are not guaranteed to defend their title at the next Club World Cup in 2029, as the tournament's holders do not yet receive automatic qualification.

Liverpool, United and City will all hope to meet the qualifying criteria over the next three years and effectively 'win back' their title of world champions.

Liverpool won the Club World Cup in 2019, while City were the final winners under the previous format in 2023.

Advert

United, meanwhile, lifted the trophy in 2008. All three sides had won the Champions League earlier in the year of their success.

And seven other clubs are now no longer recognised as champions of the footballing world.

Real Madrid are five-time winners of the Club World Cup under its previous format, but will now have to win it under its new format. They are, however, still the reigning champions of the Intercontinental Cup.

Advert

Three-time winners Barcelona are also affected, as well as two-time winners Bayern Munich and Corinthians.

Finally, Sao Paulo (2005 winners), Internacional (2006), AC Milan (2007) and Inter Milan (2010) are the other teams that can no longer call themselves world champions.

PSG, Pyramids, Al Hilal and Cruz Azul are the teams already confirmed for the 2029 Club World Cup - but all the above teams can still qualify alongside them by winning continental titles or by meeting specific club ranking criteria set by FIFA.

It's emerged that Chelsea officials had noticed that PSG reps were already assuming they had won the Club World Cup.

Of course, seeing this would be enough to motivate you to do all you can to go on and win the competition, and that is exactly what Chelsea did just over a week ago now.

PSG are European Champions and many people see them as the best team in the world at current, and they probably are. But anything can happen in this sport, and one game is one game. Chelsea proved to the world that PSG can be beaten and in all honesty, they were beaten with easy on the night with The Blues thrashing them 3-0 to become World Champions.

But it sounds like PSG were getting complacent and already assuming that they were going to win the game before it was even played.

According to a report from The Times over the weekend, at a FIFA dinner on the eve of the Club Word Cup final, the Chelsea delegation noted how preoccupied the representatives of PSG were with how and where they would collect the trophy. Chelsea's people informed Enzo Maresca of this and he passed it onto the players.

Imagine getting that information and being able to use that as such strong motivation! Amazing stuff,

Mamadou Sarr is rejoining Strasbourg on loan from Chelsea after Fabrizio Romano called the ‘here we go' done deal on that one late last night.

Nicolas Jackson's agent has been in talks with Manchester United over the weekend to see if a move to Old Trafford can happen for the striker this summer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","3 reasons Chelsea should now be considered Premier League contenders","https://theprideoflondon.com/3-reasons-chelsea-considered-premier-league-contenders","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:30:00 GMT","

Chelsea have won two trophies this season, credit to Enzo Maresca, and in large part, Cole Palmer. The Europa Conference League and the FIFA Club World Cup, along with a top-four finish in the Premier League, are indications that the Blues possess both talent and a coach capable of producing results with the right methodology.

Last season, Chelsea were shaky during the middle part of the campaign but stabilised toward the end, making a top-four finish possible. Yes, everyone expected Maresca's men to win the Conference League, but then again, everyone also expected Paris Saint-Germain to win the Club World Cup after wins over Bayern Munich and Real Madrid with ease.

So, expectations don't always equate to victories. Chelsea's performance in the Club World Cup deserves recognition for several reasons.

Maresca had the sense not to sit back against Paris Saint-Germain, but also not to press them too far forward, even though he deployed a high line. The Blues boss relied on his team's pacy backline to deal with the over-the-top through balls that Luis Enrique's side tried to play in behind. This should be noted, as the Italian manager has demonstrated this kind of pragmatism at several points throughout the season.

A pragmatic approach, when needed, allows the Blues to make the most of their key strengths in big matches: pace. If Chelsea can consistently deploy this style next season, it could lead to invaluable victories over direct rivals. Wins that could prove crucial at the end of the campaign.

This point is a bit trickier. Chelsea kept just 34% possession, yet created three big chances, took 10 shots, and scored three goals. That kind of efficiency should be acknowledged, though for a different reason. The Blues have not shown this level of clinical finishing consistently over the past season.

In fact, Chelsea missed 2.2 of every 3.2 big chances they created per game in the Premier League last season, across 38 games. They've been consistently poor at converting opportunities. That wastefulness extended to the Club World Cup final too. Against PSG, they missed two of the three big chances they created, though they were still efficient in terms of goals scored per shot taken.

Joao Pedro is likely to help Maresca's men become more clinical next season. If the Blues want to compete for more than just a top-four finish, improving their efficiency in front of goal is essential.

Chelsea's players showed a level of confidence that, admittedly, made me uneasy at first. But it paid off. Their performance reflected a team that believed in its game plan. Next season, Maresca's men will need that same belief, not only for big matches but also to meet the season's expectations as a whole.

Levi Colwill's comments about “not being Inter or Madrid” may have come across as arrogant, but confidence and arrogance often wear the same face. That belief will also help the coach, as confident players take necessary risks without being overly cautious.

These three factors are why Chelsea should be considered serious contenders for a top-two finish in the Premier League in the 2025/26 season. That is, as long as Maresca doesn't revert to a rigid “his way” approach, the kind that saw them lose 4-0 to Celtic in July 2024.

In the Club World Cup, Chelsea had to beat several teams to reach the final against PSG. While most of those opponents weren't expected to pose much of a challenge, the win over the Champions League holders was significant because it finally earned the Blues some long-overdue respect from rival fans.

Premier League teams will be at least twice as difficult as most of the sides Chelsea faced in the Club World Cup. But over the past six months, this team has shown that they can hold their own against some of the world's best, and PSG is currently the top of that list. That is a positive sign of progress and they are only expected to get better moving forward.

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump designated himself chairman of the U.S. task force organizing next year's World Cup in North America. His reign officially kicked off amid a hail of boos on July 6 in New Jersey at the Club World Cup finale between Chelsea and Paris Saint-German—a precursor to the big event in 2026.

As with most things associated with Trump, his participation in FIFA's minor canon came with a generous helping of slapdash corruption. Trump had already helped himself to the trophy meant for the tournament's winners, claimed as a piece of bric-a-brac to display in the Oval Office, so Chelsea's triumphant squad had to be presented with a replica of the original. (The president insisted the winners' trophy was gifted to him by FIFA.) The kleptomania didn't end there: Trump was filmed tucking away a championship medal in the inside breast pocket of his suit jacket at the event.

He also hogged the victory stage during the Chelsea players' celebration in front of the fans at MetLife Stadium. Gianni Infantino, head of the international soccer organization Fédération Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, was seen on camera attempting to usher the president from the platform, but Trump wasn't budging. The lone outsider stuck fast to the stage as the players around him leapt into the air to celebrate their win. He was later erased from one of the team shots posted on social media.

Chelsea midfielder Cole Palmer, who scored two of the team's three goals for the title win, said later he was “confused” by the lingering Trump. “I knew he was going to be here, but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy,” Palmer added.

Better get used to Trump hanging around. The president will now lord over arrangements hammered out in offices in his own Trump Tower in Manhattan for the 2026 World Cup taking place in the United States (13 cities), Canada (two cities), and Mexico (three cities). The 2026 iteration of the Cup will debut its new, expanded format and will include a record 48 teams and 104 games.

Trump named as the executive director of his new World Cup task force former small-time pro golfer and short-time Republican candidate for New York Governor Andrew Giuliani, 39, son of onetime New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a main defender of Trump's lie that the 2020 election was rigged. The task forces will be part of Kristi Noem's Department of Homeland Security.

Trump Tower enthusiasts will recognize that this is a full-circle operation. Ten years ago, an investigation into the biggest bribery scandal in soccer history was launched in the exact same building, as FIFA general secretary Chuck Blazer, to save himself, suited up with a wire for the FBI to implicate his cronies in the sports federation. Mike Gaeta, a founder of international investigation and consulting firm SI Global Partners, was a top FBI investigator in the case who launched the probe. In an interview, he characterized the crackdown as a major “slap upside the face of those out to game the system.”

A decade later, FIFA is back in the building. And with it comes millions of dollars—involving security, sponsorships, sports gear, and memorabilia—that has been and is being negotiated. Trump, whose private companies continue to profit from deals with corporations and nations even as he serves in the White House, is calling the shots in the U.S.

What could possibly go wrong?

Besides providing a fresh opportunity for profit and kickbacks, the World Cup in the U.S. promises politically to be a jarring mix of global cooperation, talented athletes from around the world, and the Trump administration's “suited and booted” ICE men poised to pounce on people attending the matches from around the world. It threatens to be a modern-day taste of Hitler's 1936 Summer Olympics, when Germany hosted the global games while aiming at the same time to highlight Nazi domination.

A decade ago, the FBI's investigation resulted in the indictment of nine FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice—for corruption, racketeering, and money laundering, among other charges—in a massive bribery and kickback scandal linked to awarding contracts and choosing World Cup venues in South Africa (2010), Russia (2018), and Qatar (2022). The number of indicted FIFA officials and corporate representatives later grew to some 40 people. Most confessed, were convicted, or died before court actions concluded.

U.S. prosecutors accused individuals (and collaborators) of FIFA's exclusive 24-member executive committee of choosing World Cup venues and awarding contracts influenced by hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes. According to the indictments, the head of FIFA's regional Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football, or CONCACAF, Blazer's boss Jack Warner, raked in $10 million just for voting for South Africa to be a World Cup venue, a fraction of his total take. Warner, who lives in Trinidad, has denied all the charges and has stayed out of the U.S. since his indictment.

Warner also picked Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup. (Blazer, who lived in Forest Hills, Queens, as a boy and New Rochelle, New York, later on, told confidants he did not, since the U.S. was vying to be the World Cup venue the same year.) Qatar had no stadiums adequate for World Cup play when its bid was accepted. As it fulfilled its commitments, hundreds of immigrant workers lost their lives in accidents building the stadiums and other projects for the event—a reality that Qatar's own World Cup chief has admitted. Human rights organizations say thousands died leading up to the Cup. Staging the World Cup in Qatar cost an estimated record-busting $220 billion.

By the time federal agents confronted Blazer outside Trump Tower in November 2011, he had raked in his own multimillion-dollar income, helping himself to at least a 10 percent cut of every deal he made, and an additional untold fortune under the table throughout his 11-year reign as CONCACAF general secretary. He paid no taxes for 20 years, Gaeta noted, a fact leveraged by agents to force his cooperation in their investigation.

He turned out to be the linchpin in the FBI's massive crackdown on the sports organization.

Gaeta credited Blazer with nailing down needed information that ultimately resulted in the dramatic arrests by Swiss authorities of FIFA officials outside the Baur au Lac Hotel in Zurich in May 2015. Like the mobster wiseguys Gaeta had worked with, he said Blazer was “practical, getting the most benefit as quickly as possible” while working with the FBI to stay out of prison. “At some point he started to take to the work,” Gaeta added.

It was Blazer, who got his start in the sport coaching the soccer teams of his son and daughter when they were children, who decided to rent the seventeenth floor of Trump Tower for CONCACAF offices when he became general secretary in 1990. He also lived in the building in a $18,000-a-month, three-bedroom apartment on the forty-ninth floor with a view of Central Park, with a second $8,000-a-month, one-bedroom apartment rented exclusively for his cats. Trump Tower was a symbol to Blazer that he had arrived.

Trump had nothing to do with FIFA or CONCACAF then, but the crafty, ebullient Blazer—who tipped the scales at 450-plus pounds and needed a motorized mobility chair to get around and a breathing apparatus at night—was friendly with his neighbor and building owner, who lived in Trump Tower's two-story penthouse. Both were Queens men with a chip on their shoulder about snooty Manhattan society. Trump offered Blazer open invitations to his various beauty pageants, and Blazer took him up on them.

Trump filmed his lone TV ad for his infamous Trump “University” offering pricey classes on business and real estate in Blazer's apartment in 2010. Trump touted his enterprise in a scene outfitted to look like an academic office with shelves of books and a giant globe. Neither Trump nor Blazer had any books to speak of to complete the look, so they had to be borrowed from a law firm, according to Mary Lynn Blanks, Blazer's longtime romantic partner. A $25 million settlement was later paid in 2017 to settle claims by several “university” clients that they were subject to high-pressure sales techniques and lies about the money they would make with Trump classes.

The money to be made and expended in the U.S. World Cup games is unclear. A FIFA accounting  mashing together figures for 2023–2026 reported a budget for the 2026 Word Cup of $3.75 billion, though specific expenses weren't detailed. Listed revenue apparently for all FIFA events included some $4.2 billion in broadcasting rights and $3 billion in hospitality and ticket sales. Cost estimates for Vancouver alone for its World Cup games are already edging close to half a billion U.S. dollars.

Expenses may be divvied up among hosting nations and cities and FIFA, but the organization's budget report doesn't detail how the burden will be shared. FIFA did not respond to repeated requests to provide the information.

Nor did the White House provide any figures, including costs like Giuliani's salary, the number of task force staffers or a budget for them, or how much rent the Trump Organization will be paid for the World Cup offices. Trump's task force will be responsible for all World Cup “logistics and security,” according to his executive order establishing the group.

Payments to cover World Cup expenses by U.S. hosting cities, which will include large expenditures on police and other security and emergency services, will come at a time when states will be struggling to make up for significant federal cuts in Medicaid and federal education and health services. Trump beefed up his “big, beautiful bill” with a $625 million fund to help pay for “safety and security” in the host cities—Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, East Rutherford (for New York and New Jersey), Philadelphia, Santa Clara (for the Bay Area), and Seattle. The money was allocated just as a Houston World Cup official warned that the city was “teetering in terms of being close to breaking even” for hosting one of the games.

FIFA comes out way ahead in stadium agreements, according to one recently obtained by The New York Times. It will take full control of New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, 30 days before the opening World Cup match until seven days after the tournament, according to the deal. The city and stadium, meanwhile, shall “bear all the costs and expenses incurred,” including “providing police escorts” for teams, referees, and FIFA head Infantino and his delegation. The city is also expected to “provide medical services and fire protection around matches” and any required FIFA offices free of charge.

In return for local costs, FIFA has optimistically predicted the World Cup could boost the “global GDP” by $47 billion and create hundreds of thousands of jobs.

But there have been warning signs that next year's event won't be quite as successful as touted. The recently concluded Club World Cup, intended to goose interest in the bigger tournament to come, was far less than the windfall that was hoped for, with discounted and empty seats and complaints about the extreme heat during some of the matches. The World Cup will play out next year during the same hot summer months.

The Cup will also be facing stiff headwinds created by the growing global animosity toward America, the boycotts triggered by Trump's tariffs, and his constant battery of insults directed at other countries and world leaders. The world's disregard for Trump has decimated tourism to the United States. On top of that, sports fans from around the world will also have to worry that they could be detained en route to the U.S. or otherwise swept up in anti-immigrant raids by masked ICE agents and locked in detention cages until their details are sorted out.

In addition, countless sports fans hail from the 12 countries whose travelers have been banned from entering the U.S. as of June 9, in an executive order signed by Trump. The order includes an exemption for athletes, coaches, and support staff and “immediate relatives” traveling to the Cup or to the 2028 Olympics in the U.S.

Despite problems, Trump could profit mightily from the Cup now and in the future if only by promoting his name and brand and nurturing and exploiting relationships with FIFA and sports companies and event officials. He could cash in on sports memorabilia, like issuing a World Cup meme coin from his crypto company. Infantino noted in a visit with Trump earlier this year at the White House that he might be interested in developing a “FIFA coin.” Trump noted: “That coin may be worth more than FIFA in the end.”

Qatar's aim in hosting the Cup in 2022 was part of its “sportswashing” strategy, a bid to boost the reputation of the regime to become a player on the global scene. It worked as intended, particularly with the leader of the United States. Qatar is now supplying a $400 million “flying palace” to a grateful Donald Trump to use as his Air Force One. (“Why wouldn't I accept a gift?” he asked in a Fox television interview.) And the president's family is currently doing business with a Qatari government–owned company to build a luxury golf resort in the country.

Saudi Arabia has been chosen to host the Cup in 2034, despite scathing criticism over its multiple human rights violations and the murder-dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul seven years ago. Trump staunchly defended Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his first administration, despite a determination by America's own intelligence network that bin Salman had ordered Khashoggi's murder.

“I saved his ass,” Trump later boasted about his defense of the prince, amid the outcry over Khashoggi's killing in an interview with Washington Post author Bob Woodward. “I was able to get Congress to leave him alone. I was able to get them to stop,” Trump said, Woodward recounted in his book Rage.

Just months after the end of the first Trump administration, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund—over objections by some of its board members—invested $2 billion in a financial investment operation launched by Trump's son-in-law and onetime White House aide Jared Kushner, the first such business Kushner had ever started. The Trump Organization also maintains a strong relationship with the global Saudi golf tournament operation LIV, which is part of that country's early sportswashing effort.

Despite such recent developments, Gaeta is convinced the dramatic FIFA busts in Zurich 10 years ago and subsequent cases sparked by a powerful FBI investigation sent a strong message to “extremely wealthy international businessmen abusing the system and making the rules for themselves” that they “can't do everything they want, and there are consequences.”

That's “still in the back of their minds,” Gaeta said. We shall see.

New York and New Jersey officials are projecting a $3.3 billion economic boost to the region from hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2026.

The region will hold eight matches at Metlife Stadium in New Jersey, including the final on July 19, 2026, expecting to bring in over 1.2 million fans and tourists, according to an economic impact summary released Monday by the NYNJ Host Committee, the local body responsible for organizing the games.

New York and New Jersey officials are expecting to score a $3.3 billion boost when the World Cup soccer tournament returns to the US next year for the first time in more than three decades, according to a report released Monday.

MeLlife Stadium, home of the Jets and Giants in East Rutherford, NJ, will host eight matches, including the final — which are projected to generate $1.3 billion in total labor income and $1.7 billion in spending by attendees and fans flocking to metropolitan area, according to the report by the NY/NJ Host Committee.

The expanded 48-team tournament, which run from June 11 to July 19, is expected to be the most highly attended in FIFA history — with an estimated 6 million fans converging on host cities in the US, Canada and Mexico. 

More than 1.2 million tourists are expected to travel to the New York-New Jersey region for the games, according to the report, which was co-authored by Tourism Economics, a peer-reviewed journal owned by Oxford Economics. 

“It's a legacy-defining opportunity to create lasting economic and social impact for New York and New Jersey,” Alex Lasry, CEO of the NYNJ Host Committee, said in a statement.

“From record tourism and global visibility to local investment and job creation, this tournament will help shape the future of our region.”

More than 26,000 jobs will be created across New York and New Jersey to support the games, the report said.

Other US host cities include Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco/Bay Area, and Seattle.

The host states will also enjoy an additional $432 million in state and local tax revenues, according to the analysis. 

President Trump has hinted that he has high hopes for next year's event, even as his hefty tariffs have heightened tensions with foreign countries.

“Tensions are a good thing,” Trump said during a FIFA task force meeting at the White House earlier this year when asked how his policies could affect the World Cup.

“It'll make it more exciting,” he added.

By Robert Haugh 

Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium will host six World Cup matches in 2026, including five group-stage games on June 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25, plus a round of 32 match on July 1.

KRON reports that a name change is possible.  Janine De La Vega, the City's Public Information Officer, told KRON: “It is our understanding that any name change for Levi's Stadium during the FIFA World Cup 2026 event is a matter of ongoing discussions between the Bay Area Host Committee (BAHC) and FIFA.”

But sources tell Santa Clara News Online that a name change is likely already a done deal, with the BAHC delaying the official announcement, and Levi's may not be aware they are losing a global marketing opportunity.

FIFA's strict sponsorship rules require that only official tournament sponsors be associated with World Cup venues. All existing stadium branding and signage not aligned with FIFA's sponsorship deals must be covered or removed. 

This has led to similar name changes at other host venues, such as Hard Rock Stadium becoming “Miami Stadium” and AT&T Stadium being renamed “Dallas Stadium” for the event.

The BAHC is still working to finalize event preparations, but fundraising remains a huge problem for them. 

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the 49ers and the BAHC are facing a $37 million fundraising gap, with the state budget offering only $10 million in support. 

The projected costs for hosting the matches could reach $50 million, with FIFA contributing just $13 million.

This is a developing story.

Just two Question.
How does any of this help the average resident of our City?

Why is it that the City of Santa Clara gets all the risk, yet the 49ers of San Francisco get all the rewards?  

Curious to hear any explanation from our City Staff, and maybe some options that we might have to avoid exposing our City to such “BS” Cost, especially with no matching risk / reward to merit these expenditures.     

By the way didn't the 49ers just ask to get us, the residents, to pay for their new Levi Stadium signs last year because they were looking a bit faded?
As they say…. you can look it up.

Can City staff that “negotiated” this deal with the 49ers and FIFA please inform the public of what happens to the Stadium Authority's Naming Rights revenue in 2026?

I nominate Charles Ponzi.  Ponzi Stadoum.

This is exactly what I said the cost would be to Residents when I was campaigning for District 5 council seat. If you add the SuperBowl it could be closer to $70M.

USA defender Chris Richards (3) leaves the field as Mexico celebrates the team's 2-1 win in the Concacaf Gold Cup finals at NRG Stadium in Houston on Sunday, July 6, 2025. Mexico won the game 2-1.

As soon as the referee blew the whistle to conclude the Gold Cup final, Mexico's 2-1 victory over the United States at NRG Stadium earlier this month, the Mexican players began celebrating on the field as a traditional ranchera song by Vicente Fernández echoed through the stands.

“El Rey” (The King) resonated as Mexican fans sang proudly in their green jerseys and waving their national flags, and many fans of the U.S. national team left the stadium biting the dust of defeat against their traditional CONCACAF rivals.

Perhaps many of the fans didn't even know what that song was about, but the Mexicans, in addition to singing one of the most famous verses of their popular music, took the opportunity to remind their hosts and neighbors that their national soccer team still rules the region. The pride of Mexican soccer had been wounded in recent years with the rise of national teams like the United States, Canada and even Panama in CONCACAF.

NEW FACE: How Diego Luna became the rising star of the U.S. soccer team in Gold Cup

But this year, led by Javier Aguirre, Mexico reaffirmed its supremacy. First by winning the Nations League title and now by retaining the Gold Cup, for which “El Vasco” called up his best players while Mauricio Pochettino, the Argentine manager of the USMNT, preferred to rest several of his regular starters and instead try out other young players just one year before the FIFA World Cup, which will be held in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

“Obviously (this title) is important because we Mexicans have been fortunate enough to win the last tournaments CONCACAF has organized: we won the Nations League and now we're repeating in the Gold Cup. That fills me with pride because it gives us confidence, it gives us energy for the future, for what's coming. There are no more official matches; they're friendlies, and we have to continue looking for players for the World Cup,” said “El Vasco.”

SOCCER: What Houston learned about upcoming World Cup from hosting Gold Cup at NRG

“The World Cup is going to be a real test for many of us, and we have a year to prepare well. I think there are people who would tell you today that they've passed, but there are always little things to improve. I myself sometimes make mistakes, and luckily I also have a great coaching staff that opens my eyes,” he added. “I think we've made good progress in CONCACAF recently, because it seems like we've stuck there in the past. Panama, Canada, and the United States itself have grown, and I think today we're in a prominent position in the region.”

A few days earlier, at another press conference, in the run-up to the final, Aguirre arrived with a book under his arm.

It wasn't just any book. When asked, the Mexican national team coach said it was a book on Mexican history, and that he was reading a chapter in which Texas ceased to be Mexican territory.

Coincidence? Hardly. Provocation? Maybe. In one way or another, it may have served as motivation for his players ahead of the final, and perhaps also for the fans, who played a key role with their overwhelming support at NRG Stadium, packed with 70,925 spectators, something Pochettino himself emphasized when lamenting his team's defeat.

Aguirre tried to depersonalize the achievement of winning the new title on the coach's behalf and focused on the merit of his players, who spent more than a month training for this tournament and traveled to several cities across the country. And throughout, he emphasized the tremendous support they received from the fans, and specially in Houston, which will be one of the venues for the World Cup.

Because Mexico, like the United States and Canada, has already qualified for the World Cup as one of the three hosts, it will only play friendlies between now and the big event.

Within this context, while Aguirre has used his best players to reaffirm his dominance in the region, he has also been experimenting with some young players, something he could fine-tune in the upcoming matches.

Among them are midfielders Gilberto Mora and Marcel Ruiz and fullback Mateo Chávez, who have taken advantage of the opportunities in the Gold Cup and have positioned themselves to fight for their spots in the World Cup squad.

Mora, 16, was forced into the starting team due to Luis Chávez's unfortunate right knee injury. He asserted himself and even became one of the key players in the semifinal victory over Honduras. In the final, he consistently showed his worth, showing himself constantly and calling for the ball to try to play between the two defensive lines set up by the United States, and even managed to make a difference with his skills and excellent passing.

Ruiz, 24, also played a prominent role in the final and established himself throughout the tournament after other strong performances. Chávez, 19, also made his senior team debut, though less prominently as he came in as a substitute for Jesús Gallardo, although he also performed well.

POLITICS: The World Cup is coming to Houston next summer. Will Trump make it hard for people to come?

On the other hand, Pochettino didn't regret his decision not to select many of his starters.

“All the players have a chance,” said the manager of the US national team. “We need to analyze each player, see the circumstances, the situations, the performance, the level of fitness.”

Among the absent, Captain Christian Pulisic asked for a vacation after a long season in Europe with AC Milan; Yunus Musah opted not to participate for an undisclosed personal reason; Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, and Gio Reyna were committed to their teams at the FIFA Club World Cup, Antonee Robinson and Folarin Balogun were injured; and Sergiño Dest was regaining his best physical form.

In their places, players who stood out during the tournament were goalkeeper Matt Freese, right back Alex Freeman, midfielders Malik Tillman, Sebastian Berhalter and Diego Luna, and forward Patrick Agyemang.

Pochettino, with a record of 10 wins and six losses since replacing Gregg Berhalter in the fall of 2024, will now face two exhibition games against 23rd-ranked South Korea on Sept. 6 in Harrison, N.J., and then face 17th-ranked Japan three days later in Columbus, Ohio.

After that, the 15th-ranked U.S. will face 25th-ranked Ecuador on Oct. 10 in Austin and 24th-ranked Australia four days later in Commerce City, Colo.

The first edition of the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the United States concluded on July 13 in New Jersey with Chelsea winning the tournament. But with less than a year to go until the World Cup, FIFA should take note of some alarm bells raised during the tournament.

The final, in which the English team routed Paris Saint-Germain of France 3-0 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, was a success with over 80,000 spectators. However, many of the matches, especially in the group stage, were played in half-empty stadiums as FIFA decided to use regular NFL venues instead of those of Major League Soccer (MLS), which continued to be played simultaneously with this club competition and the Gold Cup.

However, that hasn't been the most alarming aspect of the venues. Instead, it's the renewed complaints from some coaches and teams about the poor condition of some playing fields, something that had already occurred the previous summer during Copa América, which Argentina won at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami against Colombia.

Like a year ago, the organizers' main excuse has been the lack of time they've had to change the turf on fields that typically use a synthetic or hybrid surface to a natural one, which is the most commonly used in Europe and South America.

Even more worrying has been the extreme heat under which some of the matches have had to be played, during midday slots for kick-off in the middle of summer. This is an issue directly related to scheduling matches for television audiences in other countries and continents.

Sergio Marchi, president of FIFPro, the most important international players' association, harshly criticized the tournament and has already issued a warning to Swiss-Italian FIFA president Gianni Infantino ahead of the World Cup.

As FIFA's Club World Cup unfolded across U.S. stadiums in June and July, empty seats told a story that FIFA's $50 million in promotional ads did not. The soccer tournament featured 63 matches in 11 U.S. cities, with President Donald Trump announcing he will attend the final match on Sunday.

The Club World Cup was meant to preview and generate excitement about the FIFA 2026 World Cup, the men's soccer tournament coming to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. This is supposed to be the largest and most inclusive sporting event ever, featuring teams and fans from 48 countries.

But the message from FIFA about the World Cup being the most inclusive ever was drowned out by the sound of Immigration and Customs Enforcement boots on the streets and sidewalks, including at stadiums.

Trump's enthusiasm for hosting the largest global sporting event conflicts with his zeal for detaining and ejecting immigrants and foreign visitors. While U.S. immigration abuses escalate, FIFA president Gianni Infantino is still claiming that “millions of visitors” will be coming to the 48-nation World Cup next year.

Indeed, Trump has ramped up preparations by naming himself chair of “The White House Task Force on the FIFA World Cup 2026.” As the tournament kicked off, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) posted on social media: “Let the games begin! The first FIFA Club World Cup games start on June 14th in Miami… CBP will be suited and booted and ready to provide security for the first round of games.”

Intentionally or not, this language instilled fear in fans—both those living in the U.S., and those who considered traveling to the country for the games. The CBP post was later deleted, but the damage was done.

In another own goal, a 2026 World Cup countdown boat party hosted by Telemundo, one of the official broadcasters for the games, was cancelled on June 12 after U.S. Coast Guard and CBP officers interrupted the festivities, which included Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and FIFA officials. The mayor told the media: “Unfortunately, at a time our community should have been celebrating, the event had to be abruptly canceled due to a joint operation with Homeland Security and the Coast Guard.”

Instead of soccer fostering inclusion and global harmony, Trump's immigration policies are telling the world to stay away—as well as inspiring fear in those who live here. The Trump administration's enthusiasm for hosting one of the world's largest sporting events may conflict with the administration's zeal for detaining and ejecting both immigrants and foreign visitors.

Los Angeles, a host city for the 2026 World Cup, became ground zero for the clash between a welcoming global sporting event and immigration roundups. As the Club World Cup tournament unfolded, thousands of federal agents were roaming the streets of Southern California, seizing people from their workplaces, markets, and other places of daily life, terrorizing entire communities and forcing people into hiding. In response, protesters took to the streets to condemn the ramped-up ICE raids. At Dodger stadium in Los Angeles, ICE agents reportedly only left the property when stadium owners insisted.

The 2026 World Cup will depend on workers in stadiums, hotels where fans stay, and at fan zones and restaurants. It also depends on players, fans, families and ordinary people in host cities feeling safe. Yet the impact of ICE raids across Southern California is that immigrants fear going to work, church, school, markets, or simply stepping outside, much less working at or attending a sporting event.

A Trump executive order that took effect June 9 bars people from 12 countries from entering the U.S. Now the Trump administration is reportedly considering expanding this ban to cover as many as 36 additional countries. Athletes and coaches from qualifying countries are excluded from the ban, but if implemented, fans from 48 of FIFA's 211 member associations—almost one quarter of all the participating countries—would be prohibited from entering the U.S. to watch the matches.

As the 2026 World Cup approaches, the world is watching to see whether the U.S. will honor its commitments to host a truly global tournament under a human rights framework.

In July, more than 90 human rights and civil rights groups including Athlete Ally, the NAACP, the ACLU, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the AFL-CIO wrote to FIFA president Infantino to call out escalating risks around the 2026 World Cup. It is now clear that without pressure from FIFA, the 2026 World Cup could be marred by scenes of fans, families and host city residents caught up in immigration sweeps. Even for the most loyal fan, no soccer match is worth risking detention, interrogation, family separation and deportation.

A major takeaway from the Club World Cup is that the U.S. role as a host nation is creating enormous risks. All World Cup hosts accept the responsibility to welcome the world. Trump's policies may transform that invitation into a classic soccer feint: promising a warm global celebration, while heading towards an icy human rights chill.

The Reds are once again investing a fortune in a forward of undoubted potential, but very little experience

Three years ago, Liverpool paid an initial £64 million ($86m) for Darwin Nunez, a young striker with just one prolific season under his belt. The gamble did not pay off. On the contrary, it backfired badly, with the Uruguayan now regarded as one of the most disappointing deals in the club's history.

It's fascinating, then, that Liverpool have now committed even more money to signing another forward with a less impressive CV than that of Nunez back in 2022.

So, why were the Reds willing to stump up an initial £69m ($92.7m) for Hugo Ekitike? And what chance does he have of succeeding where Nunez failed so spectacularly?

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

A busy opening day of ATP Washington action is scheduled. Huge-serving Reilly Opelka's attempt to find form in home conditions against the qualifier Murphy Cassone is among the matches. We here at LWOT predict all 11 contests between three articles, including Jenson Brooksby vs Yoshihito Nishioka and Cameron Norrie vs Billy Harris. Which players do you think will win?

Head-to-head: First meeting

O'Connell has struggled this season, with a 7-15 win/loss record at ATP Tour level. 21-year-old Quinn sits at a career-high ranking of No. 82 after making a breakthrough in 2025. Although O'Connell is still ranked five spots higher, I like Quinn's chances in this contest. He usually enjoys playing in front of home American crowds, and his Australian opponent will need to be much more solid than in recent months to have a chance.
Prediction: Quinn in 2

Head-to-head: First meeting

Muller is on a five-match losing streak. Drawing a qualifier ranked outside the Top 100 is a matchup he was probably happy with, but Zhukayev has played some good tennis lately. The Kazakhstani reached a maiden Grand Slam main draw at Wimbledon a few weeks ago. Muller's experience and more complete game still make him a slight favorite, but a victory for Zhukayev would not be surprising.
Prediction: Muller in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

After making a promising start on grass by making the semifinal at the Libema Open, Opelka must have been disappointed not to make a deep run at the Queen's Club, in Eastbourne, or at Wimbledon on a surface that suits him. However, fast hard courts like those in Washington also suit the massive server. Qualifier and world No. 191 Cassone will not be used to playing someone who serves that big. I doubt that the 22-year-old, inexperienced at ATP Tour level, will be able to create many break chances or stop Opelka from manufacturing chances on return.
Prediction: Opleka in 2

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are the two dominant forces on the ATP Tour in 2025.

Sinner has just won the Wimbledon title, beating Alcaraz in the final to confirm that they have now shared the last seven consecutive Grand Slam titles.

The last man not called Sinner or Alcaraz to win a Grand Slam singles title was Novak Djokovic, who won the 2023 US Open.

However, with Djokovic now moving closer to retirement, another ATP player has made his claim as a potential contender to the dominant duo of Sinner and Alcaraz.

That player is world number nine Holger Rune, who lost in the first round of Wimbledon this year.

Since then, Rune has been spotted working with Andre Agassi ahead of his return to the matchcourt at the Washington Open.

When speaking to Tennis.com ahead of the ATP 500 tournament, Rune was asked how far he thinks he is away from the level of Sinner and Alcaraz.

While claiming that some players were still very far away, Rune suggested that his top level is actually not that distant from Sinner and Alcaraz, highlighting how consistent they are as the big difference.

“I think [the gap] is very distant for some, but for some others, they're not that far away,” said Rune. “I'm going to include myself when I say we're not that far away. 

“I see my high end of tennis to be really, really high, so I just have to lift the button, really, and stay more consistent to win more matches. I do need to stop feeling like I need to play spectacular tennis all the time to beat them.”

A post shared by Holger Vitus Nødskov Rune (@holgerrune)

As Rune continued to show confidence in his own ability, the Dane admitted that he was not satisfied just being a top 10 player and instead wanted to reach the summit of the ATP rankings.

“It all comes down to what you want. If you're happy to stick around and be No. 5, 10, 15, or 20 in the world, some players can do that without doing more,” explained the 22-year-old. 

“That's not really my goal. My goal was always to be No. 1; it still is, and I believe I can do it. I also believe there's a few things I need to do differently. That's one of the reasons why I reached out to Andre, to hear his point of view.

“It obviously does help my confidence to know I've shown a level that can beat Carlos, Jannik, and Novak. That helps the belief, of course. On the other hand, there's a difference between just beating them and making it into those big finals week in, week out. That's one of my goals now.”

Rune was once seen as Sinner and Alcaraz's biggest contender, with suggestions of a new ‘big three' being thrown around.

However, he has been unable to get anywhere near his rivals so far, having won a quarter of their number of titles.

Rune did beat Alcaraz earlier this year to win the Barcelona Open, but his Spanish opponent was physically hampered in that match.

Backing up Rune's previous claim, his biggest career success to date came when he won the Paris Masters title as a teenager in 2022, showing that his top level is very high.

Rune will be hoping to justify his claim once again at the Washington Open, where he is the third seed.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Novak Djokovic's comments come true after Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz make decision before the US Open","https://tennishead.net/novak-djokovic-has-already-been-proven-right-after-carlos-alcaraz-and-jannik-sinner-withdraw-from-the-toronto-open/","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The field at the Toronto Open is looking a little sparse this year, with some of the top-seeded male players withdrawing ahead of the tournament.

On Sunday, it was reported that Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic and Jack Draper withdrew from the tournament for various reasons.

This means four of the top six-ranked ATP players will not compete in Toronto, leaving Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz as the top seeds.

Draper has revealed a new injury to his left arm, while Sinner has said he needs to ‘prioritise' his health. After the Wimbledon final, Alcaraz said he would prioritise rest and listen to his body.

The exodus has been simply shocking. The absence of these players will leave a massive hole at the tournament, while disappointing fans who may have travelled far to watch their favourite players perform.

A number of players have discussed the issue of burnout on the ATP Tour, complaining about a packed ATP Tour schedule. In the last year, Carlos Alcaraz, Alex de Minaur and Alexander Zverev have all commented on the matter.

World number 10 Andrey Rublev also admitted he had been struggling with depression in recent years, and had utilised antidepressants for a year. Former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic has also noted an issue with antidepressants on tour.

Earlier in July, Novak Djokovic spoke about the issue, and he has been proven entirely correct after the mass withdrawals from Toronto.

Speaking to Sport Klub's Sasa Ozmo at the start of July, Djokovic conveyed his thoughts regarding players feeling burnt out or turning to antidepressants.

Djokovic said: “The first thing that comes to mind is that social media is extremely present and largely dictates the mood and daily rhythm of an athlete – especially young ones, but older ones too. 

“Everyone is on social media, and you can get lost there, get too attached to comments, to what someone types on a keyboard or phone… and that hurts. It's not trivial. That's something we need to talk about seriously.”

I asked Novak #Djokovic why so many tennis players feel burnt out or turn to antidepressants: 1️⃣ “The first thing that comes to mind is that social media is extremely present and largely dictates the mood and daily rhythm of an athlete — especially young ones, but older ones…

“There are various other factors. The fact is, in my opinion, that kids are pushed too early into strict professionalism, before they've developed emotional intelligence, which is part of psychological preparation for life. 

“When a talent is spotted, they push them professionally — just play, play, play — and then all sorts of agents latch on, those with interest in success, and they push the player to play as much as possible so they earn more. 

“It's a vicious circle, and if a player gets a bit lost in that, it can strongly affect their psyche and how they live their life.

“Tennis has the longest season of all global sports. For most who play the full schedule, it's from January 1 to late November. 

“Other sports have more competitions now too, but tennis is individual — there are no substitutes, no ‘I don't feel good today, can you sub in for me for five minutes so I can rest'… Here, every point matters, every day matters. 

“If you want to reach the highest heights, you have to transform your entire life in service of tennis and sport. You lose yourself, it's too big of a bite for most.”

It is worth noting that Djokovic himself has withdrawn from Toronto. However, this must be put into context as he is reaching the twilight of his career and has a legitimate reason to prioritise certain events over others in order to extend his career.

On Sunday, 18-time Grand Slam winner Chris Evert weighed in on Djokovic's comments from earlier in July.

Evert noted that Djokovic's summary of the burnout and antidepressant situation was a ‘tremendous answer.'

It remains to be seen if any other top ATP players will withdraw from Toronto. However, the schedule has clearly become an issue for many players.

Tremendous answer…👍 https://t.co/3TM5yU2SGt

If fans are often left wanting due to the consistent withdrawal of players from major tournaments, then a rethink of the schedule may be in order.

Dan Evans, former British number one, hit out at those complaining about the tour schedule when speaking to the BBC at the 2025 Queen's Club Championships.

He said: “I think first and foremost we're in a fortunate position.

“When I hear about the schedule [complaints], these guys don't have to play every week. You are allowed to not play. The reason they play is so they pick up their bonus pool.”

After beating Frances Tiafoe in the first round, he added: “Everybody is entitled to their opinion on the schedule, but the tour has been like that for however many years.

“The top, top guys schedule properly, and that's, you know, that's I guess what's part of the issue, I imagine, is how people schedule how many weeks they want to play, how many weeks they don't want to play.

“Me personally, I see the weeks before Grand Slams are way stronger than they were maybe ten years ago. There is more top players playing. I don't know if that's to try and pick up cheap points, but, you know, there are these massive teams now.

“They are allowed to have some input into it. There are loads of weeks in the year you can take off or train or whatnot. That's up to them.

“Anybody outside the top 15 don't have those views, because the bottom line is anybody outside the top 15 need to play every week. People need working opportunities. If you are at 60 in the world with more than two people on your staff each week, you need to make money.

“So you can't just not have tournaments every week. They need tournaments. That's it. Can't just listen to the top guys on scheduling. Just because they are better than us at tennis doesn't mean their voice is louder to talk.

“That's what I'll say. I'm more than happy to have the conversation with whoever wants it.”

The factor of exhibition matches must also be acknowledged. Players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have found time to compete in exhibition events in the last year, then later withdrawing from tour events.

This raises the matter of the players' prioritisation of their own schedule before taking issue with the ATP Tour schedule. Andrea Gaudenzi, Executive Chairman of the ATP Tour, discussed this matter in December 2024.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

The North American hard-court swing heats up in a big way with this week's Mubadala Citi Open in Washington, D.C. It is an ATP 500 tournament–and it is without question one of the best 500s of the entire year.Among those taking their talents to the nation's capital are Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti, Holger Rune, Ben Shelton, Andrey Rublev, Frances Tiafoe, Alex de Minaur, Daniil Medvedev, Flavio Cobolli, and Gael Monfils. Needless to say, there are no easy draws–and that starts at the top with Taylor Fritz. The fourth-ranked American could kick off his week with a rematch of his Wimbledon first-round showdown against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, whom he defeated in five sets on his eventual way to the semifinals. Fritz could meet Lorenzo Sonego in the third round, Rublev in the quarters, and Shelton or Tiafoe in the semis. Shelton and Tiafoe are on a collision course for what would be a blockbuster quarterfinal battle surely on Friday night, but seeds Flavio Cobolli and Gabriel Diallo could have something to say about that.The bottom half of the bracket features Musetti, Rune, De Minaur, Medvedev, Monfils, Jiri Lehecka, and Alex Michelsen. Monfils is unseeded, so he could be a tough second-round test for Alexei Popyrin prior to possibly facing a struggling Medvedev in the last 16. Musetti, who has been less than 100 percent physically since Roland Garros, will likely open in D.C. against Wimbledon quarterfinalist Cameron Norrie.

Quarterfinal predictions: Andrey Rublev over Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe over Ben Shelton, Gael Monfils over Alex Michelsen, and Alex de Minaur over Brandon NakashimaSemifinals: Rublev over Tiafoe and De Minaur over MonfilsFinal: De Minaur over Rublev    82Who will win Washington, D.C.?

de Minaur

We have the same champ Ricky, let's hope it's a good thing.

I'm very surprised Fritz is here only taking 1 week off, since he emptied his tank and then some on the grass, probably not fully recovered yet, I didn't think he'd play until Cincy, probably won't do much at the US if he's playing here, Canada and Cincy. 

Musetti is most likely fully fit now if he's playing here.

Did Fritz not have two weeks since Wimby?
As for Musetti, hard to say , injuries can linger, other thing is the heat and humidity in Washington. I'd say Tiafoe a good bet as usually highly motivated here and US hard courts generally.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

The ATP is finally back Stateside for the ATP Washington Open. Sebastian Korda won the '24 ATP Washington Open over Flavio Cobolli in three sets. Korda won't be competing this time around, so it's anyone's game. Here are my best bets for the first round of action at ATP Washington. Let me know whether you agree in the comment section.    

H2H: 1-0

Quentin Halys last played Aleksandar Kovacevic in the quarterfinals of the 2023 Phoenix Challenger. Halys took the match in three sets on a hardcourt. While this is Halys' first time at the ATP Washington Open, it will be the second appearance for Kovacevic, who made the round of 16 last year. Kovacevic is 28-20 on the year with two tournament titles, one main and one lower-level. Halys hasn't seen the winner's podium since 2023 in singles competition.

Best Bet to Make

Entering the match, Halys is a slight favorite with the books. This seems a little weird to me since he is 17-19 this year, and he hasn't impressed in any tournament since February. Kovacevic isn't Carlos Alcaraz or anything, but he's coming off a final loss at Los Cabos right before this. He's playing some solid tennis in 2025, too. He's been to four finals, and he's 2-2 in those finals. When it comes to hardcourt and indoor surfaces, Kovacevic seems to be more comfortable. Since he's coming off a final and playing on his preferred surface, I'm running with Kovacevic.

That being said, Kovacevic winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Kovacevic winning @2.00 @Bet365

H2H: 1-0

Neither Aleksandar Vukic nor Giovanni Mpetshi-Perricard is having a banner year in the sport. The two are a combined 26-37 on the year, with each having 13 wins apiece. Mpetshi-Perricard isn't having nearly as bad of a year as Vukic, but at least he can say he's been to one final and one semifinal. Vukic has a lone semifinal to his name back in May. Mpetshi-Perricard has one prior appearance at Washington, but this is the third time Vukic has participated. Vukic is only 3-9 on hardcourt this year, which makes Mpetshi-Perricard's 5-5 look outstanding.



Best Bet to Make

Mpetshi-Perricard can be had at 1.65, and that's probably as good as you're going to get with this match. Vukic is nearly a full point off at 2.63 on Bet365. While Mpetshi-Perricard is 5-5 in his last ten matches, the same can be said for Vukic. Mpetshi-Perrricard has been a tad more reliable on hardcourt matches than Vukic, and that's really the defining difference between these two. In the nine hardcourt tournaments in which he's played, he's only won his opening round match twice.

That being said,  Mpetshi-Perricard winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Mpetshi-Perricard winning @1.65 @Betway

H2H: 1-1

Jaume Munar and Marcos Giron are both sitting in approximately the same position right now. While neither has had an awful year, they haven't had a great year either. Results-wise, Giron has had a slightly better year. He has four quarterfinal appearances, while Munar only has two semifinal appearances, and both of them occurred before February 9th, 2025. Since then, Munar hasn't advanced past the round of 16. Giron was in the quarterfinals at Eastbourne just last month. This is also Munar's first time playing in Washington, and it's the fourth appearance for Giron.

Best Bet to Make

At 9-6 on hardcourt this year, I'm taking Giron in this match. The books also have him as a favorite, and I agree. Consistency is a key part of Giron's game, and he gets the advantage of playing on his preferred surface. Did I mention he's also 312-190 on the surface? Munar is primarily a clay player, and he's only 71-96 overall on hardcourt. This is a hardcourt professional taking on someone out of his preferred element. It not only makes logical sense to pick Giron, but it also makes financial sense. You can either roll with Giron straight at 1.88 for a small profit or take him 2:0 for 2.9 on Betway. I'd take the match straight. 

That being said, Giron winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Giron winning @1.88 @Pinnacle

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Serena Williams' former coach calls for tennis rule change that would have seen Carlos Alcaraz lose Roland Garros final","https://tennishead.net/serena-williams-former-coach-calls-for-tennis-rule-change-that-would-have-seen-carlos-alcaraz-lose-roland-garros-final/","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 07:30:00 GMT","

Tennis has once again been told to employ a rule change which would completely transform the men's game.

After all, following Iga Swiatek's bruising Wimbledon win over Amanda Anisimova earlier this month, crushing her in the final 6-0, 6-0, there was a great debate that raged in the aftermath.

Some argued that, had the women played best-of-five set matches, the American would have had more time to settle, thus creating a more even match and a greater spectacle for the fans.

Instead, it was a whitewash, with the youngster brushed aside in under an hour.

And yet, Rick Macci, famed for his spell coaching Serena and Venus Williams, has suggested that it is not the women's format that should change. 

Taking to X, he proposed an alternative theory that would instead see the men's format changed forever.

His argument posited that injury and fatigue lessen the spectacle of their tour, and five-hour battles fought over five gruelling sets contribute massively to this.

Many chirping that the Women should play 3 out of 5 at the Slams. Can they? Yes. Should they ? No. The reason is matches will be won /lost over the tournament because of injury. What should happen is the men should play two out of three because many matches lost because of a…

Macci did state that women could quite easily play best-of-five set matches if needed, but argued that they shouldn't, as it would reduce tournaments to battles of fitness and recovery rather than technical superiority.

He even tagged Novak Djokovic at the end, seemingly suggesting this claim for his benefit.

After all, the Serbian superstar did admit after his loss in the Wimbledon semi-finals that he just cannot compete physically with the youthful energy of Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner in the latter stages of these events.

If Macci's proposed change were to be enacted, it would change so much about the sport.

Not least, it would effectively rewrite history, given how many Grand Slam matches, and finals, were won when the eventual victor found themselves two sets to love or two sets to one down.

The most recent example would be Alcaraz's infamous French Open final triumph, where he mounted the most remarkable of comebacks to overturn a two-set-to-love deficit against Sinner.

Delving further back, and in the Italian's first-ever Grand Slam final, he was two sets to love down against Daniil Medvedev before he fought back to win the title.

Even Alexander Zverev, who is widely regarded as the best player never to have won a major, would now have two titles under his belt.

This change, had it always been the case, would also have rewritten historic matches like Andy Roddick's 2009 Wimbledon final loss to Roger Federer, allowing the latter no time for a comeback.

It also would have cut short iconic thrillers like Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer's 2008 Wimbledon final, or 2017 Australian Open final too.

Reducing the length of the matches in Masters 1000 events made sense, and has been received well in recent years.

But to remove that allure from Grand Slams would be a crying shame.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","John McEnroe faces backlash for 'nonsense' comments about Rafael Nadal","https://www.the-express.com/sport/tennis/177994/john-mcenroe-rafael-nadal-sinner","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 06:56:53 GMT","



Ivan Ljubicic, Roger Federer's ex-coach, has fired back at John McEnroe for spouting ""nonsense"" when he claimed that either Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz could have beaten Rafael Nadal in his prime at the French Open. McEnroe's statement came after the thrilling Roland-Garros showdown between Sinner and Alcaraz last month.

The epic five-set match saw Alcaraz, rally from two sets behind and save three Championship points to take his second French Open title and fifth major overall. Sinner, another rising star, got his revenge by outplaying Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final earlier this month, adding a fourth Grand Slam to his collection.

After the Paris clash, McEnroe told TNT Sports that with the best versions of Sinner and Alcaraz, either of them might be considered favorite against Nadal on clay, even when Nadal was in his prime.

McEnroe said: ""You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now - I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Nadal on clay - you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best.""

However, he isn't sure they'll break the record of most titles: ""Do I think they're going to reach 20, 24 titles either one of them? No. Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible; there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen.""



McEnroe recently expressed his admiration for the impressive performances of Alcaraz and Sinner, saying: ""But these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.""

However, some interpreted his remarks as a slight against tennis legend Rafael Nadal, who won an incredible 14 French Open titles before retiring.

Former tennis pro Ljubicic, coach to Nadal's longtime rival Roger Federer from 2016 to 2022, took issue with McEnroe's statement.

Ljubicic said: ""It was a very, very, very good final. And the drama was perfect with the match points saved. But people always exaggerate.

""John McEnroe said Nadal wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys. That's nonsense. We haven't seen the best of Alcaraz and Sinner yet. They still have a lot of room for improvement.

""But I don't think they're ahead just yet. I sometimes watch matches from 2005, 2008, 2012, 2015 [between] Roger and Rafa. That was already incredible tennis.""

When Alcaraz defeated Cameron Norrie in the Wimbledon quarterfinals, McEnroe addressed his earlier comments on BBC One, seemingly backpedaling: ""I made a comment during the French [Open] where I said these guys [Alcaraz and Sinner] would have a shot... I didn't say they would beat Nadal every time.

""I said the fact that you would think these two players would actually go onto the court really believing they could do it - with Nadal in his prime - it shows you how much the level of the game has changed even in a couple of years.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Plans to expand Wimbledon can go ahead, judge rules","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyr7e394p0o","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:07:20 GMT","

Plans to almost triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site are set to proceed after a campaign group's legal challenge against the decision to grant planning permission was dismissed by a High Court judge.

The proposal which had been approved by the Greater London Authority (GLA) includes thirty-eight new tennis courts and an 8-thousand seat stadium.

Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) had argued in court the development on the former Wimbledon Park Golf Club in west London was unlawful as the proposed land was protected.

Deborah Jevans, chairwoman of the All England Club, said she was ""delighted"" with the decision while the SWP indicated it may challenge the ruling.

Barristers for SWP told the High Court earlier this month that the decision to approve the plans was ""irrational"" and should be quashed, as Wimbledon Park - a Grade II*-listed heritage site partly designed by Lancelot ""Capability"" Brown - was covered by restrictions on how it could be used.

The GLA and the All England Club defended the challenge, with the court told that the decision was a ""planning judgment properly exercised"" and that the restrictions were not ""material"".

Dismissing the challenge, Mr Justice Saini said: ""In short, the defendant's decision on the relevance of deliverability, applying to both the statutory trust and the restrictive covenants, was a planning judgment rationally exercised and having regard to appropriate and relevant factors.""

The proposals would see seven maintenance buildings, access points, and an area of parkland with permissive public access constructed, in addition to the courts and associated infrastructure.

It would also allow the club to host Wimbledon qualifiers on site.

Following the ruling on Monday, SWP said it has been ""advised that it should"" seek to challenge the decision, and that it believed the GLA ""did make a significant legal error in the way it dealt with the special legal status of the park"".

After Merton Council approved the plans, but Wandsworth Council rejected them, City Hall took charge of the application.

Sir Sadiq Khan recused himself from the process after previously expressing public support for the development and planning permission for the scheme was granted by Jules Pipe, London's deputy mayor for planning.

He said that the proposals ""would facilitate very significant benefits"" which ""clearly outweigh the harm"".

Ms Jevans said at the time that the proposals would deliver 27 acres (11 hectares) of ""newly accessible parkland for the community"".

In written submissions, Sasha White KC said that the All England Club acquired the freehold for the golf course in 1993 and the leasehold in 2021.

The barrister told the two-day hearing that the land was subject to a ""statutory trust requiring it to be kept available for public recreation use"" and that when the freehold was acquired, the club entered into ""restrictive covenants"" governing its use.

He said this meant any plans could not ""restrict its use so as not to impair the appreciation of the general public of the extent or openness of the golf course land"".

He continued that separate High Court proceedings were ongoing over whether a statutory trust existed, and that if it does, the All England Club has ""accepted"" that this is ""incompatible with the development of the proposal"".

A hearing in that case is due to take place in January 2026.

In court, he said: ""You could not have a more protected piece of land within the planning system, frankly.""

Mark Westmoreland Smith KC, for the GLA, said in written submissions that Mr Pipe received ""detailed advice"" over the ""relevance"" of the ""alleged"" trust and covenants, and made his decision on the assumption that they existed.

The barrister said that the decision was a ""planning judgment properly exercised and having regard to the appropriate and relevant factors"".

He said that planning officers ""advised that the alleged obstacle"" that the restrictions would present ""was not itself a material consideration"".

In his written arguments, Russell Harris KC, for the All England Club, said that planning officers ""acknowledged and had regard to"" the trust and covenants.

In his 31-page ruling, Mr Justice Saini said that the authority ""properly considered the implications of the development on public open space"".

Christopher Coombe, director of SWP, said following the judgment: ""This judgment would, if it stands, set a worrying precedent for the unwanted development of protected green belt and public open spaces around London and across the country.""

Sir Sadiq said the ruling was ""welcome news"" that will ""cement Wimbledon's reputation as the greatest tennis competition in the world"".

Ms Jevans said: ""It is clear that we have a robust planning permission that enables us to create a permanent home for the Wimbledon qualifying competition as well as delivering 27 acres of beautiful new parkland for local people, providing public access to land that has been a private golf course for over 100 years.""

At the Wimbledon post-tournament party, ‘The Champions' Dinner', Iga Swiatek, the winner of women's title, bedazzled in a lilac Stella McCartney gown that was reportedly worth over $2,000 (approximately Rs 1.7 lakh). But who dresses the Wimbledon champions? 

Town And Country magazine reports that the styling is done by Elisabeth Piner, the stylist and owner of ‘Having a ball dress hire', a company that rents out dresses for formal affairs. She sets up a full-service salon inside centre court in an empty space across the hall from the ladies' locker room. 

“We've got everything, we kit them out from top to toe,” Piner told Town And Country. She and her team reached the club at 8 am on the morning of the ball, “with a car full of hundreds of dresses in multiple sizes; 50 to 60 pairs of shoes; jewellery including diamonds and colored stones; and an assortment of handbags”, the magazine reported. The Champions' Dinner is held at the lavish Raffles London. 

“Because we don't know who will win the tournament we choose styles that perhaps can be flexible, perhaps they have a lace up back or are more or less an average size,” she says. “The jewellery is easier because it's one size. We try to choose items that are just glamorous and ready to compliment the dresses … Most of the footwear and accessories are carefully selected for comfort, elegance, and reliability under pressure,” she said. “The jewellery ranges from contemporary pieces to vintage-inspired.” The magazine noted that she ‘ also tries to guess which players are most likely to make it to the finals and gather looks that might suit their individual styles'.
 
“The room is totally transformed into a glamorous, lovely boutique with all these wonderful dresses,” Piner said. “It's a tennis locker room with rails of silk and sparkle.”

Wimbledon doesn't offer this kind of service to the men's winners, letting their individual sponsor attire them. Sinner had worn a custom dark Gucci suit, with signature loafers. 

Sinner and Iga would dance, though it wasn't initially part of the plan. “Yes I mean we were there and, in the beginning, they told us that because it was quite late that we don't have to do it and then Iga told me, no, no, let's do it and I was like OK,” said Sinner. “Its a tradition. So it's good to make that happen. And yea it was nice to share that moment with Iga. And it's yeah, a beautiful moment,” Sinner shared later with BBC Sport. 

On the ‘Nothing Major' podcast, the American tennis player Sam Querrey shared more details from the night. 

“It's in the city. At that hour, there is no traffic, so it's like 25 minutes. They have a cocktail party, and then you go down to the dinner, where it's set up beautifully. Laura Robson hosted, and she went up and gave a speech. You have some appetisers, and then Iga showed up at 10:30 pm.

“She came in, and you stand up. They made this cool video up on the Jumbotron. She holds up her trophy, and then you sit down.“Sinner came at 00:05. I did not care, but he was just in the back hammering drinks with his team, having a good time. He came out with the trophy, and at some point, Laura Robson brought them both on stage. She does a Q&A with Iga and Jannik pretty quickly. And there was a rumour they were not going to have to dance, and the crowd peer pressured them into dancing.“It was good, though. Jannik did a good job; he was feeling good and made it really fun. He started twirling Iga, and then 45 seconds in, they were done dancing and went back to the table … You had unbelievable food, wine,” Querrey shared.

Iga Swiatek and Jessica Pegula had very different experiences at Wimbledon this year.

Swiatek won the Wimbledon title for the first time in her career, culminating in an emphatic final victory over Amanda Anisimova.

While in one of the biggest shocks of the opening round, Pegula lost to Elisabetta Cocciaretto in the first round.

Before Wimbledon even happened this year, Pegula told Swiatek something when they played in the final of the grass court tournament in Bad Homburg.

The only grass court tournament that Swiatek played before Wimbledon this year was in Bad Homburg.

Swiatek would reach her first grass court final at the WTA 500 tournament, before losing to Pegula in straight sets.

Pegula was full of praise for Swiatek after that final, and she has now pointed out how much the Pole's serve had noticeably improved when they played.

“I thought she was serving a lot bigger,” Pegula said in her pre-tournament press conference at the Washington Open. “I didn't really watch her much during Wimbledon. I'm not sure if that was better.

“But she was serving really big in Bad Homburg and playing good tennis and beat good grass court players. I thought our final was a really high level. It was super close. 

“You know she is always kind of down on herself about grass, and I was like, ‘Hey, you're playing really good on grass, ‘I'm not really sure why you think you're bad on grass or what it is'. 

“So it was kind of funny she ended up winning Wimbledon. I was like, of course I said that and we had that moment when we played in the final and then she wins Wimbledon, but that's just tennis for you.

“You never kind of know. She's a great player anyway, so she's going to be good on any surface. But yeah, it is interesting for…tennis is weird. You have a lot of weird things that happen over the course of two weeks.”

Question to No. 1 seed Jess Pegula from @vanshv2kGiven that you beat Iga in the final of BadHomburg, what was your level of surprise at her winning Wimbledon in the manner that she did? What did you notice about her specifically on the grass that was maybe different this year? pic.twitter.com/uzdoq2bqH0

The serve is not the only change that was noticed about the Wimbledon champion on grass this year, with a different American pinpointing another improvemnt in Swiatek.

Despite losing the Bad Homburg final in straight sets, Swiatek's improved serve was certainly effective after hitting nine aces past Pegula.

Number of aces and second serve win percentage were the only two things that Swiatek did better in the Bad Homburg final compared to her average at Wimbledon.

At Wimbledon, Swiatek won significantly more points on first serve and on average was broken less than a game per match.

While grass courts are supposed to help serving, Swiatek will be hoping that she can continue her improved numbers on the North American hard court swing.

Another goal of the world number three will be to gain ranking points, as Swiatek looks to close the gap on Aryna Sabalenka.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Wimbledon has won the latest battle in a war with local residents over its £200 million expansion plans.

Following a judicial review, a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge to last year's decision by the Greater London Authority (GLA) to approve the landmark development.

But campaigners immediately announced their intention to appeal against the verdict as the bitter dispute dragged on. A separate legal row over the scheme also remains unresolved.

Monday's judgment by Mr Justice Saini was delivered less than two weeks after a two-day hearing into the GLA's decision to allow the All England Club (AELTC) to build 39 new tennis courts, including an 8,000-seater show court, on the site of the neighbouring Wimbledon Park Golf Club.

The development of a golf course that shut four years ago would allow Wimbledon to bring its qualifying tournament in-house and effectively extend the Championships by a week.

The Save Wimbledon Park campaign group (SWP) had argued the decision by the Sir Sadiq Khan-led GLA was unlawful on three grounds. Firstly, that the legal status of the land was in dispute and planning permission should not be granted until that was resolved. Secondly and thirdly, that the decision breached the Government's National Planning Policy Framework in relation to “heritage assets” and “sports and recreation” respectively.

All three grounds were dismissed by Mr Justice Saini.

AELTC chair Debbie Jevans said: “We are delighted that Mr Justice Saini has dismissed the challenge to the GLA's decision to grant planning permission for our plans to transform the former Wimbledon Park golf course.

“It is clear that we have a robust planning permission that enables us to create a permanent home for the Wimbledon Qualifying Competition as well as delivering 27 acres of beautiful new parkland for local people, providing public access to land that has been a private golf course for over 100 years.

“We have spoken to more than 10,000 people who have taken the time to come in person and understand our plans in detail. The vast majority of people just want us to get on and deliver the many benefits on offer as soon as possible.

As well as a potential appeal, the Wimbledon expansion project is subject to separate High Court proceedings over whether the land was subject to a “statutory trust” requiring it to be kept available for public recreation use.

On that issue, Jevans added: “We now turn our attention to separate legal proceedings to give everyone reassurance that there is not, nor has there ever been, a statutory trust over the former golf course land. This hearing is due to take place in January 2026.”

Khan, the Mayor of London, said: “This is welcome news that will cement Wimbledon's reputation as the greatest tennis competition in the world and London as the sporting capital of the world.

“This scheme will bring a significant range of economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits to the local area, the wider capital and the UK economy, creating new jobs and green spaces.

“Today's news comes following confirmation of London's bid for the World Athletics Championship in 2029, new plans to deliver a once-in-a-generation redevelopment of Crystal Palace National Sports Centre and the capital staging the Women's Rugby World Cup final this September, which will have a world-record attendance for a women's rugby event.”

SWP said in a statement: “Supporters of this campaign will be disappointed to learn that Mr Justice Saini has declined to overturn the GLA's planning decision of November 2024. SWP is grateful for the careful consideration given by the judge but has been advised that it should make an application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Initially this application will be made to the judge himself, but the Court of Appeal may also grant permission. SWP is not taking this step lightly but believes that the GLA did make a significant legal error in the way it dealt with the special legal status of the Park.”

Christopher Coombe, director of SWP added: “This judgment would, if it stands, set a worrying precedent for the unwanted development of protected green belt and public open spaces around London and across the country.

“The AELTC will surely have noted the considerable public outrage about this development, most recently expressed outside the law courts, and we continue to hope that they could be persuaded to engage constructively with us, with a view to achieving a resolution of this four-year-old dispute.”

SWP added: “Even if the planning decision is upheld, there are two other major legal protections for the park which property developers would find insurmountable. The AELTC has conceded that their planned development is incompatible with the statutory public recreation trust, which according to the GLA's own advice is present over the relevant land. The existence or otherwise of a statutory trust is the subject of entirely separate proceedings which are very much alive and progressing towards a major hearing next January.

“Whatever the outcome of these two court cases, the restrictive covenants preventing building and development remain firmly in place.

“As the judge remarked: ‘It is not in issue that the golf course land is the subject of restrictive covenants which require it to be kept open and free of built development.'

“The covenants were put in place in 1993 to ensure that the AELTC kept to its promise never to develop the land. Without that formal promise, AELTC would not have been able to purchase part of the freehold of the park in the first place. The AELTC scheme cannot proceed unless the covenants are released by Merton Council. The basis upon which Merton might perhaps lawfully release the covenant is very different from the considerations supporting the planning decision.

“SWP will continue, with the aid of its many supporters, to fight for the right future for Wimbledon Park.”

During this month's hearing, the AELTC had rejected fierce local opposition to the proposed development and promised it would “improve” the Championships.

That was after hundreds of campaigners gathered outside the court in a show of support for objections to planning consent that would treble the event's footprint.

On the eve of the hearing, Telegraph Sport detailed how Sir Ben Ainslie had been parachuted in to support the proposed expansion.

Britain's most successful Olympic sailor threw his weight behind the scheme, which includes transforming the sailing club on the sculpted lake that stands at the centre of the park.

Ainslie, a local resident, said: “I would love to muck in and see it become a real success.”

Plans to almost triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site are set to proceed after a campaign group's legal challenge against the decision to approve the proposals was dismissed by a High Court judge.

The proposals, submitted by the All England Club, would see the construction of 38 new tennis courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on the grounds of the former Wimbledon Park Golf Club, which would allow it to host Wimbledon qualifiers on site.

Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) took legal action against the Greater London Authority's (GLA) decision to grant planning permission last year.

Barristers for SWP told the High Court earlier this month that the decision to approve the plans was “irrational” and should be quashed, as Wimbledon Park – a Grade II*-listed heritage site partly designed by Lancelot “Capability” Brown – was covered by restrictions on how it could be used.

The GLA and the All England Club defended the challenge, with the court told that the decision was a “planning judgment properly exercised” and that the restrictions were not “material”.

In a ruling on Monday, Mr Justice Saini dismissed the challenge.

He said: “In short, the defendant's decision on the relevance of deliverability, applying to both the statutory trust and the restrictive covenants, was a planning judgment rationally exercised and having regard to appropriate and relevant factors.”

The proposals would see seven maintenance buildings, access points, and an area of parkland with permissive public access constructed, in addition to the courts and associated infrastructure.

They would also include work on Wimbledon Lake, which would involve building a boardwalk around and across it.

After Merton Council approved the plans, but Wandsworth Council rejected them, the Mayor of London's office took charge of the application, but Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan recused himself from the process after previously expressing public support for the development.

Planning permission for the scheme was granted by Jules Pipe, London's deputy mayor for planning, who said that the proposals “would facilitate very significant benefits” which “clearly outweigh the harm”.

Debbie Jevans, chair of the All England Club, said at the time that the proposals would deliver 27 acres of “newly accessible parkland for the community”, and would allow the qualifying tournament for Wimbledon – currently staged at Roehampton – to be held on site.

In written submissions, Sasha White KC said that the All England Club acquired the freehold for the golf course in 1993 and the leasehold in 2021.

The barrister told the two-day hearing in London that the land was subject to a “statutory trust requiring it to be kept available for public recreation use” and that when the freehold was acquired, the club entered into “restrictive covenants” governing its use.

He said this meant any plans could not “restrict its use so as not to impair the appreciation of the general public of the extent or openness of the golf course land”.

He continued that separate High Court proceedings were ongoing over whether a statutory trust existed, and that if it does, the All England Club has “accepted” that this is “incompatible with the development of the proposal”.

In court, he said: “You could not have a more protected piece of land within the planning system, frankly.”

Mark Westmoreland Smith KC, for the GLA, said in written submissions that Mr Pipe received “detailed advice” over the “relevance” of the “alleged” trust and covenants, and made his decision on the assumption that they existed.

The barrister said that the decision was a “planning judgment properly exercised and having regard to the appropriate and relevant factors”.

He said: “Officers advised that the alleged obstacle that they may present to delivery of the development was not itself a material consideration which should weigh against the grant of planning permission.”

In his written arguments, Russell Harris KC, for the All England Club, said that planning officers “acknowledged and had regard to” the trust and covenants, but deemed they were not “material”.

There are many questions surrounding Novak Djokovic ahead of the US Open this year.

Djokovic lost to Jannik Sinner in the Wimbledon semifinals this year, admitting that he felt physically fatigued in the latter stages of Grand Slams at this stage of his career.

This has created many questions, with some people including Nick Kyrgios predicting Djokovic to retire soon.

The next Grand Slam tournament is the US Open, where Djokovic won his 24th major title.

Steve Flink is an American sports journalist who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2017.

When discussing the US Open on Gill Gross's YouTube channel, Flink referred to Andy Roddick's recent comments on Djokovic before suggesting that a relatively early exit in New York could trigger a retirement decision.

Flink also criticised the conversation surrounding Djokovic trying to go ahead of Margaret Court as the player with the most Grand Slam singles titles.

Court also won 24 majors, but 13 of those came before the Open Era when tennis was less internationally competitive.

“It's going to be fascinating to see what he can summon for the US Open,” Flink said about Djokovic. “I heard Andy Roddick talking and his point was basically people shouldn't be telling him that if he loses in the round of 16 that's not okay, and how many people get to the round of 16. Projecting forward, maybe, I think was what he was trying to do.

“I think Novak can accept these last three, he's a little disappointed but proud to be in the semifinals. I think if he came to New York and didn't go that far and had a surprising loss in the round of 16 then I think he might think seriously to say there is no point. How is this going to get better next year? I am going to turn 39, why would my body react better?

“He started that press conference by saying that he believes he is as professional as anybody out there. He defied anybody to find someone who works harder or trains with such purpose as him and I don't think anybody would argue that point.

“But I think he has some standards and what I also don't understand is this quest for 25, it's perfectly understandable, you break the tie with Margaret Court. But that's a false argument, it's a phony target. Not from him but from the networks in a way, because they constantly put this photo up alongside Margaret.

“You are not competing against Margaret Court, she is not even in the conversation for the greatest women's tennis player of all time. Not even close. All the experts would put Martina [Navratilova], Steffi [Graf], Serena [Williams] and Chrissy [Evert] ahead of Margaret.

“She won a lot of cheap Australian Opens, and I don't want to knock her, but there were a lot of those fields which were really quite weak because a lot of times in those years – the Billie Jean's [King] and Maria Buenos wouldn't go over there and she could waltz through those draws in the way she could never do at Roland Garros, Wimbledon or the US.

“My point is that I think if Novak would just reflect a little bit and realise the record he was always chasing was to beat Rafa [Nadal] and Roger [Federer] and be the male leader and then suddenly it became a different discussion about how he has surpassed them but could he surpass Margaret Court?

“I think he could live very easily with some reflection and introspection and say to himself you know what does that really change things for me historically?

“The 100th title was worth it, it's a milestone, I thought it was worth the effort and I thought it was a big relief to win Geneva and get that out the way, but I honestly don't think he needs that 25th. I don't think that will change anything in terms of the historian's perception over where he belongs in the all time ladder.”

According to Flink's analysis, Djokovic could be facing retirement if what happened at the US Open last year occurs again at this year's tournament.

Last year, Djokovic lost to Alexei Popyrin in a shock third round exit at the New York major.

Djokovic had won Olympic gold in Paris in his last tournament before the US Open last year, and suggested that this could have played a part in his below par performance at Flushing Meadows.

“I don't know. Maybe, maybe. But it's a different surface. I mean, obviously it had an effect,” Djokovic said in his post-match press conference. “I spent a lot of energy winning the gold, and I did arrive to New York just not feeling fresh mentally and physically.

“But because it's US Open, you know, I gave it a shot and I tried my best. I mean, I didn't have any physical issues. I just felt out of gas, you know, and you could see that with the way I played.

“Just from the very beginning, from the first match, I just didn't find myself at all on this court. It's all I can say, you know. You know, life moves on. I mean, yeah, just try and recalibrate and look for what's next.”

It is unclear whether the Serbian will play any tournaments ahead of the US Open this year, with Djokovic already withdrawing from the Canadian Open.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Holger Rune hopes he can elevate his game after receiving advice from his new mentor, Andre Agassi. 

The Danish world No.8 was recently spotted having a hitting practice under the watchful eye of Agassi, who won 17 Masters 1000 and eight Grand Slam titles during his career. The collaboration aims to provide a sort of mentorship for Rune instead of a coach. Leading up to this week, the duo held a three-day training block. 

“I reached out to him some months ago,” Rune told tennis.com. “He's an amazing man, first of all, and he's very wise, as well. He sees the game in a unique way that I've never experienced before.”

“I thought now was a good moment to reach out to Agassi because my base is back and I'm playing well again. When you're changing coaches a lot, you don't play as well because you're not following one opinion or a single structure. I thought this was the right time to get some extra input…It's not anything magic, but he obviously had some very wise words I can use.”

Rune is hoping to bounce back in North America after a disappointing grass-court swing. At Wimbledon, he suffered a shock first round loss to Chile's Nicolas Jarry, who prevailed in five sets. He performed better at Queen's with a run to the quarter-finals before losing to Roberto Bautista Agut. Overall, his win-loss record for the season currently stands at 22-14 and he has won one title in Barcelona. 

As to why he approached Agassi, Rune explained that he had studied the American's game via YouTube and wanted a view to coincide with that of his current coach, Lars Christensen.

“Right now, I'm No. 8 in the world, and anything that can help me get higher in the rankings, I'm happy to hear and listen,” he said.

“I obviously have big potential and I know I can do a lot better. He was trying to help me achieve that. We're still in contact and everything, so those three days were a kind of beginning of feeling things out, him giving me some advice, and me trying to do it on the court to see how it feels. It was just very exciting to see his point of view.”

The 22-year-old has high aspirations for the future, and the hope is that Agassi will help him along the way. So far in his career, he has been ranked as high as fourth in the world and has won five ATP titles. His best results at the majors have been reaching the quarter-finals at the French Open twice and Wimbledon once. 

“If you're happy to stick around and be No. 5, 10, 15, or 20 in the world, some players can do that without doing more…My goal was always to be No. 1; it still is, and I believe I can do it,” he states.

“I also believe there's a few things I need to do differently. That's one of the reasons why I reached out to Andre, to hear his point of view.”

To reach the pinnacle of the sport, Rune needs to take on the dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who have won the last seven Grand Slams between them. 

“I think [the gap] is very distant for some, but for some others, they're not that far away,” Rune commented. “I'm going to include myself when I say we're not that far away. I see my high end of tennis to be really, really high, so I just have to lift the button, really, and stay more consistent to win more matches. I do need to stop feeling like I need to play spectacular tennis all the time to beat them.”

Rune is seeded third at this week's Citi Open.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Novak Djokovic's comments come true after Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz make decision before the US Open","https://tennishead.net/novak-djokovic-has-already-been-proven-right-after-carlos-alcaraz-and-jannik-sinner-withdraw-from-the-toronto-open/","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The field at the Toronto Open is looking a little sparse this year, with some of the top-seeded male players withdrawing ahead of the tournament.

On Sunday, it was reported that Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic and Jack Draper withdrew from the tournament for various reasons.

This means four of the top six-ranked ATP players will not compete in Toronto, leaving Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz as the top seeds.

Draper has revealed a new injury to his left arm, while Sinner has said he needs to ‘prioritise' his health. After the Wimbledon final, Alcaraz said he would prioritise rest and listen to his body.

The exodus has been simply shocking. The absence of these players will leave a massive hole at the tournament, while disappointing fans who may have travelled far to watch their favourite players perform.

A number of players have discussed the issue of burnout on the ATP Tour, complaining about a packed ATP Tour schedule. In the last year, Carlos Alcaraz, Alex de Minaur and Alexander Zverev have all commented on the matter.

World number 10 Andrey Rublev also admitted he had been struggling with depression in recent years, and had utilised antidepressants for a year. Former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic has also noted an issue with antidepressants on tour.

Earlier in July, Novak Djokovic spoke about the issue, and he has been proven entirely correct after the mass withdrawals from Toronto.

Speaking to Sport Klub's Sasa Ozmo at the start of July, Djokovic conveyed his thoughts regarding players feeling burnt out or turning to antidepressants.

Djokovic said: “The first thing that comes to mind is that social media is extremely present and largely dictates the mood and daily rhythm of an athlete – especially young ones, but older ones too. 

“Everyone is on social media, and you can get lost there, get too attached to comments, to what someone types on a keyboard or phone… and that hurts. It's not trivial. That's something we need to talk about seriously.”

I asked Novak #Djokovic why so many tennis players feel burnt out or turn to antidepressants: 1️⃣ “The first thing that comes to mind is that social media is extremely present and largely dictates the mood and daily rhythm of an athlete — especially young ones, but older ones…

“There are various other factors. The fact is, in my opinion, that kids are pushed too early into strict professionalism, before they've developed emotional intelligence, which is part of psychological preparation for life. 

“When a talent is spotted, they push them professionally — just play, play, play — and then all sorts of agents latch on, those with interest in success, and they push the player to play as much as possible so they earn more. 

“It's a vicious circle, and if a player gets a bit lost in that, it can strongly affect their psyche and how they live their life.

“Tennis has the longest season of all global sports. For most who play the full schedule, it's from January 1 to late November. 

“Other sports have more competitions now too, but tennis is individual — there are no substitutes, no ‘I don't feel good today, can you sub in for me for five minutes so I can rest'… Here, every point matters, every day matters. 

“If you want to reach the highest heights, you have to transform your entire life in service of tennis and sport. You lose yourself, it's too big of a bite for most.”

It is worth noting that Djokovic himself has withdrawn from Toronto. However, this must be put into context as he is reaching the twilight of his career and has a legitimate reason to prioritise certain events over others in order to extend his career.

On Sunday, 18-time Grand Slam winner Chris Evert weighed in on Djokovic's comments from earlier in July.

Evert noted that Djokovic's summary of the burnout and antidepressant situation was a ‘tremendous answer.'

It remains to be seen if any other top ATP players will withdraw from Toronto. However, the schedule has clearly become an issue for many players.

Tremendous answer…👍 https://t.co/3TM5yU2SGt

If fans are often left wanting due to the consistent withdrawal of players from major tournaments, then a rethink of the schedule may be in order.

Dan Evans, former British number one, hit out at those complaining about the tour schedule when speaking to the BBC at the 2025 Queen's Club Championships.

He said: “I think first and foremost we're in a fortunate position.

“When I hear about the schedule [complaints], these guys don't have to play every week. You are allowed to not play. The reason they play is so they pick up their bonus pool.”

After beating Frances Tiafoe in the first round, he added: “Everybody is entitled to their opinion on the schedule, but the tour has been like that for however many years.

“The top, top guys schedule properly, and that's, you know, that's I guess what's part of the issue, I imagine, is how people schedule how many weeks they want to play, how many weeks they don't want to play.

“Me personally, I see the weeks before Grand Slams are way stronger than they were maybe ten years ago. There is more top players playing. I don't know if that's to try and pick up cheap points, but, you know, there are these massive teams now.

“They are allowed to have some input into it. There are loads of weeks in the year you can take off or train or whatnot. That's up to them.

“Anybody outside the top 15 don't have those views, because the bottom line is anybody outside the top 15 need to play every week. People need working opportunities. If you are at 60 in the world with more than two people on your staff each week, you need to make money.

“So you can't just not have tournaments every week. They need tournaments. That's it. Can't just listen to the top guys on scheduling. Just because they are better than us at tennis doesn't mean their voice is louder to talk.

“That's what I'll say. I'm more than happy to have the conversation with whoever wants it.”

The factor of exhibition matches must also be acknowledged. Players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have found time to compete in exhibition events in the last year, then later withdrawing from tour events.

This raises the matter of the players' prioritisation of their own schedule before taking issue with the ATP Tour schedule. Andrea Gaudenzi, Executive Chairman of the ATP Tour, discussed this matter in December 2024.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Are the stars and stripes aligned for another American champion in the nation's capital?


After Sebastian Korda snapped a 17-year drought for home champions at the Mubadala Citi DC Open last year, the red, white and blue tide is in full force for this year's edition. Taylor Fritz leads the Americans in the field, while Ben Shelton and local hero Frances Tiafoe are also among those aiming to join the list of 12 different Americans who have lifted the trophy since the tournament began in 1969.




Nobody owned the capital quite like Andre Agassi. Across 10 visits in the ‘90s, he racked up as many titles as losses — five of each — cementing his dominance in the sweltering summer heat with a record haul, including a victory as World No. 1 in 1995. Michael Chang enjoyed a reign in the winner's circle sandwiched in between Agassi's ‘95 and ‘98 titles. Chang, former No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, was crowned champion in back-to-back years, ‘96 and ‘97.


At the turn of the century, young Americans such as Andy Roddick and James Blake took the baton. An 18-year-old Roddick became the youngest champion in tournament history in 2001. That season alone, Roddick claimed an American tri-fecta of sorts, capturing his first tour-level title in Atlanta, then adding to that count in Houston and in Washington, D.C, where in the championship match the teenager beat Sjeng Schalken — the Dutchman whom Roddick helped escape a hotel fire three years later in Rome. 


Roddick returned to the winner's circle in the nation's capital in 2005 and 2007, the latter of which marked the last time an American triumphed in Washington until Korda's title last season. In ‘05, Roddick spoiled countryman Blake's quest for a second D.C. title.

Blake won his first tour-level trophy there in 2002 and upon clinching championship point, the-then 22-year-old dropped his racquet in relief and leaped with ecstatic joy. Blake's pure enthusiasm spilled over as he celebrated with his team, and the New York native said post match that he almost knocked over his mom in a joyful courtside hug.


The fourth-longest running professional tennis event in the United States, the Mubadala Citi DC Open celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018 and has continued to thrive at the original location Fitzgerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park. The venue, nestled in one of D.C.'s most inclusive neighborhoods, was chosen at the request of Arthur Ashe, who partnered Donald Dell and John A. Harris to launch the tournament in 1969. Four years after the inaugural edition, Ashe himself won the title.




Held on clay courts until 1986, the event's deep roots and rich history have made it a favourite stop for some of the sport's biggest names. American icon Jimmy Connors brought his signature fire and flair to Washington, delivering his own brand of summer entertainment. He captured three titles in the capital, including two while holding No. 1 honours (1976, 1978). A decade separated his second and third title run, with Connors returning to the winner's circle once more in 1988.


It was during that era when another star made his mark in Washington. Ivan Lendl, the Czech-American who competed under the U.S. flag later in his career, lifted the trophy twice in the 1980s. In both finals, Lendl took out an American: Jimmy Arias in ‘82 and Brad Gilbert in ‘87.


Staying on the theme of Czech-American success, last year featured a full-circle moment for Florida-native Korda and his father Petr Korda. The current No. 32 in the PIF ATP Rankings, ‘Sebi' Korda, captured his biggest career title at the ATP 500, matching his father's 1992 triumph. The Kordas became the first father-son duo to win the same title in ATP Tour history.


Now, a strong squad of home hopes look to build on the American legacy in D.C. this year. Perhaps nobody wants to win this tournament more than DMV's own Tiafoe, who has lost to the eventual champion the past three years. Fritz is aiming for his first ATP 500 crown since 2022. Shelton is seeking his first title of the year.

 Persistent rain has interrupted play on the opening day at the Generali Open in Kitzbühel, although first-round action is now back on at the clay ATP 250. 

 Two first-round matches were suspended for approximately four hours in the Austrian Alps after inclement weather closed in. Seventh seed Francisco Comesana led Tristan Boyer 5-2, and Daniel Elahi Galan was serving with a 2-1 lead against Alexander Shevchenko.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Rune on Agassi Collab: ‘I've never met a guy who sees the game this way'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/rune-agassi-collab-washington-2025","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 01:21:41 GMT","

It started with a text message, was followed by a phone call and culminated in a three-day training block in Washington D.C. ahead of the start of the Mubadala Citi DC Open.

World No. 8 Holger Rune, looking for an edge coming into the pivotal US summer hard-court swing, reached out to Andre Agassi to help hone his game at the very venue at which the two-time US Open champion won five of his 60 career titles.

“It was nice. We've been in touch for a while and we did a couple of days together here in Washington, where he was helping me with a few things, giving his opinion,” said the 22-year-old Dane, who will open his Washington campaign against Frenchman Alexandre Muller or a qualifier.

“It was really a big pleasure. He's a very, very wise man. I've never met a guy who sees the game this way.”

Rune said that despite the short partnership, he feels that he emerged stronger for it.

“Obviously he had an amazing return himself and I also return well and he had a few tips there and how I can be slightly better there and then in general about the game,” he said. 

“It was a really short period but definitely he gave me an insight of where he sees me in the future, where he sees me now and obviously there's a lot of things to improve. He helped me to get my focus and my eyes on the right things, together with my coach Lars [Christensen]. It was really cool to spend some days with him.

“I've watched a lot of him on YouTube and his style and the way of playing was amazing. His career speaks for itself.”

Asked if he might collab with Agassi in the future, the former World No. 4 said, “He's a great man, so I would definitely like that.”








Rune is 13th in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin after going 22-14 through Wimbledon. He defeated Carlos Alcaraz to win the ATP 500 title in Barcelona and reached the ATP Masters 1000 final in Indian Wells  (l. to Draper). But there have also been six opening-round losses this season, including in his last start at Wimbledon, where he fell in five sets to Nicolas Jarry.

“I've had a little bit of an up-and-down down year,” he said. ”I've had some good weeks, some bad weeks and that's what I'm trying to change. I'm thankful to be here in Washington to be able to start my US swing earlier to get matches and to get the rhythm and hopefully do some damage.

“I'm already thinking about Turin with the big weeks coming ahead. It's a golden swing for me in which I don't have a lot of points to defend.”

Rune has a 161-99 career record according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He has split four Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings with Alcaraz and has won two of five meetings with Jannik Sinner, but has watched on as the game's dominant duo has shared the past  seven Grand Slam titles, while he is yet to contest a major final.

“There is definitely a gap at the moment,” he said. “Obviously there are players including myself that can beat them. But it's all about being in those Grand Slam finals and those Masters 1000 finals playing against them and I think there is space for one more person.”

Well beyond his days as a rookie, but not yet a veteran, Alex de Minaur is right in the sweet spot of his career.

At 26 and closing in on 300 match wins, the Australian No. 1 and nine-time ATP Tour champion is eyeing a long-term return to the Top 10 and to pushing even deeper into the second week of Grand Slams, where is now a mainstay.

“I've got the experience now. I've got the knowledge, the physicality side of things. Everything is just there for me to go out and perform,” De Minaur told ATPTour.com at the Mubadala Citi DC Open, where he is the seventh seed. “I can really have a swing these next three or four years and really show that I'm at my peak and break through some barriers.

“I'm ready to go deep into tournaments. It's just up to myself to put those results right.”

De Minaur is back in Washington, D.C. for the first time since 2022 with a shot at returning to the PIF ATP Rankings Top 10 ahead of the US Open, where last year he reached his third consecutive Grand Slam quarter-final after deep runs at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

De Minaur has no points to defend during Washington and the expanded 12-day ATP Masters 1000s in Toronto and Cincinnati; he missed this period last year following a hip injury at Wimbledon, where he withdrew before his scheduled quarter-final with Novak Djokovic.

“It was somewhat difficult at the start of the year and mentally taxing knowing that I had zeros on my ranking because I missed three Masters [also Shanghai],” De Minaur said. “I knew it would be important to put myself in a good position for the back end of the year when I have little to defend, giving hope that I could gain some serious points and momentum and build on the ranking. So going into the tail end of the year, I'm excited for the opportunity and hoping I can play good tennis and take care of my chances.”



De Minaur has fond memories of Washington - both on and off the court. In 2018, then ranked No. 72, he made a surprise run to his first ATP 500 title match, where he fell in straight sets to Alexander Zverev.

“I think that was the last time I won a match here,” the Aussie No. 1 quipped about the three opening-round losses in the nation's capital that followed his 2018 breakout. “It was a huge week for me making the final of a 500, being ranked where I was, playing some great tennis along the way. I remember some epic matches, one against Rublev in the semi-finals.

“I'm hoping after having a little bit of time away from here to come back and play some good tennis again.”

The World No. 12 says that he loves the city itself, warmly recalling the time he and his team hired electric scooters to cover more ground on the Washington Mall than he does on the baseline.“I actually love the city here in Washington. We grabbed the scooters and just went around and saw everything from the White House to all the other unbelievable monuments,” he said.

De  Minaur is also happy to be spending time with fiance Katie Boulter, who is competing at the joint ATP/WTA 500, admitting that her presence provided additional incentive to return to the tournament.



“It's more over the years the schedule has slightly changed. There's been different tournaments on during this week. Last year we had obviously the Olympics,” he said.

“I've always wanted to come back and it does make it a lot better having Katie around and being a combined event for us to be able to spend some time together, being on the same timezone and just living somewhat of a normal life.”

De Minaur is playing his first event since reaching the Wimbledon fourth round, where he blitzed Novak Djokovic in the first set only to see the 24-time major champion rally to a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win.

“I felt like I had my chances,” he said. “We should have been in a fifth set. It slipped away pretty quickly, but those are the matches I need to start winning. I've identified a few areas to work on with my team, and hopefully that helps me take the next step.”

A winner of 279 career matches according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, De Minaur will play the winner of Belgian David Goffin and China's Buyunchaokete in his opening match in Washington.

With 30 wins this season, De Minaur is 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin, well positioned to compete for one of seven remaining spots at November's Nitto ATP Finals, where last year he qualified for the first time.

After winning either 46 or 47 matches in each of the past three seasons, he's also challenging himself to crack the 50-wins milestone for the first time. 

“That's the goal,” he said. “Twenty more wins? I think it's do-able.”

Remembering Jules Bianchi with Charles Leclerc

After two weekends off, F1 heads to Spa with plenty to look forward to in the 2025 Belgian Grand Prix.

After a mini-break between races, the final part of the season before the summer shutdown features a double-header, starting with one of the sport's most iconic venues. While the drivers will be looking forward to getting out on track at Spa-Francorchamps, there have been a few developments since the paddock was last together…

The 2025 Belgian Grand Prix will be the first F1 race weekend that Red Bull have taken part in without Christian Horner as their Team Principal.

Horner was relieved of his operational responsibilities as both Team Principal and CEO just three days after the British Grand Prix, with the 52-year-old telling the team it came as a surprise. Under Horner, Red Bull won eight drivers' championships and six constructors' titles, but it looks increasingly unlikely that they will add to either of those tallies this year.

Moving forward, it is former Racing Bulls Team Principal Laurent Mekies who has been tasked with arresting a slide that saw Red Bull go from one of the most dominant campaigns ever in 2023 to now sitting fourth in the standings.

While the news came as a surprise to Horner, it also caught out many within the paddock who were not expecting such a significant change at the top of Red Bull at this point of the year, and Spa-Francorchamps will be the first opportunity to hear from both Mekies and Max Verstappen – as well as many of Horner's former peers in charge of other teams – on the impact of the move.

The last race at Silverstone did little to dampen speculation surrounding Max Verstappen's future at Red Bull, and the change in Team Principal will only add to the intrigue.

When Red Bull were enjoying their most dominant year in 2023, Verstappen spoke of the importance of keeping the team together and key personnel in place to continue that run. Since then, a number of big names have departed, with Horner becoming the latest just two weeks ago.

There were questions to both Horner and Verstappen about links between the four-time world champion and Mercedes, with Horner stating that Red Bull would one day have to plan for life without their star driver. Based on current contracts, that's not meant to be until 2028, but it hasn't stopped discussions from taking place to understand future options.

If anyone had been expecting the gap between races to just quieten the talk around Verstappen and Mercedes, then they were betting against the internet, where fans were tracking jets and yachts associated with both Verstappen and Toto Wolff. According to their movements, there's a high chance the pair were in the same town in Sardinia at the same time…

Whether that's just coincidental – Sardinia being a beautiful place to go for a short break – or led to any meeting remains to be seen, but both sides are sure to be asked about it in Belgium.

It might be nearly three weeks since we last went racing, but what a story it was at the end of the British Grand Prix when Nico Hulkenberg finally secured the first podium of his Formula 1 career.

The German was able to enjoy some pretty spectacular celebrations in the Sauber garage after the race, and then similarly was welcomed home to a party by friends and family, before a further marking of the moment at the Sauber headquarters in Switzerland.

On the latter point, it's worth remembering that was Sauber's first podium for 13 years, and also continued some clear progress for the team after impressive car developments. They brought an upgrade to the Spanish Grand Prix and since that point have scored 35 points, making them the fourth-highest scoring team in the past four races.

Can they keep that run going at Spa-Francorchamps, or will the gap in events allow rivals to bring more performance to their own cars and fight back?

Ferrari have yet to win in 2025 but they have certainly been trending in the right direction in recent races, with the team finishing with at least one car in the top five in every race since Imola, where they brought an upgrade to their car.

That upgrade, however, was not the main item that Ferrari have been working on. There have been incremental gains, but there has also been a focus on the rear suspension that they have been hoping will address some of the handling and set-up issues that both Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton have been having to fight with this year.

A filming day at Mugello last week was the second of Ferrari's two permitted promotional events this year, and offered a valuable opportunity to try and make further progress. If they have developed new parts that unlock more potential from the SF-25, then Ferrari could well be a threat for victories in the second half of the season.

And even if there isn't a clear step forward, or more work needs to be done, the signs have still been positive of late, with three podiums in the last five races and Ferrari starting to take hold of second place in the Constructors' Championship, despite having to play catch-up following the double-DNF in China.

There's something special about watching Formula 1 cars attacking Spa-Francorchamps, a circuit that retains such a sense of history.

Beautifully winding its way through the Ardennes, the track is a major challenge due to the need to balance both top speed with the high downforce needs of the middle sector. Not to mention the iconic corners such as Eau Rouge and Raidillon, Pouhon and Blanchimont.

It's a track that can provide plenty of drama due to the ability to overtake and the propensity for rain to impact the weekend, with the circuit perhaps the best example of a venue where it can be raining in one sector and completely dry in another.

To add to the action this weekend, Spa-Francorchamps will also be host to a Sprint for only the second time, and the first occasion delivered a Sprint that took place in wet conditions, before a Grand Prix that was dry. A lap of Spa is special enough on its own, but even more racing action has got to be a good thing.

Remembering Jules Bianchi with Charles Leclerc

With just eight points separating Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris at the halfway mark of the 2025 season, F1.com takes a look back at how other close titles battle at the midway point played out during the rest of the campaign.

The 2025 World Championship is very much all to play for as we arrive at the halfway point of the campaign, with Lando Norris' victory at the British Grand Prix bringing the gap to leader Oscar Piastri down to just eight points. This is not the first time that we have witnessed such a duel at the midway stage – but how did those close title battles of the past play out? F1.com has been taking a look back…

Jody Scheckter had four wins under his belt from a three-year spell with Tyrrell when he joined the newly-formed Wolf team in 1977. Things quickly got off to a strong start, with Scheckter winning the squad's first-ever race at the season-opening Argentine Grand Prix.

Three more podiums and another victory followed during the first half of the campaign, meaning that Scheckter led Ferrari's Niki Lauda – competing in his first full season since his fiery accident at the 1976 German Grand Prix – by just one point in the championship standings after Round 8 of 17.

However, the South African only won one more race in the second portion of the season and, though there were still several points finishes, Lauda fared better, so much so that the Austrian wrapped up the title with two races to spare.

Lauda opted to skip those two Grands Prix and walk away from Ferrari. Scheckter, meanwhile, ended the campaign 17 points adrift of Lauda but would go on to become a World Champion with the Scuderia himself in 1979.

After Mercedes aced the introduction of turbo-hybrid regulations in 2014, the championship became a primarily intra-team battle between the squad's drivers in the years that followed. Lewis Hamilton had beaten Nico Rosberg in both 2014 and 2015 – but Rosberg appeared determined to change that when 2016 kicked off.

The German driver embarked on a winning streak as the campaign got underway, racking up four consecutive victories across the opening races. However, following his infamous collision with Hamilton at Round 5 in Spain, the latter then also took a number of wins, meaning that Hamilton was just one point behind his team mate after Round 10 of 21.

Hamilton's prospects of claiming his fourth World Championship took a hit at Race 16 in Malaysia, where an engine failure forced him to retire and lose a significant amount of points.

And while he went on to win four races back-to-back at the end of the campaign, it was not enough to overturn his deficit to Rosberg, who clinched the title by five points. Rosberg subsequently announced his retirement, while Hamilton would go on to pick up four consecutive championships between 2017 and 2020.

In his fourth F1 campaign – and third for Renault – Alain Prost looked well and truly in the mix for the title in 1983. By Race 7 of 15, the Frenchman was the only multiple winner of the season after taking victories in France and Belgium.

This put him in the lead of the championship – but just one point ahead of 1981 World Champion Nelson Piquet, who had been victorious in front of his home fans at the season-opening Brazilian Grand Prix.

Prost remained on course for his debut title entering into the final round of the season in South Africa, having remained two points clear of Piquet. After starting from P5 on the grid, the French driver worked his way up to P3 during the race.

However, Prost's Renault suffered a turbo failure on Lap 35 of 77, putting him out of the running. A P3 result for Piquet, meanwhile, was enough to secure the Brazilian the second of his three World Championships, ending the season two points clear of Prost.

By the halfway mark of the 1956 season, Ferrari's Peter Collins and Maserati driver Stirling Moss were tied on 11 points apiece at the top of the standings, with Moss' team mate Jean Behra and the other Scuderia car of Juan Manuel Fangio just behind in third and fourth respectively.

The picture would look very different ahead of the eighth and final round of the championship, however, with Moss no longer in contention while Fangio led by eight points from Collins and Behra.

During the title-deciding Italian Grand Prix, Fangio's chances of winning a third consecutive World Championship appeared to be over when he was forced to retire with steering issues – meaning that Collins had the opportunity to seal a debut title.

But an extraordinary gesture from Collins would change that. With this being an era in which drivers were permitted to hand their cars over to their team mates, the Briton gave his challenger to Fangio to complete the race, allowing the Argentinian to finish second and claim the title in the process.

In 2007, Lewis Hamilton missed out on becoming a World Champion in his rookie season by just one point to Kimi Raikkonen. The pair again found themselves battling for the title in the campaign that followed and were tied on 48 points – along with Felipe Massa – after Round 9 of 18.

During the second half of the year, Raikkonen's challenge fell away after a series of DNFs for the Ferrari driver. But his team mate Massa remained in the fight against the McLaren of Hamilton, meaning that the finale in Brazil would decide the victor.

Hamilton was seven points ahead of Massa prior to the race, with Massa able to take the title if Hamilton finished in sixth place or lower. A dramatic Grand Prix then unfolded in which Massa claimed victory and, for a few seconds at least, looked to have won the championship.

But Hamilton – who had been running in P6 – famously overtook Toyota's Timo Glock on the last lap, moving him up into P5 and earning him his debut World Championship by a sole point from Massa.

Remembering Jules Bianchi with Charles Leclerc

Jenson Button has given his take on which F1 driver he believes is currently the best on the grid – as well as being the ""most rounded"" ever in the sport.

Jenson Button believes that Max Verstappen is the “most rounded F1 driver that there has ever been”, with the 2009 World Champion suggesting that the Dutchman can “do more with a car than anyone else”.

Since making his debut back in 2015, Verstappen has added his name to the history books by going on to achieve four World Championships, 65 wins, 44 pole positions and 117 podiums to date.

While the Red Bull man has faced a tougher start to 2025 – putting him in third of the Drivers' Standings on 165 points, 69 points adrift of leader Oscar Piastri and 61 behind second-placed Lando Norris – Button feels that Verstappen remains as the best driver currently on the grid.

As such, the Briton was asked during an appearance on The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X about who he saw as the second-best, leading him to give his take on how the McLaren pair compare to Verstappen.

“I think Lando and Oscar are both up there,” Button explained. “They're very different personalities. I think Lando can be his own worst enemy. He's unbelievably quick, but if he makes a tiny mistake… I think he thinks about it too much.

“Oscar is very level-headed. He just wants to go racing, and he wants to drive fast, and he does it very well. And my comments about Max [being the best], yeah, I feel he's the most rounded F1 driver that there has ever been, you know?

“And I know he hasn't won the championships of Lewis [Hamilton]. And I obviously think Lewis is extremely, extremely good and one of the best in the world. But there's just something about Max that he can do something with a car that I don't think anyone else can.”

In terms of knowing Hamilton's abilities, Button raced alongside the seven-time World Champion at McLaren between 2010 and 2012 and was left impressed by how his then team mate could quickly bounce back during a race weekend.

“I was team mates with him for three years, and the talent, the natural ability he has is unbelievable,” said Button. “He would struggle in practice, come to qualify, I'm like, ‘Right, I've got him. I'm going to have him.' And he'd just, bang, put in a lap.

“It just came from nowhere, and I don't know where it came from. So, extreme talent, and obviously the career he's had, I'm not sure anyone's going to beat that, his records. But just thinking about this moment in time, I feel that Max is the one that can do more with a car than anyone else.”

Tune into The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X weekdays from 6:30am – 10am and on Global Player.

Adapted from Esi Edugyan's 2018 novel, the miniseries chronicles the globe-trotting adventures of a boy who escapes slavery in Barbados and winds up in Nova Scotia.


							By 

	Angie Han


Television Critic


	There's no mistaking the mission statement of Washington Black. “This just ain't his story. It's our story,” narrates Sterling K. Brown's Medwin in the opening moments, invoking themes of family, courage and inspiration. As a framing, it feels old-fashioned in style and didactic in tone, grand in ambition but also curiously limiting: Before we've even had a chance to meet the titular protagonist, he's already been burdened with the responsibility of representation.


	Luckily, Wash (Ernest Kingsley Jr.) has never been one to put too much stock in the rules of gravity anyway. While Hulu's adaptation of Esi Edugyan's Booker-shortlisted 2018 novel never fully shakes that self-seriousness, it eventually reveals itself to be a surprisingly fleet adventure, as buoyant and unpredictable as its hero's own globe-trotting travels.

The Bottom Line

	
	Weighty themes, buoyant heart.
	



Airdate: Wednesday, July 23 (Hulu)Cast: Ernest Kingsley Jr., Sterling K. Brown, Tom Ellis, Eddie Karanja, Iola Evans, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Rupert Graves, Edward BluemelCreator: Selwyn Seyfu Hinds			
			







	Selwyn Seyfu Hinds' miniseries starts, if not quite at the end of Wash's journey, somewhere deep into it. We first pick up with George Washington Black, as he's formally called, or “Jack Crawford,” as he identifies himself in hiding, as a 19-year-old in 1837. His life in Halifax, Nova Scotia — the last stop on the Underground Railroad, we're reminded — seems humble but relatively contented. He makes enough money working the docks to rent a modest room from the affectionately stern Medwin, dreams up exciting new inventions in his free time and, within the first five minutes of the Wanuri Kahiu-directed premiere, falls fast and hard for Tanna (Iola Evans), an upper-class Brit new to these shores.

	










			Related Video		







	But his story properly begins eight years earlier on a Barbados sugar plantation, where as an 11-year-old (Eddie Karanja) he has a fateful meeting with Titch (Tom Ellis), the scientist brother of his cruel enslaver (Julian Rhind-Tutt). Intrigued by the boy's curiosity and impressed by his obvious intelligence, Titch enlists his help in constructing a “cloud cutter,” a proto-blimp of Titch's own design. Eventually, in a moment of crisis, Titch also escapes with him on it, kicking off what will become a wild continent-hopping odyssey. 


	Cutting between the two timelines, Washington Black bears witness simultaneously to the very first steps in Wash's adolescent coming-of-age, and the finishing stages of it. But the need to derive a clear and profound meaning from every facet of his saga proves more of a drag than it does a blessing. While Medwin's voiceover thankfully ceases after that first scene, a heavy-handed score serves much the same purpose, prodding us toward big and obvious emotions rather than contrasting or highlighting them.


	The story flies by in a blur, pausing long enough at each stop for Wash to internalize whatever life lesson fate has in store for him, but not for us to get any specific feel for these locations and the people within them. They're symbols and metaphors, rather than worlds unto themselves, and the lived-in intimacy of similarly roving shows like Amazon's The Underground Railroad or (in a very different mood) Peacock's Poker Face is sorely missed. With such a broad yet shallow scope, Washington Black occasionally takes on the dutiful feel of an educational video.

	











	Still, for a fictionalized history lesson, it's fun one, full of surprising twists and charming turns. If Wash's romance with Tanna, a white-passing biracial woman chafing under the future laid out for her by her father (Rupert Graves), initially feels reverse-engineered from statements the show wants to make about inequities and those with the courage to defy them, Kingsley and Evans are so sweet together that we can't help but root for them.


	And if characters like tender Kit, the closest Wash has to a mother on the plantation, or Nat Turner, who models for him a more militant form of rebellion, don't stick around as long as we hope, Shaunette Renée Wilson and Jamie Hector (respectively) make big impressions in limited timeframes. 


	Meanwhile, Brown's typically excellent performance helps to elevate Medwin into a formidable figure in his own right — though one hopes we'll get more insight into the nuances of his nigh-paternal relationship with Wash in the second half of the season. (Critics were given four of eight hour-long episodes.)


Washington Black is at its most intriguing when it's least straightforward, and most willing to embrace complications. Take its portrayal of Titch, a queasily ambiguous figure. Here is a white man whose supposed commitment to abolitionism extends to treating his brother's slaves with unusual kindness, but not to refraining from using them for his own ends. His friendship with Wash defies simplistic categorization: While sincere in feeling, its inherently untenable contradictions amount to a ticking time bomb, apparently destined to blow up in the back half of the series.

	











	The more experiences the young Wash accumulates, the more affecting and engaging the drama becomes. Through Karanja's wide-eyed performance, we watch as the child takes everything in, processing what all of these adults are telling him and noticing what they don't. We see how he recalibrates his perspective with every new pearl of wisdom, stringing them together bit by bit into a comprehensive understanding of himself, the universe and his place in it.


	And in Kingsley's portrayal, we see what kind of man all of these lessons might eventually make. I may have wished, occasionally, that Wash had been allowed more room to just be his own idiosyncratic self, rather than a stand-in for bigger, loftier themes. But credit where it's due: With each passing chapter, the truth of Medwin's words becomes increasingly apparent.


	Wash isn't any sort of Everyman; on the contrary, he's a singular hero blessed with natural genius and hard-won bravery, a soaring sense of ambition and the relentless determination to make his wildest hopes come true. Like any of us, though, he's a patchwork of influences and inspirations — the histories that span centuries and continents, the communities defined by both their solidarity and their diversity, the ideals that clash or contradict or marry to form new ones. Like any of us, he contains entire lifetimes within his own.

The series pairs the 'Crash Landing on You' star with the rising 'Squid Game' actress in a story about ambition, obsession and the dark side of the K-pop industry.


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


Netflix is adding another splashy series to its Korean originals slate with Variety, a K-pop industry drama starring Crash Landing on You headliner Son Ye-jin and rising actor-idol Jo Yu-ri, best known for her breakout turn in Squid Game Seasons 2 and 3.


	The upcoming series comes from director Kim Yong-hoon, the filmmaker behind Mask Girl, one of Netflix's surprise Korean hits of 2023. The black comedy thriller spent four consecutive weeks on the streamer's Global Top 10 Non-English TV list, peaking at No. 1 in its second week.

Variety marks a stylistic shift for Kim. He'll be trading in the gritty neo-noir crime world of his breakthrough, Beasts Clawing at Straws, for the high-gloss, high-pressure domain of K-pop super-stardom. The series will explore the tensions, ambitions and fraught relationships between industry power players, the stars and their obsessive fandoms.


	Son stars as Se-eun, a top entertainment executive willing to risk everything to revive the faltering idol group she helped create. Variety adds to a busy and exciting lineup of projects for the veteran actress, including the upcoming Netflix period drama Scandals and Park Chan-wook's much-anticipated feature No Other Choice. 


	Jo co-stars in Variety as Seung-hui, a fan whose fierce devotion to her favorite idol takes her down a dangerous path. It's an amusing casting for the rising actress, given her prior career as a K-pop star and fan-favorite member of Korean–Japanese girl group Iz*One. 

	











Variety is being produced by CJ ENM Studios and UNU, continuing Netflix's longstanding status as one of the Korean content creators' top commissioners.

""It's terrible, terrible news for the world of comedy,"" the 'Last Week Tonight' host added.


							By 

	Kimberly Nordyke


Managing Editor, Digital


John Oliver is calling the cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert “incredibly sad.”


	While speaking to reporters over the weekend, Oliver was asked his thoughts about the news, which CBS revealed in a surprise announcement Thursday.




	“Obviously, I love Stephen, I love his staff, I love that show — it's incredibly sad,” the Last Week Tonight host responded. “I'm partly excited to see what they're gonna do for the next 10 months. It's terrible, terrible news for the world of comedy.”

	Oliver and Colbert both served as correspondents on The Daily Show — though not at the same time — and are friends, with Oliver having appeared on Colbert's show over the years. Oliver also noted he grew up watching The Late Show in England, when David Letterman was host.

	











	“Late-night shows mean a lot to me, not just because I work in them, because even growing up in England, I would watch Letterman's show, which of course was Stephen's show, and think about what a glamorous world that was,” he said. “So to have got to have been on Letterman's show and Stephen's show was always one of the most fun things. So it's very, very, very sad news. I look forward to seeing what [Colbert is] gonna do next because that man will not stop.”


	Colbert shared the show's live audience during the taping of Thursday's show at the Ed Sullivan Theatre in New York, drawing boos from the audience. He said he'd been told about the decision the night before.


	In a statement, CBS said the cancellation was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”

	











Last Week Tonight, meanwhile, is on hiatus until July 27. Oliver was talking to reporters in Erie, Pennsylvania — home of the newly rebranded minor league baseball team, the Moon Mammoths. The team formerly known as the Erie SeaWolves will play four games under the new moniker, but it's unclear if the name will be permanent.


	“This is entirely for the people of Erie and this team to decide now,” Oliver said, according to YourErie.com. “If they want to go back to the SeaWolves, this has been fun. If they want to keep the Moon Mammoths forever, have it.”


	Erie Mayor Joe Schember declared the day as Moon Mammoth Day and presented Oliver with a key to the city. The new name is inspired by George Moon's discovery of a mammoth skeleton in Lake Pleasant in 1991.


	Saturday night's game drew a record crowd of 7,070 at UPMC Park.

Amazon MGM Studios' new feature take on the property hits theaters in 2027.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Adria Arjona is set to star alongside Michael B. Jordan in The Thomas Crown Affair for Amazon MGM Studios. 


	Jordan directs and stars in the feature reimagining that is currently in production in London and follows Norman Jewison‘s 1968 original of the same name starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. Kenneth Branagh, Lily Gladstone, Danai Gurira, Pilou Asbæk and Aiysha Hart round out the cast for the new project that hits theaters March 5, 2027.




Taylor Russell was previously set to star opposite Jordan in the film. The Hollywood Reporter reported last week that the Bones and All actress exited the movie amid creative differences.

	Drew Pearce (The Fall Guy) wrote the script for the new movie after Wes Tooke and Justin Britt-Gibson penned a previous draft. Producers include Jordan and Elizabeth Raposo for Outlier Society and Charles Roven for Atlas Entertainment. Patrick McCormick and Toberoff Productions' Marc Toberoff also produce. Alan Trustman, who wrote the original film, serves as an executive producer.


	The original Thomas Crown Affair landed two Oscar nominations and tells the story of an insurance investigator working to track down the perpetrator of a bank heist. It was remade in 1999, with the updated version starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.


	Arjona is known for such series work as Disney+'s Star Wars show Andor and for features including Blink Twice and Hit Man. She can next be seen opposite Dakota Johnson in Neon and Topic Studio's comedy Splitsville.

	











The Thomas Crown Affair reunites Jordan with the studio that released his 2023 directorial debut, Creed III.


	Jordan teased his take on The Thomas Crown Affair during a video segment at CinemaCon in April, telling the crowd that his movie “isn't just another remake.” 


	Arjona is represented by CAA, Anonymous Content, Brillstein Entertainment Partners and Stone Genow.


Variety was first to report on Arjona's casting.

Associate Editor


Anne Hathaway is teasing the upcoming sequel to The Devil Wears Prada. 


	The actress took to Instagram on Monday to share a photo of herself as her Devil Wears Prada character Andy Sachs, captioning the photo “Andy Sachs 2025.”




	In the 2006 film, Hathaway starred alongside Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci as aspiring journalist and recent college journalism graduate Sachs who becomes the personal assistant to Miranda Priestly (Streep), the unsparing editor-in-chief of Runway fashion magazine.

Adrian Grenier, who played Hathaway's character's boyfriend, Nate, in the first movie, will not be in the sequel, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.


	In the sequel, Priestly, still the head of Runway, will have to contend with the headwinds of publishing, with the magazine now in a diminished state. Blunt's onetime assistant will now be an executive at a luxury brand conglomerate that advertises with Runway.


	The Devil Wears Prada grossed a massive $326 million at the worldwide box office and earned Streep an Oscar nomination.

	











The Devil Wears Prada 2 will hit theaters May 1, 2026.

The announcement came on Monday morning (July 21) in a video featuring MC singing a bit of the soaring title song.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Mariah Carey is Here For It All. The pop icon announced the title and release date of her 16th album on Monday morning (July 21), revealing that the LP fans have been calling “MC16” will drop on Sept. 26. The news came in a brief Instagram video in which MC flipped her hair back and walked slowly in shiny black leather high-heeled boots and black cat suit in front of a giant mural of herself, with the album title spelled out over and over in black and white behind her.


	It ended with a brief snippet of the title track in which Carey crooned, “I'm here for it all!” The final image appears to be the album's cover picture, featuring a broadly smiling Carey, eyes closed, filling up most of the page, her hair blowing in the wind as she holds her left arm up to her cheek and her right hand up to her chest.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	So far, in June Carey dropped the single “Type Dangerous” — and, recently, an accompanying EP featuring collabs with Method Mad, Big Sean, DJ Snake and others — and previewed the song “Sugar Sweet” from the follow-up to her 2018 Caution album. Carey told Apple Music last month that the album was “finished,” but at press time a full track listing had not yet been announced.

	











	The singer earned her milestone 50th Billboard Hot 100 hit when “Type Dangerous” debuted at No. 95 on the singles tally last month. The track is her first nonseasonal song to reach the Hot 100 since “I Don't” with YG logged a week on the list in Feb. 25, 2017.

	“I asked some friends why they don't dance in public, and some said because of the fear of being filmed,” his Instagram post began. “I thought damn, a natural form of expression and a certain connection they have with music is now a ghost. It made me wonder how much of our human spirit got killed because of the fear of being a meme, all for having a good time.”

	On the eve of Don't Tap The Glass, Tyler held an intimate listening party where he played the album front-to-back twice, dubbing the dance soiree as one of the “greatest nites of his life.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I just got back from a listening party for this album and man was it one of the greatest nites of my life. 30 people. No phones allowed. No cameras. Just speakers and a sweatbox. Everyone was dancing. Moving. Expressing. Sweating,” the Grammy-winning MC said. “It was truly beautiful. I played the album front to back twice. It felt like that pent up energy finally got released and we craved the idea of letting more of it out.”


	He added: “There was a freedom that filled the room. A ball of energy that might not translate to every speaker that plays this album but man did that room nail it.”

	











	He finally urged people to soak in the album in a way that allows them to move freely, express themselves, and, most importantly, dance. “This album was not made for sitting still. Dancing. Driving. Running. Any type of movement is recommended to maybe understand the spirit of it. Only at full volume,” he wrote.


Don't Tap The Glass arrives less than a year after Tyler's Billboard 200 chart-topper CHROMAKOPIA. He's currently embarking on a worldwide tour for the project and will surely dish out new records from his latest effort during his multi-country trek.

Bieber's ""Daisies"" debuts at No. 2 and Lenae's ""Love Me Not"" leaps to No. 7.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Alex Warren's “Ordinary” scores a seventh week atop the Billboard Hot 100. The song has spent all its weeks on top consecutively, having become his first No. 1 on the chart.


	Plus, two songs are new to the Hot 100's top 10, led by Justin Bieber's “Daisies,” which debuts at No. 2. The track is from his new album, Swag, which likewise bounds onto the Billboard 200 at No. 2. Bieber earns his 27th career Hot 100 top 10 — tying Janet Jackson for the 10th-most in the chart's history. It also opens as the week's most-streamed song.


	Meanwhile, Ravyn Lenae lands her first Hot 100 top 10 as “Love Me Not” surges five spots to No. 7. The song became her first entry on the chart in April.


	Additionally in the Hot 100's top 10, Teddy Swims' former leader “Lose Control,” at No. 9, makes history, becoming the first song ever to spend 100 weeks on the chart.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated July 26, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, July 22. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 19.6 million official streams (up 2% week-over-week),  73 million radio airplay audience impressions (essentially even week-over-week) and 6,000 sold (up 8%) in the United States July 11-17.


	It holds at No. 4 on the Streaming Songs chart, following four weeks at the summit; adds a fifth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs; and rebounds from No. 2 for a ninth week atop Digital Song Sales.


	The track also keeps at No. 1 on the Songs of the Summer chart, having led in all eight weeks since the seasonal survey made its annual return after Memorial Day.


	Justin Bieber's “Daisies” debuts at No. 2 on the Hot 100 with 27.6 million streams, 4.3 million in airplay audience and 4,000 sold through July 17 following its July 11 release on his new album, Swag.


	Bieber ups his career total to 27 career Hot 100 top 10s — tying Janet Jackson for the 10th-most in the chart's nearly 67-year history.


Most Hot 100 Top 10s:


	The track concurrently premieres at No. 1 on Streaming Songs, where it's Bieber's seventh leader.


	Bieber had last earned a new Hot 100 top 10 with “Ghost,” which rose to No. 5 in April 2022. He first reached the region when “Baby” debuted at its No. 5 high in February 2010. Of his 27 top 10s, he boasts eight No. 1s.


	Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” leaps 12-7 on the Hot 100 with 14.1 million streams (up 5%), 36 million in radio reach (up 13%) and 1,000 sold (up 26%). The song, which became big on TikTok, is the Chicago-born singer-songwriter's first top 10 on the chart, marking the latest milestone in her steady career ascent. In April, it became her first Hot 100 hit. She began releasing music around a decade ago and signed to Atlantic in 2016.


	“I'm just happy for all artists who have been in this 10-plus years and are feeling the love and the benefits of so much time and effort and hard work,” Lenae told Billboard in April, a day before her Coachella debut.


	“This is something I feel like I haven't heard in such a long time,” Lenae added of “Love Me Not,” which she co-wrote, noting that it reminded her of OutKast's classic “Hey Ya!,” which ruled the Hot 100 for nine weeks in 2003-04. “That mix of soulfulness with pop sensibility that anybody could sing and dance to, and feels like it could have come out in any era — that's my favorite type of song.”


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, holds at No. 9 — as it becomes the first song ever to spend 100 weeks on the chart overall. It also tallies a record-extending 70th week in the top 10.


	The single debuted, at No. 99, on the chart dated Aug. 26, 2023. It broke the Hot 100's longevity mark in May when it surpassed the run of Glass Animals' “Heat Waves,” which ran up 91 weeks in 2021-22.


Most Weeks Ever on Hot 100:


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, holds at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It notches a ninth week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	“Golden” by HUNTR/X, the trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, hits the Hot 100's top five, as the track from the hit Netflix animated film KPop Demon Hunters rises 6-4.


	Wallen's No. 2-peaking “Just in Case” dips 4-5 on the Hot 100.


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stumbles woozily 5-6 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July.


	Drake's “What Did I Miss?” drops to No. 8 on the Hot 100, a week after it debuted at No. 2 as his record-extending 81st top 10. It posts a second week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, where it became his record-padding 31st leader on each list.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” repeats at No. 10, following five weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.

The adorable team-up on the 11-year-old's favorite song from her mom's catalog isn't the first time they've sung the track together on stage.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Kelly Clarkson turned her Friday night (July 18) performance at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace into a family affair. During her Studio Sessions residency gig, the talk show host and pop superstar invited 11-year-old daughter River Rose out to join her on stage for a very special duet. 


	In an Instagram post of the mommy-daughter moment, Clarkson wrote, “Last night we had a very special guest, my daughter River Rose, joined us for ‘Heartbeat Song.' It's her favorite song,” alongside an image of her kneeling down on stage to touch foreheads with her eldest child. 

	











	In a video posted by a fan, River Rose walks out on stage and gives her mom a big hug before Clarkson tells the crowd, “we're gonna do her favorite song.” Snuggling up to the tween — who, like her famous mother was wearing dark wash jeans and a bedazzled T-shirt — Clarkson told River Rose she looked “super cute” before revved the band up to play the lead 2015 single from her seventh studio album, Piece by Piece.




			Trending on Billboard		







	River Rose hung in there like a champ, doubling Clarkson's vocals and swaying along in unison as she smiled and belted out the song, even holding a big note at the end that made the singer smile proudly. Staring into each other's eyes and touching foreheads, mother and daughter landed the plane while joyfully singing the chorus in unison. “This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it/ Been so long, I forgot how to turn it/ Up, up, up, up all night long/ Up, up all night long,” they sang, bouncing in place together as the band dropped out and the two sang the chorus one more time while giving a sweet boop finger tap to each other's foreheads. 

	











	In a testament to a life lived with a pop star mom, River Rose gave the crowd a sassy power pose after hugging Clarkson, who asked the crowd to “give it up for River Rose y'all, c'mon!” before planting a kiss on the tween's cheek as she walked off.


	Back in 2023 during her first Vegas residency run at the Bakkt Theater, Clarkson first told the crowd that “Heartbeat Song” was River's favorite, bringing the then 9-year-old out on stage to belt the tune out. “She's been jamming to this song since she was a baby,” Clarkson told her fans back then. In addition to River Rose, Clarkson shares son Remington “Remy” Alexander, 9, with ex Brandon Blackstock.


	Clarkson will be back on stage at the Colosseum on Friday (July 25).

HYBE label Belift Lab disputes the former ADOR CEO's claims that ILLIT's debut too closely mirrored NewJeans.


													By
												

	Billboard Korea



Former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin appeared in court again on Friday (July 18) for the third oral hearing in a 2 billion won ($1.45 million) defamation lawsuit filed by HYBE's label Belift Lab. The case centers on Min's public claims that Belift plagiarized concepts from her and ADOR's work with the girl group NewJeans in their promotion of ILLIT. Belift Lab initially filed the lawsuit in May 2024, accusing Min of defamation and obstruction of business.


	A separate hearing for a 500 million won ($360,000) lawsuit filed by Source Music, initially scheduled for the same day, was postponed to Aug. 22. Source Music had filed its claim in July 2024, alleging that Min's statements constituted false information and harmed both the company and its artists.


	The Belift Lab hearing was originally scheduled for May 2025 but was rescheduled to July 18 at the request of Min's legal team. With Source Music's case delayed, only the Belift-Min proceedings took place that day. Both sides were given 30 minutes each to present their arguments in court.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Belift Lab emphasized Min's influence as a prominent producer in the K-pop industry and questioned whether labeling a rookie group as plagiarists less than a month after their debut could truly be seen as serving the public interest. The label argued that the elements Min cited — hanbok styling, choreography and hairstyles — are widely used across K-pop. They also noted that Min herself had faced accusations of similarity during NewJeans' “Ditto” era.


	In response, Min's legal team stated that from ILLIT's debut, both domestic and international fans and critics had consistently pointed out similarities between the two groups, claiming the resemblance was too significant to be coincidental. They further argued that HYBE initiated an abnormal internal audit of ADOR shortly after Min raised these concerns, framing the current dispute as a matter of defamation and business interference rather than copyright infringement.


	The proceedings follow a recent development on July 15, when police dismissed HYBE's criminal complaint against Min for breach of trust, concluding there was no evidence of wrongdoing. However, the ongoing conflict between HYBE labels and Min Hee-jin, which began with an internal audit of ADOR in 2024, remains unresolved.


	NewJeans will celebrate their third debut anniversary on July 22, though the group is currently on hiatus.

Less than a year after CHROMAKOPIA's arrival, the Grammy-winning rapper is back. 


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



	While he's still on the road touring in support of CHROMAKOPIA, Tyler, The Creator unleashed his Don't Tap the Glass album on Monday morning (July 21). 


	Tyler debuted cuts from his new LP at a $5 show in Los Angeles on Sunday night (July 20) before he continued to buck the trend with another weekday release for fans to indulge in as they wake up for school, work or whatever comes as part of their weekday routine. 


	The Grammy-winning rapper announced the album at his Brooklyn show on Friday night and had a “Don't Tap the Glass” exhibit at various locations around New York, including the Barclays Center and the Oculus at the World Trade Center.

	The cover art finds a shirtless Tyler in a matching cap and red pants combo that could be inspired by LL COOL J, 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin and Ludacris' oversized muscle arms featured in the “Get Back” video. 


	Prior to the album's arrival, Tyler attempted to quell fans' expectations and hype surrounding the project. “Yall better get them expectations and hopes down this aint no concept nothing,” he wrote on X regarding Don't Tap the Glass.

	It's Tyler, The Creator's second album in less than a year and ninth solo effort overall, as CHROMAKOPIA hit streaming services in October. The project debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 299,000 album-equivalent units earned in the shortened tracking week. It was also ranked as Billboard‘s seventh best album in all genres of 2024.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Lena Headey (Game of Thrones) and Robin Tunney (The Mentalist) are set to star in Divine Blood, an indie dark comedy marking the feature directorial debut of husband-and-wife duo Paul Castro Jr. and Aly Miller.


	In the film from Lynx Point Pictures, which just wrapped filming in New York, Headey plays Ruth George, a once-revered “menstrual artist” (yes, that's exactly what it sounds like), whose work — crafted from her own blood — catapulted her to cult fame. But just as she's dragged back into the spotlight, her body begins to stage a quiet, sticky rebellion into a raw, absurd, and disturbingly relatable reckoning with art, womanhood, and the sheer chaos of being human.

	











	Tunney plays Ruth's sister, Scarlet. Others in the cast include Chloe Levine (The OA), Kyra Weeks (The Wedding in the Hamptons), and Revon Yousif (The Better Sister). Miller penned the script and Mia Cusamano handled casting. Miller and Castro produced alongside Josh Folan, Jason Montalvo and Ari Michael, with Anirban Bagchi and Amado DeHoyos exec producing.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Best known for her Emmy-nominated work on HBO's Game of Thrones, Headey has more recently been seen starring in series like Beacon 23 and White House Plumbers. Upcoming, she also has Netflix's Western series The Abandons. She's repped by TMT Entertainment Group, CAA, and Kraditor & Haber.


	Known for roles in shows like The Mentalist and Prison Break, along with films like The Craft and Empire Records, Tunney's recent credits include Dear Edward and Horse Girl. She is repped by Strand Entertainment and Gersh.

	











	Castro Jr. and Miller's past work includes the award-winning short Aeris and the documentary Madonna and the Breakfast Club, which was acquired by Hulu. Castro Jr. is repped by Creative Talent Company.


	Levine is repped by IAG and Anthony and Associates; Weeks by Framework Entertainment and Eris Talent Agency; and Yousif by BRS/Gage Talent Agency and Swiontek Entertainment.

					TIFF Unveils Round Of World Premieres With 'Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery' & Pics From Derek Cianfrance, Paul Greengrass, Nicholas Hytner, Hikari & More		
			








	Before Waiting for Godot begins its Broadway run on Sept. 13, both Bill and Ted will be in TIFF; Keanu Reeves starring in Good Fortune and Alex Winter with the world premiere of his Adulthood. 


			Watch on Deadline		







Good Fortune, which first dropped a trailer at CinemaCon 2024, follows a well-meaning but rather inept angel named Gabriel, played by Reeves, who meddles in the lives of a struggling gig worker (Ansari) and a wealthy venture capitalist (Seth Rogen). 


Poetic License stars Method Man, Nico Parker, Andrew Barth Feldman, Cooper Hoffman, Maisy Stella and Leslie Mann. The movie follows Liz, a former therapist and soon-to-be empty nester, as she becomes the unexpected point of tension between two inseparable best friends and college seniors, Sam and Ari. Liz is forced to reexamine her life as the boys' friendship unravels in a fierce competition for her affection.

	











	Sony Pictures Classics' Nuremberg chronicles the true story of the eponymous post WWII trials held by the Allies against the defeated Nazi regime. Pic centers on American psychiatrist Douglas Kelley (Rami Malek), who is tasked with determining whether Nazi prisoners are fit to stand trial for their war. He finds himself in a complex battle of wits with Hermann Göring (Russell Crowe), Hitler's right-hand man. 


	Michôd's Christy stars Sydney Sweeney as 1990s female boxer Christy Martin. Merritt Weaver, Ben Foster and Katy O'Brian also star. 


	Winocour's Couture stars Jolie as an American filmmaker who arrives in Paris for Fashion Week on a life-and-death journey, facing challenges and self-discovery. Jolie was at TIFF last year with the world premiere Without Blood, which she directed. The Oscar winner was also lauded at TIFF's awards gala. 


	McAvoy's California Schemin tells the story of two Scottish lads from Dundee who conned the music industry by pretending to be an established Californian rap duo, bagging a record deal and appearing on MTV until their scam unraveled.


Glenrothan also stars its director Cox, as well as Alan Cumming, Alexandra Shipp, and Shirley Henderson in a tale about two brothers, who following a violent exchange with their father on the day of their mother's funeral, sees the younger of the two leaving their Highland home for America. After forty years they reunite in the land of their birth.


Train to Busan filmmaker Yeon Sang-ho's new movie, the mystery thriller, The Ugly, centers around a man's investigation behind his long-lost mother's death.


	In a full reveal that other big fall and awards season movies are world premiering elsewhere, TIFF announced that Guillermo del Toro's Jacob Elordi and Oscar Isaac Frankenstein is getting a North American premiere in addition to Benny Safdie's Dwayne Johnson movie The Smashing Machine in which the former WWE wrestler plays mixed-martial arts and UFC champion Mark Kerr. Meanwhile, Edward Berger's Colin Farrell, Tilda Swinton psychological drama thriller, Ballad of a Small Player, is making its Canadian premiere at TIFF. Pic follows a high stakes gambler who is laying low in Macau whose past and debts start to catch up with him. He encounters a kindred spirit who might just hold the key to his salvation.


	In addition, the closing night movie is Peak Everything from Canadian director Anne Émond playing on the last night of the fest on Saturday, Sept. 13.


	TIFF, presented by Rogers, takes place Sept. 4–14. The festival says they've invited movies from 30 countries.

Tammy Slaton, 38, who rose to fame through the hit TLC series “1000-Lb Sisters,” has once again stunned fans! Tammy posted jaw-dropping new photos showcasing her ongoing weight loss journey. 

The reality star, who began sharing her health transformation in 2020, has now lost a staggering 500 pounds and undergone surgery to remove excess skin. 

On Saturday, July 20, Tammy posted a TikTok slideshow featuring new images of herself looking confident, radiant, and almost unrecognizable. 

Though she left the caption blank, she used the viral sound “I understood the assignment,” signaling just how far she's come.

A post shared by Creative Chaos (@acreativechaospodcast)

The TikTok post quickly generated a wave of emotional and supportive comments. Fans were amazed by Tammy's glow-up, with one follower declaring, “Absolutely loving this era of Tammy.”

Another user wrote, “Ok Tammy! We see you 👀 happy looks good on you 💜,” while someone else gushed, “Looking amazing Tammy.”

@LuckySeven 🅱️  yall want to hear a great artist go check out my friend my Bestie I've known for years amazing person. I'm trying to help them make it big. and all I ask, is y'all to show them some love

The outpouring of love didn't stop there. One longtime fan commented, “I love your show soo much. I've been watching since day 1 and it's soo incredible to see how far you have come. Keep slaying queen 🥰.”

Perhaps the most touching message came from a follower who wrote, “Brought a tear to my eye. It's been honestly so inspiring and amazing to watch your journey. Never been prouder of a stranger in my life! Well done Tammy 👏.”

A post shared by Creative Chaos (@acreativechaospodcast)

Tammy's update included both selfie-style and full-body shots, showing off her slimmer figure. The use of filters and her fresh appearance had fans calling her transformation “unreal.” 

A post shared by TLC (@tlc)

Her TikTok presence has evolved into a space of positivity, self-love, and resilience—qualities that have resonated with her audience since the beginning.

A post shared by Tammy L Slaton (@queentammy86)

Together with a friend, Tammy has contributed to a collective weight loss of over 2,000 pounds. While she has made incredible strides, she has been candid about the challenges she continues to face.

A post shared by Dr. Eric Smith (@doctorericsmith_)

While Tammy isn't behind the wheel just yet, she's already envisioning her dream ride: a classic Ford Mustang GT, which she adorably referred to as a “vintage stang” during a recent podcast appearance.

She also shared exciting personal news—her engagement to longtime partner Andrea Dalton. After three years of dating, Tammy proudly revealed her engagement ring on a podcast hosted by Hunter Ezell. The couple has kept their relationship mostly private, but her recent posts suggest she's entering a joyful and confident new era.

Tammy's journey—from her early struggles on “1000-Lb Sisters” to her current state of empowerment- has inspired millions. Her latest social media drop isn't just a photo update; it's a celebration of progress and hope. And fans can't wait to see what she'll do next.

Jennifer Garner shared a sweet mother-daughter moment with her eldest child, Violet, during a relaxed weekend outing in Los Angeles. As per photos published by People on Sunday, July 20, the “13 Going On 30” star, 53, treated her 19-year-old daughter and her friends to coffee. Garner shares Violet with ex-husband Ben Affleck.

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

As per the photos, Garner kept things effortlessly stylish in a white and gold striped shirt. She paired with high-waisted white pants and brown sandals. Garner completed the look with her signature dark, square-framed sunglasses.

Violet, now a college student, opted for a casual white T-shirt and wide-cut blue jeans. She accessorized with her familiar brown glasses and black-and-white sneakers. The two appeared relaxed and all smiles, soaking in their low-key family moment.

This latest outing comes just a week after Garner and Affleck reunited to spend time with their younger children, Seraphina, 16, and Samuel, 13. They enjoyed a casual outing at Fenway Park in Boston. On July 11, the family attended the Boston Red Sox vs. Tampa Bay Rays game, where they were seated in the front row. 

Cameras captured Affleck, 52, in a green Red Sox cap, sitting with Garner between their two children. “Great Red Sox family right there, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and their kids,” NESN commentator Dave O'Brien said during the televised broadcast.

Affleck and Garner were married from 2005 to 2018 and continue to co-parent their three children amicably.

Earlier this year, Garner opened up to People magazine and spoke about parenting as her children, who continue to grow into young, promising adults. 

“They're really solid right now,” she said. “I'm just watching them in this new phase of life where they're figuring out who they're going to be and what they're going to study. And I'm so interested in them. All the time, I'm interested in everything about them.”

Still, she admitted that giving them space to make their own decisions is one of the most challenging aspects of parenting. “I mean, my parents did too, and I'm so amazed by that. I have a hard time not saying, ‘This is what I see you as,' and ‘I think you should.' I really have to sit on my hands,” she said.

Apart from Violet, Garner and Affleck continue to co-parent their daughter, Seraphina, 15, and son, Samuel, 12.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jared Padalecki's Wife Drops Cute PDA Photo That Has Fans Swooning","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jared-padalecki-wife-pda-birthday/","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 02:02:44 GMT","

“Supernatural” sure knows how to bring co-stars together in real life. We have Jensen and Danneel Ackles, Rob Benedict and Ruth Connell, Meg Donnelly and Drake Rodger, Mark Sheppard and Sarah Sheppard, DJ Qualls and Ty Olsson, and yes, Jared Padalecki and Genevieve Padalecki. 

The last two are definitely no exception. Especially after they like to remind fans how strong of a marriage they have. Like this week. Jared just turned 43, and his wife, Genevieve, made sure the world knew how loved he is. How? With a kiss, a convertible, and a carousel of memories that has fans crying into their flannels.

A post shared by Genevieve Padalecki (@genpadalecki)

On Saturday, July 19, Genevieve posted a heartfelt Instagram tribute to her husband of 15 years. “Almost 17 years together, 15 married,' she wrote on Instagram. “What a privilege and gift to wish @jaredpadalecki another year around the sun. I love you with all my heart. Grateful to celebrate you today. ❤️”

The photos were definitely a mix of goofy, glamorous, and intimate. One shows them cracking up mid-sentence, another has them riding in a drop-top, wind in their hair straight out of a CW romance. And yes, there's a full-blown kiss picture that had fans losing their minds in the comments. One wrote, “Happy birthday sam, yes I said sam😘 you and ruby (@jaredpadalecki @genpadalecki ) have a beautiful family and absolutely beautiful kiddos!! Who knew yalls parts in supernatural would lead to a marriage and decades together.”

But this birthday post is just the latest chapter in a love story that's been unfolding since “Supernatural's” fourth season.

Let's rewind to 2008, shall we? Jared was already an established heartthrob as Sam Winchester on “Supernatural” when Genevieve (then Cortese) joined the cast as Ruby. She was a demon in lacy underwear, as Jared famously recalled.

“I was a single dude, and she was a pretty girl in her underwear on her first day on set,” Jared revealed at a convention in 2012. “I was very excited to meet her. Meanwhile, I think she was like, ‘Who is this long-haired a-hole who thinks he can talk to me while I'm reading a book?'”

Despite that rocky first impression, sparks flew. They started dating in fall 2008, got engaged the following year, and tied the knot in Idaho on February 27, 2010.

Since then, they've built a life that includes three children, Tom, Shep, and the adorable Odette, along with a herd of mini horses, chickens, and even a taxidermied chicken that lives in their guest bathroom. Yeah, we're not asking about that; we know better. 

A post shared by Genevieve Padalecki (@genpadalecki)

What makes Jared and Genevieve's love story so irresistible isn't just the CW beginnings or the red carpet appearances. It's their balance of glamour and grit. For their honeymoon? They hiked Machu Picchu, and they have repeatedly said they enjoy kayaking and food truck dates. You know, just down-to-earth things that make them the couple they are today.

Even after 15 years, the couple still sneaks in goofy couple challenges on Instagram and cuddles up for annual tributes. Whether it's Father's Day, an anniversary, or a birthday bash, the Padaleckis never miss a chance to show up for each other, digitally and IRL.

So yes, Jared's 43rd birthday post was cute. But what makes it swoon-worthy is the quiet through-line that runs through every pic, caption, and kiss. It's a love story that started on a demon-hunting set and never stopped growing. 

Now, excuse us while we go cry into our “Supernatural” DVDs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Tom Cruise's Ex Gushes Over Him in Recent Interview","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/tom-cruises-ex-gushes-over-him-in-recent-interview/","Mon, 21 Jul 2025 17:05:38 GMT","

Rebecca De Mornay still thinks fondly of her ex Tom Cruise.

During a recent interview with Page Six, De Mornay said that she is “really proud” of the actor.

De Mornay and Cruise co-starred in teen comedy “Risky Business” in 1983, which kick-started their respective careers. The two started dating while filming the project, and went on to date for over two years after its release. 

“He is a brilliant, brilliant interpreter of what the zeitgeist is,” De Mornay told the outlet of Cruise's success today. “I'm really, really proud of knowing him from when we were in the suburbs of Chicago, and knowing what he wanted and where it is now.”

After “Risky Business,” Cruise's career took off. The A-lister has led multiple film franchises over the past few decades, such as “Top Gun” and “Mission: Impossible.”

Last month, “Top Gun: Maverick” director Joseph Kosinski confirmed that a third “Top Gun” film is in the writing process during an interview with British GQ. 

2022's “Top Gun: Maverick” was a massive financial and critical success, and became Cruise's highest-grossing film ever. While this year's “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” was only the franchise's fourth-highest grossing film, it still had the best opening weekend of any “Mission: Impossible” movie.

“We started this together and look what he did with it,” De Mornay said.

Meanwhile, De Mornay decided to keep her career more low-key. After “Risky Business,” she took on grittier roles – including a railway worker in “Runaway Train” and a sinister nanny in “The Hand That Rocks The Cradle.”

A post shared by BELLA (@bellathorne)

The actress, 65, makes an appearance in “Saint Clare,” which released in theaters and digitally on July 18. The film stars Bella Thorne, who plays a young serial killer who targets predatory men, spurred on by mysterious voices. 

“It's very rare that I read scripts about a female serial killer who's obsessed with Joan of Arc, which I thought was just brilliant,” De Mornay told Page Six about why she agreed to take on the role.

“I just wanted to be a support to this project,” she continued.

Osgood Perkins is getting into the relationship-horror film subgenre. The auteur, who recently helmed both “Longlegs” and “The Monkey” for NEON, is set to release his third film with the distributor in less than a 16-month span. Perkins also became the first ever filmmaker to land a first-look deal with the acclaimed studio, as announced in May 2025. 

For “Keeper,” though, writer/director Perkins is just helming it: Nick Lepard wrote the script, with the one-location horror film shot during the 2023 strikes between the “Longlegs” and “The Monkey” productions. The logline for “Keeper” reads: “During an anniversary getaway at a remote cabin, a wife (Tatiana Maslany) is left alone after her husband (Rossif Sutherland) departs, only to confront a sinister presence that exposes the cabin's chilling past.”

Maslany also starred in Perkins' “The Monkey,” which offered a sneak peek at “Keeper” in a post-credits scene. Perkins told IndieWire that “Keeper” is a “beautiful, beautiful movie” that has a “grown-up, kind of relationship horror” aspect. Perkins raved that actress Maslany is “just the greatest. She's so infinite. I'm so lucky to have her.”

And that wasn't the only stroke of luck on the project: “Keeper” was shot as an indie during the strikes. “It was made during the [Writers Guild] strike, so I couldn't write it,” Perkins said. “This lovely Canadian non-union guy [Nick Lepard] wrote this movie and we sort of figured out this thing.” 

He continued of his career, “I've landed myself in a supremely lucky position where all of my movies get to be one of one, right? I think that's almost expected now, at least after ‘Longlegs” into ‘The Monkey.' I think everybody's getting, ‘Oh right, he's not going to hit the same beat twice, I don't know what to expect.'”

Perkins added to IndieWire that ‘Keeper' will be similar to his “zoomed out” approach to the horror genre. While “Longlegs” was his “pop version” of horror, “The Monkey” was a comedy about death; “Keeper” is a meditation on relationships, much like fellow NEON release “Together.” 

NEON will premiere “Keeper” in theaters November 14. Check out the teaser trailer below.

Quentin Tarantino would give five years of his life to collaborate with this late legend. John Waters thinks one of her films is the among the greatest features of all time. Of course, both auteurs are speaking about the one and only Tura Satana. 

Late actress Satana's history is one for the record books: An Asian American trailblazer onscreen, Satana got her start in burlesque (she went by the stage name “Miss Japan Beautiful” as a teenager) and went on to lead the iconic 1965 classic “Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,” which solidified her status as a karate master in action films. 

 










While Satana's life had all the glitz imaginable (she infamously dated both Elvis and Rod Taylor), her traumatic childhood in part led to her acting career. At age nine, Satana was kidnapped, assaulted, and left for dead in a race-driven hate crime post-Pearl Harbor in 1948. She vowed to take revenge on her attackers, and did by way of her success.

Now, Satana's full story is being told in the long-awaited, authorized documentary simply titled “Tura!” The film, directed by Cody Jarrett and in the works since 2017, is narrated by Margaret Cho and includes interviews with John Waters, Dita Von Teese, Pamela Des Barres, Ted V. Mikels, original FPKK and Russ Meyer cast members and Satana's two daughters. “Tura!” uses home movies, never-before-seen cult film footage, and the late Satana's personal archives. 

 










The film is billed as showing Satana revisit her “innermost feelings as she experienced the events that molded and impacted her and those around her, from childhood to her [passing] in 2011.” Director Jarrett helmed Satana's final film, “Sugar Boxx.”

“Anyone who ever met Tura Satana came away with something unforgettable. She radiated,” Jarrett said in a press statement. “She was authentic. She was charming and a good listener. She was also wildly, hilariously unpredictable, at times bawdy, and could still kick ass right up until the end. There were a lot of popular, sexy women and cult movie stars in the 1960's, but few have left the widespread, lasting impact on society that Tura has, and she deserves recognition for that. It's easy to admire Tura for being the sexy, groundbreaking bad-ass we see on screen, but what it took, the sacrifices she made to get to that place and become that person we all admire so much — that's where the true love and respect begin.”

He continued, “I knew Tura, and this film is a labor of love, not just for me but all our cast and crew who either knew her or were affected by her on a personal level. So it was important for us to get it right; to really get to the core of who Tura was and express her feelings about her life experiences, not just observe them with an outsider's point of view. Tura's deathbed wish was for the making of this film. She wanted her fans to know everything, especially how much they meant to her. So, thank you for joining us in Tura's journey.”

 










“Tura!” is produced by Jarrett and Siouxzan Perry. Cho and Sarah Martin executive produce, with Max Borges and Joseph Dickstein as co-executive producers. 

Quiver will release “Tura!” in select theaters on Friday, August 1. Check out the trailer and poster, both IndieWire exclusives, below.

The world of Jane Austen is expanding a little further with more “Sense and Sensibility” casting. 

The Focus Features and Working Title iteration of the iconic novel will also star George MacKay, “Outlander” actress Caitríona Balfe, Frank Dillane, Herbert Nordrum, Bodhi Rae Breathnach, and Fiona Shaw, as announced Monday. 

As previously reported, Daisy Edgar-Jones will lead as Elinor Dashwood, with Esme Creed-Miles playing Marianne Dashwood. “Blue Jean” filmmaker Georgia Oakley will direct from a script by bestselling author Diana Reid. The feature has started filming in the United Kingdom.

 










Per an earlier announcement, “Originally published anonymously with the byline reading ‘By A Lady,' Austen's ‘Sense and Sensibility' established her as a literary force and remains a cornerstone of English literature. The timeless exploration of restraint and passion follows sisters Elinor (Edgar-Jones) and Marianne Dashwood, opposites in their emotional approach, as they navigate love, loss, and financial uncertainty amid the societal expectations of 18th-century England. Celebrated for its wit, deep social insights, and enduring cultural relevance, the novel launched the bright career of one of history's greatest authors.”

Focus and Working Title return to the Austen classics: Both studios collaborated on Wright's 2005 adaptation of “Pride & Prejudice” and Autumn de Wilde's 2020 take on “Emma.”

Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner of Working Title Films will produce “Sense and Sensibility” alongside India Flint of November Pictures and Jo Wallett. 

MacKay is believed to be the male lead; he recently led a slew of 2024 indie hits such as “Femme,” “The Beast,” and “The End.” Meanwhile, Edgar-Jones has starred in “Twisters” and “On Swift Horses,” and is set for Chloe Domont's “A Place in Hell” with Michelle Williams and Andrew Scott. 

Edgar-Jones will also shoot Fernando Meirelles' heist thriller “Here Comes the Flood” for Netflix, with Denzel Washington and Robert Pattinson co-starring. The film is billed as an “unconventional heist movie about a bank guard, a teller, and a master thief in a deadly game of cons and double crosses.” Meirelles directed 2019's “The Two Popes” also for Netflix, and helmed “The Sympathizer” and “Sugar” for TV. Simon Kinberg (“Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” upcoming “Star Wars” trilogy) wrote the script.

As teased, Tyler, the Creator has released a new album. The 10-song Don't Tap the Glass follows last October's Chromakopia and was previewed only with a handful of posts teasing its release date of Monday, July 21. Listen to the album, which clocks in at just under half an hour, below.

In a graphic about the album, Tyler framed it as a dance-forward party album. Here's the note in full:

I asked some friends why they don't dance in public and some said because of the fear of being filmed. I thought damn, a natural form of expression and a certain connection they have with music is now a ghost. It made me wonder how much of our human spirit got killed because of the fear of being a meme, all for having a good time. I just got back from a ‘listening party' for this album and man was it one of the greatest nights of my life. 300 people. No phones allowed. No cameras. Just speakers and a sweatbox. Everyone was dancing, moving, expressing, sweating. It was truly beautiful. I played the album front to back twice, it felt like that pent up energy finally got released and we craved the idea of letting more of it out. There was a freedom that filled the room. A ball of energy that might not translate to every speaker that plays this album but man did that room nail it. This album was not made for sitting still. Dancing driving running any type of movement is recommended to maybe understand the spirit of it. Only at full volume.

While full credits have not yet been released, opener “Big Poe” finds Tyler embodying the titular alter-ego alongside an as-yet-anonymous guest rapper and a sample of Busta Rhymes' “Pass the Courvoisier Part II,” which featured P. Diddy and Pharrell Williams.

Tyler, the Creator's rollouts for his albums have generally been pretty short, but Don't Tap the Glass arrives with the least notice yet. Here's a brief history, excluding the fairly traditionally promoted Goblin and Wolf: Tyler announced Cherry Bomb just a handful of days before its release, but fans got a bit more time (15 days) before he dropped Flower Boy. He trimmed that down to 11 days for Igor, but only eight days separated the announcement and release of Call Me If You Get Lost. For Chromakopia, Tyler once again let 11 days pass between announcement and the album's release. Even with the short rollouts, Tyler always made sure to release pre-album singles, but that was not the case for Don't Tap the Glass.

Tyler remains on tour in support of Chromakopia. He still has shows left to play in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines. He's also due to headline major North American music festivals including Lollapalooza and Outside Lands. See his latest tour dates here.

4.8

Genre:

Rap

Label:

Cactus Jack / Epic

Reviewed:

July 21, 2025

In the upset of the century, Travis Scott's voice is not the first that you hear on JACKBOYS 2, the second iteration of the Houston rapper's Cactus Jack compilation project. Ushering the listener into the label's renegade world is the legendary Bun B, one-half of Texas rap icons UGK, touting the potential of Houston becoming the next rap stronghold, delivered in the form of a faux-radio interview. A fair amount of mythmaking and shot-calling occurs in the 30-second intro: Bun evokes DJ Screw's immense impact and idyllic candy paint imagery before dropping an eye-widening statement, promising that JACKBOYS 2 will be the record to convince the rest of the country that Houston is up next. The claim is uttered in such a terse manner that it almost feels sarcastic when it hits your eardrums.

Yet, it falls in line with Travis' bulletproof self-efficacy. In the years since the 2019 release of JACKBOYS, his standing as one of rap's resident raging superstars has rarely been challenged, despite all the tragedy and tabloid gossip. He's ballooned to the size of a red giant star, wielding spectacles like Astroworld and UTOPIA to move weight in merchandise and ticket sales with an unnerving constancy.

But as Cactus Jack's label head, Travis' attention has been somewhat neglectful. It's hard out there for the likes of Don Toliver, SoFaygo (one album and a slew of low-impact EPs after signing in 2021), Sheck Wes (one full-length project since 2018), and the newly signed Wallie the Sensei. JACKBOYS 2 is another attempt to rectify this situation, where Travis tries to build a blockbuster event to let his charges showcase their stuff. Though, similar to the first edition, the Cactus Jack roster is relegated to supporting roles, reducing opportunities for an already shallow talent pool. It's especially magnified by paint-by-numbers trap and rage production that coasts on the tenets what's hot right now instead of pushing the envelope with quirkiness and individuality—whirring synths and pounding snares bleed together for songs at a time— while feeling devoid of earnest effort by its spearheading figure, manifesting in a record that pushes you closer to sleep than it does to rage.

It's as if the crew attempted to translate the “big cinematic event” feeling that colors Travis' albums (and, to a lesser extent, Toliver's solo releases like 2021's Life of a DON) into a compilation mixtape without any of the foundation needed to support it. It's obvious from the outset: “Champain & Vacay” should break the doors down with Waka Flocka Flame ad-libs, but the subdued, spaced-out synths combine with Travis' uninspired rebuttals at Pusha T creates a distractingly incongruous energy. It gets to the point where you begin to take Travis for his word when he raps, “On tracks not givin' a fuck/On wax not givin' a fuck,” on “2000 Excursion.” Even the superstar bells and whistles seem to be perfunctory on JACKBOYS 2—congratulations to 21 Savage's ghostly ad-libs on “Kick Out” and Future and Playboi Carti's obligatory weave over an unmemorable F1LTHY beat on “Where Was You”—which seems counterintuitive at its core.

Very little room is left for the rest of JACKBOYS to display any chemistry (with Travis or each other) or aptitude. They remind me of an AAU basketball team that never practices together, only showing up to the gym once a tournament to grab highlights for their own IG pages. Worthy clips are welcome surprises: Toliver's Auto-Tune croons trying to break through the atmosphere, Wallie the Sensei's saccharine vocal runs on “Can't Stop,” and Sheck Wes' free-wheeling repetition over producer AM's subtle electronic beeps and whirs on “ILMB.” But there seems to be a basic misunderstanding about what it means to put your crew in the best position to succeed. The dizzying list of production credits somehow results in a flattened terrain where stock, hyper-efficient rage and trap beats drone in the background, helping to ensure that the few opportunities for Sheck Wes and SoFaygo to do Opium-karaoke are wholly unremarkable.

What is the point of JACKBOYS 2? The most cynical reading is that it exists as a “Travis Scott featuring …” project, solely designed to give Harmony Korine another chance to make a short film and let Travis peddle another merch package. But evidenced by the fact that the Houston superstar is only a positive contributor in sparse moments—meeting the occasion earnestly to match Glorilla's raucous energy on “Shyne” (justice for the dueling Barrington Levy impressions) and handing the ball off to SahBabii on “Beep Beep”—this doesn't feel like an adequate answer. Showing the fruits of Cactus Jack Records' roster also does not seem to be the priority, either, making one question Travis' ability to boost anyone's profile, save for Toliver and his nicely carved niche.

Occam's razor, then, says this is a collection of loose cuts from each artist strewn together as physical proof that the JACKBOYS crew still exists, at least in name. It does make you think of Bun B's unfulfilled promise on the introduction and wince, wondering what it means that the city's biggest star's vision for the future rings so hollow.

July 21, 2025

Berlin's PAN label has been sidling up to Parisian gallery Bourse de Commerce since the latter opened its doors in 2021. The two collaborated on Baiser Mortel, an LP and performance of the same name that took place in the gallery the year it opened. In it, Paris-based producer Low Jack paired up with French rapper Lala &ce and a host of other musicians—one of whom was Le Diouck (real name Magueye Diouck.) The Senegalese French artist designs graphic novels and has performed on several releases with Boukan Records boss Bamao Yendé. His latest project, Grace Joke, is both his debut solo album for PAN and the prologue to a trilogy of comics he plans to release with Yasmeen El Hamdani in the coming years.

The album's title might sound like a dig at Grace Jones, but in fact it's a portmanteau of two characters from Le Diouck and El Hamdani's forthcoming novel: Grace is a young woman reanimated as a cyborg searching for her memories, and Joke is a down-and-out circus clown broken by melancholy. This split personality recalls the record's near namesake, who declared in a 1985 interview, “I'm schizophrenic, I have many moods.” Rendering his character sporting lipstick, an angular haircut, and a hundred-yard stare, Le Diouck evokes Jones' iconic figure on the cover of Grace Joke, a bubbling alt-R&B album that flaunts every iota of its maker's mercurial identity.

Until now Le Diouck's androgynous Auto-Tuned verses have sauntered across Afrobeats, batida, and dancehall tunes. But, as he told French television show Basique, he really loves Brazilian funk and rock, so a bunch of talented musicians from France's underground electronic scene and PAN's roster conjure up this refreshing blend for him on Grace Joke. Yann Rose's guitar and Yves Tumor's vocals breathe an emo edge into the alt rock of “Onigashima,” while the strings on “OVNIesque”—produced by Modulaw, Eliot Rdv, and Bamao Yendé—abruptly leap from their floating intro into short, skipping bursts over a funk beat.

Frequent sudden changes like those spice up the album's verse/chorus structure with sharp and unexpected turns in mood and intensity. After screaming over creeping grunge guitars at the start of “Émeraude,” Le Diouck retreats to a whisper beside light percussive taps. Such shifts in tone aren't always so blatant; occasionally Le Diouck lets them coexist like a devil and angel on each shoulder. The electric guitar whining beneath the jaunty reggae of “Cumbia del Diamante” mirrors the stark contrast in the track's video between Le Diouck's fabulous yellow tunic and the forlorn figure he cuts. Grace Joke and its many producers find boundless ways to make the record pop.

The sheer number of niche pop-cultural references Le Diouck weaves into his swooning verses make it denser than your usual R&B album. When he raps, “T'es ma Kajol, j'te rassure, pas de débarras” (“You're my Kajol, I assure you, no good riddance”) he invokes a popular Bollywood TV character to express a forbidden love. His rap braggadocio is hardly run of the mill, either. “Akira en Zinedine, fort” (“Akira on Zinedine, strong”) he raps on “La Païva,” reimagining Zinedine Zidane headbutting Marco Materazzi with a Tetsuo-sized head. It's an anecdote that many will only half get, much the way not all listeners will be able to keep up with his swerves between languages. But even for those of us who aren't polyglots, each linguistic shift replenishes his verses with fresh fight. “I'm tired of that shit/Ma nkoy watt,” he barks on “Thelma & Louise,” and the three abrupt Wolof syllables snap back at the English phrase like a kung-fu combo. It wouldn't be outrageous to compare Le Diouck's rapid-fire vocals to someone like MF DOOM, whose rhyming couplets pasted a rough collage of his universe rather than a clear picture. It was cryptic, but undeniably him.

On Grace Joke, Le Diouck reveals as many facets of himself as can be crammed into a single work of art. Like many releases on PAN, this omnivorous record is a feat of world-building; draped in a Technicolor dreamcoat of moods, ideas, and inspirations, it's a passionate defense of multiplicity in a world that often prefers a stifling consistency from its creators. Surely Grace Jones would approve.

In the 1977 queer manifesto The Faggots and Their Friends Between Revolutions, author Larry Mitchell juxtaposes the fantasies of “the faggots” with those of “the men.” The men fantasize about control, domination, personal accumulation; the faggots about love, solidarity, communal embodiment. In their self-titled debut Disiniblud, composer-musicians (and self-described Larry Mitchell fangirls) Rachika Nayar and Nina Keith bring to life these queer fantasies, asking what queer utopia might feel like and how we might collectively get there.

Built on the duo's longstanding friendship, Disiniblud (pronounced “Disney blood”) is a dreamy ode to community that weaves together electronic experimentation with subtle pop lyricism and explosive instrumentals with ambient soundscapes. It highlights the strengths within each artist's solo music: Where Nayar's 2022 debut full-length Heaven Come Crashing offered a transcendent mash-up of club beats and post-rock grandiosity, Keith's 2019 MARANASATI 19111 leaned into found sound and formlessness. On Disiniblud, Nayar's compositional rigor and Keith's intuitive process produce an album whose moments of quiet are as pointed as they are open-ended and whose moments of rapture embrace desire as much as release.

For Disiniblud, utopia is an exercise in imagination and observation alike. On the bucolic “Serpentine,” featuring Cassandra Croft, an undulating guitar and muted piano trade looping figures back and forth, evoking the gentle rocking motion of a lullaby. Croft's reverb-soaked vocals float atop shimmering synths, as the sun grows, a door opens, and we are launched towards the bright unknown. If “Serpentine” is a daydream, “Traces in the window” is its lunar counterpart. The haunting alto of ASPIDISTRAFLY's April Lee, reminiscent of Grouper, narrates dark silhouettes from behind a pane: “a stray creature,” “a stanza,” “the spleen of existence.” Observation gives way to revelation and, by extension, another world.

In uncovering multiple portals to utopia, Disiniblud home in on childlike wonder—a force that permeates the entire album. On “Blue Rags, Raging Wind,” hammered figures play in rounds, recalling a toy xylophone or a music box. Meanwhile, simple keyboard melodies on tracks like “No more to see” and “whole30 Fight Club” recall the guileless piano work of ambient composer Harold Budd. Proof that “childlike” doesn't always mean “simple,” the title track sounds like a direct descendant of Sigur Ros's “Hoppípolla” (Icelandic for “hopping in puddles”), both in its youthful exuberance and its sweeping emotional arc. Video game blips and whirring machines propel the track skyward into a dramatic post-rock windstorm. In featuring nearly all of the album's collaborators, including Julianna Barwick, Tujiko Noriko, and Willy Siegel of Ponytail, the track acts as a thesis statement on the centrality of community to Disiniblud's vision of paradise.

More than anything though, Disiniblud sounds like hope. “[it could happen]” chops up and loops its eponymous mantra, as the sound of a helicopter readies for lift-off. On “It's Change,” trills, whoops, and fluttering flutes convey humor and delight while offering a landing spot for heartbreak. Love and loss are inextricable, and Disiniblud reprise melodic motifs and vocal samples across different tracks to gesture at this dialectic. Barwick's gauzy intonations of “give up,” for instance, float through both “It's Change” and “Give-upping,” sister tracks that celebrate letting go. Filmic in a way that recalls Explosions in the Sky or Nayar's own “Heaven Come Crashing,” “Give-upping” feels like standing on the precipice of a cliff before a world that is startlingly whole. Barwick's ethereal vocals echo like a chorus from on high, as subdivisions stack up into a wall of sound. Under a single pounding piano note, a droney sub-bass beats like a Kali Malone organ, as a mechanical ratcheting recalls a roller coaster's ascent. The ensuing drop may be vertiginous, and the promise may be unknown—but such is queer life. It is always an act of faith.

Nayar and Keith, for their part, know this well. They know that the earth, as Larry Mitchell put it, has been “scarred and gouged and stripped and bombed,” and it is time for the fairies to leave the world of men and to make one of their own. With Disiniblud, the duo have done just that. They've built a garden full of twinkling guitars and gossamer voices, shadowy caves and blinding light. The air is warm here, and the door is open.

Zach Bryan closed out his three-night run in New Jersey with a bang. Before the musician hit the stage on Sunday, July 20, the Bruce Springsteen record “House of a Thousand Guitars” blared throughout MetLife Stadium. It was a hometown homage to the veteran artist (“I'm Goin' Down” opened the previous show), but also a preview of what the night had in store. Toward the end of his set, Bryan welcomed Springsteen to the stage alongside Kings of Leon‘s Caleb Followill.


	“One of them is Caleb Followill from Kings of Leon, one of the sweetest men I've ever met,” Bryan told the audience while introducing his special guests for the night. “And one of the greatest men to ever exist, a New Jersey native, Mr. Bruce Springsteen.” 


	Falling into a rhythm together, the trio performed “Atlantic City” from Springsteen's 1982 album Nebraska. A few songs later, Springsteen joined Bryan once again to close out the show with an encore performance of “Revival.” Bryan and Springsteen previously performed “Atlantic City” this past August, as well as their collaboration track, “Sandpaper” from The Great American Bar Scene.












	“I've lived here in this place my whole life, around a group of people I cared about, and I wanted to write music that I felt would simply remain meaningful,” Springsteen told Bryan in Rolling Stone‘s Musicians on Musicians issue in 2024. “I didn't want to lose touch with who I was, where I came from. I thought that these things were essential to my sanity. Not necessarily to my success, but to my own personal sanity, to my own personal well being… And so that's what kept me on a certain path for a long time.”

	For Bryan, Springsteen has served as a roadmap for how he imagines his own future as a musician. “That's where I'm at in my own career right now. I love country music, but I also love an assortment of stuff — Kings of Leon, Jason Isbell, all those guys,” Bryan said. “I don't want to be a country musician. Everyone calls me it. I want to be a songwriter, and you're quintessentially a songwriter. No one calls Bruce Springsteen — hate to use your name in front of you — but no one calls Bruce Springsteen a freaking rock musician, which you are one, but you're also an indie musician, you're also a country musician. You're all these things encapsulated in one man. And that's what songwriting is.”

	In midtown Manhattan one fall night, a mélange of bros descended upon Herald Square to see Creed. They walked around clutching Budweiser beers and hot dogs in their fists — some of them even lit their Marlboro reds in unison during “Higher.” The crowd was peppered with 3 Doors Down shirts (they were the opening act), Dallas Cowboys jerseys with “Stapp” on the back, and the types of dirty-joke tees you buy on the Jersey Shore boardwalk (one read “Do MILFs Not Drugs”).


	This was all happening not in 2002 — but last November, when the band sold out Madison Square Garden.


	The last time Creed played the Garden, it was the year 2000. They were both the biggest and most hated band in the world. The Christian tinges of their lyrics, baritone dramatics of Scott Stapp's voice, shoulder-length wind-blown hair, greased up chests and perpetually unbuttoned shirts made the band and others like them symbols of all that was uncool about modern rock music at the time.


	But for every joke at Creed's expense in their heyday, the band would sell another thousand CDs, tallying up nearly 30 million albums sold in America, with 53 million worldwide. When it comes to the bestselling acts of the millennium, the band was up there with Eminem, Britney Spears, Toby Keith, and Jay-Z. And while all those acts were prodded in their own ways by the public and the critics, the only other bands that were as maligned as Creed were the bands that sounded like them: Nickelback, 3 Doors Down, Staind, Hinder, Buckcherry and the rest of the Top 40 hard rock of that era.

	











	At the time, these über-masc hard-rockers were seen as the regrettable product of a generation of musicians who idolized the sound of grunge icons like Nirvana and Pearl Jam but wanted to live the more debauched and ideally less depressed life of the Sunset Strip rockers like Guns ‘n Roses or Mötley Crüe. Not exactly grunge but not exactly metal, they fell under the umbrella term “butt rock,” a name the bands loathed but the fans have adopted more earnestly over the years.

	“In the early 2000s, rock is back,” recalls critic and 60 Songs That Explain the ‘90s host Rob Harvilla. Around the time butt rock reigned, Harvilla had just begun working at an alt-weekly in Columbus, Ohio. “The Strokes and the White Stripes were considered very cool, magazine-cover-worthy bands. Meanwhile, Nickelback are selling 10 million records. The entire point of declaring some rock cool is to cast further aspersions on the actual popular rock bands at the time. You always need the cool band and the uncool band for it to be defined against.”


	In the decades following, Creed and others either waned in popularity or imploded the way popular rock bands often do: lineup changes, substance abuse, legal issues, deaths. The acts that kept it going became focused on touring, failing to see their new songs or albums climb the charts the way they used to. But before Creed reunited in 2023, however, a tide was already shifting. Millennials who came of age when Creed and other bands like them ruled the charts, have fonder memories than the seemingly more discerning adults of the time recall. Their childhoods are peppered with memories of hearing “One Last Breath” on the Top 40 stations or watching Nickelback's “Photograph” video on MTV. Those memories were good, remarkable even. 

“I just need my kids” – Me, a kid #nickelback #dadrock #2000sthrowback 


	Over the past three years, content shared about these bands shifted from sneering jokes to loving or humorous memories. Fans started to call the genre “divorced-dad rock,” a natural evolution of classic rock's “dad rock” moniker. There are Gen Z content creators sharing their songs and attending butt-rock dance parties. Even big pop stars are singing their praises. On Instagram Live in 2023, Megan Thee Stallion turned up the volume and stopped what she was doing to dance to “How You Remind Me” when it came on shuffle. “We need to pull up the instrumental,” she said, right before imitating the way Chad Kroeger sings the word “yeah.” SZA defended both Creed and Nickelback during an interview with Variety.

	“Do white people hate Nickelback?” she asked after the interviewer facepalmed in response to her saying she loved those bands. “I like Creed so much — ‘Higher'? Why are you hating on it? Have you ever felt more inspired and uplifted in your life? I'm in the car and I'm blasting ‘Higher,' I feel like it's a gospel song, the vocals are going crazy and it's also somehow slightly romantic, it just feels so fun. Because even if it's cliche, he's so fucking dead-ass! I will be a Creed fan forever.”

	











	Nostalgia cycles are natural; every 20 to 25 years, some trend or genre or subculture comes back into the mainstream, revived and reinvented by kids who were too young to experience it the first time. The past five years have been flush with aughts microtrends: baggy low-rise pants, baby T-shirts, the bright pastels of Club Libby Lu, Fueled by Ramen pop punk. The streets of Manhattan's SoHo area are as indecipherable from 2002 as the Creed concert had been. The cycle can become so accidentally ubiquitous that the former kids who blissfully existed outside of whatever discourses these trends or bands started in their heyday wonder now, as adults, what was so bad about them in the first place. 

Nothing butt rock in this one  #fypp #alternativeband #alternativemusic 


	But massive tours and some Instagram memes are just the tip of the butt-rock iceberg: There are sold-out cruises, a festival on land, bootleg merch, streaming hikes, and dance parties in every major American city. The bands themselves are back to reap the benefits: Creed starred in a Super Bowl commercial last year for Paramount+, where Drew Barrymore, Patrick Stewart, and Arnold of Hey Arnold! sang “Higher.”


	But it's not just the meme makers who are reclaiming the music of their youth. So have the Trump-loving, manosphere-running conservative bros, a more fitting reflection of the post-9/11 Bush era during which these bands found their audiences, adding a more complicated layer to the butt-rock revival. The audience for these bands is more confusing than ever, split between the extremely online humorists and the more earnest ticket buyers, who probably never stopped loving these bands in the first place. Between them is where the irony starts to blur: Were Creed and Nickelback unfairly rated? And if so, who are they even for anyway?


	ON HALLOWEEN IN New York City, the usual crowd of costumed revelers packed out Fig. 19, a speakeasy cocktail bar on the Lower East Side. There were cats, zombies, a topical Challengers couples' costume, and, unlike most parties, a high volume of Fred Dursts. Behind the decks, the Deadbangers Ball's host and DJ, Alanna Raben, played Korn and Creed as the backward red caps drank Mezcallica and Black Hole Rum cocktails.


	Raben's first Deadbangers Ball was five Halloweens prior, in 2019. She had been DJ'ing around New York for a while, and was starting to grow frustrated with playing the same Top 40 every night. Raben, a millennial, is a fan of music that “sounds and feels like a lower-back tattoo,” she says. “I have a strong love for tribal tramp stamps and wallet chains and Ed Hardy. I will definitely date a dude with a soul patch or a landing strip. So I champion it. I'm here for it.” 


	Before she started hosting her own hard-rock parties, she'd throw on Nickelback and Creed in between Drake or the Chainsmokers to test out the crowd.

	











	“I felt like 2 a.m. was this magic hour where I could finally play what I liked, and it resonated with people,” she recalls. “Those people making faces pretending to despise this music are now too drunk to hide it. They're lip-synching to ‘How You Remind Me.'”


	A year earlier, she started “Grunch,” a grunge brunch where she would play a mix of grunge, post-grunge, and a host of other semi-related rock from those eras. Bushwick restaurant El Cortez served up Nickelback Shots, Red Hot Chili Nachos, and Korn on the Cob to a packed-out crowd. 


	“When I first started these events, it wasn't exactly cool or accepted,” Raben admits. “Venues would hear me pitch an event centered around butt rock and turn their heads.” During the pandemic, she turned her Grunch Instagram into a meme page. It has since accrued 178,000 followers with her Fred Durst Fridays and Scott Stapp Sundays stealing the show. When pandemic bans lifted, she saw her parties grow, too. 

A post shared by GRUNCH (@grunchrules)


	“We're selling out events across various cities. We do an event called Nothing Butt-Rock and venues are now requesting us to host afterparties for bands and shows,” Raben says. Grunch has hosted official afterparties for Crazytown and Limp Bizkit concerts, as well as a club party for VIP-ticket buyers at Creed's show at Long Island's Jones Beach amphitheater this July. “People recognized that our love for the music is genuine. There's a real fan base out there. The memes have definitely proven that,” she says.


	Meanwhile, down south, songwriter Bryan Frazier grew up idolizing Nickelback and Creed. 


	“I always loved these bands,” the 35-year-old Virginia native says proudly. He moved to Nashville in his twenties to pursue his music career. “People hated them and tried to make fun of you for liking this music. It's been a funny cycle of it coming back around where it's cool again to like it. I guess people are admitting it.”


	At BMI's Key West Songwriters Festival, he realized he wasn't alone in unabashedly loving this era of music. He was in the Atlanta airport with a few other musicians who attended the conference, and they got to talking about those rock songs they couldn't avoid on the radio as kids. “We were trading memes and being like, ‘Oh, man, we miss that music,'” Frazier says.


	One of the new friends was from the Raised Rowdy brand, a podcast network and live-event promoter in Nashville. They decided to create a house band and put on a show where the city's songwriter community could sing some of their favorites from this era, creating “a professional cover band with really good singers.”

	











	“It brought everyone back to being young,” he says of the first Butt Rock Night, which happened at Live Oak in March 2021. Nearly 250 people attended. “No one was in competition with each other. We were all just kids again singing the songs we loved.”

A post shared by Bryan Frazier (@bryanfraziermusic)


	Frazier has since started his own Instagram page, where he produces memes and reels about loving the same bands they cover at the show. The page has accrued 165,000 followers and even supportive comments from Scott Stapp. In November, Butt Rock Night hosted the official afterparty for Nickelback's Live in Nashville album, “a big milestone moment for this ridiculous night,” Frazier says.


	“Creed and a lot of those guys have been made fun of for so long, it took them a while to get on board to like and comment and understand we weren't making fun of them,” he continues. “We are 100 percent superfans of these guys, and the term is not derogatory. We want to make them bigger. We're trying to make it a positive term.”


	It's clear the bands are feeling the positivity and even rethinking their relationship with a genre name that held such negative connotations for so long. Hinder, who have seen a remarkable jump in popularity for their song “Lips of an Angel,” have found themselves back on the road and in the studio, having released the astutely named album Back to Life in May. 


	“The renaissance was happening, and we just thought it was a perfect time to get out there and put new music out and kind of piggyback off of it, since we have the eyes on us and on the songs,” says drummer Cody Hanson. 

man risked his life for a tune #producer #hinder #lipsofanangel #original


	And the fans are definitely searching for Hinder: A representative for TouchTunes shared data trends with Rolling Stone, and Hinder saw a 22 percent increase in plays from 2022 to 2024. At the bar across the street from where Frazier hosts Butt Rock Night, they had to take “Lips of an Angel” off the jukebox because it was being played too much.


	Grunch and Butt Rock Night are just two in a wave of butt-rock themed pages and parties. In L.A. this past May, DJ and nu-metal enthusiast Holiday Kirk put on Creed Night at a downtown venue where amateur wrestlers broke drywall over their heads as “Higher” poured out of the speakers. Last fall, SiriusXM Octane host and content creator Jesea Lee co-hosted his first butt-rock-themed party in Cleveland with emo party promoters Jukebox Breakdown. 


	Lee's popular TikTok page is dedicated to hard-rock and metal news, so he began noticing a shift in positive accolades toward butt-rock bands in his own comments section back in 2023.

	











	“There was a noticeable huge tide turn on Nickelback,” he explains. This was between the release of the Canadian band's 2022 album. Get Rollin', and the premiere of its documentary, Hate to Love, which is now streaming on Netflix. “Every time I post content about them and it does get crapped on, those commenters get crapped on back. People will say ‘It's not cool to pretend to not like Nickelback.'”


	All of these parties and meme pages have found success in a fusion of post-grunge, hard rock, and nu metal, combining the distinct genres under the same umbrella term of butt-ock, even though Korn, Deftones, and Limp Bizkit were not only markedly different in their approach, but also hated the butt-rock sound as much as everyone else claimed they did at the time. The nu-metal revival predated Creed's and Nickelback's comebacks by a few years; there were multiple Woodstock ‘99 docs, the repopularization of the JNCO brand, and a big Deftones collaboration with Heaven by Marc Jacobs that starred It-girl model Gabbriette in its campaign. As more bands that were played on the same rock and Top 40 stations during that time get reborn, the concept of Nineties-music nostalgia gets further flattened.

A post shared by GRUNCH (@grunchrules)


	Harvilla began to notice the blurred lines of late-Nineties genres as he produced his podcast 60 Songs That Explain the ‘90s and while writing its corresponding book.


	“The late Nineties were a weird, transitional wasteland,” he says. All of these genres that had such stark lines in the Nineties have now become a more nebulous concept, blending into one supergenre of just “Nineties music.” The same can be said for Y2K as well, as many of those bands only became more successful in the new millennium. 


	Nostalgia and memory can be tricky. Most of the posts Lee has noticed on his TikTok feed have been millennials and Gen Z listeners recalling their experiences hearing Staind or 3 Doors Down or Puddle of Mudd or System of a Down in their parents' cars. The genre lines mean nothing; this was nothing more than the Top 40 hard rock that defined their childhoods. 


	But the Gen X'ers who weren't making fun of butt rock are still very much active fans. They're not the ones attending the trendy dance parties; they're the ones selling out cabins on Creed's cruise and filling the lawns at the sold-out amphitheater runs each summer. In the comments of viral videos, they've become protective and even territorial, Lee says. 


	“You see a lot of angry older people in the comments,” he says, mostly on “butt rock rankings” of artists and albums that younger fans have shared. “‘You don't even know about that,' or, ‘How could you rank this? You weren't there.'”

	











	“These bands sold millions and millions of records and their fans loved them unironically,” Harvilla adds. “They loved them despite the fact that they were uncool, or maybe because they were uncool. And that's a more interesting relationship to have with a band than to just be told to like something. That's something more strident, more honest, more personal.”

	CREED'S MADISON SQUARE Garden show took place just a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president again. There were no red hats visible in the audience, but there was a sense of victory among the attendees. At least two “USA!” chants occurred during the set of opening act 3 Doors Down (who played Trump's first inauguration in 2017). At least four more happened after Creed took the stage.


	“There's no way any Kamala [Harris] voters would go to this,” commented the millennial men behind me, pronouncing Kamala's name incorrectly. 


Flightless Bird host David Farrier encountered a similar scene when he saw Creed in San Bernardino, California. Farrier grew up in New Zealand and attended a conservative Christian school. Creed and Nickelback were huge in his home country, but Creed were able to get the stamp of approval from his school and family because of the Christian-sounding themes from a band that never explicitly identified as being religious. The crowd was, as Farrier recalls, “deeply Trump-y.” The concert reminded him of the Baptist megachurches of his youth; Stapp even stopped the show to pray after a fan was injured in the pit.


	“Nothing Scott Stapp is doing is ironic,” he says. It's part of the problem Creed's haters had with them to begin with: He's an incredibly earnest frontman who toys with the theatrics of Eighties rock machismo — crotch gyrating, legs splayed out in a Warrior 2 pose while belting so hard that his tanned skin is always covered in beads of sweat within the first few songs.

A post shared by Creed Fanpage (@creed.daily)


	“There's this very hypermasculine vibe,” Farrier continues. “Looking at the crowd that was at the Creed concert I went to, it did feel like the attitude of men who were there was, ‘We can be men. It's not shameful to be into this hypermasculine, very right-leaning Christian world.”


	Online, people have joked about the parallels Trump's second administration has had to George W. Bush's presidency: the blind nationalism, the Islamophobia, the fearmongering around who does and does not legally reside here. It was no accident that these hard-rock bands thrived even more in the wake of a deeply patriotic era in modern American history; Creed were notably called upon to headline the halftime show at the Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving game in 2001, which doubled as a 9/11 tribute. Video of the almost outlandishly patriotic show featured a choir,  flag spinners, aerial silk performers, and live doves. It has recently begun going viral every year during the Super Bowl, despite not being affiliated with the Super Bowl, and spawned a popular shirt that calls it “the greatest halftime show ever.”


	Whether or not they were explicitly religious or even political, these bands represented simple ideas of good and evils, songs about sin and salvation. ​​“I think politically, the world that these bands came up in and grew up in and were popular in is being mirrored now,” Farrier adds. “It's less about the old-school Christian values I grew up with, but more the idea that it's OK to be white and proud and a man, and it's cool you can rock really hard still.”

	











	As apolitical as the Instagram memes and viral videos have been, that hasn't stopped alt-right influencers from adopting butt rock's resurgence as a positive sign for their movements. Political commentator Rogan O'Handley posted on X: “Gen Z kids are listening to Creed & Nickelback. They're going to church in record numbers. They're intolerant of LGBT extremism. They're supporting Trump in record numbers. They're barely drinking alcohol and avoiding hookup culture. This generation didn't grow up watching MTV, Hollywood movies, and legacy media. They grew up on the internet and self selected the content they wanted. And it turns out when the human mind isn't brainwashed, it drifts towards the Bible and traditional values. And 90s rock.”

A post shared by @buttrocknight


	Outside of 3 Doors Down's inauguration performance and Staind's Aaron Lewis declaring “God bless Donald Trump and J.D. Vance” in concert, most of these bands' politics have been opaque. Canadian act Nickelback are confusingly co-headlining a “Rock the Country” tour with Trump superfan Kid Rock. Stapp endorsed God during a concert prior to the 2024 election.


	“They want us divided. They want us separate. They want us compartmentalized in our little niches, in our own little groups … to keep us distracted from holding them accountable,” he said at a Texas show last September. “We remind them that we are a constitutional republic built upon the Bible and the word of God, and not a ‘democracy.'” He went on to say that “civil rights are being violated every day” and that “everything we accuse almost every other country of doing, we're doing right here.”


	“I would say I am a Creed fan,” Farrier says now, “and yet I don't stand by any of the values they preach on, or certainly the values I imagine a lot of the people I found myself in the crowd with have. But I fit right in at a Creed concert: I'm a white male in his forties wandering around.”

	










A post shared by Creed Fanpage (@creed.daily)


	UNLIKE FARRIER, I did not fit in at the Creed concert. As a Black millennial woman, I was an anomaly in Madison Square Garden that Friday night. But I grew up in the Midwest loving Creed, Nickelback, Staind, Hinder, and the collection of nu-metal bands that get lumped in with them on all of these meme pages and parties.


	During a classmate's 10th birthday party, I watched her receive a copy of Creed's Weathered from her sister and cry tears of joy. Since my twenties, I've belted out “How You Remind Me” and “With Arms Wide Open” in countless karaoke rooms. At age 30, I took a stretch limo with six Canadians to go see Nickelback perform at New Jersey's Starland Ballroom. Last summer, I wore a backward red hat and black cargo pants on a party bus to see Limp Bizkit. During the three years since, I've attended countless butt-rock-themed parties, blurring the lines between reporting for this story and simply going for my own enjoyment. I like listening to this music, so much so that a number of songs from this era have snuck their way into my Spotify Wrapped and Apple Music Replay over the past few years.


	I've come to understand that the appeal of these bands to me, someone who is not part of their ideal demographic, is the same appeal I get from the girly pop music I love and typically cover: the heightened sense of gender performance. The overly taut, veiny muscles, the bad facial hair, the low-hanging oversize jeans, the tribal tattoos, the beer swigging. It's a type of masculinity that feels both dramatic and sexless.

The beer that will never be topped #creed #summerof99tour 


	“I've never had the pleasure of seeing Creed live, but I always pictured them as very long-flowing-hair-in-the-wind-machine, foot up on the monitor, messianic pose, with arms wide open,” Harvilla says. “This very resonant idea of the rock star frontman on the cross.”


	For millennials like Raben, it felt like both the butt-rock bands and their nu-metal peers were just as in on the joke — sometimes.


	“I feel like Fred Durst created that personality,” she says. “When he puts the red hat on, he's Fred Durst. I accept the role for what it is: fun to watch, fun to listen to.”


	Nostalgia cycles have a tendency to make people wonder if the criticism against what was once deemed uncool was actually underrated. But this particular musical resurgence is so tied into the songs themselves and what they evoke it's hard to ignore a certain level of musical mastery these bands had over creating pretty-timeless anthems.

	











	“I think the music is good,” Farrier says. “I think ‘Higher' is an incredible song. They make amazing pop songs.”




	“I like Nickelback just fine, but I don't think we need to go all the way now to claim that they were truly great or that they were the best rock band of their time,” Harvilla argues. “They never needed the critical acclaim, and I think that's the thing that frustrates critics more, the idea that we don't have any control and we can't tell the world at large what to like.”


	In some ways, the critical reappraisal has barely started, though the country community has already led the charge. In 2024, Nickelback were invited to be special guests at Stagecoach, Coachella's sister festival in Indio, California, that highlights country music. They were joined onstage by Hardy and Jelly Roll. When Creed filled the same slot this year, they were joined by Tori Kelly.

	The bands are finding ways to keep the goodwill coming. Creed leaned into nostalgia by naming their cruise “Summer of ‘99.” This summer, they'll take it to land for a festival of the same name in East Troy, Wisconsin. Nickelback will co-headline. Even if they're still not considered cool, it's clear butt-rock bands have become truly beloved.


	​​“I do think they enjoyed being huge more than they would've enjoyed being cool,” Harvilla says. ““They certainly make more money that way. They're able to play arenas forever. You have to choose to an extent.” These bands probably chose wisely.

Demi Lovato is in the final stages of her ninth studio album. A source close to the project tells Rolling Stone Monday that Lovato is embracing the electronic sound of some of her biggest pop hits on her next record, which is expected to drop later this year.


	“Over the past few years, Demi has found love, joy, and newfound confidence, making the choice to approach life with much more lightness and fun,” the source tells Rolling Stone, referring to her recent marriage to Jordan “Jutes” Lutes. “She took this sentiment into the studio, which can be felt in every track on this celebratory dance-pop album.”


	Lovato tapped Zhone — the music maker behind “Someone for Me” by Kylie Minogue, “Rush” by Troye Sivan, and “Joyride” by Kesha — to executive-produce the upcoming project.


	“It's been so inspiring working with Demi and experiencing her journey of continued leveling up,” Zhone tells Rolling Stone about their work together. “She is such a master in the studio. This album is about letting inhibitions go, and we had so much fun making this music! It really comes across throughout.”

	











	Fans have already started to get a taste of DL9 with teasers posted by Lovato of the album's lead single, “Fast.” The music is a significant step away from the rock-leaning energy of her two last projects, 2022's Holy Fvck and 2023's Revamped, which reimagined her pop hits as rock tracks.

	When she announced Revamped with Rolling Stone, she said she was considering a return to pop. “I was listening to a bunch of metal. And now, I'm trying to wrap my brain around more pop-sounding stuff, just in case my music wants to take that direction,” she said at the time.

	











	On the new project, she'll tap into the sound she's explored on some of her chart-topping EDM collaborations, such as 2018's “Solo” with Clean Bandit, 2017's “No Promises” with Cheat Codes, and “Instruction” from Tell Me You Love Me with Jax Jones. Her electropop goes back to 2013, when she included fan favorite “Neon Lights” on her self-titled record Demi.

	In between standing on business in paparazzi clashes and dodging endless rumors about his personal life, it turns out Justin Bieber was busy in the studio, making a genuinely interesting album. Swag is full of well-chosen collaborators —  Gunna, Sexyy Red, Cash Cobain, Lil B,  Dijon — confessional lyrics, and even surprisingly self-aware skits recorded with Druski. 







	In the new episode of our Rolling Stone Music Now podcast, we break down the last few years of Bieber's life and career, with Jeff Ihaza (who wrote a smart piece on Bieber's cultural savvy) and Brittany Spanos joining host Brian Hiatt.

	The discussion notes that Bieber stepped off the pop treadmill after the endless work of his younger years — Swag is only his third album of the past 10 years. It's also a welcome throwback to an era where male pop stars drew from R&B instead of, say, soft rock. The panel goes on to dig into Bieber's enduring influence — stars like Billie Eilish worship him, and he still carries weight as “a cool white boy,” as Ihaza puts it, in hip-hop and R&B.

As promised, Tyler, the Creator released his new album Don't Tap the Glass on Monday morning, just days after the rapper revealed his surprise follow-up to 2024's Chromakopia.


	The 10-track LP, out via Columbia Records, is the rapper's ninth album. It clocks in at 28 minutes and 30 seconds, with no special guests noted on the track list. Tyler, the Creator wrote on social media that the music is “MADE FOR BODY MOVEMENT. FULL VOLUME.” Listen here.

A post shared by Tyler, The Creator (@feliciathegoat)


	“I asked some friends why they don't dance in public and some said because of the fear of being filmed,” Tyler shared in a social media statement. “I thought damn, a natural form of expression and a certain connection they have with music is now a ghost. It made me wonder how much of our human spirit got killed because of the fear of being a meme, all for having a good time. I just got back from a ‘listening party' for this album and man was it one of the greatest nites of my life. 300 people. No phones allowed. no cameras, just speakers and a sweatbox. Everyone was dancing, moving, expressing, sweating.”

	











	He continued: “It was truly beautiful. I played the album front to back twice. It felt like that pent up energy finally got released and we craved the idea of letting more of it out there was a freedom that filled the room. a ball of energy that might not translate to every speaker that plays this album but man did that room nail it. This album was not made for sitting still, dancing, driving, running. Any type of movement is recommended to maybe understand the spirit of it. Only at full volume.”

	











	During his show in Brooklyn on July 18, Tyler shouted out the album title and outside his concert at Barclays Center there was a massive figure enclosed in a clear box that read “Don't Tap the Glass.” Tyler confirmed the album and its impending July 21 arrival (as well as a preorder page) on social media soon after.


	A few days prior, the rapper hinted that something would be heading to fans next week, with Tyler sharing images on Instagram of a Louis Vuitton bag, a mannequin's head, and a trumpet player in a band uniform all labeled with the date July 21. Last month, Doechii and Tyler previewed their new Pharrell-produced track “Get Right” during Louis Vuitton's fashion show in Paris. That collaboration does not appear on Don't Tap the Glass.

Don't Tap the Glass is Tyler's ninth album, following last year's Chromakopia, which arrived just nine months ago in October 2024. That album featured a hefty list of collaborators including Doechii, Childish Gambino, GloRilla, Lil Wayne, Lola Young, Santigold, Teezo Touchdown, Schoolboy Q, and Sexyy Red; prior to Don't Tap the Glass' arrival, a similarly all-star guest list was rumored, but Tyler shot down those rumors on social media this past weekend: “NONE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE ON THIS, I DID NOT POST THIS INFO I DONT KNOW WHERE YOU GOT THIS FROM TO CONFIRM IT.”

Ellen DeGeneres confirmed that she and her wife Portia de Rossi moved to the U.K. because of Donald Trump. During an event the Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham, England, on Sunday, DeGeneres told broadcaster Richard Bacon that Trump's election in November spurred their permanent relocation to the Cotswolds.


	“We got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, ‘He got in,'” DeGeneres recalled, according to the BBC. “And we're like, ‘We're staying here.'”


	She acknowledged that living in the countryside has been a positive change from the U.S. “It's absolutely beautiful,” the comedian said. “We're just not used to seeing this kind of beauty. The villages and the towns and the architecture – everything you see is charming and it's just a simpler way of life. It's clean. Everything here is just better—the way animals are treated, people are polite. I just love it here. We moved here in November, which was not the ideal time, but I saw snow for the first time in my life. We love it here. Portia flew her horses here, and I have chickens, and we had sheep for about two weeks.”

	











	DeGeneres expressed her concern about the state of LGBTQ+ rights in the U.S. and noted that she and de Rossi are considering getting remarried in the U.K. 


	“The Baptist Church in America is trying to reverse gay marriage,” she said. “They're trying to literally stop it from happening in the future and possibly reverse it. Portia and I are already looking into it, and if they do that, we're going to get married here.”

	











	She added, “I wish we were at a place where it was not scary for people to be who they are. I wish that we lived in a society where everybody could accept other people and their differences. So until we're there, I think there's a hard place to say we have huge progress.”


	Elsewhere during the conversation, DeGeneres reflected on her talk show Ellen coming to an end in 2022 after 19 seasons amid claims that she was fostering a toxic work environment. She previously addressed the controversy in her 2024 tour and her recent Netflix stand-up special, and echoed similar sentiments on Sunday.

	“No matter what, any article that came up, it was like, ‘She's mean', and it's like, how do I deal with this without sounding like a victim or ‘poor me' or complaining?” she said. “But I wanted to address it. It's as simple as, I'm a direct person, and I'm very blunt, and I guess sometimes that means that… I'm mean?… I don't think I can say anything that's ever going to get rid of that [reputation] or dispel it, which is hurtful to me. I hate it. I hate that people think that I'm that because I know who I am and I know that I'm an empathetic, compassionate person.”


	She added that it was “certainly an unpleasant way to end” her talk show. The comedian also acknowledged that she misses “a lot” about her show, but doesn't feel that a similar format would work at this point. 


	“I mean, I wish it did, because I would do the same thing here,” she said. “I would love to do that again, but I just feel like people are watching on their phones, or people aren't really paying attention as much to televisions, because we're so inundated with with information and entertainment.”

	With that in mind, she hasn't figured out her next move yet career-wise. “I want to have fun, I want to do something,” she said. “I do like my chickens but I'm a little bit bored.”


	DeGeneres isn't the only American comedian to leave the country in the wake of Trump's second election. Earlier this year, Rosie O'Donnell revealed that she relocated to Ireland shortly before Donald Trump took office for the second time. Trump responded by threatening to take away her U.S. citizenship.

Abbey Clancy claims she saw three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) while she was driving.

Abbey Clancy claimed she spotted three UFOs in the sky whilst she drove down the A3



The 39-year-old model says she saw ""rectangle lights"" zooming in the sky as she drove down the A3 - which connects London and Portsmouth.



Abbey told her husband, ex-footballer Peter Crouch, 44, on their The Therapy Crouch podcast: ""I have all these UFO people contacting me going, 'You did see it, it's not a figure of your imagination.'



""I just saw these three rectangle lights in the sky. It wasn't a sunny day, and it hadn't been raining.



""It couldn't have been some sort of reflection. Seconds later, they all darted off in a different direction.""


Abbey is not the only star to reveal UFO sightings, as actor Michael Sheen, 56, recently revealed he saw a ""phalanx of light"" when he was on his way home from school one day in his hometown of Port Talbot, Wales - which has attracted several alien sightings.


However, Michael did not tell anyone that he spotted a UFO until it disappeared, meaning people dismissed his claim.


The Good Omens actor said on the Scarred For Life podcast in March: ""When I was about 12, I was coming home from school. I used to go on the school bus and it would drop me off at the end of the road.


""And I would walk up my to my house and as I would turn up the drive to my house, to my right was the edge of the mountain and behind me was the town and going out to sea.


""And just as I turned I saw something come around the edge of the mountain off in the distance - a light coming round.


""So I sort of stopped and this light came out and then two lights behind it and then three lights behind it and then I saw a phalanx of light coming from behind the mountain and floating out over the sea.


""And as I'm standing there I'm thinking, 'I think those are UFOs, I'm fairly certain those are UFOs', and I thought I had to go into my house and tell my family there are UFOs out here, or lights, and they should come and have a look.


""And then I had to go into the house and go, 'Umm I think I've just seen...', and no one believed me obviously.""

The following is a syndicated interview with filmmaker John Shackleton, creator of the new YouTube series THE SUPERNATURAL UK. Shackleton talks about his fascination with the paranormal, balancing skepticism with belief, and gruelling all-night shoots. 

What inspired you to create The Supernatural UK, and how did the concept first come about?

As a filmmaker, I'm naturally drawn to the unknown. I've always had a love for horror and the supernatural – but it wasn't until a few years ago, when I found out my accountants moonlighted as paranormal investigators, that I really dipped my toe in! I tagged-along out of curiosity. No expectations, full sceptic mode.

The spark really happened when I was working on Château DIY for Channel 4. Some of the medieval château stories ignited my imagination. I made multiple trips to France across different series, but it was during one particular stay, alone in a gîte just after the pandemic, that things took a turn. One night something bit my finger – I jolted awake and saw my bedside table physically rocking. The next morning, my researcher (in the room opposite) told me she'd been woken by the sensation her bed was off the ground.

When I got back to the UK, I started filming investigations with different paranormal teams. That eventually led to a 50-minute TV pilot, ‘Somerset Supernatural'. At the time, I was also shooting ‘Dorset: Country and Coast' for Channel 5, and I liked how the format wove real people and real places into the fabric of a region. So, I took that approach – blending fly-on-the-wall documentary with local character and applied it to the paranormal.

I teamed up with my long-time collaborator and all round creative powerhouse Andy Bourne, who handles everything from cinematography and editing to VFX and post. We decided to make more episodes specifically for online. The result is ‘The Supernatural UK', a year-long passion project built on the back of that original pilot.

How do you define “supernatural” in the context of this series, and what makes the UK uniquely suited for these stories?

For me, the supernatural starts where science and logic stop. If it defies physics or falls outside the norm, then it is – by definition, para-normal. Like with UFOs – it doesn't mean little green men, just that it's unidentified.

The UK is especially rich ground for this kind of exploration. Its deep history, layered folklore, pagan traditions, religious shifts, give us an incredible scope. So in the context of the series, “supernatural” is a wide net. It covers the unexplained – spiritual, scientific, or otherwise. Everything's on the table.

Can you talk about the research process—how do you uncover or choose locations and cases?

Ironically, I try not to research too much. These are observational documentaries, and I want to arrive as open and fresh as possible. Whether or not I've read the history doesn't determine if something decides to make itself known on the night. In that sense often the less I know, the better.

That said, we do have researchers on standby. Karin Beasant, one of our producers, is incredibly thorough and often suggests locations or connects us with investigators. I go with my gut – it's proven to be a pretty reliable barometer.

Sometimes opportunities come out of other projects. While working on a show about Warwick Castle, I pitched access for The Supernatural UK' – remarkably they said yes, and that became episodes 9 and 10 of the series. I'm also drawn to specific phenomena like remote viewing, and when something intriguing lines up, I'll do everything I can to make it happen. That's the joy of working independently – no one's dictating the agenda. I can follow my instincts.

What challenges did you face—especially with the documentary-style format?

Plenty! For starters, the shoots can be gruelling. We pulled a lot of all-nighters, especially when things started to heat up. Crew availability could be tricky, too. In the opening episode, shot in Nottingham, I had to run everything solo – organisation, production, camera, sound, the lot. Luckily, my day job's prepared me for that, but it can create issues like dropped timecode, which then take longer to fix in post. I have to wear many caps, sometimes even the red hood, too!

The steepest learning curve for me was the edit. I don't usually edit my own work, but for this I had to learn how to sync multi-cam footage, manage audio files, and basically build the episodes from scratch. It was time-consuming, but rewarding. I'd often discover things I hadn't clocked on the night – like hidden story threads or electronic voice phenomena (EVPs) that only emerged during meticulous reviews. It's definitely sharpened my storytelling skills and revealed arcs that might've gone unnoticed otherwise.

Are there recurring themes or messages you hope viewers take away from the series?

Yes – mainly that science doesn't yet have all the answers. As Shakespeare put it: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. I think that quote sums it up perfectly. We need to keep enquiring. Keep our minds open. That's how we unlock whatever it is that's really going on out there.

How do you balance scepticism and belief in the series? Do you take a particular stance?

I'm not a fan of extremes—blind belief or staunch scepticism. I try to land somewhere in the middle. Think Mulder and Scully. In fact, we set that tone right from the first episode, with some healthy banter between our sceptic and  spiritualist investigators.

If something strange happens, I always try to debunk it first. But I've had moments where I know what I saw, I know what I heard, and no rational explanation holds water. That tension between belief and doubt is part of what makes the series so engaging and timeless, I think.



You're a well-regarded feature filmmaker. Did you bring any cinematic techniques to enhance the series?

Absolutely. I've spent years streamlining my process so I'm not waiting on anyone's permission to shoot. I own pro filming equipment, and Andy does too. Between us, we can load up the van and go. We also use GoPros, 360 cameras – anything to make sure we don't miss a beat. Weird stuff always seems to happen the moment the main camera's down, we soon learned!

We're both big fans of cinematic title sequences. Andy works in Unreal Engine and creates visuals that really punch up the intros. Music's crucial, too. We worked with Paul Saunderson on the theme and Jacob Maloney on the score. They've helped give the series a much more elevated feel. But above all, it's about story. And often, that story only really reveals itself in the edit.

Were there any moments during filming that genuinely surprised you or changed your perspective?

So many. One night I brought a trained security dog to what's considered the most haunted prison in the UK – just for insurance! Not only did the dog react to multiple unseen presences, but we started getting what felt like intelligent responses from assumed inmates. Lights triggered on command. Motion sensors responded to verbal prompts. Suddenly, “coincidence” didn't seem the most logical explanation anymore.

I keep the setup lean and spontaneous – often confirming investigators just days before, so I know nothing's being staged. Everything you see is real. That includes a poltergeist experience that even our biggest sceptic deemed 94% likely, and a museum investigation that escalated from the movement of a simple doll in a cabinet, to full-blown activity – footsteps, voices, EVP, and vibration sensor activation.

There have just been too many “coincidences” to ignore.

Do you think the rising interest in the paranormal reflects something deeper about society today?

Yes, I do. With everything going on in the world—the climate crisis, wars, political instability – it feels like we're collectively looking for meaning and reassurance. The doomsday clock is at 89 seconds to midnight. It's no wonder people are asking bigger questions about what happens when we die.

Finally, do you believe in ghosts?

Literal ghosts? No, they still don't make sense to me – and I felt that way before I started. But when I find EVP recordings of disembodied voices replying to questions… when radio signals give us information the team couldn't have known… when I hear footsteps in an empty building, or a voice that everyone on the team hears… it's hard to dismiss.

So do I believe something is out there? Yes. Without a doubt.

María Inés Plaza Lazo: The title “As Above, So Below” is ancient and esoteric, yet uncannily contemporary. Helena Blavatsky reintroduced this phrase to 19th-century mysticism; you refract it through club culture and Christian iconography. In your hands, it resonates less as metaphysical truth than as method: flattening hierarchies, collapsing the sacred and mundane, the visible and the invisible, pop music and highway lights. What's the cosmology at work here?

Mark Leckey: What you're pointing to is how I'm trying to approach things from two directions: from being completely embedded in pop culture—that's my background—but also from a place of growing interest, maybe even awakening, to spiritualism and medieval metaphysics. That's really where this show comes from. Like you said, it's a line between stations of the visible and invisible, and that's exactly what I'm dwelling in right now.

There's a contradiction, though—or maybe a dialectic—that I can't resolve. A kind of spiritual or metaphysical pull, grounded in a historical materialist base: where I come from, how I grew up, the conditions and influences that shaped me politically and otherwise. I'm trying to work through that contradiction. The visible and the invisible. I really like that formulation.And the body—the human body—is the connective tissue between those two realms.

As for “As Above, So Below,” it's not just about theosophy. That phrase is everywhere now; it's basically a pop-cultural term. But my interest in it goes back further—to the alchemists, to Hermes Trismegistus. There's a whole cosmology there, a belief in the interconnectedness of everything in the universe. I suppose what I'm trying to do is to resolve spiritual and material concerns that exist simultaneously in me.

MIPL: If the body is the connective tissue between the visible and the invisible, how do you shape the spaces where memory, affect, and magic can actually take hold?

ML: I think it really started to come together at Haus der Kunst, though I wasn't fully aware of it at the time. When you're using so much moving image and sound, you can't just drop it into a black box—it never felt alive in that context. I realized I had to transform the space itself, make it part of the work, so that what you're seeing and hearing could really land, really hold your attention. That's when I started thinking more environmentally—not to seduce the viewer exactly, but to pull them into something more like a dream. I hesitate to say “immersive” because it's become a buzzword, but I wanted to create something closer to a psychedelic experience.

Affect, memory, magic—they're not content, they're modes of perception. You're taken out of yourself. In a successful psychedelic experience, you're lifted out of reason, out of rational circumstances, and placed into something more like a dream. And a dream carries the potential for magic. Once you leave the bounds of the known, you're already in the realm of the magical. I'm trying to create something closer to the condition of music than to cinema or traditional art exhibitions. Music makes space for the supernatural—for the paranormal. Whereas art often prescribes those things, or is suspicious of them.

I came across something after making the show that really stuck with me. I can't remember where I read it, but it said, “all pop culture is paranormal.” That struck a chord.

MIPL: In your video work Carry Me into the Wilderness (2022), we hear your voice collapse under the weight of sensation—sunlight, sound, space. But you're not on a pilgrimage. You're in Alexandra Park, in a northern suburb of London. Yet the experience was not only paranormal, it became sacramental. Were you documenting the sublime, or did this just happen to you?

ML: I had a sublime experience—and in the moment of that experience, I tried to record it. I thought I was capturing it as an artist: “This thing is happening to me; I need to document it so I can make use of it.” But when I actually started working with the material, I realized I wasn't acting as an artist so much as being contemporary. Just responding in the way we all do now: transforming every experience into information.

So yes, even in this very profound moment, I was still trying to extract value from it. There's a suspicion baked into that. Even suspicion about whether I actually had a spiritual experience.I come from a grounded, materialist background—and yet here I am, having these unexpected sacramental or sacred moments. I don't really know how to reconcile those two realities.So I tried to make the work feel both: exalted and skeptical.

MIPL: Was that feeling of being absolutely contemporary—almost as ecstasy—a refusal of productivity?

ML: I think I confused the artistic impulse with contemporary production. I had my phone in my pocket, thinking of it as an artistic tool—but really, it's an extraction device. The best example of this is how people behave at concerts. Holding up their phones constantly, recording. It's not really about the experience itself, but about the information the experience can generate. We're always translating or producing things for circulation and distribution. And artists aren't exempt from that. We're not standing above it.

But ecstasy itself—well, a lot of these realizations come after the work is made. I usually follow a hunch or impulse, and then reflect or read afterwards. I read about the etymology of “ecstasy”: it means to be taken outside of the place where you stand. It's about being pulled out of what you know—your surroundings, even yourself. It's both an exalted moment and a moment of horror, of fear. The world we live in now—yes, there's doomscrolling and all of that—but it's also a kind of ecstasy. A constant state of being pulled out of where you are. It's thrilling and exciting, but also terrifying and alienating.

MIPL: Doomscrolling can be both: Absolute saturation—your brain literally overwhelmed. People talk about brain rot as a side effect. You also seem to reach for a kind of temporal intensity—the moment where the world arrives all at once. Could we call this a politics of the moment? A refusal of progress in favor of the saturated now?

ML: I'm saturated. I can't deal with it.

MIPL: All of us are.

ML: I just look at the difference in how I worked in 1999, when I made Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore. I was dealing with a limited archive, with limited access. Now—only 25 years later—what's available is oceanic. It's transformed everything. We literally can't work without the internet anymore. I probably would have kept making archival collage work, but that method was voided by the sheer availability of imagery and sound we have now.

MIPL: Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore now feels like a secular icon—an object of reverence, even grief. You once called it a ghost. Has nostalgia become one of your materials?

ML: I mean, that's part of why I turned to medieval metaphysics—because it becomes so unknowable. I needed to find some kind of analogy between the understanding of God and the understanding of life under capitalism. I don't mean that in a spiritual sense necessarily, but in terms of trying to fathom the unfathomable. The tools I'd been given just didn't seem to work anymore. Something shifted so suddenly. The conditions changed in a way that felt abrupt. To go from Fiorucci at the turn of the century to where we are now—it just feels completely disorienting. I became interested in the idea of negative theology—the notion that God is fundamentally unknowable, un-circumscribable. You can't picture him, can't really know him in any definitive way. He exists beyond all human knowledge and sense. So, the only way to approach God is obliquely, through a kind of negative path.

MIPL: You've said before how images now function less as documents, more as performances or hallucinations. Is video the ideal form because it embraces that instability?

ML: Video is not a true medium in any traditional sense. It lends itself to circulation and transformation. It's very mutable. It's kind of the opposite of something like painting or sculpture. I change it constantly. Every time I do a show, the video changes—I adapt the work. But I do worry: is this still the right kind of medium? There's so much video now. And if all you consume is video, can you even see it anymore?

One of the most upsetting things I heard recently was an interview with a 16-year-old who said, “I don't listen to music anymore. I'm just bored of it.” I thought, “yeah, of course.” It's just there, all the time. Like water. But I don't think that means we should retreat to older forms like painting and sculpture—that feels reactionary. I'm not interested in that. And that's the point where I sometimes think: maybe I shouldn't make art at all. That's where that line of thinking goes.

MIPL: I'd like to ask about the masculine lineage in the figures you invoke: the hermit in the cave, the raver in the dark, the father with a phone during lockdown. But there's also instability, surrender, even genderlessness in these states of ecstasy. Is your work a way of making masculinity porous, mystical, overwhelmed?

ML: I sometimes look at the work and think: there's a lot of masculine energy there. There's a kind of violence that creeps in. But also… it might entirely be the wrong thing to say, but I think that art is queer. It queers you. And the more I make art, the queerer I get in how I understand the world. It changes the way I approach things. And I've allowed that to happen. The artists I admired were all gay. They influenced me. I never resisted it. That's what I'd hope the work does. I think my work is about being a man. A lot of it is about trying to understand what it means to be a man now. But I hope that men are changing. That they're transmuting. I want to be transmuted.

MIPL: That is a wonderful, utopian thought.

ML: I think it ties into what you said earlier about mysticism and transcendentalism. The promise of the digital is fluidity—it dissolves boundaries. That's its nature.

MIPL: But what's interesting is that you create glitches while embracing that fluidity. You constantly interrupt it.

ML: I'm trying to glitch myself. I do have a strong streak of romanticism, and I think I try to put obstacles in the way of that. I'm not repelled by my romanticism, but I see its dangers. Its ineffectiveness, maybe. So, if there are glitches, it's to get in the way of that. Because if I didn't, I'd just succumb.

MIPL: You seem to share this drive to glitch with other artists who metabolize the world in hybrid, polyphonic ways—such as, Christelle Oyiri or Arthur Jafa. Could you speak to the conversations or resonances you've had with them?

ML: The main resonance is music. I want art to expand toward music, or the space of music, because that's where I feel more at home. That's what I grew up with. To come into the art world—if you're from a background like mine—is to find yourself in a completely different world. You have to acclimatize, adjust, change yourself. But now it feels like art is more porous. It's more fluid. Its boundaries are less secure.

Music allows for that. It's not just democratic—it's graspable. Anyone can engage with it. I reached out to Christelle because I like what she does musically. I want to be in the same space she's in. I want more people like her around. My interest in art and music—this might be a very 20th-century idea—but I believe in form. I believe in formal experimentation.

MIPL: Like in Nobodaddy (2018), where you literally give voice to absence through technology. A bronze figure with holes in the entire body is inhabited by sound; a speaker-body that speaks absence and dematerialization, transcending the physical.

ML: Immanence, I think, is the word. Not transcendence—but immanence. Yes. I want to evoke and amplify being alive. It's as simple as that. Christelle makes me feel more alive. AJ makes me feel more alive. All these things—they amplify that feeling of presence. Of being here. Imminently here.

MIPL: What does “authenticity” mean to you today—especially when your own biography becomes raw material?

ML: I think I'm still drawn to authenticity—but I'm not quite sure how to put that into words. There's always a danger in trying to be “authentically working class,” and maybe even more so in trying to make “authentically working-class art.” I don't think either of those things necessarily serve the working class in any real or meaningful way. So, I'm very suspicious of authenticity when it comes to class. At the same time, someone's background does matter to me. I still feel a bit disappointed when I find out that someone I admired went to public school and had all the privileges that come with that.

I suppose I do still have a nose for some kind of authenticity—or maybe for a kind of groundedness, or reality. But I also know it's a trap. I think authenticity is something of a dance. You have to move in and out of it.

Mark Leckey's exhibition “Enter Thru Medieval Wounds"" will be on view from 11 September 2025 to 03 May 2026 at the Julia Stoschek Foundation in Berlin. Saturday & Sunday, 12PM to 6PM.

Just imagine it, the news stories are all over your phone when you wake! The day will surely come that we will discover that we are not alone in the Universe! What happens the day after though? A new research paper from the SETI Post Detection Hub at the University of St Andrews tackles this question, outlining how NASA and the global scientific community should prepare for the moment humanity detects signs of extraterrestrial intelligence.

The paper, written by 14 researchers representing institutions from York University to the University of Cambridge, emphasises that ""a technosignature detection will trigger a complex global process shaped by uncertainty, misinformation, and multiple ideological stakeholders."" Unlike searching for simple microbial life, discovering technological signatures from alien civilizations would fundamentally reshape our understanding of our place in the universe and create unprecedented challenges.

The researchers led by Kate Genevieve from the Astro Ecologies Institution argue that past preparation efforts, including guidelines from 1989, are woefully outdated for our internet age. Early protocols predate the internet and could not account for the complexity of rapid global media dissemination. In an era of viral misinformation and instant global communication, the discovery of alien technology would likely create a media firestorm unlike anything humanity has experienced.

The team proposes six critical areas where NASA should invest now, before any discovery occurs. These range from advancing detection technologies to studying how different cultures might interpret the news of extraterrestrial discovery.

One fascinating aspect of the research involves developing ""Other Minds"" paradigms, essentially preparing to recognise intelligence that doesn't think like us. The paper suggests that techniques from bioacoustics, machine learning and quantum computing offer significant insights, including studying whale songs and bird navigation to understand non human communication patterns.

 Researchers suggest that studying whale song can help understand non-human forms of communication such as those that may be experienced from alien intelligence!

This approach challenges researchers to move beyond Earth centric assumptions. If aliens communicate through methods we've never imagined, perhaps using quantum entanglement or patterns we haven't recognised, then our current detection methods might miss them entirely.

Surprisingly, much of the preparation work focuses not on alien technology but on human psychology and interaction. The researchers emphasise integrating humanities and social sciences, recognising that the biggest challenges might come from how people react to the news rather than from the aliens themselves.

The paper recommends funding research on the psychological, social, and global dynamics of post detection scenarios and even suggests analyzing science fiction stories to understand how different cultures envision first contact. These fictional scenarios, the researchers argue, provide valuable insights into human expectations and fears.

Perhaps most practically, the team calls for creating robust international coordination systems before they're needed. They warn that without a Post Detection SETI Hub, NASA risks a gap in the system, akin to a Moon landing without astronaut retrieval. Just as NASA developed detailed protocols for Apollo missions, including quarantine procedures, the space agency needs comprehensive plans for managing a SETI discovery.

The researchers don't claim that discovering extraterrestrial intelligence is imminent however, but they argue that preparation now is essential. With advanced telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope already operational and instruments like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory coming online, a technosignature discovery could emerge in any realm of astronomy research.

Their message is clear: the question isn't whether we'll ever detect signs of alien technology, but whether we'll be ready when we do. By investing in research, international cooperation, and communication strategies now, NASA can help ensure that humanity's greatest discovery becomes a moment of unity and wonder rather than chaos and confusion.

If aliens are out there, then our radar systems are putting on quite an electromagnetic show for them.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Professional outfits like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute scan the skies with radio telescopes for any sign of extraterrestrial life. They're especially tuned in to potential presence of technosignatures—electromagnetic radiation emitted by an advanced society's technology. While that effort has produced some exciting close calls, humanity most likely has yet to find any sign of alien life. 

Of course, there's another way to look at this problem. If an alien civilization in our galactic neighbor also had their own SETI-esque programs—similarly probing the skies in search for an answer to that ever-elusive “Are we alone?” question—could they hear us? 

Well, as it turns out, the answer is an emphatic “yes”—not, however, because we're purposefully shooting some kind of high-powered radio beam into the cosmos that's acting like a galactic flare gun. No, aliens could hear us just from our everyday airport and military radar systems.

In a new study—the preliminary results of which were revealed at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting 2025 in Durham, U.K.—lead researcher Ramiro Caisse Saide from the University of Manchester concluded that an alien civilization within 200 light-years of Earth could likely spot our planet's radar signals using an advanced radio telescope similar to the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. The study concluded that worldwide airport radar alone outputs a radio signal of roughly 2×10¹⁵ watts, while military radar outputs distinctive directional radio beams up to 1×10¹⁴ watts. 

At first, 200 light-years may not seem like a lot—after all, the Milky Way stretches some 100,000 light-years across. But even a distance this short (at cosmic scales, at least) includes some 120,000 stars, which very likely host plenty of candidates capable of sustaining life. 

“This would look clearly artificial to anyone watching from interstellar distances with powerful radio telescopes,” Caisse Saide said in a press statement. “In fact, these military signals can appear up to a hundred times stronger from certain points in space, depending on where an observer is located.”

The authors looked at this “hidden electromagnetic leakage” from the perspective of six stellar systems: Barnard star (6 light-years away), HD 48948 (55 light-years away), HD 40307 (42 light-years away), HD 216520 (64 light-years away), LHS 475 (40 light-years away), and AU Microscopii (32 light-years away). 

To help others understand what the ‘leakage' might look like, the researchers published a video showing the mean distribution of Earth's Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) over a 24-hour period as it would appear on AU Microscopii. A distinct pattern emerges based on the distribution of radio equipment across the planet. So, if some alien civilization took a keen interest in a particular rocky planet located in the Origin-Cygnus arm of the galaxy, this clearly artificial EIRP signature might just raise an eyebrow (or whatever aliens would do to show confusion). 

“Our findings suggest that radar signals—produced unintentionally by any planet with advanced technology and complex aviation system—could act as a universal sign of intelligent life,” Caisse Saide said in a press statement. “In this way, our work supports both the scientific quest to answer the question ‘Are we alone?' and practical efforts to manage the influence of technology on our world and beyond.”

Running for 15 seasons, Supernatural was one of the most successful fantasy/horror series in television history. Fans have hoped the show might see a revival on HBO Max, as a new series or feature-length film. However, while Sam and Dean Winchester are once again hitting the road to fight evil, it is in an entirely different medium.

Warner Bros. Discovery and Dynamite Entertainment are partnering on a new Supernatural comic book. While this is not the first time Sam and Dean have appeared in a comic, their last miniseries was released in 2011. The new comic, which premieres in October, will be set between seasons 1 and 2 of the show.

Acclaimed author Greg Pak will write the new Supernatural comic. A veteran comic writer, Pak is perhaps most famous for his work on Marvel's Darth Vader comic series. He is joined by artist Eder Messias, with whom Pak collaborated on the Captain America comic.

 “Fans of Supernatural know the show is a blast, and it's an enormous pleasure and privilege to be able to dig into this wild world, especially with Eder Messias,” Pak shared. “We're going for fun and grounded, and then we're going to absolutely cut loose when the time comes. I can't wait to show more, and thanks so much to everyone for coming along for the ride!”

Messias, who describes Supernatural as “by far my favorite television series,” is equally enthusiastic about the new comic. “Here in Brazil, on Saturday nights, they would show four episodes in a row.” Messias shared. “After that, we would spend the week talking to friends about the next episodes. I'm looking forward to bringing this story to fans and giving it my best!”

Four covers for the first issue of Supernatural may be viewed below. In addition to a photo cover, there are covers by Eder Messias, Clayton Crain, and David Cousens.

Matt Morrison has been writing about comics and superheroes for nearly two decades. His work can also be seen at KabOOOOOm.com and No Flying, No Tights. When he is not reading comics and writing, he enjoys role-playing, cosplay and photography.

Dynamite Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products are teaming up for a Supernatural comic series, featuring new stories that are set between the first and second seasons of the long-running show. Writer Greg Pak and artist Eder Messias, who previously worked together on Sam Wilson: Captain America, will be the creative team for the new comics. In the first arc, the Winchester brothers, who hunt ghosts, demons, and other supernatural creatures, will search for the source of a series of mysterious fires in a decaying Rust Belt town. The series will launch in October and the first issue will have covers by Messias, Clayton Crain, and David Cousens, as well as photo covers from the show.

“A couple of dudes in a cool car chasing monsters, demons, and ghosts? Tongue-in-cheek, but deeply-felt emotional story of sibling rivalry and family tragedy? Hugely fun, anti-authoritarian heroes and vibes? Look, I was hooked with the ghosts, but I'm all in,” Pak said in a statement accompanying the announcement. “We're going for fun and grounded, and then we're going to absolutely cut loose when the time comes.”Supernatural debuted in 2005 and ran for 15 seasons, the first on The WB and the rest on The CW, making it the longest running scripted fantasy series on TV. “Here in Brazil, on Saturday nights, they would show four episodes in a row,” Messias said. “After that, we would spend the week talking to friends about the next episodes.”

DC's WildStorm published several miniseries based on the show, and it was adapted into an RPG early in its run (see “‘Supernatural RPG'”); more recently, CMON added two Supernatural packs to its Zombicide 2E game (see “The Winchesters Hunt Undead in ‘Zombicide 2E'”).

Fresno Nightcrawler: Walking Into the Unknown | Unexplained Cryptid Sightings

Step into the unexplained on Cold Logic as host Silas Gray delves into one of the most baffling anomalies ever caught on camera: The Fresno Nightcrawler. In 2007, a home security system captured two white, spindly, unidentifiable entities gliding across a suburban lawn, defying all known physics and conventional explanation.

This episode meticulously analyzes the original 2007 footage, dissecting visual analysis from Hollywood experts and video engineers that proved the video was not a hoax. Learn how AI gait reconstruction further deepened the mystery, revealing a non-human motion cadence that doesn't conform to any known biological movement.

Beyond attempts at debunking, Cold Logic explores chilling cryptid theories and the unsettling Yosemite Nightcrawler sighting from 2011, which eerily mirrored the original event. We explore potential connections to Native American folklore, where legends of ""forest watchers"" with long legs have existed for centuries.

But the enigma deepens as we dive into government conspiracy theories: Could these be experimental recon drones from a DARPA project? Are they interdimensional visitors bleeding into our reality? Or is the persistent unexplained nature of the Fresno Nightcrawler footage part of a controlled disinformation operation? Discover the unsettling local police response and missing records that add layers to the cover-up narrative.

""The Fresno Nightcrawler: Walking Into the Unknown"" challenges you to question what you think you know about reality. Tune in to Cold Logic to explore a mystery that has never been proven fake, never been replicated, and remains utterly unexplained.

HAPPY VALLEY, Calif. - A decade after her daughter's mysterious disappearance, a Shasta County mother continues to seek answers. The baby, Ember Graham, vanished from her crib under puzzling circumstances.

Ember was just six months old when she went missing in July 2015. Her father, Matthew Graham, was considered a person of interest in her disappearance but was killed in a shootout with police a few weeks later. Before his death, Matthew told his wife, Jamie Graham, that someone had broken into their home and kidnapped Ember.

""Every chance I got I grilled him every conversation I grilled him. I grilled him when I visited him in jail and I grilled him when he was out of jail. He just kept saying I don't know. I don't remember his story kept changing and I knew he's not telling the truth about something,"" Jamie Graham said.

When asked if she believes someone else might have information, Graham expressed hope that the truth will eventually come out.

""I do and that's why I am so persistent. I do believe he spent a lot of time with his family and his friends, and I feel like he absolutely would have broke down and told somebody what happened if not multiple people,"" Graham said.

Ember, who would be 10 years old now, has brown hair and brown eyes and suffers from a seizure disorder. There is a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect.

Anyone with information is urged to contact the Shasta County Sheriff's Office at (530) 245-6025 or Secret Witness of Shasta County at (530) 243-2319.

Ruling in university's favor would reverse funding freezes that became cuts as Trump administration escalated fight

US politics live – latest updates

Harvard University appeared in federal court on Monday to make the case that the Trump administration illegally cut $2.6bn from the storied college – a major test of the administration's efforts to reshape higher education institutions by threatening their financial viability.

US district judge Allison Burroughs heard arguments from Harvard and the Department of Justice. The cuts, imposed earlier this year, have halted major research efforts and Harvard argues they are a politically motivated attempt to pressure the school into adopting federal policies on student conduct, admissions, antisemitism and diversity.

A ruling in favor of the university would revive Harvard's sprawling scientific and medical research operation and hundreds of projects that lost federal money.

“This case involves the government's efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard,” the university said in its complaint. “All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: allow the government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution's ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions.”

Monday's hearing will be closely watched by other universities that have seen their research funds axed by the administration, which has suspended or threatened billions in grants and contracts from several institutions. The White House is reportedly close to finalizing a deal with Columbia University – the first institution it targeted for cuts – to restore $400 mn in funding in exchange for the university implementing a series of measures meeting the administration's ideological demands.

Harvard is the first – and so far only – university to sue.

The university has separately sued the administration over its revocation of Harvard's eligibility to host international students. (Trump has also threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, but he has taken no action to that effect so far.)

Burroughs is overseeing both of Harvard's cases against the administration and in June issued an injunction stopping the government from barring foreign Harvard students from entering the country.

Monday's hearing will be the first time the court will hear arguments about the legality of the administration's funding cuts. It is unlikely the judge will issue a decision immediately, and any ruling will probably be appealed.

Harvard's lawsuit accuses Donald Trump's administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university after it rejected a series of demands in an 11 April letter from a federal antisemitism taskforce.

The letter demanded sweeping changes related to campus protests, academics and admissions. For example, the letter told Harvard to audit the viewpoints of students and faculty and admit more students or hire new professors if the campus was found to lack diverse points of view. The letter was meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment on campus.

Alan Garber, Harvard's president, pledged to fight antisemitism but said no government “should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue”.

The same day Harvard rejected the demands, Trump officials moved to freeze $2.2bn in research grants. Linda McMahon, the US education secretary, declared in May that Harvard would no longer be eligible for new grants, and weeks later the administration began canceling contracts with Harvard.

As Harvard fought the funding freeze in court, individual agencies began sending letters announcing that the frozen research grants were being terminated. They cited a clause that allows grants to be scrapped if they no longer align with government policies.

after newsletter promotion

Harvard, which has the nation's largest endowment at $53bn, has moved to self-fund some of its research, but warned it can't absorb the full cost of the federal cuts.

In court filings, the school said the government “fails to explain how the termination of funding for research to treat cancer, support veterans, and improve national security addresses antisemitism”.

The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the April demand letter was sent. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel contracts for policy reasons.

“It is the policy of the United States under the Trump administration not to fund institutions that fail to adequately address antisemitism in their programs,” it said in court documents.

Finally, last month, the Trump administration formally issued a finding that the school tolerated antisemitism – a step that eventually could jeopardize all of Harvard's federal funding, including federal student loans or grants. The penalty is typically referred to as a “death sentence”.

While Harvard's cases against the administration proceeds in court, the university is reportedly also negotiating with the administration for a deal that might end the dispute outs of court.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The US House of Representatives on Friday passed an amendment banning the US Department of Defense from creating, buying or displaying any map that shows Taiwan as part of the People's Republic of China (PRC).

The “Honest Maps” amendment was approved in a voice vote on Friday as part of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for the 2026 fiscal year.

The amendment prohibits using any funds from the act to create, buy or display maps that show Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, Penghu, Wuciou (烏坵), Green Island (綠島) or Orchid Island (Lanyu, 蘭嶼) as part of the PRC.

The act includes US$831.5 billion in discretionary spending.

Before the vote, US Representative Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin, who proposed the amendment, urged support from his colleagues. 

He said that the House had approved a similar measure in the previous Congress as part of the State Department Appropriations bill and that this new amendment aims to extend the policy to the defense department.

Tiffany said the amendment was not controversial, as lawmakers in the House recognize that “Taiwan is not — nor has it ever been — part of Communist China, even for a single day.”

The US lawmaker said Taiwanese choose their leaders, maintain their armed forces, conduct their foreign policy and manage their trade agreements with other nations.

“By every measure, Taiwan is a sovereign, democratic and independent nation — and any claims to the contrary are simply false,” Tiffany said.

Since the 1970s, Washington's so-called “one China” policy has acknowledged Beijing's unsubstantiated claims over Taiwan, Tiffany added.

He called it “an antiquated and dishonest policy — one that we should abandon.”

Although Tiffany said the “Honest Maps” amendment would not end the misguided “one China” policy, he emphasized that it would ensure US maps reflect the reality that “China is China, and Taiwan is Taiwan.”

The Department of Defense Appropriations Act also included US$500 million in aid for the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative (TSCI).

In a statement dated Tuesday last week, the US Office of Management and Budget under the Executive Office of the President said it appreciated the House Appropriations Committee's inclusion of US$500 million for the initiative.

The US$500 million is crucial to the defense department's efforts to enhance Taiwan's self-defense capabilities, the office said.

“The administration strongly urges full consideration of the fiscal 2026 budget request of US$1 billion for TSCI, as Taiwan's ability to credibly defend itself is vital for deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and important for safeguarding United States personnel in the event of a contingency,” the office said.

The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party told the Central News Agency that the House discussed the TSCI after hearing testimony from retired US Navy rear admiral Mark Montgomery in May titled “Deterrence Amid Rising Tensions: Preventing CCP Aggression on Taiwan.”

In his testimony, Montgomery urged the Congress to increase financial aid to Taiwan to strengthen its defense, adding that Taiwan is too small to face China alone since Beijing's GDP is 23 times larger than Taipei's.

Montgomery said defense aid to Taiwan can be increased through Foreign Military Financing, Presidential Drawdown Authorities and the TSCI, which allow the US to provide equipment to Taiwan.

Montgomery recommended US$300 million for the first year of the TSCI and urged Congress to approve US$1 billion for next year and beyond.

A key use for this money would be training Taiwan's troops, including captain's courses and battalion-level training at US bases in Hawaii and the west coast, Montgomery said.

Russia has showcased what it has described as the ""largest and most secret"" drone factory in the world, in a propaganda video showing teenagers assembling the Geran-2 drones used to target Ukraine.

The facility at the Alabuga industrial park near Kazan in the Tatarstan region is one of Russia's main production hubs, allowing it to produce a reported 5,200 Shahed-type strike drones and decoy models a month as of May.

""This is the largest such plant in the world and the most secret,"" Timur Shagivaliev, CEO of the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, told Zvezda, the Russian Defense Ministry's television channel.

""At one time, the plan was to produce several thousand (Geran drones) — now we are producing nine times more than planned.""

Russian state media released footage showing teenagers assembling drones inside the facility, highlighting a recruitment program targeting students as young as 15 from local technical colleges.

""Everywhere you look, there's young people working here,"" a voice-over in the Zvezda video says, as dozens of teenagers are seen making drone components and working at computer stations on a brightly lit factory floor.

The Yelabuga plant was previously targeted by Ukrainian drones multiple times. The latest attack allegedly happened on June 15.

The Yelabuga plant, launched in 2023, is equipped with metal foundries, blacksmith shops, and in-house assembly lines, according to Zvezda footage. It reportedly uses parts shipped from Iran via the Caspian Sea and Kama River. A Russian military think tank claimed drone output jumped 16.9% in May.

The Geran-2 drone, with a 3.5-meter length and 50-kg warhead, has a range of 1,800 kilometers and can reach speeds of 300 km/h. Each unit is estimated to cost as little as $35,000–$49,000 — a fraction of the multimillion-dollar cost of Western air defense interceptors like the U.S.-made Patriot missile.

Reports from multiple sources, including Interpol, allege the Alabuga Special Economic Zone has also recruited African women under false pretenses through a work-study scheme. An investigation into potential human trafficking was opened in April, following testimony and reports from affected individuals.

The Geran-2, Russia's version of Iran's Shahed-136, has become crucial part of nightly attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Russia launched over 5,300 Shahed drones in June alone. Ukraine suffered the largest single-day drone and missile strike on July 9, with 741 aerial weapons launched.

Germany's Maj. Gen. Christian Freuding, head of Ukraine policy at the German Defense Ministry, warned on July 19 that Russia aims to eventually launch 2,000 drones a night. In a Bundeswehr podcast, Freuding said Ukraine could counter such barrages only by striking drone production sites and lowering interception costs.

Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service reported in June that Russia plans to manufacture 30,000 long-range drones and 2 million FPV (first-person-view) drones in 2025, signaling a massive expansion of drone warfare.

Ukraine has also increased its domestic drone production in response. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv has the capacity to produce up to 8 million drones annually, though it lacks the foreign funding to scale fully. 

Former Defense Minister Rustem Umerov had earlier estimated a 4 million drone yearly capacity.

The previous round of talks took place on June 2 in Istanbul, following a May 16 meeting after a years-long freeze.

According to the U.K. government, the tankers have secretly transported $24 billion worth of oil since the start of 2024.

""I urge our European allies, who have talked a big game, to follow us if we implement these secondary tariffs,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.

Trump's ultimatum to Russia, Ukraine's largest government reshuffle, and allegations launched against prominent anti-corruption activist that many claim are politically motivated.

Ukraine needs $6 billion to bridge its weapons production shortfall in 2025, Defense Minister Denis Shmyhal told allies during a virtual Ramstein meeting on July 21, according to Radio Svoboda (Ukrainian service of RFE/RL).

""It is clear to all that truly effective talks can only take place at the level of national leaders,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Speaking during the 29th Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said he reached the agreement with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a recent trip to Washington.

""It is a great honor and at the same time an extraordinary responsibility for me to lead the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a difficult time for our country,"" Hennadii Shapovalov said in a statement.

""In the morning, after briefings from military and interior officials, I met with the foreign minister and our (Presidential) Office team. We finalized the long process of selecting ambassadorial candidates,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram. 

The body of 61-year-old Ihor Hrushevskyi, a former senior officer in Ukraine's Department for Combating Organized Crime, was discovered floating face down in the swimming pool of the Cala Alta residential complex in Villajoyosa.

""This is the largest such plant in the world and the most secret,"" Timur Shagivaliev, CEO of the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, said. 

At least one person was killed and eight were injured as repeated explosions rocked Kyiv, and several fires broke out across Ukraine's capital during a mass Russian drone and missile attack overnight on July 21.

The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia launched 450 aerial threats overnight, including 426 Shahed drones and various types of missiles, including Kinzhal, Kalibr, and Kh-101. 

Amid reported Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia, a fire broke out at a train station in the village of Kamenolomni in Rostov Oblast overnight July 21 as Moscow faced drones for the fifth straight night, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

One of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers twice urged the FBI to look at Donald Trump following an alleged incident with him.

In 1996, Maria Farmer, told police she was groped by Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Ms Farmer, who worked for Epstein as an art advisor, was one of the first people to accuse the paedophile financier of sexual misconduct.

When reporting the incident she raised concerns about the high-profile individuals surrounding Epstein, including Mr Trump and Bill Clinton, she told the New York Times.

Ms Farmer told the newspaper she had been troubled by a 1995 incident with the then-Apprentice star, in which she met Mr Trump for the first time after being summoned to Epstein's Manhattan offices late one evening.

She claimed the impromptu meeting took place just before she began working for Epstein. Ms Farmer said she arrived in running shorts and that Mr Trump hovered over her and stared at her legs, making her feel scared.

She said Epstein then entered the room and said: “No, no. She's not here for you,” before the pair left together. Ms Farmer claimed she then heard Mr Trump say he thought she was 16 years old.

Ms Farmer said she did not experience any other incidents with Mr Trump and did not see him engage in inappropriate behaviour with women or girls.

In 2006, Ms Farmer claimed she again told the FBI to examine Mr Trump's links to the late financier.

At the time, she was interviewed as part of the investigation into claims Epstein had sex with a minor.

Epstein was eventually charged with one count of soliciting prostitution and and one count of soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. He pleaded guilty and served 13 months in a low-security prison.

The White House branded the story about Mr Trump, which Ms Farmer first made public in 2019, as “recycled, old fake news of the highest order”.

“This is recycled, old fake news of the highest order that was already peddled for more than six years, concocted by Democrats and the liberal media just like they did with the Russiagate scandal, which was just proven today.

“The president was never in his office. The fact is that the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep,” director of communications Stephen Cheung told the Telegraph.

Mr Trump is facing the biggest crisis of his presidency over his administration's failure to release all information related to Epstein's case.

The FBI and the Department of Justice sparked dismay among the president's Maga base earlier this month after concluding that the sex offender did not have a “client list” and took his own life in a Manhattan prison cell in 2019.

Conspiracy theorists, including many Trump voters, believe that Epstein was killed to prevent supposed information about high-profile “clients” involved with the financier being made public.

Ms Farmer worked for Epstein from 1995 to 1996, first as an art advisor and then on the front desk of his New York mansion, where she oversaw the coming and goings of girls, young women and celebrities.

Her younger sister, Annie Farmer, was also assaulted by Epstein. She said she was coerced into a topless massage at his ranch in New Mexico when she was 16-years-old.

The president last week ordered the Department of Justice to release grand jury testimony related to Epstein after the Wall Street Journal reported that Mr Trump had sent the disgraced financier a sexually suggestive birthday card in 2003.

Mr Trump called the report a hoax and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"
