                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) have been touted as a potential treatment for a variety of conditions, from inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, and type 2 diabetes to autism. In experiments with mice and studies with human tissue samples, the researchers conducting the new study saw that anaerobic microbes from the colon not only colonized the small bowel after a single transplant but also persisted there for months. These microbes also changed their new intestinal environments to their advantage, "terraforming" them in ways that caused changes in the recipient's metabolism, behavior, and energy balance. "I think it's a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn't willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn't be there," said Orlando (Landon) DeLeon, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at UChicago and lead author of the new study, which was published in Cell. "If we're designing good therapeutics, we should be aware of the importance of matching the regional microbiota to their proper environments, so that we provide better overall health benefits." FMT is approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for treating repeated infections with Clostridium difficile (C. diff), an opportunistic bacterium that often causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation in hospital patients who have been on antibiotics. Seeing the success in treating C. diff patients, many physicians have been eager to use FMT to treat other digestive conditions. Researchers understand that gut microbiome health can impact all vital organs and systems of the body, so the idea is that replacing a "sick" gut microbiome with a "healthy" one could fix the problem in one fell swoop. The gut isn't simply one consistent environment with the same microbiota throughout, however; instead, it has several distinct regions that are vastly different microbial ecosystems, each tailored for specific microbes that can provide functions vital to the health of their host. Orlando (Landon) DeLeon, PhD, postdoctoral researcher at UChicago and lead author of the new study Recipients of FMT are usually treated with antibiotics first to clear out the microbes living in the gut, leaving a clean slate for newly transplanted microbes to take up residence â€“ sometimes, however, in the wrong places. This created regional gut mismatches persisting up to three months after just one transplant. DeLeon saw that mismatches changed gene and protein expression in the intestinal lining in ways that more closely resembled expression levels from the microbes' original or native intestinal regions. "It's like they're engineering or terraforming their environments to help them fit in," DeLeon said. Chang said that this research highlights the need for more caution with FMT before we fully understand the long-term effects of introducing one set of microbes into a new environment. "We have absolutely no idea what's in FMT, except that it's a combination of microbes," Chang said. "But even a single FMT will cause a change in the host-microbe relationships in these very different regions of the bowel that may be very difficult to reverse." Both DeLeon and Chang advocate for "omni-microbial transplants," or OMT, instead. Whether given via an endoscopy or in pill form, microbes naturally settle in the right places, especially when they are competing side by side with others that normally inhabit a certain region. "If there's an open space, something's going to fill it," DeLeon said. "But the microbes that were supposed to be there are better suited for it, so they're more naturally going to fill it even in the presence of other microbes." DeLeon plans to keep studying how different microbes exert their influence in different parts of the intestine, using different approaches like single cell sequencing and metabolomics to track their activity. He is also exploring how the gut regions terraformed by microbiota mismatches can be restored to their original state, which could help restore normal gut function. Such deeper understanding could lead to improvements in the application of microbial transplants, ultimately helping them live up to their significant promise.
