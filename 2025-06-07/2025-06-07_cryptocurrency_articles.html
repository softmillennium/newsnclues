                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTC$105,784.84 held firm above $105,000 on Saturday despite an unusually combative and personal escalation in the Trump-Musk feud that could rattle traditional markets next week. On Saturday, in a phone interview with NBC News, President Trump warned that there would be “serious consequences” if Elon Musk financially backed Democratic candidates running against Republicans who support the GOP's budget bill. “I would assume so, yeah,” he added when asked if the rift was permanent. The cryptocurrency held onto earlier gains and continues to trade near weekly highs. The market's composure suggests that traders may increasingly view BTC as a hedge against institutional dysfunction, or at least as an asset insulated from the partisan fallout that tends to impact equities more directly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Notably, with a trading volume of $128.33 billion, the crypto space has grown by 2.65% today. With this, Bitcoin price has maintained its $105,000 mark this week, suggesting a strong bullish action in the market. Moreover, are you closely monitoring the price action of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP daily? In this article, we will explore the market sentiment and possible price action of these 3 cryptocurrencies. This has resulted in it comfortably reclaiming the $105,000 mark. Adding to this, the BTC price is hovering extremely close to the resistance trendline of the descending channel pattern, suggesting a high possibility of a micro breakout rally situation shortly. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator breakout of the neutral point and is currently valued at 53.70 (Slightly bullish). If the trend continues to move upward, this indicator could experience a bullish convergence in the daily time frame, resulting  in a short rally. Moreover, each EMA acts as dynamic support during price corrections, suggesting multiple safe exit points for short-term investors. A bullish breakout of the descending channel pattern could result in the BTC price heading toward its upper resistance levels of $109,000 and $122,000, respectively. The ETH coin price successfully holds its $2,500 mark this week. However, it has entered into a consolidated price action as it has been constantly trading within the $2,750 and $2,500 range. With a project valuation of $304.026 billion, it dominates by 9.2557%. The Cross EMA 50-day displays a constant rise and is currently valued at $2,344.94, whereas its 200-day EMA shows a strong support around the $2,450 mark. With a potential Golden Cross in the daily time frame, the Ethereum shows a sign of bullish action. However, a setback may result in it retesting its crucial support trend level of $2,400. Ripple's XRP price records a neutral price action over the past seven days as it has displayed a variation of less than 1%. However, with a market capitalization of $128.64 billion, it continues to dominate the 4th position with a contribution of 3.945% in the total market valuation. The Stoch RSI lines are at 33.70 (blue) and 28.58 (orange). Notably, this indicator measures the level of high-low range over a set period. It helps traders identify overbought and oversold conditions more accurately than traditional RSI. This type of trend action in the SMA suggests rising optimism among the investors and whales toward this altcoin. Other key resistance for this altcoin stands at the $2.5 mark. Conversely, its key support trendline is $2 if the market experiences a bearish turnaround. Overall, the cryptocurrency market shows high signs of a positive price action this month as top cryptocurrencies display bullish sentiments despite a volatile action this week. Additionally, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP tokens could ignite a short rally this month as their technical sentiments are now showing signs of greed. However, investors are suggested to brace themselves as unexpected liquidations or increased feud between Donald Trump & Elon Musk could trigger a short squeeze.

Hence, investors have been showing significant interest, pushing the ongoing UNIL presale above $2.4 million in record time. Nevertheless, it hovers above the 200-EMA ($2.08), which has proven to be a solid support. Further supported by technical indicators like Momentum (10) and Commodity Channel Index (20), an XRP price bounce is on the table. Meanwhile, WestBfieldLa's optimistic price prediction has become a subject of much interest, highlighting why it is one of the top DeFi coins to invest in. However, UNIL's significant upside potential has been attracting more investor interest. Hence, at the current price, it presents a great entry to what could be significant gains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin Hyper has seen rapid traction in its presale, raising close to $700,000 just days after going live. The project is already gaining momentum in the crypto community and has attracted coverage from major crypto media outlets. Bitcoin Hyper is designed as a Layer 2 blockchain to scale Bitcoin by enabling faster transactions, lower fees, and smart contract capabilities. While Bitcoin remains the most secure and established blockchain, its base layer is limited by slower speeds and lacks support for decentralized applications (dApps). To overcome these issues, Bitcoin Hyper leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), combining Solana's high-throughput architecture with Bitcoin's unparalleled security. This hybrid approach introduces programmability to the Bitcoin network, allowing near-instant transaction processing and unlocking a new world of use cases. Operating as a low-latency Layer 2 network, Bitcoin Hyper processes transactions on a high-performance virtual machine and settles them on Bitcoin's Layer 1. This reduces congestion and cuts costs significantly compared to native Bitcoin transactions. Users can deposit BTC, convert it into Layer 2 tokens, and use them within the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, with the option to redeem tokens back to BTC seamlessly, enabling trustless interoperability between layers. Security remains a core focus for Bitcoin Hyper. Trading is already enabled, providing investors with confidence in the project's reliability. The Bitcoin Hyper white paper outlines a bold vision to become the leading programmable Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. By offering fast smart contract execution, low-cost dApp deployment, and a seamless bridge to Bitcoin's base layer, the ecosystem aims to deliver true scalability without compromising Bitcoin's foundational security. Integration of Solana's technology stack ensures a familiar and robust environment for developers, attracting builders seeking the combined benefits of both Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin Hyper is actively growing its community, boasting over 6,900 followers on X since launching in May 2025. It also maintains active engagement on Telegram and through its official website. As further proof of its rising presence, more crypto analysts have begun discussing Bitcoin Hyper on their YouTube channels—many of which have thousands of subscribers—highlighting the growing recognition the project is receiving across the crypto space. The Bitcoin Hyper presale is currently offering tokens priced at $0.0118. Over $680,000 has been raised so far, and the token price is set to increase within the next 24 hours—making this an ideal opportunity for early investors to secure tokens at a discount. The presale primarily accepts Ethereum (ETH), with additional support for Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and stablecoins like USDT. Once the presale concludes, participants will be able to claim their HYPER tokens, currently issued on the Ethereum blockchain. In just a few days, the project has raised nearly $700,000 and is attracting growing interest from crypto analysts and major media outlets. Bitcoin Hyper is quickly emerging as one of the most compelling Layer 2 innovations for Bitcoin—combining Solana-level performance with Bitcoin's trusted foundation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This figure has placed it ahead of Bitcoin in daily price shift. The network's rise in usage comes as its native digital currency, TRX price shows early signs of a rebound. Tron coin is making a quiet but strong comeback. As of June 6, 2025, TRX price was trading at $0.2782, up 2.72% in 24 hours. While that may not grab headlines, the bigger picture tells a more interesting story. Analysts tracking the market noted that TRX price is in what they call a rebound and decoupling phase. That means it is starting to move independently, no longer following broader market trends too closely. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages for activity have both climbed steadily, showing that the user base is growing at a consistent pace. Analyst Cryptoonchain pointed out that these metrics often lead to positive price action. In a market where many coins rise and fall together, TRX price is starting to behave differently. With more users and steady engagement, the signs point to building momentum. This marks a 30% increase since February 2025, adding around 2 million transactions per day in just four months. The numbers highlight a key difference between Tron and Bitcoin. While Bitcoin's transaction count is often tied to exchange-related activity, Tron's growth comes from real usage. Tron's low transaction fees and fast processing times are likely major reasons behind the surge. Developers are also choosing it for dApps due to the lower costs and smooth user experience. With millions of daily transactions now a regular feature, Tron is beginning to look like a leader in practical blockchain utility. This usually leads to TRX adoption and a potential upward movement in price. Broader market conditions and investor sentiment will play a role. But if Tron coin's current bullish trend continues, the $0.5 level may come into view sooner rather than later. With stablecoin use growing and developer interest holding strong, the building blocks for a price breakout are already there.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American singer Jonathan Mann lost $3 million, which he had earned from NFT sales, to crypto tax and an unexpected Ethereum price crash. Jonathan Mann, an American singer and songwriter, recently experienced a notable crypto loss due to the market crash. Consequently, Mann has turned his ordeal into a musical tale, advising other investors to be cautious. “This is the story of how I made three million dollars and lost it,” Mann sings. Three years ago, Mann sold 3,700 songs at $800 each, generating roughly $3 million in Ethereum (ETH) from these sales. With so much excitement and a lack of preparation, the singer and his wife chose to HODL Ethereum. They expected the largest altcoin by market capitalization to surge in price. — 17 years of song a day (@songadaymann) June 5, 2025 Instead of increasing as the couple had expected, the ETH price followed a downtrend pattern in January 2022. This was an unfortunate situation, considering that the price of ETH had significantly dropped since then. Mann and his wife were trying to avoid losses. Hence, they took a loan from Aave, a prominent lending protocol, and used the ETH as collateral, rather than selling it. When Terraform Labs crashed in 2022, more disaster struck for the American musician, as massive crypto liquidations occurred. In the blink of an eye, Mann's $3 million vanished. He and his wife ended up with a debt of $1,095,171.79. Mann sold a rare Autoglyph NFT he purchased in crypto's early days to save the day. After some setbacks, he found a broker who was willing to pay $1.1 million for the NFT. After this unpleasant ordeal, the American singer has not stopped writing songs and selling them as NFTs.

Bitcoin's journey from digital experiment to mainstream investment has been marked by one defining characteristic: extreme price volatility. However, data from NYU Stern's Volatility Lab reveals a remarkable transformation in how dramatically Bitcoin's price swings, offering important lessons for today's investors. Between 2010 and 2017, Bitcoin experienced volatility that would make even the most seasoned traders nervous. To put this in perspective, traditional stocks typically see volatility between 15-30% annually. This extreme volatility reflected Bitcoin's status as an unproven digital asset with minimal institutional backing. Small trading volumes meant that even modest buy or sell orders could trigger massive price swings. Bitcoin's price rocketed from under $1,000 to nearly $20,000 before crashing back down, creating the kind of volatility that attracted speculators while terrifying traditional investors. Current data shows Bitcoin's volatility has continued moderating, now typically ranging between 30%-80%. While this remains substantially higher than stocks or bonds, it represents a dramatic evolution from Bitcoin's early days. This represents remarkable progress for an asset that once regularly experienced 300%-400% volatility. Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase. First, Bitcoin has become more accessible to risk-conscious investors who were previously deterred by extreme price swings. Institutions and retail investors alike can now consider Bitcoin allocation with more predictable risk parameters. However, “more stable” doesn't mean “stable.” An 80% volatility level means investors should still expect significant price movements. Bitcoin can easily gain or lose 20%-30% in a single week, making it unsuitable for investors who can't tolerate substantial short-term losses. As Bitcoin's market capitalization grows and institutional adoption increases, basic economics suggests volatility should continue declining gradually. Dollar-cost averaging becomes particularly attractive, as it helps smooth out price fluctuations over time. Position sizing remains critical – financial advisors typically recommend limiting Bitcoin exposure to 1%-5% of total portfolios. Even with reduced volatility, Bitcoin remains far more volatile than traditional assets, requiring careful consideration of overall portfolio risk. Bitcoin's volatility journey from 400% to 80% represents one of the most significant developments in cryptocurrency history. While still volatile by traditional standards, this evolution reflects Bitcoin's gradual transition from speculative experiment to legitimate asset class. For investors, this trend suggests Bitcoin is becoming more investable while remaining distinctly different from traditional assets. Understanding this evolution helps investors make informed decisions about whether and how to include Bitcoin in their portfolios, recognizing both its progress and its continued unique risk profile.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the altcoin season to actually begin, past market performances show that there needs to be a major decline in the Bitcoin dominance. This is the ultimate trigger the market needs to confirm that altcoins will begin their own independent run. The Bitcoin dominance is still trending at a high 64%, and this continues to be a thorn in the side of altcoins. With the dominance this high, the Bitcoin price continues to dictate where the market goes and has seen altcoins suffer crashes as a result of even the tiniest movement triggering a decline in prices. However, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend has pointed out an interesting formation in the chart, which is a 7-wave crashing pattern. This pattern has been completed, and this signals a possible drop in the Bitcoin dominance as time goes on. This pattern suggests that the Bitcoin dominance could possibly drop to 62%, which would be good news for those waiting for the altcoin season. The last time that the dominance was this low was back on May 14, and altcoins had rallied hard as a result. For this decline to be completed, the crypto analyst reveals that confirmation lies below 63.45%, as this is the Wave 6 lows. As the analyst explains, “real momentum kicks in under 62%,” and this is when altcoin season moves with full force. Some have said there will be no altcoin season similar to what was seen in 2021, while others have maintained that it is still possible. For a 2021-style altcoin season to happen, though, the crypto analyst says the altcoin market, which excludes the top 10 cryptos by market cap, must break above the $470 billion resistance like it did in previous cycles. Once this happens, then they expect the altcoin season to begin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After earning $3 million from NFT sales, Jonathan Mann watched it vanish in a crash, and now he's turned the ordeal into a painfully honest crypto tax tune. Non-fungible token (NFT) artist Jonathan Mann, the musician behind the “Song A Day” project, has turned his crypto tax ordeal into a cautionary musical tale. In a new track shared on X, Mann recounted how he made $3 million selling his entire back catalog as NFTs, only to see it vanish as the market crashed during the Terra ecosystem collapse. “This is the story of how I made three million dollars and lost it,” Mann sings. Mann said it all began on Jan. 1, 2022, when he sold 3,700 songs at $800 each, netting him roughly $3 million — all in Ether (ETH). Excited but unprepared, Mann and his wife decided to hold onto the crypto, hoping ETH prices would increase. “We didn't have a plan,” Mann admitted in the song. Things took a turn when ETH's value declined in January 2022, and the couple was unsure about how much to sell or when. Because of this, even though their $3 million in ETH went down in price, their tax bill remained the same. To avoid selling their crypto at a loss, Mann said they took out a loan through the lending protocol Aave, using some of the ETH as collateral. Scrambling to find a way out, Mann spent months combing through transactions with his accountant to determine how much they owed — they found out it was $1,095,171.79. Related: NFTs can be securities, but SEC Wells notice to OpenSea ‘not productive' — Lawyer With the threat of potential liens on their home and risks of losing his wife's retirement account, Mann turned to one last option: selling a rare Autoglyph NFT he purchased back in crypto's early days. “It felt so bittersweet to be done,” he sings at the end. Despite the ordeal, Mann continues writing daily songs and selling them as NFTs, still hopeful he'll one day earn another $3 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum attracts investor interest even when it maintains a healthy upward trend this month. Currently, with a 24-hour trading volume of $17.05 billion, ETH trades at $2,487.15 and has posted a 2% gain over the last 24 hours.While the weekly momentum was slightly bearish, the month-on-month increase of 30.45% illustrates excellent underlying momentum together with a fresh interest from institutional as well as retail investors. The 12-hour chart of Ethereum shows a symmetrical triangle pattern, clearer under technical analysis. This pattern is most commonly drawn with continuation moves but currently reflects indecision within the market since neither the buying nor selling pressure has taken control.Converging trendlines depict a compressing range, thus hinting at an impending significant breakout. This area has previously resulted in sell-offs; however, the tightening structure increases its chances of breaking out within days. This bullish scenario would likely draw quite a bit of buying volume, which would continue to propel Ethereum higher. If Ethereum cannot climb above the resistance, then the price could drop into the range between $2,430 and $2,250.This area is considered a significant support zone and may indeed become flavored with selling pressure if it were to be retested. Traders are waiting for a clear direction from volume and momentum as it gets closer to the apex of the triangle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto keeps offering not just an alternative financial system but a platform for global innovation. Amidst this evolution, one segment of the digital asset space consistently draws high-level attention: cryptocurrencies with high-growth potential. A new class of blockchain projects is emerging that combines utility, scalability, and financial performance to deliver exponential upside. Qubetics introduces a novel solution to one of the most persistent problems in global finance: inefficient cross-border payments. By using an advanced blockchain protocol, Qubetics eliminates intermediaries and minimizes delays. Its protocol design focuses on interoperability, ensuring smooth integration with legacy banking systems and upcoming fintech platforms. With regulatory compliance built into the architecture, Qubetics allows banks and financial institutions to execute cross-border transactions while meeting global standards. The result is improved customer experience, operational efficiency, and a competitive edge for early adopters. Qubetics is currently in the final stage of its crypto presale. The project has attracted more than 27,500 token holders, signaling strong community confidence and market readiness. That means early birds stand to gain nearly 20% the moment it goes live. After a dramatic supply cut—from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens—the scarcity is real, and the shift of 38.55% of tokens to public hands signals a major move toward decentralization. If the token hits $0.40, your holding would be worth about $4,747.60—a tidy $747.60 gain. Better yet, if TICS reaches $1 post-presale, this amount turns into $11,867 — a 196% return. These projections are based on historical crypto market patterns and the unique utility $TICS brings to financial networks. It's important to note that while the projections are promising, actual outcomes depend on continued development, regulatory acceptance, and global adoption. Its real-world utility for banks and financial systems enhances both adoption potential and long-term token value among the best cryptos for 100X potential. Celestia proposes a revolutionary approach to blockchain architecture through modularity. By separating consensus and data availability layers, it offers developers a flexible environment to build scalable decentralized applications without inheriting the limitations of monolithic blockchains. The platform empowers developers to deploy their own sovereign blockchains using minimal computational resources. Why this crypto makes it to this list: Celestia lays the groundwork for next-gen blockchain development, reducing entry barriers for developers while maximizing scalability and customizability. With faster transaction confirmation times and lower fees, Litecoin offers a practical alternative for everyday crypto payments. Its recent adoption of the MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) upgrade enhances transaction privacy, making Litecoin more appealing to both individual users and payment-focused enterprises. Widespread exchange support and a strong developer community ensure continuous improvements. Why this crypto makes it to this list: Litecoin's long-term stability, consistent development, and enhanced privacy features make it a solid bet for scalable digital currency usage. Filecoin addresses the growing need for decentralized cloud storage by creating a marketplace where users pay for storage space using its native token, FIL. Providers earn FIL tokens by offering unused storage space and maintaining data integrity. With partnerships spanning academic institutions, research facilities, and enterprise users, Filecoin provides a tangible utility in storing verifiable, censorship-resistant data. The protocol's alignment with Web3 principles adds an extra layer of relevance in today's privacy-focused environment. Its economic model incentivizes trust and reliability, boosting long-term value. Cardano stands apart due to its science-first approach, backed by peer-reviewed research and formal verification methods. Designed by academics and engineers, Cardano focuses on creating a sustainable, secure blockchain optimized for real-world applications. The platform uses a unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, which consumes significantly less energy than proof-of-work chains. Why this crypto makes it to this list: Cardano's commitment to research, scalability, and environmental sustainability positions it as a forward-looking blockchain solution. Its hybrid consensus model combines proof-of-history and proof-of-stake, optimizing performance without sacrificing decentralization. Despite previous network congestion issues, Solana's ongoing improvements and strong developer ecosystem continue to attract new projects. From gaming platforms to DeFi protocols, Solana powers a growing number of high-traffic applications. Why this crypto makes it to this list: Solana's technical capabilities, vibrant ecosystem, and strong institutional support make it a contender for long-term exponential growth. Each cryptocurrency discussed above brings a unique value proposition to the table. Cardano integrates science with scalability, and Solana delivers performance at scale. But remember, while high potential returns exist, so do market risks. Regulatory changes, technological hurdles, and adoption rates will all influence future performance. Qubetics focuses on improving cross-border payments with near-instant settlements, regulatory compliance, and seamless bank integration. Celestia is a modular blockchain protocol that separates consensus and data availability, allowing developers to build custom blockchains. Yes, Cardano uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, making it significantly more energy-efficient than proof-of-work chains, as one of the best cryptos for 100X potential. Solana's architecture supports high-throughput performance, ideal for demanding dApps like gaming and DeFi platforms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jonathan Mann decided to hold the ETH from the sale, which turned out to be a bad decision in hindsight. Singer-songwriter Jonathan Mann recently shared the story of how earning millions in Ethereum (ETH) during a one-hour sale of his NFTs eventually became a “tax nightmare.” In 2022, he sold 4,000 songs worth 13 years of work within 60 minutes for a total of roughly $3 million in Ethereum. He retained the earnings in Ethereum instead of converting to dollars. However, a week later, market price slipped below $3,000, shrinking the sale's dollar value. The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats revenue earned directly in crypto as ordinary income at the moment of receipt, he owed a massive tax obligation even though his assets were no longer worth the same dollar amount. The tax man calculated Mann's tax obligations based on the $3 million initial valuation rather than on subsequent lower prices. Mann had already accumulated $1 million in 2021 obligations linked to earlier NFT mints and airdrops, including Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and ConstitutionDAO tokens. To cover part of that balance, he borrowed $400,000 against 518 ETH through the Aave lending platform. However, little did he know that his collateral was about to evaporate. However, the May 2022 collapse of the Terra ecosystem cut the collateral's value from $1.5 million to about $200,000, forcing a last-minute repayment that left Mann with 163 ETH and a net capital loss of roughly $1.3 million. Mann recounted that at the time he was “dreading” the only option he had left to solve his dilemma – selling his “autoglyph.” Matt Hall and John Watkinson (of Cryptopunks fame) had made something special. John built a custom “glyph to midi” tool because of it. It was a piece of my soul from when 50 people knew what NFTs were. This will match revenue with prospective tax liabilities.
