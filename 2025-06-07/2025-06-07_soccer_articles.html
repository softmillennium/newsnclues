When not writing, he is either playing or watching sports. Translations may contain inaccuracies‚Äîplease refer to the original content. The U.S. men's national soccer team finally takes to the pitch again on Saturday when it hosts a tough Turkey team in what should be a great test for manager Mauricio Pochettino's men. The U.S. has lost its last two matches heading into this game against Turkey, falling 1-0 against Panama in the CONCACAF Nations League semifinal before then again losing, this time to rival Canada, 2-1, in the third-place game, despite a 35th-minute goal by Patrick Agyemang. Needless to say, with the 2026 World Cup not all that far away, the U.S. will need to start shifting its momentum. Some of the notable names set to miss this next batch of friendlies for the team are some of the team's best players: Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, and Folarin Balogun. This could not come at a worse time for Pochettino, as the national team desperately needs to find its footing after a rough recent stretch, with the 2026 World Cup, which it hosts, coming next summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 1-0 victory preserved England's perfect start to World Cup qualifying as Thomas Tuchel became the first manager in the nation's history to win his first three games in charge without conceding a goal. But England were dull and lethargic against Andorra, who are ranked 173rd in the world by FIFA, and they were jeered off at the half-time break. Andorra 0 England 1 ‚Äì Tuchel's men largely underwhelming, might they regret narrow win? England endured a largely frustrating evening in Barcelona, as they scraped a 1-0 World Cup qualifying win against Andorra. Thomas Tuchel's team would have expected to rack up a more convincing score line against a team ranked 173rd in the world, but ended up with just Harry Kane's second-half goal to show for their efforts. The result leaves England top of their qualifying group but improved performances will surely be required later in the campaign. Andorra 0 England 1 ‚Äì Tuchel's men largely underwhelming, might they regret narrow win? Thomas Tuchel has just been interviewed by ITV and could not hide his disappointment with his side's laboured performance. üí¨ ‚ÄúWe're not happy with the performance, of course. We started quite well in the first 20 or 25 minutes, but that was the only time it felt like it was only a matter of time. But we completely lost our momentum and couldn't get it back for the whole of the first half. ‚ÄúWe got a little bit in the first 15 minutes of the second, but then ended up in a period which was by far not good enough. There was a lack of urgency, quality and energy.‚Äù A slightly sheepish Harry Kane has just been interviewed by ITV. We take the points and move on.‚Äù A game that will almost certainly be forgotten about come tomorrow morning is over. England, courtesy of Harry Kane, won by a single goal, but their performance was nothing to shout home about. England's fans booed them off at half time and there were a smattering at full time, too, such was the display. Tuchel knows there is plenty of room for improvement, and there is enough time before next year's World Cup to iron out any problems, but there is a lot of work to be done if England are going to be genuine contenders to win next year's World Cup. Now let's never speak of this again. England break forward at the death but Gordon pokes Gibbs-White's cross wide. Madueke prevents the ball from going out and the goal is at his mercy but he slots it straight at Alvarez. Morgan Gibbs-White is coming on, for some reason. He replaces Jude Bellingham with two minutes remaining. There will be three minutes of additional time. It's now 15 minutes since England last had a shot on target. Thomas Tuchel is about to become the first England manager to win his first three games in charge without conceding ‚Ä¶ but this has been a dreadfully dreary performance. Tuchel's heart must have been in his mouth as Guillaume Lopez, an Andorran substitute, marauded into Jordan Pickford's penalty area. His shot was eventually blocked, but it will serve as a reminder, no matter how little attacking Andorra are doing, that England only have a one goal lead going into the final 10 minutes. Vales, who has only just come on, completely outfoxes Burn with a smart backhell into space. Lopez collects the ball and slaloms forward and, for a moment, it looks as though he's clean through. But Konsa catches up and does well to block his shot before it troubles Pickford. Eze gets up well above Borra and nods the ball towards goal, but Alvarez reads it well and does fantastically to tip it over the bar. Alvarez is man of the match as it stands! Another good pass from Curtis Jones releases Harry Kane into space down the right. Jude Bellingham hares forward to get involved but Kane's pass is too far behind him and, once again, Andorra scramble it away to safety. Trent Alexander-Arnold has been lively since coming on a few moments ago. He takes a corner on the right-hand side and it's a good delivery, although Borra heads it away. It's a good idea but he cuts across it too much and the ball bounces wide of Alvarez's right post. Cole Palmer comes off for Eberechi Eze. And Madueke switches flanks to allow Eze space on the left. Thomas Tuchel is about to shuffle his pack. Eberechi Eze and Trent Alexander-Arnold are getting ready.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea looking to strengthen in the winger position following the decision not to take up the option to sign Jadon Sancho permanently; club want player signed ahead of Club World Club Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The club are hoping to sign him before Tuesday's deadline as they want him to play in the Club World Cup. Dortmund are also taking part in the competition. The 20-year-old winger was a target in January and has remained high on a list of eight or nine attacking names Chelsea are working on this summer. Chelsea may also sign another striker after already completing deal for Liam Delap with Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko on their shortlist. But goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga looks set to leave Stamford Bridge. Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign him and are expected to trigger the ¬£5m release clause in his contract. When it comes to honing young English talent, Dortmund know how to do that better than most clubs in the Premier League. But Gittens' story is different to those of Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham who came before him before moving on for big money. Bellingham arrived having had a season in the Championship with Birmingham City. A prospect at Reading, he had spent only two years at City, but was not close to the first team when Dortmund made their move. We want to find the one player who can reach our first team," said Dortmund CEO Lars Ricken.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tickets for the FIFA Men's World Cup will soon be up for grabs, and the classification matches involving the host nations - Mexico, Canada, and the United States - have already been assigned dates and venues. Here's what FIFA, the event's governing body, has announced so far: The global tournament is set to run from June 11 through July 19. Mexico's team will play in the inaugural match, set to be held in Mexico City. The opposing team has yet to be announced. Team USA is scheduled to debut on Friday, June 12, in Los Angeles at SoFi Stadium. After that, the U.S. team will play on Friday, June 19, at Seattle's Lumen Field, and then return to Los Angeles for a match on June 25. Additional match dates for Team USA will be announced as the tournament progresses, depending on their performance in the group stage and whether they advance to the knockout rounds. The World Cup final is slated to take place at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. The venue sits in the borough of East Rutherford, 8 miles west of Manhattan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FT. LAUDERDALE, FL - JANUARY 18: United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino talks with United States forward Indiana Vassilev (19) during an international friendly soccer match between the U.S. Men's National Team and Venezuela on January 18, 2025 at the Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, FL. The United States men's national soccer team will play in its third International Friendly of 2025 when it hosts Turkey. Where: Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, East Hartford, Connecticut Channel Finder: DirecTV, Verizon Fios, Cox, Xfinity, Spectrum, Optimum Here's a recent U.S. soccer story from the Associated Press: NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Christian Pulisic is among a slew of regular starters who will be missing when the United States plays in next month's CONCACAF Gold Cup, another blow for a team coming off dismal performances at the Copa America and CONCACAF Nations League. Given the absences, coach Mauricio Pochettino wants players who will convince worried fans a turnaround is ahead. ‚ÄúIt's our responsibility to send some signal to them,‚Äù he said Thursday during a Zoom news conference after announcing his 27-man roster. Yunus Musah also asked out, Antonee Robinson was dropped because he has been playing with an injury, and Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna were blocked because FIFA gave the expanded Club World Cup priority over national teams. Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Tanner Tessmann were omitted in what Pochettino called ‚Äúfootball decisions.‚Äù U.S. Soccer Federation sporting director Matt Crocker said Pulisic and his advisers asked for the possibility to be left off because of the amount of games he has played in the last two years. ‚ÄúMany people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup,‚Äù Pochettino said. After the Gold Cup, he will have just four brief training windows on FIFA international dates before players report ahead of the World Cup. Without saying players had been complacent, Pochettino said ‚Äúwe learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March, and it's about to be ‚Äî maybe use a different way to approach these opportunities.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you arrive to the camp and you want to spend nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?‚Äù Pochettino asked out loud. Outside back Sergi√±o Dest returns to the national team for the first time since March 2024 after recovering from a torn ACL. He had two MLS appearances last year and has become a regular this season. Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, a 24-year-old son of the former coach, also was picked for the first time along with 20-year-old forward Damion Downs and 21-year-old defender Quinn Sullivan. Downs has played on youth teams of Germany and the U.S., and helped Cologne gain promotion to the Bundesliga for 2025-26 after a one-season absence. Goalkeeper Matt Freese, who has attended national team camp previously but not played in a game, also was selected. The U.S. plays Turkey on June 7 at East Hartford, Connecticut, and Switzerland three days later at Nashville, Tennessee, then meets Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti in the first round of the Gold Cup. Defenders: Max Arfsten (Columbus), Sergi√±o Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando), DeJuan Jones (San Jose), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse), Tim Ream (Charlotte), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati) Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson (Leeds), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis), Luca de la Torre (San Diego), Diego Luna (Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia), Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus) Damion Downs (Cologne), Brian White (Vancouver), Haji Wright (Coventry) The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Advance Local.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Names will be made this summer in United States men's national team action, which starts when Mauricio Pochettino's team meets up with European powers Turkiye in East Hartford on Saturday. But there are still a lot of regulars here, as Tyler Adams and Johnny Cardoso keep things steady and vicious in the midfield and Chris Richards gets more time as one of the leaders at the back. Richards returns to the team with an FA Cup on his resume, and Crystal Palace teammate Matt Turner is likely to also start for the USMNT. Location: Rentschler Field in East Hartford, ConnecticutTV: Telemundo, Universo Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Damion Downs, and Brian White all have claims of form and will feel they can claim the center forward spot with Folarin Balogun leaving camp through injury. Malik Tillman can show so much without Reyna, Weah, and Pulisic, and has to be thrilled at the prospect of orchestrating the attack in front of steady midfielders. The wings are very intriguing, as we'll learn how highly Pochettino already rates Diego Luna, and there are a bunch of talented options who could claim starting spots. The Crescent Stars essentially cruised through Nations League B, winning promotion with a decisive two-legged triumph over Hungary. Former AC Milan and Sevilla boss Vincenzo Montella is missing some familiar names for this match as Bournemouth's Enes Unal, Brighton's Ferdi Kadioglu, and Hoffenheim's Ozan Kabak are out through injury and Cenk Tosun was not called into the team. This is a squad based largely in Turkiye's top flight, but Real Madrid starlet Arda Guler and Juventus young star Kenan Yildiz ‚Äî both 20 years old ‚Äî are in the fold. Man United backstop Altay Bayindir and Trabzonspor keeper Ugurcan Cakir are the keepers with experience. This is a solid team with lots of experience. Many will know the names Merih Demiral, Caglar Soyuncu, Mert Muldur, Okay Yokuslu, and Orkun Kokcu. Anything can happen in these friendlies once teams start making loads of subs in the second half, so it's almost more worthwhile to predict the score after 55 minutes or so. Either way, we'll venture chances in this one. The hosts will be slight favorites to win here, but we'll take that down a notch.

But this year's competition has an enormous prize fund of ¬£777m ($1bn), to be split among the teams. The Club World Cup has typically been viewed as a minor affair for European clubs and fans, but FIFA wants it to be 'the football event of the year'. As well as the new format, the competition is also going to feature a host of 'trailblazing' rule changes, which FIFA claim will 'improve football. The most significant innovation is that referees will wear body cameras, allowing fans to see closer into their decision making process. The new camera angle will be trialled to see if it can improve the viewing experience for fans at home, while FIFA will use the experiment to create guidelines for its possible use in other competitions. Advanced semi-automated offside technology will also be used as referees seek to make quicker decisions throughout the match. The new Club World Cup format has received criticism from players and FIFA is currently facing legal action surrounding the tournament's scheduling. Manuel Akanji, currently in the US on Switzerland duty for their upcoming pair of friendlies, has candidly spoken out against the fixture congestion. The Manchester City defender said: 'I have been a strong critic of this competition for some time now. My City teammates are not exactly overjoyed about the tournament either.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portugal forward has ‚Äòpractically decided' not to take part Mbapp√©: PSG Champions League win ‚Äòdoesn't affect me' Cristiano Ronaldo has said he does not plan to play at the Club World Cup in the United States, despite being courted by clubs participating in the 32-team tournament. Speculation over the Portugal forward's future intensified last month when the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, said discussions were under way about Ronaldo playing despite his club side, Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr, failing to qualify. Asked about the possibility of signing for another club in order to play Ronaldo said: ‚ÄúIt's irrelevant, at the moment it doesn't make sense to talk about things other than the national team. ‚ÄúThere has been plenty of contact [from clubs], I see things that make sense, others that don't. You can't go to all of them, you have to think short, medium and long term. It's something that's practically decided on my part, which is not to go to the Club World Cup, but I've had plenty of invitations.‚Äù Al-Nassr's sporting director, Fernando Hierro, said last month they were negotiating with Ronaldo over a contract extension but faced competition from clubs eager to sign the five-times Ballon d'Or winner. Ronaldo added to the uncertainty, posting on social media: ‚ÄúThis chapter is over. The Portugal captain played down suggestions that it is a face-off between himself and the 17-year-old Barcelona sensation, Lamine Yamal. ‚ÄúIt's always been like that, whenever I've played football, whenever I've played a big game it's always been Cristiano against this one, against that one,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat I want most is for Portugal to be at a good level, confident that things can go well, that we can play a great game and win against a very good team, possibly the best in the world.‚Äù Meanwhile, Kylian Mbapp√© has insisted he was happy to see his former club, Paris Saint-Germain, win the Champions League for the first time after his departure last summer. PSG thrashed Inter 5-0 in Munich last week to lift the trophy, 12 months after Mbapp√© left on a free transfer in acrimonious circumstances. ‚ÄúI was happy, they deserved it,‚Äù Mbapp√© said. I've been through every stage of the Champions League except winning it,. ‚ÄúI can't remember ever seeing them go 5-0 up. It's 100% deserved, they're becoming the team everyone wants to beat.‚Äù Speaking before France's Nations League third-place playoff against Germany in Stuttgart on Sunday, Mbapp√© also backed compatriot Ousmane Demb√©l√© to win the Ballon d'Or award, ahead of Spain and Barcelona's Lamine Yamal. Mbapp√© scored 43 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid, winning the European golden shoe award, but his team failed to win a major trophy, beaten by Barcelona in the title race and Copa del Rey final. The 26-year-old has also been involved in a legal dispute with PSG over ‚Ç¨55m in wages he claims the club have not paid him. The France forward claimed there were no hard feelings over his departure and PSG's European success. No, my story was over, it had to end,. There was no bitterness, I'd reached the end of my tether.‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After disappointment in the Concacaf Nations League, the United States men's national team is back in action with a friendly against Turkiye as a tune up for the Gold Cup, which kicks off in just over a week. It's a strange international break with the Club World Cup and rest for players thinning out Maucicio Pochettino's squad which will be without regulars such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Sergino Dest, Gio Reyna and Folarin Balogun for this match. Turkiye will be one of the better teams that the USMNT has faced, ranking 27th in the FIFA men's rankings, so with a squad that's mostly from Major League Soccer, this will be a true test of Pochettino's tactics. Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more. These teams haven't met since 2014 when the United States defeated Turkiye in a tune up match for the World Cup in Brazil. That was a World Cup where the United States did make it to the knockout stage before falling to Belgium in extra time. Despite that game being 11 years ago, Hakan Calhanoglu did come off the bench in that match for Turkiye and will be expected to start this match, playing a critical role in their midfield. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. With such an inexperienced roster on the international stage, Pochettino has been asked if the squad at his disposal is good enough to win these games before heading to the Gold Cup but he quickly dismissed that notion. "I think we need to respect the players that are here. We weren't good enough to win the Nations League. I think we cannot judge or analyze in this way. If we don't win, you can criticize." While he's not wrong about how the USMNT has performed, this will be an important time for him to get the team to a stage where they are good enough to win these matches. Since taking over in September of 2024, this will be the longest camp that Pochettino has spent with the squad, which will give him a chance to make tactical breakthroughs. If they're still not good enough to win these games after spending that much time with the Argentine, that's when alarm bells will begin to ring about what this team's ceiling is. Alongside Jack McGlynn, Luca De La Torre, Malik Tillman, Diego Luna, and Tyler Adams, there are quite a few directions that Pochettino can go in for this friendly, and that choice could have major implications on an eventual World Cup squad. USMNT: Matt Turner, John Tolkin, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Nathan Harriel, Tyler Adams, Johnny Cardoso, Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright T√ºrkiye: Ugurcan Cakir, Mert Muldur, Samet Akaydin, Caglar Soyuncu, Mustafa Eskihellac, Salih Ozcan, Hakan Calhanoglu, Arda Guler, Kenan Yildiz, Baris Tilmaz, Kerem Akturkoglu John Tolkin, Holstein Kiel: While this is Tolkin's first USMNT camp since being relegated from the Bundesliga, he did put in some good performances for Holstein Kiel after joining in January. Without Antonee Robinson, he could get a chance to be the starting left back for the USMNT, a position that has no true backup. When depth will be needed at multiple positions if the USMNT wants to succeed at the World Cup in 20206, figuring out Robinson's backup will be critical. If the same USMNT from the Concacaf Nations League comes into this match, it will be quite a disappointment as their performance facing Panama and Canada won't be good enough to win this match facing off against Turkiye. They may not have to win the game in this friendly, but an improved performance is certainly needed. It will at least be an eventful one with Arda Guler scoring before Brian White comes off the bench to rescue a result for the USMNT in a match that, while it won't be pretty, will build confidence for this squad. ‚òÄÔ∏è Morning Footy (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Join Golazo Network as it helps fans get their day started on the right foot on the network's flagship morning show with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Sport Bild journalist Christian Falk, the Club World Cup has made things more difficult for Bayern Munich's squad planning initiatives: Partly because it's their first time, but also because of what's at stake in terms of financial rewards. If Bayern Munich win the Club World Cup, they could secure over ‚Ç¨100m. This would represent a very welcome boost in the transfer market. At the moment, you can see that Bayern have a big problem in defence. It's not clear if Kim Min-jae can play, which is partly why they're so keen to get Jonathan Tah over the line as soon as possible in time for the Club World Cup. Bayer Leverkusen want a fee said to be around ‚Ç¨4m-5m to release Tah early, which is too much for Bayern Munich. As we now know, Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen put their heads together and did work out a deal. It remains to be seen how Tah's presence could affect Kim Min-jae's situation. As for Tom Bischoff, Hoffenheim is still looking to capitalize on holding his rights for a few more weeks: There's now a separate issue with Tom Bischof, as Hoffenheim has now realised it can also squeeze some money out of Bayern. So, the club is struggling to get a team together and have a big squad for the Club World Cup. Otherwise, things could get a little difficult. Eric Dier, for instance, isn't in the team any longer, so things aren't quite clear at the moment. Awesome, then check out the latest edition of the Bavarian Podcast Works ‚Äî Weekend Warm-up Show!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Grealish isn't holding back when it comes to letting his doubters know how he feels after a tumultuous season. The Manchester City winger made 20 appearances in the Premier League this season scoring just one goal along with a single assist. His future has been widely discussed after reports surfaced that he's likely going to be left off Man City's squad list for the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. As such, talks of a potential summer move have heated up. Former Aston Villa forward Gabi Agbonlahor criticised Guardiola's decision to leave Grealish on the bench in their loss to Crystal Palace. When the clip was posted to social media, one user responded: ‚ÄúDude Jack is (sic) been bad lately and I'm not surprised Pep did that.‚Äù Scored three goals in my last three appearances over 45 mins but okie dokie love x.‚Äù The City forward also commented, ‚ÄúWhat u want me to do, score a hatty in 20?‚Äù Much has been made about Grealish since his move to Man City. The Spaniard has his style of play and he particularly coaches players to fill certain roles, even despite Grealish's tantalising performances for Aston Villa. Max Mallow is an editor for Sports Illustrated FC. Somehow, he has just enough time every matchday to tweet when an Arsenal player scores a goal.
