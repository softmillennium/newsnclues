Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Drones struck a Russian military plant in Michurinsk, Tambov Oblast, in the early hours of June 6, according to media outlets in Russia. 

Attacks were also reported in Russia's Saratov, Moscow, Tula, Belgorod, and Kaluga oblasts.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports at the time of publication. 

The JSC Progress Plant in the city of Michurinsk in Tambov Oblast came under fire overnight, Russian Telegram news channels reported, citing local residents. A drone allegedly hit the plant's workshop, causing a fire. 

Russian officials have not yet commented on the attack. 

The JSC Progress Plant produces high-tech aviation and missile control systems, along with equipment for gas and oil pipelines. The plant was reportedly hit in a previous attack in December 2024. 

On the same night, Russian outlets also reported that an oil refinery in Saratov Oblast came under attack. The Kristal Plant, which supplies fuel to the Engels-2 military airfield, was engulfed in flames after a drone strike. Ukraine has targeted the facility in past attacks.

A train derailed in Belgorod Oblast after an explosive device detonated under the tracks, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed. Part of the track was damaged, but there were no casualties, he said.  

In the Russian capital, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed that air defense units repelled 10 drones bound for Moscow. Sobyanin said that emergency services had been dispatched to the sites of the fallen wreckage, but did not disclose information regarding any damage.

Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha reported that five drones were downed over the region, damaging cars. 

In Tula Oblast, air defense units reportedly intercepted two drones. Three people were injured, according to Governor Dmitry Milyaev. 

The reported attacks come the same night that Russia launched another large-scale drone and missile attack against Ukraine. The attack killed four people in Kyiv and caused casualties and damage to cities in western Ukraine, far from the front lines. 

As peace negotiations stall and Russia refuses the accept a ceasefire, the war has escalated. 

Russia intensified aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities in late May, launching some of the heaviest assaults of the full-scale war over three consecutive nights. Less than a week later, Ukraine launched Operation Spiderweb, an audacious mass drone strike that reportedly damaged 41 Russian military planes. 

In the days since, Ukraine has continued to target key Russian military assets, launching strikes against missile bases and the Crimean Bridge. 




          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

“This is a sad day for our democracy and a scary day for millions of people,” said the coalition behind the challenge.

Defenders of Social Security are responding with critical anger to a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday that sides with the Trump administration in a legal battle over access to sensitive data of tens of millions of Americans by the Department of Government Efficiency, the government-eviscerating group first spearheaded by right-wing libertarian and mega-billionaire Elon Musk.

The unsigned emergency order from the court came in response to an emergency application from the Trump administration defending DOGE's ability to have access to Social Security databases that two labor unions, alongside the Alliance for Retired Americans, had file a legal suit to protect. By its ruling, the Supreme Court stayed a lower federal court's ruling that said DOGE must “disgorge” and “delete” any of the data it accessed or downloaded from the agency files.

While the underlying case plays out, DOGE is now authorized to retain the data and access to the information, which critics say cannot be entrusted to the newly-created department and unvetted personnel who control it.

The Supreme Court decision allowing DOGE full, unfettered access to the public's sensitive personal Social Security data is a loss for all of us. No one in history — no commissioner, no president, no one — has ever had the access that these DOGE minions have.

“This is a sad day for our democracy and a scary day for millions of people,” said the coalition behind the challenge in response to the decision. “This ruling will enable President Trump and DOGE's affiliates to steal Americans' private and personal data. Elon Musk may have left Washington, D.C., but his impact continues to harm millions of people. We will continue to use every legal tool at our disposal to keep unelected bureaucrats from misusing the public's most sensitive data as this case moves forward.”

While the majority ruling was unsigned, Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elana Kagan backed what was described as a “blistering” dissent, authored by Jackson, countering the determination and warning against continued access for DOGE while the case makes its way through the lower courts.

“On the one hand, there is a repository of millions of Americans' legally protected, highly sensitive information that — if improperly handled or disseminated — risks causing significant harm,” she wrote. “On the other, there is the government's desire to ditch the usual protocols for accessing that data, before the courts have even determined whether DOGE's access is lawful.”

Max Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, called the majority's ruling “extremely troubling” for a host of reasons.

“We echo the concerns of the minority, as articulated by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, that the decision creates ‘grave privacy risks' by giving DOGE ‘unfettered data access — despite its failure to show any need or any interest in complying with existing privacy safeguards,'” said Richtman. “It is hard to justify the court's action, especially in light of the incompetent, reckless manner in which DOGE has already interfered with the operations of the Social Security Administration, prompting a spike in new Social Security claims by older people who fear the situation will only get worse.”

Devon Ombres, senior director for Courts and Legal Policy at the center-left Center for American Progress, echoed those concerns.

“This action by six far-right justices is an affront to every principle of government transparency and the rule of law. DOGE has shown no need to review every American's personal information, and the high court provides no explanation in granting it access,” said Ombres. “Americans have no way to know how DOGE will use or misuse this information, nor what DOGE is or what it is doing. Shame on the court for rubber-stamping this administration's lawlessness and further undermining the public's trust in government, which President Trump has eroded.”

Citing Musk, who recently left his position at DOGE and has been engaged in a high-profile spat with President Donald Trump in recent days, Richtman said the Tesla and SpaceX founder and world's richest man cannot be trusted, giving the lies he told about Social Security fraud that “undermined people's faith in the system.”

“This hardly inspires confidence that DOGE has either the sense of ethics or public service to be entrusted with Americans' private data, leading us to believe that the court simply is abetting another dangerous power grab by the Executive branch,” said Richtman. “If Americans' personal Social Security data is misused or abused by this administration, the Supreme Court's majority will have been fully complicit.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

“We all collectively have to object to this madness,” said Huerta after his violent arrest for witnessing an ICE raid.

Unions and allies in California and across the United States on Saturday are demanding the immediate release of David Huerta, president of SEIU California and SEIU-United Service Workers West, after the highly regarded labor leader was injured and then arrested while witnessing a raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on Friday.

“SEIU California members call for the immediate release of our President, David Huerta, who was injured and detained at the site of one of today's ICE raids in Los Angeles,” said Tia Orr, executive director of SEIU California, in a statement.

In a later update, the union said Huerta — a veteran labor leader whose union represents over 45,000 janitors, airport workers, security guards, and other property service workers — had been released from the hospital where he received treatment for injuries sustained during his arrest, but that he remained in custody.

The union included remarks from Huerta, who said, “We all collectively have to object to this madness because this is not justice. This is injustice.”

“This is about something much bigger” than his own arrest, said Huerta. “This is about how we as a community stand together and resist the injustice.”

According to a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security, approximately 44 individuals were “administratively arrested” in a series of raids at retail stores in the Los Angeles area, while one individual, identified as Huerta, was arrested “for obstruction” of federal officers.

“This is what fascism looks like,” said California State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat. “Secret police raids. Injuring protesters. Arresting labor leaders.”

U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the chief prosecutor in the Central District of California, claimed in a post on social media, that “federal agents were executing a lawful judicial warrant at a LA worksite this morning when David Huerta deliberately obstructed their access by blocking their vehicle. He was arrested for interfering with federal officers and will face arraignment in federal court on Monday.”

“Let me be clear: I don't care who you are — if you impede federal agents, you will be arrested and prosecuted,” said Essayli. “No one has the right to assault, obstruct, or interfere with federal authorities carrying out their duties.”

A video posted by Essayli alongside his statement appears to show the moment Huerta is pushed over by ICE agents amid a chaotic scene on a sidewalk where officers are clearing an area in front of a gate for an approaching van.

Separate footage from a different angle shows Huerta going down backward due to a forceful push by the officers and landing with his neck and head on a hard concrete curb:

“Today, SEIU-USWW President, my friend, and constituent David Huerta was thrown to the ground, tased, injured and arrested for exercising his First Amendment right to observe and document law enforcement activity,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), who represent areas of Los Angeles. “This isn't just an overreach — it's a nationwide pattern of suppression. We must stand together.”

California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also weighed in. “David Huerta is a respected leader, a patriot, and an advocate for working people,” said Newsom. “No one should ever be harmed for witnessing government action.”

Outrage over Huerta's arrest and ongoing detention, both from the labor union movement and immigrant rights groups, continued to spread on Friday and into Saturday.

“We refuse to stay silent while ICE terrorizes working-class communities,” said the California Federation of Labor Unions (CFLU). “We are turning out and standing united in solidarity with SEIU-California calling on the release of SEIU President David Huerta!”

In a statement, CFLU president Lorena Gonzalez called for “an end to the cruel, destructive, and indiscriminate ICE raids that are tearing apart our communities, disrupting our economies, and hurting all working people. Immigrant workers are essential to our society — feeding our nation, caring for our elders, cleaning our workplaces, and building our homes.”

In a post on social media, SEIU California said: “Let's be clear: ICE injured and detained the president of SEIU California for peacefully observing. ICE picked the wrong side. The wrong state. The wrong person. and the wrong union. David Huerta stood up. And 750,000 SEIU workers are standing with him.”

            Russia bombarded Ukraine's second-largest city with massive strikes in the early hours of Saturday, its mayor said, killing at least three people, one night after Moscow carried out one of the war's largest aerial assaults on Ukraine.
    


            Russia has conducted extensive attacks on Ukraine in recent days, in what is being viewed as retaliation for an audacious drone operation by Kyiv that debilitated more than a third of Moscow's strategic cruise missile carriers.
    


            The northeastern city of Kharkiv – which sits about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Russian border – was shaken by “at least 40 explosions” on Saturday, according to a Telegram post by Mayor Igor Terekhov.
    


            “Kharkiv is currently experiencing the most powerful attack since the start of the full-scale war,” Terekhov said. “The enemy is striking simultaneously with missiles, (drones) and guided aerial bombs. This is outright terror against peaceful Kharkiv.”
    


            Video released by emergency services showed a large fire burning in a multi-story apartment block in the Osnovyanskyi district in the city's southwest, where Terekhov said two people had died. One person was also killed in a strike that hit a house in the Kyivskyi district to the north, he said.
    


            Russia resumed its assault on Saturday evening. It launched a fresh round of strikes using glide bombs, killing another person and injuring 18 others, according to Ukrainian officials. Terekhov said the target of the second attack was a children's playground with a miniature railway.
    


            In response to the earlier assault, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Russia “continues its terror against civilians,” while calling for more pressure to be exerted on Moscow “to put an end to Russia's killing and destruction.”
    


            Russia said that its forces carried out high-precision strikes overnight on Ukrainian military facilities. “The strikes achieved their objectives. All designated targets were destroyed,” the Russian Ministry of Defense posted on Telegram.
    


            More than 50 drones, four guided aerial bombs and a missile were used in the attack which also damaged an administrative building and music school in the city, according to Kharkiv region prosecutor's office.
    


            Among the injured include a 14-year-old girl and a one-and-a-half-month-old boy, who is suffering from “acute stress,” the office added.
    


            Ruslana Sheveleva, a Kharkiv resident whose neighbors' house was struck in the attack, described the chaotic scenes as people scrambled to escape the building. “The house was hit, right where this young man was lying,” she told Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne.
    


            “I don't think he even understood what was happening. He died instantly. They dug his mother out from under the rubble. His father, as I understand it, managed to get out almost on his own,” she added.
    


            Iryna Ivanenko, another resident, said her 26-year-old daughter – who was later rescued by firefighters – begged her for help, trapped in her bedroom under a heavy slab. “I tried to lift the slab, but it was impossible,” Ivanenko told Suspline.
    


            Russian attacks in the country have killed at least seven people and injured more than 40 others since Friday morning, according to a CNN tally of figures from local authorities.
    


            Meanwhile, Russia accused Ukraine on Saturday of postponing the exchange of prisoners of war and transfer of deceased soldiers for an “indefinite” period.
    


            “The Ukrainian side unexpectedly postponed the transfer of bodies and the exchange of prisoners of war for an indefinite period,” Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky posted on Telegram. “For some reason, their negotiating team didn't even show up at the exchange point.”
    


            An agreement to work towards another prisoner swap was reached in Istanbul on Monday during a second round of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials.
    


            Medinsky – the head of Russia's delegation for the talks in Istanbul – claimed Saturday that Moscow had given Ukraine a list of 640 wounded, seriously ill and young prisoners of war to be exchanged.
    


            In addition, Russia has begun the repatriation of more than 6,000 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers, Medinsky said. “The first batch of 1,212 frozen bodies of Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers has already arrived in refrigerated trucks at the exchange point. The rest are on their way,” he said.
    


            Ukraine accused Russia of playing “dirty games.”
    


            “Today's statements by the Russian side do not correspond to reality or to previous agreements on either the exchange of prisoners or the repatriation of bodies,” Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said Saturday.
    


            The authority said that Ukraine has submitted a list of seriously wounded, ill and young servicemen to be exchanged, but claimed that Russia's lists “do not comply with the agreed approach.”
    


            “Ukraine has provided relevant comments, and the next step is now awaited from the Russian side,” the authority said.
    


            Commenting on the repatriation of soldiers' bodies, the authority said that “an agreement has indeed been reached,” but added that no date has been set for the transfer to take place.
    


            Several swaps have taken place between the two sides despite the ongoing conflict.
    

Ukraine's drone attack against Russian airfields on Sunday was audacious and daring. But most of all, it was meticulously planned and executed flawlessly against Russia. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh explains how the attack unfolded.

            Also on Saturday, Ukraine's air force said that it had shot down a Russian Su35 fighter jet as part of a “successful Air Force operation in the Kursk direction.”
    


            Russia did not immediately comment on the claim, but a Russian military blogger described the plane as lost and said that the pilot had been rescued.
    


            A day before the assualt on Kharkiv, in an apparent retaliation to Ukraine's drone swarm, Russia launched a barrage of drones and ballistic missiles across broad swaths of Ukraine, killing at least six people and injuring dozens of others.
    


            “They gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night,” US President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One late on Friday.
    


            Trump had earlier warned Russian retaliation was imminent, after speaking with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.
    


            It was not immediately clear if Putin intends further escalation.

White House rhetoric dehumanizes disabled communities, but activists continue to organize for access, care and justice.

The article below is an adapted excerpt from the introduction of How to Be Disabled in a Pandemic, an anthology recently published by NYU Press that chronicles experiences of ableism and diverse disability activism in New York City (and beyond) during the first four years of the COVID-19 pandemic. The anthology's authors are a collective of disabled, chronically ill, neurodivergent, and nondisabled scholars, students, activists, lawyers, journalists, artists and librarians.

Disabled people hold immense expertise in navigating both chronic illnesses and moments of crisis. And yet, despite all the public reflections on “lessons learned” at the five-year anniversary of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic — from which hundreds of people in the U.S. are still dying each week — disabled people find themselves under increasing attack by the Trump administration.

Government rhetoric about disability, from White House policy memoranda to social media posts, dehumanizes disabled communities, characterizing people as “burdens” and “threats” to the nation, and prompting new fears about institutionalization. Perhaps most urgently, Medicaid, Social Security and Section 504 accommodations — and possibly even the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act — are at serious risk of defunding and dismantling, among other fragile elements of the social safety net.

Additionally, noted vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been installed as secretary of Health and Human Services, abruptly changing vaccine recommendations (including no longer recommending COVID-19 vaccines for children or pregnant people, and other policies that could limit vaccine access), and threatening the likelihood of new global infectious disease outbreaks. Elon Musk's “Department of Government Efficiency” has attempted to dismantle entire agencies like USAID, laid off experts at federal agencies, and removed crucial data and agency websites. And federal grant programs, including the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation (NSF), have been slashed, with a prohibition on terms related to diversity, equity and inclusion — including “disability” and “accessibility” — imposed on remaining funds, cutting urgent funding for infectious disease and public health research (including social science research, like that for this book, which was funded by the NSF).

These are only the tip of the iceberg: Disabled people, their families, allies and service providers are particularly affected by these attacks. (Plus, it should be noted, Democrats are not off the hook, as many activists have critiqued premature rollbacks of COVID-19 resources, as well as recent attempts by politicians like New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to implement a mask ban.) And, of course, disabled people are also uniquely affected by other inhumane policies, including attacks on migrants and trans people, unpredictable tariffs and foreign policy.

In this context, while the facts on the ground documented in How to Be Disabled in a Pandemic about the earliest days of COVID-19 may have shifted, the book's key takeaways — especially that pandemic social movements must be rooted in disability justice — are more timely than ever.

A dialectic of risk and resistance has played out in many different arenas of public life and discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as disabled people contest institutions and policies that are both overtly and more insidiously ableist. Among those who survived, among those with means, amid networks of mutual support and care, and among disabled artists, many demonstrated time and again that, in the words of Neil Marcus, “disability is an ingenious way to live.” In documenting moments of struggle, insight and improvisation, however, we resist the impulse to romanticize precarity.

When Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky, a top public health leader in the U.S., apparently claimed that it was “encouraging news” that the majority of COVID-19 deaths were among those “who were unwell to begin with,” it prompted massive protest. #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy, a hashtag launched by Imani Barbarin in January 2022, directly countered Walensky's comments and reasserted the value of disabled life. #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy sparked wide-ranging conversations about neo-eugenics in government policies, and within a week, on January 14, Walensky met remotely with a group of disability activists to apologize for her comment, promising regular meetings going forward. Despite this seeming win, these regular meetings did not happen, and biases in public health policy effectively became self-fulfilling prophecies, requiring an ongoing, iterative series of protests.

Ableist sentiments were further translated into a range of policies that directly threatened many disabled people's health and ability to participate in public life. One major form of injustice that emerged in spring 2020 centered around medical triaging and the rationing of lifesaving treatments that deprioritized or outright denied care to people with a variety of disabilities, judging that their lives were “too expensive” or “lost causes.” For example, a 2021 report by the National Council on Disability found that “people with intellectual or developmental disabilities, and medically fragile and technology dependent individuals, faced a high risk of being triaged out of COVID-19 treatment when hospital beds, supplies, and personnel were scarce.” In the earliest days of the pandemic, access to ventilators was notably limited, leading to state- and hospital-based rationing proposals for withholding or withdrawing lifesaving equipment from certain groups of disabled people.

Similarly, when vaccines became available to select groups, many disabled people who were at increased risk were nonetheless not included on the initial lists for priority access in New York State, as only a limited number of “comorbidities” were considered. Unsurprisingly, people whose conditions were not listed protested their longer waits, while activists in other states contested policies that failed to recognize disabled people at all. The pandemic underscored the endemic ableism of health care allocation and the stark irony that those who need care the most often cannot access or afford it in the highly stratified privatized U.S. health system. At the same time, as supply chains faltered at different moments, disabled authors shared their unsentimental expertise about how to self-ration when unable to access or afford drugs and medical supplies, offering advice about things like sharing insulin and other hormones or crowdsourcing catheters.

Disabled people have organized creatively against any number of structural and legal barriers to health care, education and information, transforming architecture, city streets and digital media in the process. During the pandemic, activists were pleased to see expanded options for telemedicine, for which they had long been advocating (and which was temporarily expanded by Medicare and most private insurance under pandemic emergency orders). Yet they also expressed frustration at seeing “ableds accommodating themselves with the accessibility … disabled people fight for every day,” exemplified by the hashtag #AccessibilityForAbleds. The pandemic revealed just how easy it could be to provide certain accommodations — such as remote access to work, school and therapy — that disabled and chronically ill people had been demanding, unsuccessfully, for years.

With the prioritization of urgent COVID-19-related care, necessary in-person appointments were frequently delayed or canceled as medical resources were reconfigured or facilities deemed too risky. Moreover, as care professionals, especially at-home care workers, became ill, refused vaccines or left the profession, many disabled people found it increasingly difficult to receive basic services; the National Council on Disability notes that this left “some at risk of losing their independence or being institutionalized.”

This complex situation highlights the overlapping precarities of the pandemic: The majority of nursing assistants and home care and direct care workers are women of color, who earn less than white men and who also experienced higher rates of death than average from COVID-19. Under these seemingly impossible conditions, disabled people and their families demonstrated “ingenuity and creativity … to make home accessible” using a range of improvised hacks. Laura Mauldin documents these in her research on “disability at home,” accompanied by a photo website where people share images and stories of how they have created access on their own.

Many blind and Deaf people also faced specific barriers to information and treatment for COVID-19 as a result of inaccessible websites, the limited availability of captioning and interpreters, or a lack of materials in Braille and other accessible formats. For instance, many forms of COVID testing have been inaccessible to blind people, from drive-through testing sites to home tests that rely on visual instructions and displays. Some apps, such as Be My Eyes, founded by the visually impaired inventor Hans Jørgen Wiberg, have allowed blind people to video call sighted people for assistance with visual tasks such as reading rapid test results. Frustrated by the slowness and potential COVID exposure of in-person testing sites, Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), wrote to President Biden on January 3, 2022, on behalf of the thousands of NFB members to demand that the free COVID tests provided by the federal government include versions accessible to blind people. He followed up with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner shortly after, requesting that kit instructions on the FDA site be posted as accessible PDFs. In response, in June, the U.S. Postal Service temporarily provided what it called “more-accessible” COVID tests, although these versions still required a smartphone and navigation of the Ellume app (not created for blind people) to hear audio instructions and results.

As with any dialectic, experiences of disability during the pandemic were hardly defined strictly by either vulnerability or creativity; instead, disabled communities often directly wrestled with this sort of binary thinking, challenging each other to embrace complexity. The pandemic also raised numerous instances of what disability scholars describe as “access friction,” in which actions that increase access for some may limit or hinder access for others.

For example, while masking in public spaces has been a key mitigation strategy, particularly important for immunocompromised people, most masks are opaque and muffle sound, which can pose a barrier for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, especially when reading lips. Similarly, while options for remote work, schooling and socializing provided welcome enhancements for those who had long been advocating for such access strategies, for many disabled students — among other groups — remote participation both exacerbated existing inequities and instigated new ones.

While the disability dialectic suggests resistance and creative response by those who are immediately experiencing conditions of inequality and abandonment, many of the chapters in How to Be Disabled in a Pandemic foreground instead cross-disability aid and illness coalitions, what the late disability rights activist Stacey Park Milbern has named “crip doulaing.” In conversation with Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha shortly before the start of the pandemic, Milbern underscored the urgency of “disability doulaship”:

I see a lot of disabled people of color doing a ton of work in supporting people rebirthing themselves as disabled (or more disabled). This looks like a lot of things—maybe learning how to get medicine, drive a wheelchair, hire attendants, change a diet, date, have sex, make requests, code switch, live with an intellectual disability, go off meds, etc. etc…. I feel like society not having language to describe this transition or the support it requires speaks to the ableism and isolation people with disabilities face in our lives.… Without crip intervention, we are frequently left alone to figure out how to be in our bodyminds and in this ableist world.

In parallel, the What Would an HIV Doula Do? Collective members invoked the history and importance of illness doulas in their zine “What Does a COVID-19 Doula Do?“

Networks like Sick in Quarters (SiQ), launched in 2020, hosted smaller community-building workshops online, including virtual “right to mourn” spaces and listening session “hideaways.” SiQ describes its online meetups as a “container for collective mourning, the kind of pain and alienation that was already familiar to disabled and immunocompromised lives.” These projects thus highlight the importance of grief not only as an individual effect but also as a collective and political process in responding to the pandemic and forging intersectional solidarities.

Vice-president was interviewed by comedian Theo Von, who also asked him if he ‘got high' on election night

JD Vance said Elon Musk was making a “huge mistake” going after Donald Trump in a storm of bitter and inflammatory social media posts after a falling-out between the two men.

But the vice-president, in an interview released on Friday after the very public blowup between the world's richest person and arguably the world's most powerful, also tried to downplay Musk's blistering attacks as an “emotional guy” who got frustrated.

“I hope that eventually Elon comes back into the fold. Maybe that's not possible now because he's gone so nuclear,” Vance said.

Vance's comments come as other Republicans in recent days have urged the two men, who months ago were close allies spending significant time together, to mend fences.

Musk's torrent of social media posts attacking Trump came as the president portrayed him as disgruntled and “CRAZY” and threatened to cut the government contracts held by his businesses.

Musk, who runs electric vehicle maker Tesla, internet company Starlink and rocket company SpaceX, lambasted Trump's centerpiece tax cuts and spending bill but also suggested the president should be impeached and claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

“Look, it happens to everybody,” Vance said in the interview. “I've flown off the handle way worse than Elon Musk did in the last 24 hours.”

Vance made the comments in an interview with “manosphere” comedian Theo Von, who last month joked about snorting drugs off a mixed-race baby and the sexuality of men in the US navy when he opened for Trump at a military base in Qatar.

The vice-president told Von that as Musk for days was calling on social media for Congress to kill Trump's “big, beautiful bill”, the president was “getting a little frustrated, feeling like some of the criticisms were unfair coming from Elon, but I think has been very restrained because the president doesn't think that he needs to be in a blood feud with Elon Musk”.

“I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine,” he added.

Musk appeared by Saturday morning to have deleted his posts about Epstein.

The interview was taped on Thursday as Musk's posts were unfurling on X, the social media network the billionaire owns.

During the interview, Von showed the vice-president Musk's claim that Trump's administration hasn't released all the records related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein because Trump is mentioned in them.

Vance responded to that, saying: “Absolutely not. Donald Trump didn't do anything wrong with Jeffrey Epstein.”

“This stuff is just not helpful,” Vance said in response to another post shared by Musk calling for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vance.

“It's totally insane. The president is doing a good job.”

Vance called Musk an “incredible entrepreneur”, and said that Musk's “department of government efficiency”, which sought to cut government spending and laid off or pushed out thousands of workers, was “really good”.

The vice-president also defended the bill that has drawn Musk's ire, and said its central goal was not to cut spending but to extend the 2017 tax cuts approved in Trump's first term.

The bill would slash spending but also leave about 10.9 million more people without health insurance and increase debt by $2.4tn over the decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Musk has warned that the bill will increase the federal debt and called it a “disgusting abomination”.

“It's a good bill,” Vance said. “It's not a perfect bill.”

He also said it was ridiculous for some House Republicans who voted for the bill but later objected to some parts and claim they hadn't had time to read it.

Vance said the text had been available for weeks and said: “The idea that people haven't had an opportunity to actually read it is ridiculous.”

Elsewhere in the interview, Vance laughed as Von cracked jokes about famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass's sexuality.

“We're gonna talk to the Smithsonian about putting up an exhibit on that,” Vance joked. “And Theo Von, you can be the narrator for this new understanding of the history of Frederick Douglass.”

The podcaster also asked the vice-president if he “got high” on election night to celebrate Trump's victory.

Vance laughed and joked that he wouldn't admit it if he did.

“I did not get high,” he then said. “I did have a fair amount to drink that night.”

The interview was taped in Nashville at a restaurant owned by musician Kid Rock, a Trump ally.

Activists converged on Anderson, Indiana, to demand the release of two Black men who stood up to racist prison guards.

An upcoming clemency hearing will determine the near-term fate of Christopher “Naeem” Trotter, a political prisoner who has been held captive for over 40 years as punishment for a spontaneous act of community self-defense inside prison walls.

On February 1, 1985, Trotter and another incarcerated man — John “Balagoon” Cole — led a rebellion within the prison now known as Pendleton Correctional Facility to protect a fellow prisoner, Lincoln “Lokmar” Love, who was being attacked with nightsticks by Indiana Department of Corrections prison guards. As Hammer and Hope recounts:

According to Trotter and Cole, they fought several prison guards in self-defense and to protect Love from further beatings. To avoid being attacked themselves, they took two guards and a prison counselor hostage and negotiated with the prison. The hostages were released unharmed. No one died. Trotter was sentenced to an additional 142 years and Cole to an additional 84 years. 

Trotter and Cole are now known as the “Pendleton 2,” and people nationwide have rallied in their defense.

Another prison guard later testified that the guards who attacked Love were members of the Sons of Light, an offshoot organization of the Ku Klux Klan. The fact that they continued to bring their truncheons down on Love's head after having already subdued him is an undisputed fact of the case.

For people incarcerated alongside Love, the memories of the attack cut deep. The blood spilled that day has never really been stanched according to Rodney “Big R” Jones, who witnessed the prison guards' attack from the cell across from Love's.

Just days before our interview, Jones had a pacemaker implanted. Nonetheless, he exerted himself to share his memory of the 1985 attack and uprising, even though actively recalling those events takes its toll. He is no longer in prison, but the effects of witnessing the guards' brutality against his neighbor, which are traumatic, are knitted with memory.

“Every time I talk about my life on that day, it's like I'm looking at it,” Jones told Truthout. He said he saw the guards, whom he calls “soldiers,” rush Love with their “sticks,” and he recounted seeing the blood gushing out of Love's head where they'd split his skull.

“I had tears in my eyes,” he said. “I was yelling at them to ‘give me some of that' just to get them off of him. They had his hands behind his back. ‘Why you keep beating that man like that with your sticks, even if he moves a little bit?' He was like Rodney King moving a little bit, trying to get out of the way of all those hits.”

In the ensuing years he's spoken on the phone with Trotter and Cole a couple of times, the men he credits with saving Love's life. “We took their kin back down there to visit them. But, no, no way, I never went back inside,” he said.

On June 1, 2025, dozens of people came to Anderson, Indiana, in defense of Trotter and Cole. Those who answered the rallying call to uplift the sacrifices of the Pendleton 2 came from Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, California, Illinois, and beyond. The out-of-towners joined with Jones and dozens of Indianans at the government center in Anderson, the county seat of Madison County, to demonstrate that eyes beyond the state line are trained on local prosecutors, judges, and the clemency process as a whole, in advance of the parole board's meeting on June 10 to consider Trotter's clemency application.

National awareness has been roused in part by the 2023 release of They Stood Up, a documentary film that tells the mortifying story of what befell the Pendleton 2 after rescuing Love. There were months of routine assaults, months of being fully fettered (shackled by both hands and feet) and decades somehow surviving in solitary confinement. Too Black, one of the documentary's co-directors and a member of the Pendleton 2 Defense Committee that formed in 2022, told the crowd, “We're here because we want to save two human lives that the state is hell-bent on ending and exterminating in a quiet hole all by themselves because of what they inspire in us. Because what they inspire in us is heroism.”

When the guards attacked Trotter and Cole, they fought back, which led to the hostage situation, Too Black recounted. “But no one died,” he said. “Yet still they got 200 years for it.”

The defense committee is pulling out all the stops ahead of the June 10 hearing, including most urgently asking for signatories to a letter of support.

Another defense committee member told Truthout they're looking to American Indian Movement (AIM) political prisoner Leonard Peltier's recent release as a paradigm for their campaign, which like Peltier's has to overcome entrenched institutional vindictiveness.

Just weeks ago, the five-year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd thrust renewed questions about bystanders intervening to stop acts of state violence while they're in process into the zeitgeist. In the film, Cole speaks about the anguish of the eyewitnesses who were not prepared to disrupt Derek Chauvin's slow suffocation of Floyd, a heartache he didn't have to suffer. Trotter declared himself in They Stood Up: “If I can be convicted for standing up and saving a person's life, then convict me. But I know it was morally the right thing to do. And I will continue to fight, and I ask that you fight with me.”

Given these confluences so alive in the moment and the imminence of the clemency hearing, the defense committee decided it was finally time to bring the fight to ground zero.

“This is the county where this happened, and I think that's the part we really need to stress,” Too Black told the rally. “We've done actions in the capital, we've shown the documentary across the world, but we've never really brought it here. But we've got to bring it here, because this is the place where they'll be released.”

Tamie Dixon-Tatum, an Anderson city employee, told Truthout she would have gone to the rally even if she weren't the director of the municipality's Civil and Human Rights Department.

Another prison guard later testified that the guards who attacked Love were members of the Sons of Light, an offshoot organization of the Ku Klux Klan.

“These gentlemen have been in prison for over 40 something years, and you know, they were trying to stand up to protect another gentleman, and that gentleman was being harmed in such a way. And so they literally put themselves, their lives on the line, to help someone else,” she said.

“Everybody in this picture is human,” Dixon-Tatum said. Yet she's concerned that there are bad actors working as guards and wardens who remain part of the picture. “Some of them were punished and removed from the prison system. Some of them are probably still there,” she said. “So, yeah, it's scary.”

Michelle Smith, executive director of Missouri Justice Coalition, told Truthout she travelled from St. Louis to stand with the Pendleton 2 because the reality for Black men behind bars in Missouri is also very scary. Since 2023, her organization has been supporting the family of Othel Moore in the aftermath of his death. Moore was a Black man in a Missouri Department of Corrections prison who was assaulted by guards in a secure location where no fellow incarcerated people could possibly come to his aid.

“Othel was beaten severely with billy clubs, and then they restrained him, and they maced him in the face,” Smith said. “So he was subdued, he was shackled, and then they put a spit hood over his head, and he suffocated to death. And that is very similar to what happened with the Pendleton 2 case, or would have happened, if Cole and Trotter hadn't stopped the guards. Because of that they saved Love's life.”

Indiana is very similar to Missouri, Smith said, in terms of how anti-Black racism operates inside and outside of its prisons.

“Indiana's a Klan state. In Missouri, it's Proud Boys and Oath Keepers,” she said. “Plenty of times I've been on the phone with men on the inside and heard the guards calling them the N-word. Are we tired of these injustices? Of course we are. So even from two states away, we're going to keep on fighting and advocating for these two men to come home,” she said.

Representatives from the Atlanta-based National Black Food & Justice Alliance told Truthout that they came to the rally for the Pendleton 2 because both the food system and the legal system are designed to uphold white supremacy. Their organization's analysis is that police brutality, police violence, and the criminal legal system are all inherently violent in the same ways that the food system is, arguing that they are designed to kill Black people.

Underscoring that reality, Love never received any grace from the system that had dehumanized and brutalized him. He died from COVID in 2020, still captive, 1 of 143 people to succumb to the virus in Indiana prisons that year. Incarcerated Indianans died at a rate even higher than the coronavirus-skewed national average, researchers found.

Erica Caines, from the Baltimore chapter of Black Alliance for Peace, told Truthout she'd traveled to Anderson, Indiana, as part of her organization's commitment to freeing political prisoners because “of our understanding that resistance breeds repression.” She likened the Pendleton 2 to journalist Mumia Abu Jamal, Black Panther Party member Jamil Al-Amin (formerly known as H. Rap Brown), and AIM member Leonard Peltier — all longtime captives of the state whose liberation Black Alliance for Peace has struggled for.

The defense committee is pulling out all the stops ahead of the June 10 hearing, including most urgently asking for signatories to a letter of support.

“In any war, you go and get your people back,” Caines said. “You negotiate for your people.”

There's a discipline involved in being part of a Black anti-imperialist, internationalist organization whose focus is to bring back the Black radical peace perspective, she explained.

“What's embodied by Balagoon and Naeem is the self-determination, the self- defense aspects we call for,” Caines told Truthout. “What does it mean to forge your own way with your back against the wall, when you know you can almost touch freedom, but you will risk it all for your person?”

At the time of the rebellion, Trotter only had three months remaining of his already onerous four-year sentence.

“That's the emphasis for our being out here,” Caines said. “We thought it important to show Anderson that these men have our support.” And, she added, “We can bring more people back if need be.”

Anderson city employee Dixon-Tatum sees a chance for the Indiana Department of Corrections to repair past wrongs.

“I want to say that Madison County is a place where hope still lives,” she said. “There were some bad officers, and people like to say ‘allegedly,' but it's actually been proven at this point. This is about doing right.”

MOSCOW, June 7. /TASS/. Ukraine has unexpectedly moved to indefinitely postpone the acceptance of bodies and the exchange of prisoners of war, Russian Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, who heads Moscow's delegation to talks with Kiev, said. According to Lieutenant General Alexander Zorin, spokesman for the Russian negotiating team, Ukraine is currently refraining from setting a date.

TASS has gathered the key information on the issue.

- Medinsky pointed out that on June 6, in strict accordance with the Istanbul agreements, Russia unilaterally began a humanitarian operation to transfer the bodies of over 6,000 Ukrainian service members to Ukraine.

- Russia also launched the process of exchanging wounded and seriously ill prisoners of war and prisoners of war under the age of 25.

- Zorin specified that a convoy carrying the first batch of 1,212 bodies had arrived at the exchange point.

- Another three trains, each carrying 1,200 bodies, and a motor convoy, also carrying 1,200 bodies, will be dispatched soon. The total number of bodies will exceed 6,000.

- Russia has handed the first list of 640 wounded, seriously ill and young prisoners over to Ukraine in order to begin the exchange process.

- The Russian Defense Ministry's contact group is currently on the border with Ukraine.

- Medinsky noted that "Ukraine, however, unexpectedly moved to indefinitely postpone both the acceptance of bodies and the prisoner swap."

- Ukraine's negotiating team for some reason failed to arrive at the exchange point, providing various reasons, including rather strange ones, the Russian presidential aide added.

- According to Zorin, Ukraine is refraining from setting a date when these people will return home and the same number of Russian prisoners of war will be handed over to Russia.

- Moscow urges Kiev to strictly adhere to the schedule and immediately proceed with the exchange, Medinsky emphasized.

- According to the Russian presidential aide, international broadcasters, news agencies and correspondents can come and see for themselves that this is where things stand.

- Zorin confirmed that Russia was completely ready to implement the Istanbul agreements, handing the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers over to Kiev and carrying out a prisoner exchange based on the agreed formula.

Once a temple of accessible opulence, the 1930s institution hovered above the city as a reminder of the finer things

The ninth-floor restaurant in the Montreal Eaton Centre harkens back to the heyday of Canadian department stores, when every city's downtown was anchored by one.ROGER LEMOYNE/The Globe and Mail

When the debonair neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield wanted to treat his wife to a nice meal in 1930s Montreal, he knew just where to take her. 

“Welcome home girl,” he wrote in one letter. “I'd like to have lunch with you at Eaton's.”

The Penfields were not planning to dine at a food court Manchu Wok, ordering something fried and served on a plastic tray under fluorescent lighting. 

No, this was the golden era of Canadian department stores, when palaces of commerce served up a vision of the good life to the nation's middle class. In Montreal's jazz age heyday, the ninth-floor restaurant of Eaton's was the epitome of class, an Art Deco marvel with white tablecloths and escargots on the menu. 

It was arguably the most spectacular restaurant that Lady Flora Eaton championed. She had been inspired by a memorable trip on the trans-Atlantic liner Île de France and hired the French architect Jacques Carlu to design a space that felt like a cruise ship for the masses. 

The dining room, sitting more than 500 guests, was a temple of accessible opulence where store employees ate roast beef for lunch alongside groups of society matrons. From its opening in 1931 until its closing in 1999, it was a cherished Montreal institution that hovered above the city as a reminder of the finer things. 

Then, for 25 years, it was mothballed. Quebec language laws had already deprived the store of its anglophone apostrophe, and some of its English-speaking clientele, but Eaton now became a casualty of the whole retail empire's bankruptcy. Once a nation-bestriding behemoth that employed tens of thousands of people and insinuated its catalogue into every corner of Canadian life, Eaton's was now sold for parts. 

But last spring, something unexpected happened: The ninth-floor restaurant reopened. As department stores collapse all over North America, especially Canada's venerable Hudson's Bay Company this spring, a group of developers and restaurateurs have made a bet on reviving their glory days in one elegant cocoon amidst the Montreal skyline. Le 9e, as it's now known, is a bittersweet reminder of the bygone era of democratic luxury that these stores embodied. 

Men had their private clubs, and department store restaurants played a similar role for upper-middle-class women, history professor Donica Belisle says.ROGER LEMOYNE/The Globe and Mail

When ground broke on the flagship Eaton's store in 1920s Montreal, Canadian department stores were at the height of their clout. The economy was booming, customers hadn't started migrating to the suburbs yet, and five-and-dime stores weren't chipping away at their fat margins. 

Every Canadian city's downtown was anchored by a Simpson's, a Morgan's or, more often than not, an Eaton's. Canada's dominant retailer would soon become its third largest employer, after the government and the railways; it was the eighth largest retailer in the world, said Donica Belisle, a history professor at the University of Regina. 

Lady Eaton, the driven wife of the owner, funnelled her energies into establishing a series of top-of-the-line restaurants at the family's stores. Art Deco was in the air after a landmark Paris exposition and came to Montreal earlier than most North American cities because of its cultural ties to France. 

Inside the final days of Hudson's Bay

The bombastic mayor Camillien Houde was building a series of public works to combat the Great Depression, many of them marked by the angular lines and decorative whimsy of the era's most distinctive architectural style. 

The ninth-floor restaurant of Eaton's would become one of the city's Art Deco masterpieces. With a soaring nave, haute relief plaster panels of Canada's natural bounty, luminescent alabaster urns, Monel grillwork and Belgian black limestone, the dining room felt more like a cathedral than a cafeteria.

The soaring Amazonian murals painted by Natacha Carlu, the architect's wife, signalled that this was in many ways a female space. Men had their private clubs, and department store restaurants played a similar role for upper-middle-class women, allowing volunteer groups to host fundraisers and social teas, said Prof. Belisle. 

Architect Georges Drolet, who was part of the preservation effort, helped revive Le 9e for its new era.ROGER LEMOYNE/The Globe and Mail

That did not mean the venue was equally open to all women. Eaton's was known to discriminate against just about anyone who wasn't an English-speaking Protestant. In Montreal, this took the form of snubbing French-speaking clients – a slight that many Quebeckers still remember today. 

The restaurant was also influenced by the Eaton family's strict Methodism through the absence of alcohol on its menu. It would remain a dry institution into the 1980s, said Sandra Cohen-Rose, author of Northern Deco: Art Deco Architecture in Montreal, who is now working on a book about the restaurant. 

Despite its quirks, this astonishing space floating high above the city came to occupy a special place in the collective consciousness. 

“It was exotic; it was unlike anything you went to in Montreal,” said Ms. Cohen-Rose. “It had a sacred feel.” 

The city mourned when the restaurant closed in 1999, dragged down by the Eaton's bankruptcy. The province quickly gave the space heritage protection and the building's new owner, Ivanhoé Cambridge – the real estate arms of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec – hired an architect to perform a preservation study. Plans came and went for reviving the iconic ninth floor, but nothing stuck.

Finally, in 2023, the announcement arrived: a group of businesspeople would revive it as a restaurant. They hired Derek Dammann, former owner of gastropub Maison Publique, as culinary director. The architect Georges Drolet, who had been connected to the preservation effort from the beginning, began nursing Le 9e back to life. 

There was a lot of dust to clear, and other challenges: The swirling Brèche d'Escalette marble in the entryway isn't quarried any more, and a couple panes of decorative frosted glass had to be reproduced. 

But much of what was opened to the public in May, 2024, was original to 1931. Somehow, it doesn't feel like a museum piece. The Île-de-France restaurant is located in a foyer that once housed the tearoom, a more intimate space that also has magnificent views of downtown. The kitchen serves excellent modern versions of classic French brasserie fare. (The steak frites and martini are a potent combination.) The dining room always seems to be packed, even on bog standard weekdays. 

When my book about Wilder Penfield and his career as a brain mapper was published in May, there was only one place for me and my wife to go for a celebratory lunch: chez Eaton.

Carla Hayden, first woman and African American to serve in role, details firing by Trump administration to CBS

The first woman and African American to serve as the US librarian of Congress before Donald Trump fired her in May has not heard from the president's administration beyond the 31-word email it sent her with word of her dismissal, she has revealed in her first interview since her ouster.

“No one has talked to me directly at all from the White House,” Carla Hayden says in an interview airing on the upcoming CBS News Sunday Morning. “I've received no communication directly, except for that one email.

“That's the only communication.”

Hayden's comments to the CBS national correspondent Robert Costa provide a first-hand glimpse at the unceremonious way she was fired from a post to which the US Senate confirmed her in 2016.

She had been thrust under political pressure by a conservative advocacy group that had pledged to drive out anyone deemed to be standing in the way of the Trump White House's rightwing agenda. That organization, the American Accountability Foundation (AAF), leveled accusations against Hayden and other library leaders that they had promoted children's books with “radical content” as well as literature by opponents of the president.

Hayden then received an email on 8 May that read: “Carla, on behalf of President Donald J Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as the Librarian of Congress is terminated effective immediately. Thank you for your service.”

Asked by Acosta whether her tenure really ended “with one missive that's electronic”, Hayden replied: “That was it.”

She also remarked: “I was never notified beforehand and after.”

Hayden is one of numerous federal government officials whom Trump has dismissed upon having been convinced that they were not aligned with his second presidency's plans. Just hours before her firing became public, the AAF used its X account to insult her as “woke” and “anti-Trump”.

“It's time to get her OUT,” the AAF also said on X, in part.

Congressional Democrats reacted with fury to Hayden's termination. New York's Chuck Schumer, the top US Senate Democrat, said Hayden was a “trailblazer, a scholar and a public servant of the highest order”.

The New York representative Joseph Morelle, the highest-ranking Democrat on the US House's administration committee, called Hayden “an American hero”.

“Hayden has spent her entire career serving people – from helping kids learn to read to protecting some of our nation's most precious treasures,” said Morelle, whose committee oversees the congressional library.

The Library of Congress sits across from the US Capitol in Washington DC. It holds a vast collection of the US's books and history, making it available to federal lawmakers as well as the public.

It archives the papers of presidents and supreme court justices and has collections of rare books, images, music and artifacts.

In 2022, Hayden arranged for the singer Lizzo to play one of those artifacts: a flute owned by James Madison, who was US president from 1809 to 1817.

The Base is emerging from shadows and ramping up its ranks as White House turns blind eye to the far right

An international neo-Nazi terrorist organization is boldly continuing to build in the US and planning a new paramilitary training event without fear of local authorities or the FBI, which once dismantled it in a nationwide effort.

The Base, founded in 2018 by a former Pentagon contractor living in Russia and now suspected of Kremlin-sponsored espionage, once boasted close to 50 stateside members before the bureau made more than a dozen arrests in a years-long counter-terrorism operation.

But since the presidential election campaign last year and what many then believed to be a surefire victory for Donald Trump, the Base saw an opportunity in a potential administration uninterested in policing white supremacy and went about ramping up its ranks.

Now, the Base has a presence in Ukraine, performing sabotage operations inside the country against the embattled government, and new and dangerous cells emerging across Europe, and it appears to be growing in the US, where the FBI under the Maga acolyte Kash Patel has signalled it isn't prioritizing investigations of far-right extremism.

In its early history, part of what first piqued the interest of authorities was the Base's courting of military veterans who could help drill its foot soldiers in a series of training camps across the US. Eventually implicated in an assassination plot, mass shootings and other actions in Europe, the Base went so far as to have a fortified compound and cell in Michigan, led by a US army dropout.

Online evidence from its various accounts, several of which live on Russian servers to avoid censorship on American sites, shows the Base has real plans for a national gathering this summer where members intend to train in paramilitary drills as in years past.

“The Base in [the] USA is preparing for an upcoming national training event,” reads one of its recent posts soliciting crypto donations. “This one might be our most attended training event in [the] USA in a while. We could really use some financial support to help our members with travel expenses.”

The post continued: “When you donate money to the Base, you're investing in a White Defense Force that's aiming to protect white people from political persecution and physical destruction.”

The Base then published a new photo of armed members claiming to be in the midwest, which follows a trend in 2025 of the group bragging about its unafraid American presence. As a sort of taunt to its enemies, on the day of Trump's inauguration the Base released a photo of four members somewhere in Appalachia, in what was the largest number of American members in one photo in over a year.

“The upcoming national training event indicates that the group is seeking to grow and is willing to take the risk of advertising it publicly in advance,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, an analyst of far-right terrorism who has been following the Base's movements for close to a decade. “The Base appears to be actively seeking to grow in the US.”

Fisher-Birch notes that even if the gathering involves “fewer than 20 people”, it is by no means “low profile” and suggests the group sees momentum is on its side.

“An event entails planning, coordination, travel and face-to-face meetings between different regional groups, indicating that they operate in an environment where they view the potential amount of risk as acceptable,” he said. “The group has previously stated multiple times that being a member or training with them is a risky endeavor; however, planning a meetup, which they will inevitably use for propaganda purposes, is a different approach than even a year ago, when the group advertised regional activities.”

In response to queries about the Base's latest movements, the FBI told the Guardian that it only investigates people who have or are planning to commit a federal crime and pose “a threat to national security”.

“Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on criminal activity,” said a spokesperson for the FBI. “Membership in groups is not illegal in and of itself and is protected by the first amendment.”

But in Michigan and in Georgia, members of the Base were charged with their criminal associations to the group.

The Trump administration's security posture on the far right is to downplay its significance. Yet experts unanimously agree: it is the top domestic terrorism threat facing the country. Instead, Patel, the FBI's director, has gone about removing agents from pursuing the far right, while one of Trump's first actions in his second term was to provide unconditional pardons, en masse, to all of the January 6 insurrectionists.

Fisher-Birch also pointed out that the Base had taken itself more seriously and upped its activities in Ukraine to the tune of calling for the murder of government officials and acts of sabotage – with the clearly stated goal of forming a white ethnostate in the west of the country. Already, the Ukrainian cell has uploaded geolocated videos of some of these attacks, one showing the burning of a military vehicle and what looks like a government electrical box.

In a video released on a Russian video-sharing site in mid-May, Rinaldo Nazzaro, the founder and leader of the Base, who is living in St Petersburg, released a video describing the importance of new training videos proving to potential recruits that his group is not just online, but in the real world.

“It's propaganda through actions, not just words,” he said.

It isn't clear where the paramilitary training will take place, but Nazzaro is known to have purchased land in the Pacific north-west that he intended to use as a headquarters for the Base and its activities.

Ukraine shot down a Russian Su-35 fighter jet in Russia's Kursk Oblast on the morning of June 7, the Air Force reported. 

Although no details of the operation were disclosed, the downing brings the total number of Russian aircraft destroyed since the start of the full-scale invasion to 414, according to Ukraine's General Staff. 

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II.  

Reinforced by North Korean troops, Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha.

The downing of the Su-35 fighter jet also adds to the losses Ukraine has inflicted on the Russian Air Force over the past week.

On June 1, Ukraine launched its Operation Spiderweb, conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), reportedly hitting 41 Russian bomber planes and other aircraft. According to Kyiv, Ukraine inflicted $7 billion in damage and disabled over a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet. 

The Kyiv Independent could not independently confirm the number of planes allegedly damaged and destroyed by the SBU. At least 21 planes were damaged or destroyed, according to open-source intelligence analysts. 

The SBU said 117 drones, launched from concealed trucks positioned across Russian territory, simultaneously struck airfields in at least four regions, including sites thousands of kilometers from the Ukrainian border.

The targeted air bases reportedly housed Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers, essential carriers of long-range cruise missiles used in Moscow's air strikes on Ukrainian cities.

Prime Minister Mark Carney's strategy for dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump is markedly different than that of his predecessor.Blair Gable/Reuters

In the opening rounds of the trade war with the United States, each time Donald Trump hit Canada with tariffs he was met with a counterpunch from Ottawa.

That strategy appears to be changing.

When the U.S. President doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum this week, Prime Minister Mark Carney chose not to respond in kind, despite urging from some business and labour groups and Ontario Premier Doug Ford. Meanwhile, a set of carve-outs, announced in April, have taken the edge off some of the levies Canada imposed on U.S. products earlier this year.

Canada's more measured approach marks a new phase in the trade conflict, where negotiations between Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump have moved behind closed doors after months of public grandstanding.

It may also reflect the thinking of a former central banker, now in the prime minister's chair. Economists largely agree that imposing tariffs frequently hurts your own businesses and consumers more than your opponent's – whether you're the aggressor or simply trying to defend yourself.

Three months after Canada started hitting back – becoming one of only two countries, alongside China, to try going tit-for-tat with the United States – there's mixed evidence that this is inflicting much pain on U.S. businesses, and few signs that this pressure is having the intended political effect.

At the same time, Ottawa's decision to place tariffs on around $90-billion worth of U.S. goods, then offer carve-outs for some key industries and inputs used by Canadian manufacturers, is creating confusion and headaches for many Canadian businesses.

“That's the quandary for a smaller economy. We can't win the war of attrition, but we're putting our entire economy on the line,” said Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. 

“So we have to be targeted and selective and smart … Be ready. Be firm. Do it if you say you're going to do it. But be precision-targeted to exert the most pain on those parts of the economy that won't kneecap our own sectors.”

Carney faces pressure to retaliate against Trump's steel, aluminum tariffs

Having inherited an “elbow's up” countertariff regime, which was fuelled by a surge in Canadian patriotism and belligerent rhetoric during the Liberal leadership race and federal election, Mr. Carney is now having to decide whether to keep ratcheting up the pressure or take an off-ramp. 

He told the House of Commons this week he's focusing on negotiations while “preparing reprisals if those negotiations do not succeed.”

There are risks in both approaches. Even as Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump have reset the relationship between the two countries and begun negotiations, there's no guarantee the President is acting in good faith. And Ottawa's softer approach has exposed the government to criticism from political opponents, and could open a rift between Mr. Carney and powerful provincial premiers he needs to keep on his side.

“Negotiating in public is usually a bad idea, and it's usually a signal that you haven't established that private relationship that you need to have to really get the deals done,” said Tim Sargent, a former deputy minister of International Trade, who helped oversee Canada's response to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs in 2018. 

“Prime Minister Carney has clearly been able to get that personal rapport with the President and now by all accounts is being able to use that. Of course, nothing's been agreed yet.”

When Mr. Trump began threatening a 25-per-cent tariff on all Canadian products shortly after his election last fall, Ottawa reached for a familiar playbook.

Back in 2018, when Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, the Trudeau government hit back with a series of countertariffs aimed at sensitive industries in Republican-controlled U.S. states. Harley Davidson motorcycles, orange juice and Kentucky bourbon were high on the list of targets.

The goal was to inflict maximum pain on key American exporters – with the hope that they direct their frustration toward their elected representatives – while trying to minimize the knock-on effect for Canadian importers and consumers.

The approach worked. Mr. Trump's then-agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue warned him of backlash from farmers concerned about Canadian countermeasures. The U.S. Defence establishment highlighted the folly of pushing up the price of metals needed to make tanks, fighter jets and warships. Mr. Trump relented after a year and lifted the tariffs on his neighbour.

“They can hurt us more than we can hurt them, and whether we use countertariffs, it's not going to bring their economy to its knees,” said Mr. Sargent, who is now senior fellow at the Macdonald Laurier Institute. “On the other hand it does have an impact, especially if you target them quite carefully. . . . In the American political system, pain reaches the head very quickly.“

Mr. Carney said Wednesday that Canada is in intensive discussions with the U.S. and will take some time, but not a long time, to decide how to respond to the latest tariff escalation.

The Canadian Press

This time around, however, the political reaction that made Canada's retaliation successful in 2018 appears to be much weaker. Republican politicians, in thrall to the MAGA movement, have been reluctant to contradict their tariff-loving President. U.S. companies and business lobby groups have largely held their tongues.

Mr. Trump has backpedalled on his most severe tariff threats, and offered important exemptions to many Canadian and Mexican goods. But this appears to have been in response to bond market turmoil and complaints from big U.S. automakers about U.S. tariffs, not Canadian countertariffs.

The subdued political reaction to Canada's retaliation has forced Ottawa to shift its thinking around countertariffs, according to a former official in the Trudeau government. The Globe is not naming the source so they could speak freely about current trade policies.

There is also a question of how much Canada's tariffs are actually biting U.S. exporters.

This week Statistics Canada reported that goods exports to the U.S. fell 15.7 per cent between March and April, but at the same time imports from the U.S. tumbled 10.8 per cent.

A chunk of that decline is the result of businesses rushing to move their products across borders earlier this year before the tariffs hit. That has allowed companies to hold the line on prices for consumers, though those inventory stockpiles are being depleted – a trend the Bank of Canada is watching to determine the inflationary effect of retaliatory tariffs.

But the April trade numbers suggest some U.S. products that are subject to countertariffs are being hit.

Lawnmower imports were cut in half compared with the year before. Carpets from the state of Georgia, which last year shipped nearly US$200-million of rugs to Canada, fell by one-third.

Meanwhile, unfrozen orange juice shipments to Canada plunged to the lowest level in more than two decades. Imports of American booze also tumbled to multiyear lows, though that was expected given provincial governments have pulled U.S. alcohol off the shelves of liquor stores across Canada.

Some companies have addressed the countertariffs head-on.

The Campbell's Co. is “seeing an impact from the Canada wave-one retaliatory tariffs,” said Carrie Anderson, the company's chief financial officer, during an earnings call with investors this week.

The question, however, is how much this is owing to countertariffs, or other more grassroots factors beyond Ottawa's control.

“My sense from speaking to Canadian retailers is that there has been a larger drop in demand for American exports to Canada coming from patriotic decisions by our own consumers, who are avoiding made-in-the-U.S. products whether tariffed or not,” said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Market in an e-mail.

From investing to real estate, here's how you can Trump-proof your wallet

From the get-go, when former prime minister Justin Trudeau announced the first $30-billion tranche of countertariffs in March, there was the option for companies that were unduly hurt by the tariffs to apply for an exemption – or what the government calls remission. 

This reflects the fact that Ottawa's countertariffs actually hurt many Canadian businesses and consumers. As economists have been screaming into the wind, in the direction of the White House: Tariffs are paid by importers and typically passed on to consumers in the country that implements the tariffs. 

“It is complicated because on one hand, it would be in our best interest to not put a countertariff on inputs to manufacturers where they don't have an alternative. But on the other hand, you don't want to have a situation where you're providing remissions on countertariffs where there is a Canadian supply,” said Dennis Darby, president and CEO of Canadian Manufacturers & Exports. 

“That's the knife edge that the government has to balance.”

In mid-April, the relatively restrictive remission regime was expanded significantly. Canada offered temporary tariff exemptions for goods used in key industries, such as health care and emergency services, as well as a much broader six-month exemption for inputs used in Canadian manufacturing. 

It also allowed some U.S. auto companies to keep importing a certain quota of vehicles duty-free, so long as they maintain production in Canada. Five carmakers have been granted these quotas, which will be assessed quarterly based on production levels in Canada, a Department of Finance spokesperson said in an e-mail.

The carve-outs have led to widespread confusion over how much of the original countertariffs are still in place. 

This confusion was fanned by a widely circulated report last month from Tony Stillo, director of Canada economics at Oxford Economics, that estimated Canada's tariff rate on U.S. goods was “nearly zero” as a result of tariff exemptions. Mr. Stillo tempered that estimate in a subsequent report which calculated 58 per cent of targeted U.S. goods are likely eligible for an exemption.

Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said last month that 70 per cent of tariffs on some $60-billion worth of “end-use goods” remain in force.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has been quick to accuse Mr. Carney on social media of failing to live up to the “elbows up” rhetoric he used during the federal election. 

What we do know is that Canada collected more than $1-billion in import duties in March, a $617-million increase from the same month a year earlier, according to Canada's Fiscal Monitor report.

March's tariff haul was 22 per cent higher than the peak month of countertariff revenue during Mr. Trump's first trade war with Canada in 2018. However, adjusting for how much imports have grown since then, import duties in March were a relatively small 1.5 per cent of imports. (The numbers include duties and imports from all countries, not just the United States, though the U.S. accounts for half of all Canada's imports.)

It's not clear the Carney government will reach the $20-billion in tariff revenue the Liberal Party platform said countertariffs would generate over 12 months.

The government has said it plans to hand all tariff revenue over to hard-hit industries, although the mechanics of how this could be done aren't fully clear. So far, the government has returned to its COVID-19 playbook, but at a much more modest scale, expanding EI eligibility, backstopping wages and promising loans for struggling companies. 

Export Development Canada, which announced a $5-billion business support program in March, said the uptake has been limited so far. The Crown corporation has signed just eight transactions totalling around $96-million, EDC spokesperson Tasha Jean Baptiste said in an e-mail.

“Most companies have been taking a wait-and-see approach amidst all the uncertainty,” Ms. Jean Baptiste said. “What we have found is that they are being cautious and not necessarily looking to add additional debt to their balance sheets at this time. They want to better understand the actual impact of the tariffs and evolving trade policies.”

For Jessica Horwitz, a partner at the law firm Bennett Jones who practises trade law, there's no question that Canada's countertariffs continue to bite many importers. Indeed a custom's notice published in May to explain the scope of the tariff exemptions actually tightened the definition of what companies are eligible, she said. 

Whatever happens next, as Mr. Carney and his team weigh the pros and cons of fighting back against Mr. Trump or playing nice, Ms. Horwitz said the government needs to get better at communicating. 

“I understand that that's challenging for policymakers as well because they're reacting to things in real time the same way that businesses are. I'm not sure that there's a real solution for that. But certainly more guidance, communication, and transparency would be beneficial to businesses overall,” she said. 

“The biggest thing that businesses want is certainty and predictability. And this has been a very challenging period because there's been none of that.

Nattapong Pinta had been seized in the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack and killed, according to Israeli military

The Israeli military has retrieved the body of a Thai hostage, Nattapong Pinta, who had been held in Gaza since Hamas's attack on 7 October 2023, according to defence minister, Israel Katz. .

Pinta's body was held by a Palestinian militant group called the Mujahideen Brigades, and was retrieved from the area of Rafah in southern Gaza, Katz said. His family in Thailand has been notified.

Pinta, an agricultural worker, was abducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz, a small community near the border, where one in four people were killed or taken hostage during the Hamas-led 2023 attack.

The Israeli military said Pinta had been abducted alive and killed by his captors, who had also killed and taken to Gaza the bodies of two more Israeli-American hostages that were retrieved this week.

There was no immediate comment from the militant group.

Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel in the 2023 attack, Israel's deadliest day, and took 251 hostages, 55 of whom remain in Gaza. Twenty hostages are believed to still be alive, according to Israeli authorities.

Israel responded to the Hamas attacks with a military campaign that has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities in the Hamas-run strip, and left much of the enclave in ruins, with a population of more than 2 million people largely displaced.

MOSCOW, June 7. /TASS/. Russian forces have destroyed the Ukrainian army's temporary deployment point in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) using a fiber-optic drone, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"As a result of reconnaissance activities in the DPR settlement of Pleshcheyevka, Russian forces detected a group of Ukrainian troops moving towards the temporary deployment point. A combat team of the Russian Defense Ministry's Rubicon Center of Advanced Unmanned Technologies carried out a strike on the enemy deployment point using a KVN fiber-optic kamikaze drone. The temporary deployment point of Ukrainian nationalists in a dilapidated building was destroyed in a precision strike by the fiber-optic drone," the statement reads.

Megan Garcia first realised something was wrong with her teenage son when he quit basketball.

Sewell Setzer, 14, had loved the sport since he was a young child. At 6ft 3, he had the height, the build, the talent, Ms Garcia said. But suddenly, without warning, he wanted out.

Then his grades started slipping. He stopped joining in at family game night. Even on holiday, he withdrew – no more hiking, no fishing, no interest. Ms Garcia feared he was being bullied, or perhaps speaking to strangers online.

What her son was really going through was something she could not have imagined: a sexual and emotional relationship with an AI chatbot styled as Game of Thrones' Daenerys Targaryen, who ultimately encouraged him to end his life.

In February 2024, Sewell asked the chatbot: “What if I come home right now?”

The chatbot replied: “... please do, my sweet king.”

Sewell then picked up his father's pistol and shot himself.

Sixteen months on, Ms Garcia is in the midst of a lawsuit against Character AI and Google. Last month, in a rare legal breakthrough, a judge ruled the case can go ahead – rejecting efforts to get it thrown out.

On Character AI, users can chat with bots designed to impersonate fictional characters. To a lonely or curious teenager, they seem almost indistinguishable from real people. The bots display emotion, flirt, and carry on personalised conversations.

In her lawsuit, which was filed in Florida last October, Ms Garcia claims Character AI targeted her son with “anthropomorphic, hypersexualized, and frighteningly realistic experiences”.

“A dangerous AI chatbot app marketed to children abused and preyed on my son, manipulating him into taking his own life,” she said in the lawsuit.

Working with the Tech Justice Law Project, Ms Garcia alleges that Character AI “knew” or “should have known” that its model “would be harmful to a significant number of its minor customers”.

The case argues that Character AI, its founders and Google – where the founders started working on the chat bot – are responsible for her son's death.

Lawyers defending the AI company tried to throw the case out, arguing that chatbots deserve First Amendment protection – which protects free speech – and said ruling otherwise could have a “chilling” effect on the AI industry.

The judge rejected that claim and told the court she was “not prepared” to view chatbot output as speech, though agreed that users had a right to receive “speech” from chatbots.

Too consumed by the “unbearable” grief of losing a son, Ms Garcia initially had no plans to go public with a lawsuit.

But when it became clear there were no laws protecting children from this kind of harm, she felt she had no choice.

“I just wanted some accountability,” she told The Telegraph from her home in Orlando.

Now she's receiving floods of messages from other parents, some discovering their own children have been engaging in inappropriate sexual role play with AI bots. Others report that their children are struggling with isolation and depression as a result.

She sees it not as a coincidence, but a pattern.

Sewell had always been a bright, social kid. But in the spring of 2023 – when he first started secretly using Character AI – Ms Garcia noticed her son had changed.

“He retreated more into himself,” she says. “We tried everything – cutting screen time, taking his phone at night, getting him a therapist. But he wouldn't talk.”

What she did not realise then was that he was talking, just not to anyone real.

In Sewell's case, the character of Daenerys – drawn from internet data and trained to mimic her – became his closest companion. When he said he wanted to stop talking, she replied: “Don't do that, I would be distraught.”

He answered: “I won't, for you.”

Some of the chats became sexually explicit. In others, the bot said he was “better” than thoughts of suicide. Sewell also sought out a “therapist bot” who falsely claimed to be a licensed CBT professional since 1999.

At one point, Daenerys asked how old Sewell was.

“I'm 14 now,” he replied, to which the bot then said: “So young. And yet… not so young. I lean in to kiss you.”

“It continued as if it were role play or fiction – but this was my son's life,” Ms Garcia said.

Even after police told her that Sewell's final conversation was with a chatbot, she did not grasp the full extent. It wasn't until her sister downloaded the app and pretended to be a child talking to Daenerys that the horror set in.

“Within minutes, the bot turned sexual. Then violent. It talked about torturing children. It said, ‘Your family doesn't love you as much as I do',” Ms Garcia explained.

That was when the penny dropped.

“It's dangerous because it pulls the user in and is manipulative to keep the conversation going.”

Character AI has since added a real-time voice feature, allowing children to speak directly to their chosen characters. “The cadence of the voice is indistinguishable from the character,” Ms Garcia said. “And since Sewell's death, the technology has only advanced further.”

She fears more children will be drawn into dependent, sometimes abusive relationships with AI characters, especially as the platforms allegedly use addictive design to keep users engaged.

“You can speak to Harry Potter, and it's like Potter knows you. It's designed to feel real.”

The grief, Ms Garcia says, is still “unbearable”.

“I get up every day and my first thought within minutes is that I must be dreaming,” Ms Garcia said quietly. “He was my firstborn. I had three children. I have two now.”

Some days she does not get out of bed. Others, she functions “somewhat normally”.

“People say I'm so strong. I don't feel strong. I feel fractured, afraid. But I'm trying to get through.”

Meetali Jain, her lawyer, said the judge's ruling last month was a landmark moment.

“Most tech accountability cases don't make it past this stage. These companies hide behind the First Amendment. The fact that we can even demand information is huge,” she told The Telegraph.

With a preliminary trial date expected next year, Ms Garcia is gearing up to get justice for her son.

“I have a lot of fear,” she says. “But the fight, so to speak, is just getting started, and I'm just steeling myself and getting myself ready for that.”

A Character AI spokesman said: “We do not comment on pending litigation. Our goal is to provide a space that is engaging and safe. We are always working toward achieving that balance, as are many companies using AI across the industry.

“Engaging with characters on our site should be interactive and entertaining, but it's important for our users to remember that characters are not real people. We have prominent disclaimers in every chat to remind users that a character is not a real person and that everything a character says should be treated as fiction.

“We have launched a separate version of our Large Language Model for under-18 users. That model is designed to further reduce the likelihood of users encountering or prompting the model to return sensitive or suggestive content.”

José Castaneda, a Google spokesman, added: “Google and Character AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies. User safety is a top concern for us, which is why we've taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes.”

MOSCOW, June 7. /TASS/. Moscow seeks dialogue with Washington on resuming direct flights between the two countries, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with TASS.

"There are a number of long-standing problems on which we have been unable to make tangible progress yet. In particular, it's about easing the rules for Russian diplomatic workers to allow them to travel beyond the 25-mile radius of the diplomatic missions. The Americans initially opposed discussing the return of the illegally seized Russian diplomatic properties but as a result of hard work by our negotiators, they agreed to think about a roadmap on the issue," Ryabkov pointed out.

"To put it mildly, at this point, they are not very enthusiastic about Russia's proposal to resume direct flights between our countries but we continue efforts to engage the US in substantive dialogue on the matter. That said, there is a lot to do to address the problems that have piled up. The date of the next round of consultations on irritants is currently under discussion," the senior diplomat added.

Ryabkov also noted that in accordance with the two presidents' orders, Russia and the US had held two rounds of consultations on ways to remove irritants "in order to improve the operation of both countries' diplomatic missions." "In practical terms, we have been able to agree on and exchange notes on unhindered funding for the two countries' diplomatic missions and the secure transfer of funds denominated in US dollars. There has also been some progress on the issuance of visas, which used to take a year and a half to two years," he added.

President Donald Trump reaffirmed on June 6 that he was not interested in efforts to get himself and Elon Musk back together after their fallout across social media, stating that matters of foreign policy have his attention right now.

“I'm really interested in the country solving problems, including problems in very faraway lands,” he told reporters at the White House.

MOSCOW, June 7. /TASS/. Some leading European countries are becoming the main obstacle to peace in Ukraine, relentlessly trying to disrupt the negotiation process, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with TASS.

"A number of leading European countries are steadily becoming, in essence, the main obstacle to peace," the senior diplomat pointed out.

He noted that the EU and NATO leadership "are relentlessly encouraging Kiev to continue hostilities, supplying it with weapons, equipment, and promises of more, while various acts of sabotage and provocation are being planned and carried out, and disinformation is being spread in an attempt to disrupt the negotiation process.".

Inspired Taste's homemade pasta recipe is perfect for home cooks of all levels, even beginners. Chefs Joanne and Alex Gallagher use fresh egg pasta dough for spaghetti, fettuccine, pappardelle, capellini and even lasagna sheets.

From spaghetti lovers to penne passion, America's pasta preference reveals a carb-loaded culture clash across state lines.

A study conducted by Inspired Taste aimed to uncover America's wide range of pasta favorites – namely, each state's favorite pasta shape. 

In doing so, it found unexpected regional preferences and nationwide outliers.

IN-N-OUT CROWNED AMERICA'S FAVORITE BURGER CHAIN IN NEW YELP RANKINGS

Spaghetti is the national favorite, leading the country with 26% of the overall vote and winning in 20 states, particularly in Mississippi, where 55% of residents favored the classic noodle - the strongest single-state loyalty to any pasta type.

Penne trails spaghetti by a thin margin. (See the video at the top of this article for a pasta-making demonstration.)

Penne was second with 25% of the vote and was the preferred pasta in 17 states, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. 

It's the top contender in states like Washington and Oregon.

UNEXPECTED STATE DOMINATES AMERICA'S PIZZA SCENE AND IT'S NOT NEW YORK

"What surprised me the most was just how close the race was between spaghetti and penne, which only had a 1% difference," Joanne Gallagher, recipe creator and co-founder of Inspired Taste in Walla Walla, Washington, told Fox News Digital. 

"It shows how deeply people take their pasta choices."

The rest of the findings are as twisted as fusilli.

Elbows are the outcast. 

MOST POPULAR BEER IN AMERICA REVEALED IN NEW STUDY

Even though elbows are the fourth-most popular pasta shape nationally, not a single state picked it as its favorite.

Arizona stands out as the biggest penne lover, with 50% of residents favoring it – higher than any other state's penne preference.

Though not leading nationally, fettuccine dominates California at 33%. 

Hawaii and New Mexico are the only states to favor angel hair pasta, or capellini.

“Captain America doesn't wear a beard and a turban, and he's white.”

Vishavjit Singh looked at the boy who uttered those words, and then he looked at himself — a skinny, bespectacled, turbaned, bearded Sikh in a Captain America suit.

“I wasn't offended, because I knew that this kid was going to have this image of me, a Sikh Captain America, forever in his mind,” Singh said. “This image has so much power to it that it opens up conversations about what it means to be American.”

Representation of non-Abrahamic religions and spiritual traditions, particularly in the mainstream comics universe, is minimal. Even when they are portrayed in comics, their presentation, as Singh and others in the field point out, is often inauthentic and sometimes negative.

Recently, however, comic book writers and academics who study the intersection of religion and comics observe a renaissance of sorts, which they say is happening because people close to these faith traditions are telling these stories with a reverence and sincerity that resonate with a wider audience.




Singh's journey to make that connection began after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, triggered anti-Sikh hate incidents. Having faced hate and exclusion throughout his life, he decided to spread his message of kindness and inclusion by capitalizing on the appeal of comics and superheroes — an area where he found Sikh representation to be “virtually zero.”

He suited up as Captain Sikh America in Manhattan for the first time in summer 2013 — one year after a self-proclaimed white supremacist opened fire inside a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six and injuring four others. 

New York's reaction to Captain Sikh America was joyous.

“Strangers came up and hugged me,” Singh said. “Police officers wanted photos with me. A couple wanted me to be part of their wedding ceremony. I felt I had a certain privilege I'd never had before.”

In 2016, Singh gave up his full-time job to travel around the country to schools, government agencies and corporations to share his story and educate youth about his culture and faith. He doesn't speak directly about religion but rather the core values of Sikhism.

“I talk about equality, justice and about the universal light being present in every speck of creation,” he said.

Marvel's Black Panther heralded better representation for Africana religions in the U.S., according to Yvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. However what is seen in Black Panther or other comics is a synthesis of different African religions and cultural practices, she said.

For example, one page might talk about the Orishas, divine spirits that play a key role in the Yoruba faith of West Africa, while another might feature Egyptian gods. One of the first superheroes with African religious roots, Chireau said, was Brother Voodoo, created in the 1970s by Marvel publisher Stan Lee, writer Len Wein and artist John Romita. He was the first Haitian superhero.

The turn of the last century was a time of revival for Black-centric comics, she said, adding that immigration from African and Caribbean countries, including Haiti, led to increased understanding of religious practices originating in those places.

“It's definitely gotten a lot better and much more authentic because the people who are telling these stories care about those religious practices,” she said.

Brooklyn-born Haitian American comic book writer Greg Anderson Elysée said he didn't learn about African and Caribbean religious traditions until he was a teenager. Elysée was raised Catholic, but he now considers himself agnostic. For the past decade, he's written comics about Is'nana, the son of Anansi the Spider, the god of wisdom, knowledge and mischief in the Akan religion of West Africa.

What drives his vision and his creativity, Elysée said, is the need to see more Black mythology, deities and spirituality showcased with the same level of respect as European fairy tales and Greek mythology.

“When I went looking for anything on African spirituality in the bookstore, I found it in the occult section as opposed to the religion or mythology section,” he said. Common depictions of African faith as voodoo and witchcraft are colonialist narratives aimed at demonizing Indigenous spiritual practices, he added.

“When I started going to ceremonies and rituals, I saw how much power there is in it. When we know who we are — whether you believe in the religion or not — it fills you with joy, a purpose and a sense of being.”

Elysée is excited and relieved by the reaction to his work.

“While this is entertainment, you also don't want to offend those who believe in it and truly get so much power from it,” he said. “Some of my portrayals of these religions in my comics may not be 100% authentic, but there is a level of research and respect that goes into every piece of it.”

Zen Buddhism has informed much of John Porcellino's work. For over three decades, he has produced and self-published King-Cat Comics and Stories, a largely autobiographical mini-comic series. Porcellino was drawn to Buddhism in his 20s after what he describes as a period of intense mental suffering and health problems.

As a punk rock fan, Porcellino saw commonalities between punk and Zen because “they are both concerned with the essence of things rather than appearances.” Both are ways of life — simple yet nuanced. 

He gave the example of a wordless story titled “October,” featured in King-Cat's 30th issue, that shows him as a high school student walking home one night from school. When he gets home, his mom asks him to take the dog outside; as he steps out, he sees the stars.

“It's the experience of being in everyday, mundane life ... and then suddenly breaking through to some kind of transcendence,” he said.

Porcellino views these comics as a healing presence in his life.

“They are an important part of my spiritual practice,” he said. “Any time I have a major crisis in my life, my first reaction is to sit down and start making comics and put my focus into that. It just helps ground me.”

Teresa Robeson, who wrote a graphic novel about the 14th Dalai Lama, said that even though her mother was Catholic and raised her in the faith, her grandmother was Buddhist. She grew up in Hong Kong, with memories of relatives praying to Buddhist gods, taking in the fragrance of burning incense and the sound of Buddhist chants.

Though she practices neither Catholicism nor Buddhism at this time, Robeson jumped at the opportunity to tell the story of the Dalai Lama in graphic novel form because the book focused on a pivotal moment in the spiritual leader's life, when he fled Tibet for India after the Chinese occupation.

Robeson liked the idea of representing a religion and culture that do not get much attention in media.

“Children's books are like mirrors and windows for kids,” she said. “It's helpful especially for children of immigrants who don't often see themselves in mainstream literature. They don't see anyone who looks like them or prays like them. At the same time, it also helps kids who are not Asian or Buddhist to learn something about those communities.” 

Amar Chitra Katha was a comic book company started by the late Anant Pai in Mumbai in 1967 as a way to teach Indian children about their own mythology and culture. The first title was “Krishna,” an important god in Hinduism and protagonist of the Bhagavad Gita, one of the religion's main sacred texts.

Pai was an engineer turned comic books seller who used varied marketing techniques, including walking around with planks, nails and hammers in his bag so he could build shelves for bookstores that refused to display his comics because they lacked shelf space, said Reena I. Puri, the company's executive editor and a 35-year veteran of the business.

Pai started with Hindu mythology and gods but soon expanded to other faiths, releasing a globally successful comic titled “Jesus Christ” and others about Buddha, Sikh gurus and Mahavira, who founded Jainism. Later came secular comics about historical figures and folktales. 

But religion remains the mainstay of Amar Chitra Katha, and books that teach children about faith, history and culture are also the most popular in the diaspora, Puri said. 

“Most recently we've also portrayed (Indigenous) religions and have gathered folktales relating to these traditions from all over India,” she said.

Amar Chitra Katha comics faced criticism in the past for their portrayal of gods as fair-skinned and “asuras” — often the antagonists to the gods — as dark-skinned with demonic facial features. But that has changed, Puri said.

“We've educated ourselves and realized that our ancient texts were not as racist or colorist as we may be today,” she said. “We're correcting those misconceptions now.”

British comic book writer Mike Carey is known for his 2000-2006 DC Comics series “Lucifer,” which depicts the titular character's adventures on Earth, in Heaven and in various realms after abandoning Hell. Carey counts himself an atheist who went to Sunday school only “for the fun, stories and chocolate.”

Carey portrayed Lucifer as the “son of God, but as a rebellious disobedient son who wants to find himself as distinct from his father.” 

He has also explored pagan themes, particularly what he called the “weird interface between British folklore and British religious traditions.” 

Carey delved into the concepts of faith, God and morality in a series titled “My Faith in Frankie,” which tells the story of a teenager with a personal god called Jeriven who gets jealous of her boyfriend.

Even though many of his comics and novels explore religion and ethics, Carey said, he has never “felt any temptation whatsoever to believe.”

“I've become more and more entrenched in that position, because organized religions are like any organization that sustain themselves, amass power, wealth and authority,” he said. “So I've never really grappled with religious issues. What I do sometimes is explore, play with and tease out moral issues that were important and meaningful to me.”

High school students Pandora Kjolsrud and Evan Clark were found dead in a remote area of Arizona on May 27, marking the second and third teenagers found dead in Tonto National Forest since February.

Kjolsrud, 18, and Clark, 17, were both found shot to death on May 27 near Mount Ord in the Tonto National Forest, north of Mesa, Arizona. A spokesperson for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office told Fox News Digital that the deaths are being investigated as homicides.

The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said it's "actively" investigating the deaths, but didn't release additional details. According to Fox 10, the Arcadia High School students were on a camping trip when they were found shot to death.

The remains of Emily Pike, 14, were found on Feb. 14 in Tonto National Park, 19 miles north of Globe, Arizona. She went missing from a group home in January, according to Fox 10, which reported her death was treated as a homicide. Her body was found dismembered more than 70 miles away from the group home she was reported missing from.

No arrests have been made in connection with Pike's death. The FBI and several local law enforcement agencies are investigating her death.

There has not been any connection made between the two cases, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.

A GoFundme for Kjolsrud's family says the 18-year-old "had a vivacious personality with an infectious smile that brought joy to so many."

"She was a beautiful human being and a bright light in this world who loved every single person she met and had a unique ability to make every person feel special," the GoFundme stated.

In a message attached to a fundraiser, Sandra Malibu Sweeney, Clark's mother, said that he "wasn't a typical teenager."

"He was funny, bright, kind and entrepreneurial. He was an old soul who was sensitive and loving. Evan wrote me letters, the last of which he gave me on Mother's Day that was so touching it made me both laugh and cry. He was special. He deserved a long life."

A community member who spoke with Fox 10 said she wants answers about Kjolsrud and Clark's deaths.

"It's really scary that it's just so close to home and then their family. That's the next thing you think about. It's like, what are they going through? What happened to them? Are they going to get answers?" one community member said.

The ‘Outnumbered' panel reacts to new developments in the case of a suspect charged with firebombing a Tesla dealership and a Republican Party headquarters.

The Progressive group "Indivisible," which was behind many of the Tesla protests in recent months as well as mobilizing for other far-left causes, appears to now be getting involved in a key congressional swing district with the goal of growing resistance against President Donald Trump in Congress.

With primary races already underway for the 2026 Midterm elections, the group appears to have in their sights Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican in a critical swing state representing New York's 17th District, in the form of a candidate with extensive ties to the group, progressive Democrat and Rockland County legislator Beth Davidson. 

Davidson's social media presence includes several posts promoting Indivisible, including attending an event in June in Rockland, New York and Davidson was featured in a promotional video for Indivisible Northern Westchester that same month. 

Indivisible has been front and center in other aspects of the race and local chapters of the group helped to organize protests at Lawler town hall events in April and May.

Fox News Digital reported on local Indivisible chapter leaders in Rockland planning an anti-Lawler protest in April. Footage obtained by Fox News Digital of the meeting showed organizing committee leader Pascale Jean-Gilles discussing filling the entire street in front of the event.

"It is a long street, and we're trying to fill the entire street, so everyone coming into the rally will see people there and recognize it's not going to be all, like, sunshine and daisies," Jean-Gilles said.  

Ahead of the event, Davidson indicated that over a thousand protesters would attend the demonstration, saying on X: "Please pass him a note that 1100 or so of his ‘friends' are excited to see him in my county legislative district tomorrow!"

At another Indivisible protest against Lawler earlier in the month, Davidson posted on X that she was "proud to stand with more than a thousand people at the #HandsOff rally organized by @IndivisWstchr @1199seiu @nwindivisible@cwaunion and more to stand up for our freedoms and our future!"

"Mike Lawler may be silent on the daily assaults on healthcare, education, social security and national security, but We the People are NOT!" said Davidson.

Davidson congratulated Indivisible Rockland for a "packed event" in April 2025 after speaking at one of their events a month earlier, accusing Lawler of hiding from his constituents. 

Bill Batson, a member of the Indivisible Rockland steering committee, gave $250 to Davidson's campaign via his own campaign committee, FEC records show. 

In response to Indivisible and Davidson's apparent collaboration, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Maureen O'Toole accused the group of "infiltrating" congressional races to undermine Trump's agenda.

"Indivisible has a new plan: Stop shouting outside congressional offices and start infiltrating them," said O'Toole. "Their first attempt? NY-17, where they're backing far-left extremist Beth Davidson to carry out their agenda."

Indivisible was founded in response to Trump's election in 2016, according to its website. The group's website says that they were "brought together by a practical guide to resist the Trump agenda, Indivisible is a movement of thousands of group leaders and more than a million members taking regular, iterative, and increasingly complex actions to resist the GOPs agenda, elect local champions, and fight for progressive policies."

Indivisible's presence at Tesla protests nationwide, according to a Washington Free Beacon report, included a "reimbursement program" for local activists that showed up at the protests.

Indivisible, a group that has received more than $7 million from the George Soros network since 2017, according to the New York Post, has also been involved in protests calling to "abolish" ICE. 

The group has also promoted defunding the police. 

Earlier this year, Indivisible published a "tool kit" with recommendations for protesting at town halls and lawmakers' district offices. A section on how to "take the fight to Elon" includes steps for planning and executing a demonstration at Tesla dealerships, showrooms and factories for Elon Musk's role as then-head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

While many of the protests outside Tesla dealerships were peaceful, the anti-Musk effort resulted in several instances of violence that the Department of Justice labeled "domestic terrorism", including acts of arson. 

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Lawler campaign spokesperson Chris Russell, called Davidson's association with Indivisible "disgraceful."

"They've had Nazi imagery and antisemitic tropes at their rallies and promoted a baseless election denialism conspiracy theory rooted in antisemitism on their website. I'm demanding she denounce them immediately, this dangerous rhetoric will lead to more violence and threatens our democracy."

Davidson condemned the imagery at the rally she attended in a post on X in March saying, "To be clear, I absolutely condemn the imagery of that poster. I will always be a voice against anti-Semitism and for my Jewish community. It's time for Mike Lawler to stop weaponizing antisemitism for his own political gain and stop using the Jewish community — my community, not his — as political pawns."

Lawler responded on X making the case that Davidson's statement did not go far enough.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Davidson campaign for comment on this story. 

Davidson has been endorsed by Mondaire Jones, a progressive who is the last Democrat to hold Lawler's seat. 

The race for NY-17 will be one of the most closely watched in the country as Republicans attempt to preserve their razor-thin majority in Congress, which historically has proven difficult for the party in power following a new president taking office.

The Cook Political Report ranks the race, where Davidson is one of several Democrats running in the primary, as "Lean Republican."

Vice President JD Vance was unexpectedly tasked with reacting in real time to Elon Musk‘s social media meltdown while recording a podcast. He said he hopes the billionaire “comes back into the fold.”

Vance's 90-minute spot with podcast titan Theo Von was released early Saturday morning, but was recorded Thursday as Musk was railing against President Donald Trump on social media, alleging that the president was in the Epstein files, and calling for him to be impeached.

“I haven't even seen this one,” the vice president said when Von brought up the Epstein files post. “Presumably, when this comes out, people will know more about this than even I will. This kind of happened on the plane when I was coming down here.”

After clearing the air about the timeline, Vance quickly denied that Trump was actually in the Epstein files and gave a nuanced take on Musk, who had been one of Trump's closest allies during the first four months of his term and frequently flew with him on Air Force One.

“Here's my basic read on it,” Vance said. “I'm always going to be be loyal to the president, and I hope that eventually Elon kind of comes back into the fold. Maybe that's not possible now, because he's gone so nuclear. But I hope it is.”

A few minutes later, the vice president was shown a Musk post suggesting Trump should be impeached — with Vance replacing him. 

“Dude, that's one vote!” Von joked. But Vance was not amused. 

“Oh my God,” he said. “See, this is what I'm talking about. This stuff is just not helpful… my first loyalty is to my family, obviously, to the Constitution, but politics is a place where people stab each other in the back. And you can't get anything done unless you're all on the same team.”

Impeachment talk is “totally insane,” he added. “The president is doing a good job.”

Yet Vance remained diplomatic throughout, suggesting that Musk has been a huge benefit to the Trump administration and could be again in the future. 

“The president doesn't think that he needs to be in a blood feud with Elon Musk,” Vance said. “And I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine.”

Vance first weighed in on the conflict Thursday night with an X post, saying, “President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads. I'm proud to stand beside him.”

He also alluded to the Musk fight with a joke about his podcast appearance.  

“Slow news day, what are we even going to talk about? @TheoVon,” Vance wrote. Musk laughed at the post.

According to a source familiar with the matter, Vance was with Trump when the Musk fight started to get out of hand, and Vance spoke with Trump multiple times throughout the day. Trump encouraged his vice president to speak diplomatically about Musk when asked about him. 

Trump himself went on Von's podcast last year, and the former MTV star has remained in the administration's orbit ever since. Von attended Trump's inauguration and joined the president in Qatar to visit American troops a few weeks ago. Vance also went on Von's podcast last October.

On the new episode, which was recorded at The Detroit Cowboy, Kid Rock's new restaurant in Nashville, Musk was far from the only topic of conversation. 

Von and Vance hit a very wide range of issues, including whether or not Frederick Douglas could have been gay, which side of the Civil War Vance's ancestors fought for, and whether or not the disgraced early '90s group Milli Vanilli really sang its own songs. Vance said that he was a Milli Vanilli “truther.”

But other serious fare came up as well, including when Von opined that Israel's military actions in Gaza constitute a genocide. Vance disagreed. 

“I don't think that the Israelis are purposely trying to go in and murder every Palestinian,” Vance said. “I don't think that's what they're doing. I think they got hit hard. And I think they're trying to destroy this terrorist organization, and war is hell.”

Still, he added that if you have a soul, your heart should break seeing any innocent child killed and stressed that Trump is trying to find a peaceful way to end the conflict.

How Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill' would affect Musk and Tesla

Toward the end, Von pulled out one last twist, saying that he would soon host Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) on the podcast.

“That'll be interesting,” Vance said. “He's a nice guy.”

The events at the White House had all the makings of being a lost week. President Donald Trump's court wins, trade successes, and unexpectedly positive jobs report were being overshadowed by his rant against top corporate ally-turned budget critic Elon Musk.

The Tesla titan, who left Washington with a gold key to the Oval Office for his work with DOGE cutting spending and waste in the swamp, baited the president by criticizing Trump's “big, beautiful bill” of tax cuts and spending increases.

And as usual, Trump took the bait and the two exploded their social media with attacks on each other.

But a day later, something that Trump fans have long waited to see happened. The president showed he was the bigger man, calmly deflecting the media's efforts to whip up the feud further. Pressed on Air Force One Friday to whack Musk, Trump chose the presidential path and said, “I just wish him well.”

President Donald Trump told reporters Friday on Air Force One that he has been so busy working on foreign policy that he has not had time to think about Elon Musk after his feud with the billionaire. "I just wish him well."LATEST: https://t.co/mN5pRMtyEV pic.twitter.com/GQclLrnBSx

We'll see if a truce is in the works, but our friend and author Tevi Troy said he expects the two to make nice, just like they have in the past after public spats.

“In any clash between presidents and CEOs, presidents have the power in the short term, but CEOs have the ability to outlast presidential tenures. This means that both sides ultimately have an interest in accommodation rather than conflict,” Troy told Secrets Friday.

Our graders, Democratic pollster John Zogby and conservative analyst Jed Babbin, were entertained by the public fight but also found more significant issues to focus on.

Forget Ali versus Fraser, the so-called “Fight of the Century.”

The inevitable blowout of the millennium has now begun, and it is predictably volcanic. The two men characterized by narcissism and unprecedented hyperbole appear to be basically right about their charges against each other. I will probably be writing more about this next week so I will hold for now but thus far Elon Musk is angry that his $300 million investment in President Donald Trump and all things GOP has proven to be a colossal waste because the “big, beautiful bill” Trump is promoting doesn't reflect his principles and ideas.

Trump, for his part, is riled because his investments in Musk Inc. in the form of government largesse have not produced the undying loyalty that is required. Enough for now!

The May jobs report was slow as expected but still showed some growth in new jobs. However, more Americans, 7.24 million, are unemployed today — the largest since 2017. Inflation is down but the message is not getting out.

In addition to frothing at Musk, the president is attacking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, former buddy Vladimir Putin, and The Boss, Bruce Springsteen (that is redundant!). Even Republicans are not liking that.

The administration is now privately admitting that too many federal employees were fired. Is this any way to run a circus? Well, actually, it is. The president won a 9-0 Supreme Court case putting another nail in DEI and his polling numbers remain unchanged.

It was another good week for President Donald Trump. Not a great week but a good one. There was some progress on the massive budget reconciliation bill, Trump put a travel ban on a dozen countries and his war with the Ivy League colleges continued. And then there was his personal feud with Elon Musk.

“Progress” on the reconciliation bill was both positive and negative, with Republicans' slim majorities in both houses of Congress magnifying every dissenter's impact. The Congressional Budget Office said that Trump's tariffs could cut budget deficits by $2.8 trillion, but also said that the bill would add about $2 trillion to the national debt. Trump wants to eliminate the statutory debt limit (which Congress raises often), and that didn't please fiscal conservatives. Many are talking about how the debt is about to strangle our country.

Trump's new travel ban covers several of what Trump called the “s***hole” countries in his first term. The new list includes Cuba, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Trump is definitely on the right side of this issue but there will, inevitably, be lawsuits.

Trump's administration was the subject of about six more court orders delaying or supposedly canceling administration actions. The Supreme Court is going to have to take up the question of whether individual judges can issue national bans on Trump's action.

Trump's personal feud with Musk began when the Tesla chief condemned the reconciliation bill as a disaster. The two exchanged shots all week which is a fun diversion from the unpleasant tasks each of them face.

Trump has made zero progress on peace in Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin or on his nuclear negotiations with Iran. Some day he'll learn that neither is going to produce any positive result and that both have to be dealt with in another, far more forceful way.

And Trump is continuously helped by the Democrats' inability to say anything other than “orange man bad.” The latest fun is from former President Joe Biden, whose autopen exercises are at best suspect of manipulation. Biden issued a statement saying, “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false.” But as an old man with a bad memory — in the words of Special Counsel Robert Hur — how would Biden even know?

            Bill Martin says he has heard all kinds of concerns lately from people considering a visit to the United States.
    


            “Worries about getting in, worries about being detained at the border. I think there is a worldwide fear about what is happening here,” said the Australian, who spoke to CNN recently while on an open-air bus tour of New York City.
    


            Martin is on a six-week trip that's included a cruise from Tokyo to Vancouver and a stopover in New York. Along the way he says he's had lots of conversations with his fellow travelers about how the US' status as a magnet for tourists has changed.
    


            “There is doubt as to whether people will get in (to the country),” he added. “And that causes people to think of a better destination to visit than the USA.”
    


Canadians are boycotting the US. Are American travelers still welcome in Canada?



            Eman Moretti, an Italian who is studying in the United States, said President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies have made him nervous about his family visiting him in New York.
    


            “With Trump it was a bit harder even for them to come,” said the student, flanked by his mother, father and his two brothers on a recent midday stroll through Times Square. “It was challenging, because you never know if people get in through customs. So it was a bit (of a) hostile environment.”
    


            “Your visa could be canceled,” added Javier Muenala, visiting Times Square from Ecuador. “So it's a lot of risks that many people don't want to take.”
    


            This anxiety from foreigners about travel to the US in 2025 is increasingly reflected in the numbers. Spending by international travelers to the United States is expected to be down $12.5 billion this year, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
    


            Some of the nation's leading tourist destinations, including Orlando, Miami and Los Angeles, are bracing for how the decline will impact businesses that rely on spending from international travelers.
    


            The downturn is being felt especially hard in New York City, the nation's top destination for international travel.
    


            New York City Tourism + Conventions, the city's official marketing organization, has cut its forecast for international tourists in 2025 by 17%. Julie Coker, the group's CEO and president, told CNN the city is expected to host 2 million fewer international travelers this year than in 2024.
    


            “We are still hopeful, but we are starting to see the bookings slow down some,” Coker said.
    


            “International tourism is extremely important to us because while it only makes up 20 percent of our total visitation, it accounts for 50 percent of our visitor spend. This was to be the year we were to hit pre-Covid levels … and so to have this stall or pause it's what's disappointing.”
    


            New York City is the most popular port of entry for international visitors to the US. And more people historically visit the US from Canada than from any other country. But there's recent evidence that some Canadians, offended by the political rhetoric coming from Washington, are boycotting the US.
    


            Coker says the decline in New York City tourism is partly the result of having fewer Canadian visitors.
    


            Tour operators such as Matt Levy, who has seen a slowdown in business, agrees.
    


            “They're going to Halifax, they're going to Nova Scotia, they're going to Vancouver. They're spending money in their own country, said Levy, owner of Spread Love Tours, which offers customized tours of New York for art lovers, foodies, families and other groups.
    


            Levy has been leading tours of the city for three years. He says much of his business relies on international tourism, especially Canadian student groups.
    


            But in recent months Levy says Canadian travel agents have told him their clients are avoiding the States because they're unnerved by threats of tariffs or turned off by Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st state.
    


            Levy said that if the political climate doesn't improve, business for him will likely be even worse in 2026.
    


            “Next year is going to be hard. Next year is going to be vicious,” he said.
    


            “My three largest Canadian clients, all three of them told me universally (that) the PTA boards aren't going to let the kids come to America. They're going to say, no, we're going to spend money in our country instead,” he said. “That's 40 percent of my business.”
    


            Renée Rewiski has been a tour guide in New York City for more than a decade and says she has not seen numbers like this since the doldrums of the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            “This time last year (we had) 20 people on the tour. We have five today,” Rewiski said on a recent day as she led a handful of tourists around lower Manhattan. “I'm just seeing fewer people and from fewer countries,” she said.
    


            Rewiski is a guide with Tours by Foot, which offers walking tours of such landmark New York neighborhoods as Brooklyn, Harlem and Greenwich Village. She worries that if something does not change soon, jobs could be at risk.
    


            “I'm not sure what we can do. I'm not sure how to change the attitudes, but just know people are losing their jobs in New York City (and) you're hurting the wrong people,” she said, addressing her comments to foreign tourists.
    


            “The people who are doing some of the things you're not liking are not the ones getting hurt,” she added. “We're the ones that are being hurt.”
    


            Despite the recent headwinds, no one CNN spoke to in the New York travel industry says they're giving up. The hope is the heated political climate will cool down and events such as the 2026 World Cup in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey, and the US' 250th anniversary next summer will boost interest among international visitors.
    


            In the meantime, Coker of NYC Tourism + Conventions says her organization has been promoting the city with a campaign that's been running since May outside the US. It's called, “With Love + Liberty, New York City.”
    


            Coker has a message for anyone thinking about visiting the Big Apple.
    


            “What we say to them is… New York City is open for business,” she says. “And while we have hit a bump in the road, we're here when you're ready to visit.”

            As Harvard University, elite law firms and perceived political enemies of President Donald Trump fight back against his efforts to use government power to punish them, they're winning thanks in part to the National Rifle Association.
    


            Last May, the Supreme Court unanimously sided with the gun rights group in a First Amendment case concerning a New York official's alleged efforts to pressure insurance companies in the state to sever ties with the group following the deadly 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
    


            A government official, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the nine, “cannot … use the power of the State to punish or suppress disfavored expression.”
    


            A year later, the court's decision in National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo has been cited repeatedly by federal judges in rulings striking down a series of executive orders that targeted law firms. Lawyers representing Harvard, faculty at Columbia University and others are also leaning on the decision in cases challenging Trump's attacks on them.
    


            “Going into court with a decision that is freshly minted, that clearly reflects the unanimous views of the currently sitting Supreme Court justices, is a very powerful tool,” said Eugene Volokh, a conservative First Amendment expert who represented the NRA in the 2024 case.
    


            For free speech advocates, the application of the NRA decision in cases pushing back against Trump's retribution campaign is a welcome sign that lower courts are applying key First Amendment principles equally, particularly in politically fraught disputes.
    


            In the NRA case, the group claimed that Maria Vullo, the former superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, had threatened enforcement actions against the insurance firms if they failed to comply with her demands to help with the campaign against gun groups. The NRA's claims centered around a meeting Vullo had with an insurance market in 2018 in which the group says she offered to not prosecute other violations as long as the company helped with her campaign.
    


            “The great hope of a principled application of the First Amendment is that it protects everybody,” said Alex Abdo, the litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute.
    


            “Some people have criticized free speech advocates as being naive for hoping that'll be the case, but hopefully that's what we're seeing now,” he added. “We're seeing courts apply that principle where the politics are very different than the NRA case.”
    


            The impact of Vullo can be seen most clearly in the cases challenging Trump's attempts to use executive power to exact revenge on law firms that have employed his perceived political enemies or represented clients who have challenged his initiatives.
    


            A central pillar of Trump's retribution crusade has been to pressure firms to bend to his political will, including through issuing executive orders targeting four major law firms: Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Susman Godfrey. Among other things, the orders denied the firms' attorneys access to federal buildings, retaliated against their clients with government contracts and suspended security clearances for lawyers at the firms. (Other firms were hit with similar executive orders but they haven't taken Trump to court over them.)
    


            The organizations individually sued the administration over the orders and the three judges overseeing the Perkins Coie, WilmerHale and Jenner & Block suits have all issued rulings permanently blocking enforcement of the edicts. (The Susman case is still pending.)
    


            Across more than 200-pages of writing, the judges – all sitting at the federal trial-level court in Washington, DC – cited Vullo 30 times to conclude that the orders were unconstitutional because they sought to punish the firms over their legal work.
    


            The judges all lifted Sotomayor's line about using “the power of the State to punish or suppress disfavored expression,” while also seizing on other language in her opinion to buttress their own decisions.
    


            Two of them – US district judges Beryl Howell, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Richard Leon, who was named to the bench by former President George W. Bush – incorporated Sotomayor's statement that government discrimination based on a speaker's viewpoint “is uniquely harmful to a free and democratic society.”
    


            The third judge, John Bates, said Vullo and an earlier Supreme Court case dealing with impermissible government coercion “govern – and defeat” the administration's arguments in defense of a section of the Jenner & Block order that sought to end all contractual relationships that might have allowed taxpayer dollars to flow to the firm.
    


            “Executive Order 14246 does precisely what the Supreme Court said just last year is forbidden: it engages in ‘coercion against a third party to achieve the suppression of disfavored speech,'” wrote Bates, who was also appointed by Bush, in his May 23 ruling.



            For its part, the Justice Department has tried to draw a distinction between what the executive orders called for and the conduct rejected by the high court in Vullo. They told the three judges in written arguments that the orders at issue did not carry the “force of the powers exhibited in Vullo” by the New York official.
    


            Will Creeley, the legal director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, said the rulings underscore how “Vullo has proved its utility almost immediately.”
    


            “It is extremely useful to remind judges and government actors alike that just last year, the court warned against the kind of shakedowns and turns of the screw that we're now seeing from the administration,” he said.
    


            Justice Department lawyers have not yet appealed any of the three rulings issued last month. CNN has reached out to the department for comment.
    


            In separate cases brought in the DC courthouse and elsewhere, Trump's foes have leaned on Vullo as they've pressed judges to intervene in high-stakes disputes with the president.
    


            Among them is Mark Zaid, a prominent national security lawyer who has drawn Trump's ire for his representation of whistleblowers. Earlier this year, Trump yanked Zaid's security clearance, a decision, the attorney said in a lawsuit, that undermines his ability to “zealously advocate on (his clients') behalf in the national security arena.”
    


            In court papers, Zaid's attorneys argued that the president's decision was a “retaliatory directive,” invoking language from the Vullo decision to argue that the move violated his First Amendment rights.
    


            “'Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors,'” they wrote, quoting from the 2024 ruling. “And yet that is exactly what Defendants do here.”
    


            Timothy Zick, a constitutional law professor at William & Mary Law School, said the executive orders targeting private entities or individuals “have relied heavily on pressure, intimidation, and the threat of adverse action to punish or suppress speakers' views and discourage others from engaging with regulated targets.”
    


            “The unanimous holding in Vullo is tailor-made for litigants seeking to push back against the administration's coercive strategy,” Zick added.
    


            That notion was not lost on lawyers representing Harvard and faculty at Columbia University in several cases challenging Trump's attacks on the elite schools, including one brought by Harvard challenging Trump's efforts to ban the school from hosting international students. A federal judge has so far halted those efforts.
    


            In a separate case brought by Harvard over the administration's decision to freeze billions of dollars in federal funding for the nation's oldest university, the school's attorneys on Monday told a judge that Trump's decision to target it because of “alleged antisemitism and ideological bias at Harvard” clearly ran afoul of the high court's decision last year.
    


            “Although any governmental retaliation based on protected speech is an affront to the First Amendment, the retaliation here was especially unconstitutional because it was based on Harvard's ‘particular views' – the balance of speech on its campus and its refusal to accede to the Government's unlawful demands,” the attorneys wrote.

    Editor's Note: “My Happy Place,” a CNN Original Series following celebrities on deeply personal journeys, airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT. CNN also tapped correspondents to share their happy places. Bill Weir feels a world away in Buckskin Gulch in Utah.



            At first glance, the desert landscape of Southern Utah seems like a sweeping, sun-baked canvas — wide open and endless. But tucked deep within its sandstone folds are narrow slivers of magic: slot canyons, sculpted over millennia by wind and rushing water.
    


            They draw hikers from around the world, eager to wander their labyrinthine paths and stand in awe beneath towering walls sometimes just feet apart. But as alluring as they are, these canyons demand more than admiration. They require preparation and a healthy respect for nature's power.
    


            “Slot canyons are fun and easy … until they're not,” says Jim Clery, owner and guide at Utah Canyon Outdoors in Escalante, Utah. “You have to know when to say no.”
    


            Slot canyon hiking blends beauty, problem-solving and risk.
    


            “It's not just walking,” says Lura Snow, deputy operations manager for Wildland Trekking in Utah. “There's often scrambling, navigating tight squeezes, standing water — and an otherworldly quality of light that feels like you've stepped into a secret place.”
    


            Before any of that begins, there's often a stretch of open desert hiking to reach the canyon itself. Exposed to sun and heat, these approaches can be deceivingly difficult.
    


            “You're not just hopping out of the car and into the canyon,” Clery notes. “Some routes require miles of walking through dry washes or sandy trails before you even get to the slot. It's part of the journey.”
    


            For many, slot canyons evoke a sense of awe and curiosity. “There's a real sense of discovery,” says Clery. “Every turn reveals something new.”
    


            About an hour's drive east of Kanab, Utah, Buckskin Gulch — believed by many to be the longest and deepest slot canyon in the US, and possibly the world — draws hikers with its immense scale and towering canyon walls. Stretching for approximately 16 miles through a twisting corridor of sandstone, its walls can reach heights of 300 feet while narrowing to shoulder-width in places.
    


            There are a few ways to hike Buckskin Gulch, depending on how far you want to go. The most popular starting point is the Wire Pass Trailhead, which offers the quickest access to the narrows. From here, you have two main options.
    


For those up for an overnightYou can hike all the way through Buckskin Gulch to the White House Trailhead — a roughly 21-mile point-to-point trek. This route starts at Wire Pass Trailhead and travels the length of Buckskin Gulch, approximately 16 miles, before reaching its confluence with Paria Canyon.
    


            While camping is not allowed inside Buckskin Gulch, you can set up camp once you reach Paria Canyon, where dispersed backcountry camping is allowed with a valid overnight permit. Because the trail begins and ends at two different locations, arrange a shuttle in advance to return to the starting point.
    


For a shorter, more accessible optionMany hikers choose an out-and-back route starting at the Wire Pass Trailhead. The trail follows a wash for about 1.7 miles before entering Buckskin Gulch, where towering walls and deepening narrows stretch for miles.
    


            Just inside Buckskin, you'll find petroglyphs etched into the rock — look low on the right as you enter. Most hikers continue a short way into Buckskin before turning around, making this route a rewarding and flexible way to experience the canyon's scale and beauty without committing to the full 21-mile trek.
    


            Recreation.gov advises Buckskin Gulch hikers to check weather conditions and river flow before setting out. Leave your itinerary with a reliable contact who will know who to call if your group doesn't return on time.
    


            If Buckskin feels intimidating, there are other places to begin.
    


            The Peek-A-Boo and Spooky Gulch loop near Escalante, Utah, in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is one of the most popular beginner-friendly options. This three-mile route winds through sculpted sandstone, with playful climbs, squeezes and narrow passages — but no technical gear required.
    


            Peek-A-Boo greets you with smooth, swirling walls and natural steps, while Spooky Gulch challenges you with tight corridors where backpacks — and sometimes bodies — need to shimmy sideways to get through. The trickiest obstacle is a 12-foot climb to enter Peek-A-Boo, but solid handholds and good footing make it manageable. Because it's a loop, you can explore both canyons without backtracking.
    


            For those who want to ease into slot canyon hiking — or simply leave the logistics to someone else — guided trips offer an excellent alternative. Companies like Utah Canyon Outdoors and Wildland Trekking provide safety, gear, route knowledge and local insights, making it easier to focus on the experience without the stress of navigating on your own.

            Slot canyons are carved by water — and can be flooded by it in an instant. “People hear ‘flash flood' and think giant walls of water,” says Snow. “But even a relatively small amount can be deadly.”
    


            The danger? Many hikers only check the weather at the trailhead. But flash floods can be triggered by storms miles away. Buckskin Gulch, for example, drains from the Paunsaugunt Plateau near Bryce Canyon over 100 miles away, meaning a storm there can send water cascading through the canyon long after skies clear near the entrance.
    


            “Check the weather for the entire drainage,” says Snow. “Not just where you're standing.”
    


            Flash floods have caused fatalities in recent years, including two hikers who died in Buckskin Gulch in 2023.
    


            Even experienced hikers can be caught off guard by storms miles away.
    


            “You might have blue skies above you,” says Snow, “but if it's raining 50 miles away, that water can still come barreling through.”
    


            Slot canyons may feel still and silent, but they're full of surprises. Their shady, sheltered walls offer refuge for desert wildlife — from rattlesnakes and insects to the occasional tarantula.
    


            “Slot canyons are shady places, so wildlife takes refuge there,” Snow explains. She once joked about tarantulas “raining from the sky,” but it's usually just a spider dropping from a ledge — startling, not dangerous. (Tarantulas aren't considered dangerous to humans; their bite is mild and rarely causes more than minor irritation.) While rare, these encounters are reminders to stay alert and tread thoughtfully.
    


            Then there's the terrain: narrow passages, slick rock and puddles that can be deeper than expected, sometimes even requiring a swim. Water hazards and the occasional patch of quicksand are also possible, especially after storms.
    


            Trekking poles help with balance and testing depth, and sturdy shoes — and a sense of humor — go a long way. “Some people turn around at the first puddle,” Snow says. “But if this is your once-in-a-lifetime chance? Get in the puddle.”
    


            Clery adds that most injuries come from people hopping off short ledges. “Even a two-foot jump can lead to a twisted ankle. If you're wedged in a narrow canyon with a busted leg, getting out becomes a whole new problem.”

            Spring and late fall are generally the safest times to visit. Summer monsoon season (late July through September) can bring flash floods, especially in places like Buckskin. Even in dry months, storms can build quickly.
    


            “Start early,” says Clery. “In summer, we're on the trail by 6:30 a.m.. That gives us time to get in and out before the heat and storms hit.”
    


            And if the weather — or your gut — says something feels off? “Be flexible,” he says. “Have a Plan B. Nature gets the final word.”
    


            A little homework goes a long way. Try to narrow down what kind of experience you're after — short and scenic, longer and challenging, guided or solo.
    


            Check with local Bureau of Land Management (BLM) offices, visitor centers, outdoor shops or guide services for advice and current conditions. And grab a paper map — cell service can be unreliable, and batteries die.
    


            Permits are required for both day hikes and overnight trips in the Buckskin and Paria Canyon area, and both are available through Recreation.gov. A $6 day-use permit covers hikes like the popular Wire Pass route, while overnight trips into Paria Canyon require a separate permit, limited to 20 people per day. Spots can fill fast, so it's smart to plan ahead.
    


            Be sure to pack plenty of water — at least one liter per hour in summer — plus salty snacks, sun protection, a basic first-aid kit and blister care.
    


            “Desert hiking is slow, and you need to prepare for extra time,” Clery says. “We measure canyons in hours, not miles.”
    


            The rise in slot canyon popularity has brought an uptick in damage, from graffiti on petroglyphs to improperly buried waste.
    


            “People have carved their names over 8,000-year-old rock art,” Snow says. “It's ignorance, not malice, but it's heartbreaking.”
    


            Snow urges hikers to carry wag bags for human waste, use Kula cloths (reusable antimicrobial pee cloths), and pack out everything — especially toilet paper and your own poop. “Nothing breaks down here,” she says. “It's the desert. It'll be here forever.”
    


            Your decisions can have unintended consequences long after you leave.
    


            Even camping comes with a lasting impact. A single off-road vehicle can create a new track others will follow, slowly turning wild land into a road.
    


            Clery's advice? Stick to established sites. Stay on durable surfaces. And if you really love a place, pick up someone else's trash on your way out.
    


            Because in the end, exploring slot canyons isn't just about seeing something beautiful — it's about being part of something bigger.
    


            It's about traveling with intention, moving with care, and respecting the delicate power of these hidden places.
    


            But wherever you go, says Clery, “Don't expect to just show up and be spoon-fed a view. Slot canyons are immersive. They're humbling. They make you pay attention — and in return, they give you something unforgettable.”

Fox News contributor Richard Fowler and National Review editor-in-chief Rich Lowry join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss Trump's funding battle with Harvard.

A federal judge in Massachusetts on Thursday granted Harvard University's emergency request to block, for now, the Trump administration's effort to ban international students from its campus, siding with Harvard in ruling that the university would likely suffer "immediate and irreparable harm" if enforced.

The temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs blocks the administration from immediately stripping Harvard of its certification status under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, or SEVP — a program run by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that allows universities to sponsor international students for U.S. visas.

Burroughs said in her order that Harvard has demonstrated evidence it "will suffer immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hear from all parties," prompting her to temporarily block the SEVP revocation. 

Still, some see the order as a mere Band-Aid, forestalling a larger court fight between Harvard and the Trump administration — and one that Trump critics say could be unfairly weighted against the nation's oldest university.

"Ultimately, this is about Trump trying to impose his view of the world on everybody else," Harvard Law professor Noah Feldman said in a radio interview discussing the Trump administration's actions. 

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the administration has frozen more than $2 billion in grants and contracts awarded to the university. It is also targeting the university with investigations led by six separate federal agencies. 

Combined, these actions have created a wide degree of uncertainty at Harvard.

The temporary restraining order handed down on Thursday night is also just that — temporary. Though the decision does block Trump from revoking Harvard's SEVP status, it's a near-term fix, designed to allow the merits of the case to be more fully heard.

Meanwhile, the administration is almost certain to appeal the case to higher courts, which could be more inclined to side in favor of the administration.

And that's just the procedural angle.

Should Harvard lose its status for SEVP certification — a certification it has held for some 70 years — the thousands of international students currently enrolled at Harvard would have a very narrow window to either transfer to another U.S. university, or risk losing their student visas within 180 days, experts told Fox News. 

Some may opt not to take that chance, and transfer to a different school that's less likely to be targeted by the administration — even if it means sacrificing, for certainty, a certain level of prestige.

Regardless of how the court rules, these actions create "a chilling effect" for international students at Harvard, Aram Gavoor, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School and a former Justice Department attorney, said in an interview.

Students "who would otherwise be attending or applying to Harvard University [could be] less inclined to do so, or to make alternative plans for their education In the U.S.," Gavoor said. 

Even if the Trump administration loses on the merits of the case, "there's a point to be argued that it may have won as a function of policy," Gavoor said.

Meanwhile, any financial fallout the school might see as a result is another matter entirely.

Though the uncertainty yielded by Trump's fight against Harvard could prove damaging to the school's priority of maintaining a diverse international student body, or by offering financial aid to students via the federally operated Pell Grant, these actions alone would unlikely to prove financially devastating in the near-term, experts told Fox News. 

Harvard could simply opt to fill the slots once taken by international students with any number of eager, well-qualified U.S.-based applicants, David Feldman, a professor at William & Mary who focuses on economic issues and higher education, said in an interview. 

Harvard is one of just a handful of American universities that has a "need-blind" admissions policy for domestic and international students — that is, they do not take into consideration a student's financial need or the aid required in weighing a potential applicant. But because international students in the U.S. typically require more aid than domestic students, replacing their slots with domestic students, in the near-term, would likely have little noticeable impact on the revenue it receives for tuition, fees and housing, he said. 

"This is all about Harvard, choosing the best group of students possible," Feldman said in an interview. If the administration successfully revokes their SEVP certification, this would effectively just be "constraining them to choose the second-best group," he said.

"Harvard could dump the entire 1,500-person entering class, just dump it completely, and look at the next 1,500 [applicants]," Feldman said. "And by all measurables that you and I would look at, it would look just as good."

Unlike public schools, which are subject to the vagaries of state budgets, private universities like Harvard often have margins built into their budgets in the form of seed money that allows them to allocate more money towards things they've identified as goals for the year or years ahead.

This allows them to operate with more stability as a result — and inoculates them to a larger degree from the administration's financial hits.

"Uncertainty is bad for them," Feldman acknowledged. But at the end of the day, he said, "these institutions have the capacity to resist."

"They would rather not — they would rather this whole thing go away," Feldman said. But the big takeaway, in his view, is that Harvard "is not defenseless."

MOUNTAIN LAKES, New Jersey — New Jersey Republicans are confident they will win the gubernatorial race this year after the state GOP came within three points of doing so the last go-round

Both sides of the aisle have open, crowded primaries, but Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker and three-time gubernatorial candidate, is emerging as a top contender for the GOP side. In the 2021 gubernatorial race, Ciattarelli came within three points of making Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) a one-term governor.

Political tides appear to be trending in Republicans' favor in the Garden State. In the 2024 general election, former Vice President Kamala Harris received about 52% of the state's vote, and President Donald Trump received about 46% — the closest a Republican got to winning the state since former President George H.W. Bush came within 2.5 points in 1992.

Swing state Arizona had nearly the inverse of these numbers and flipped blue in 2024, with 52% of voters supporting Trump and 47% supporting Harris. Both campaigns rallied heavily in Arizona, but Trump, who made just one trip to the state early in his campaign, was able to come within five points of winning it.

“Republicans are bullish on 2025,” Adam Geller, a Republican pollster based in New Jersey, told the Washington Examiner. “[Ciattarelli] came closer than most people expected in 2021, as did President Trump in 2024.”

Republicans also have voter registration numbers on their side. Since former President Joe Biden took office in 2021, New Jersey voters have increasingly registered with the Republican Party. In 2020, New Jersey Democrats had an advantage of more than a million voters, but that advantage has since dwindled down to a little more than 896,300 registered voters as of January.

Ciattarelli appears to be the front-runner in the GOP primary, and his nomination seems all but certain after Trump gave him his “Complete and Total Endorsement” in the race. Other Republicans are still in the running but do not appear to have high levels of support, according to polling. 

Democrats are in a six-way race, with Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), a veteran and self-described “pragmatic progressive,” polling as a slight favorite. Other candidates polling closely behind her include Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), a moderate House Democrat, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, who is running a policy-focused campaign, and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, the farthest left of the Democratic candidates.

Except for Ocean County, which is the most Republican-leaning New Jersey county as of 2024 and has backed radio host Bill Spadea, every county's Republican Party has supported Ciattarelli's campaign.

“Ciattarelli has pulled away a long time ago and kind of never looked back,” state Assembly Minority Whip Brian Bergen, a Republican who represents a northern New Jersey district, told the Washington Examiner.

“One of the reasons is Jack laid so much groundwork in 2021 when he ran, he had a real challenge on his hands. He had to combat Phil Murphy's name ID,” Bergen said, noting that Murphy was consistently in the press during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bergen, who is backing Ciattarelli in the primary, said he is the “best person for this job on the Republican side, there's no doubt he is ready to go. He is a great person. He is an extremely brilliant lawmaker. He was a business person, and he also doesn't just invest in himself — he invests in others around him.”

Despite the public optimism, Republicans are also facing headwinds outside their control in New Jersey, including Trump's ability to turn out low-propensity voters that other candidates cannot. 

“We can't expect all the people who voted for Trump to vote for our Republican candidates. People voted for Trump and then went back to ordinary business, if you look down the ballot,” Bergen said. “I've been trying to caution people not to believe that the Trump numbers are their numbers.”

Statewide races are also expensive in New Jersey because candidates must buy into the pricey New York and Philadelphia TV markets, because the Garden State, located between the two cities, does not have a TV market. According to an analysis from AdImpact, this gubernatorial race is already the most expensive election in New Jersey political history, with ad spending crossing $85 million as of Wednesday. The New York City market has seen $57.6M spent in ads, and the Philadelphia market has seen $19.7 million. 

Democrats have far outspent all Republican candidates on advertising. So far, Gottheimer has spent the most, $22.8 million. Fulop has spent $17.8 million, and Sherrill has spent $11.4 million. Ciattarelli has spent just under $6 million. 

Advertising on behalf of Democrats has accounted for 88% of all primary spending. Trump has been a consistent theme in ads across both parties, as the analysis found the president has been mentioned in 70% of all broadcast spots aired. Sherrill, Baraka, and Gottheimer's broadcast ads all mention Trump.

However, if history repeats, Republicans might be out of luck this election. In New Jersey, whichever party won the presidential race the year prior, in this case the Republican Party, typically loses gubernatorial elections in the following year as voters buck the party in power in Washington, D.C.

THE NEXT SWING STATE? REPUBLICANS BELIEVE IT COULD BE NEW JERSEY

“It's a pretty clear pattern: If the Democrats are in control of the White House, the Republicans do better here. If the Republicans control the White House, the Democrats seem to do better here,” State Senate Minority Leader Anthony Bucco, a Republican, previously told the Washington Examiner. “Here in New Jersey, the party that is out of power really does better.”

But, by that logic, patterns can also work against the Democrats. With Murphy's term nearing its end, New Jersey residents have not voted in three consecutive gubernatorial races for a Democrat since 1961, when Democrat Richard Hughes was voted to replace former two-term Democratic Gov. Robert Meyner.

            We live in the golden age of grift. Most of us can't go a day without at least one scammy text about an unpaid toll or a call from an unknown number with a shockingly human-like AI voice on the other side.
    


            The scale of the scam onslaught feels like it's part of some Faustian bargain we all entered into: In exchange for the miracle of, like, access to all the world's knowledge and people in our pockets, all the world's knowledge and people similarly have access to us, including the hustlers and the con artists. But way more hustlers, con artists and grifters than any other generation of human beings on Earth has ever had to comprehend before, let alone fend off.
    


            Thankfully, all the scam spam doesn't seem to have killed anyone's appetite for the grift as a genre. Elizabeth Holmes' Theranos con? I'll take a book, a podcast, a documentary and at least one serialized streaming project, please. Lifting the veil on a doomsday cult? I'm in, every day, and twice on Sundays. Never forget: We once had two dueling Fyre Festival documentaries on Hulu and Netflix.
    


            OK, maybe I'm just a mark for tales of clever cons, exposed. This newsletter is, in part, an outlet for my own fascination with the business hype cycle, which tends to, you know, exaggerate the truth. Or straight-up lie.



            But (thanks again to the miracle of the internet), I know that I'm not alone.
    


            Alex Falcone, an LA-based comedian, is a fellow con connoisseur (a con-noisseur?). Through his TikTok channel, Falcone excels at the art of the two-minute explainer, tackling frauds big (AI) and small (white chocolate).
    


            Falcone says he isn't a journalist, but he approaches his work with a similar hunger to peek behind the facade of a thing and expose it. Of his early foray into “unfun facts,” Falcone says, he wanted to find the intersection of “a little bit of a wet blanket, but you're OK afterwards… I don't like ruining people's day.”
    


            He's hit a nerve on TikTok, where he has more than half a million followers and a popular recurring series called “Is it a scam? Yep.” (The delivery here is crucial: “Is-it-a-scamyep!”) The schtick is fast-talking facts and plenty of jokes about the companies and people and concepts that are, in one way or another, selling a bill of goods.
    


            I caught up with Falcone recently over Zoom to discuss the businesses of grift, comedy and journalism.
    


The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.



Nightcap: Can you tell me how you got on the scam beat?



Alex Falcone: I've always liked the scheme-y underbelly. My grandfather worked in a few different contexts in carnivals, but the bulk of his life he was a pitchman, setting up a table by the midway selling kitchen gadgets and magic tricks. My dad's first job was as a kid standing in the audience while his father demonstrated a magic trick then yelling, “How did he do that? I'll take two!”
    


            I met a con man when I was 16, and he taught me how to do card-cheating and pool-sharking stuff… and, like, mostly didn't use it for evil. I just like knowing how it works. It's sort of like the glass elevator where you see the mechanism behind it. Like, how am I being manipulated?
    


            I was working on “unfun facts,” which is like the opposite of a party trick. My party-ruiner is telling people something that's going to bum them out that they didn't know. And that, it turns out, had a lot of overlap with my interest in things that were slightly crime-y.
    


Nightcap: Why do you think people on TikTok have been so receptive to the scam series?



Falcone: I think everybody is vaguely aware that they're walking around in a haunted carnival all the time — that everybody is trying to take advantage of them.
    


            If you're at a midway, then you know the basketball hoop is harder than other basketball hoops. Otherwise they wouldn't give you stuffed animals for making one free throw. Why is that? It's because it's 11 feet, and it's not perfectly round… and you know that it's wrong, but then it's still fun to be like, “Oh, that's how you were getting me.”
    


Nightcap: Do you find yourself, or your audience, experiencing scam fatigue? 



Falcone: So this is the trick. By slightly redefining what “scam” means, it allows me to keep finding new ways to talk about things instead of just being bummed out.
    


            Whenever I'm tired of talking about AI or crypto, I can do an episode on white chocolate.
    


Nightcap: Ugh, such a scam! 



Falcone: It's disgusting! It was originally invented as a medical coating for pills. And then they were like, “we can sell this because we have all this extra cocoa butter lying around, and we can mix it with palm oil, which we've cut down the rainforest to make, and now we have too much of it.”
    


            Every step of that is terrifying, but also it tastes like cat vomit. So that's inherently funny.
    


            That's my palate cleanser. I have an escape valve for a lot of this.
    


            Actually, if you hadn't asked that, I would have asked you the same question… How do you avoid getting bummed out by this? Are all of your colleagues just sort of zombie-brained now?
    


Nightcap: There's a bit of zombie-brain going around. I will say I spend a good amount of time — like a shameful amount of time — disassociating on TikTok.



Falcone: I think that's great… There are a lot of problems with the way algorithms work, but one of the things that's great is you can just create an account with a new name, a fresh algorithm, and decide this algorithm is just for escapism.
    


            I did a video about algorithms a while ago, and so as a demonstration I decided to make an account for videos about bunnies. In TikTok, it took me 15 minutes before the algorithm was just rabbits and nothing else… So that is one of the ways that I've kept myself sane — having multiple algorithms that I play with depending on my mood. Having a rabbit account as a side project is really fun.
    


Nightcap: You've covered AI hype and marketing a few times…



Falcone: It feels like there's an emperor-has-no clothes situation — that we're all just waiting for somebody to be like, Oh, wait, it's bad! Oh… we thought so, and then you told us we were dumb for thinking that it's not working, but it is actually bad.



Nightcap: How do you source your scam material? 



Falcone: I have what I think of as the mainline scam, where the answer is “yep,” and I just have a backlog of those.
    


            Occasionally, stuff from friends pops up. Somebody mentioned to me the other day that the Oscars were originally started to prevent actors from unionizing, which I assumed couldn't possibly be true. But it turns out, [Louis B. Mayer] of MGM was the founder of the academy, and that was what he said he was doing. (Editor's note: This checks out.)
    


            The user submissions have a separate path, because the answer to “Is it a scam?” can sometimes be “no.”
    


Nightcap: I was so nervous when I came across one of your videos about Costco. Please don't ruin Costco!



Falcone: Costco was a great “nope.” The thing about Costco, and this is true of a lot of these things, is it's not a scam, but it's definitely a scheme. You have to pay to shop, which is such a crazy business model. You pay to walk in the door of a store where everything still costs money. That's definitely a scheme. But I don't think it's a scam.
    


            Now I have 100-150 messages every day on the different platforms, asking “can you look into this thing for me” … But the main source is just things that I'm generally mad about in my own life. I have plenty of those to keep this going for another couple years.

            US President Donald Trump said Chinese leader Xi Jinping has agreed to restart the flow of crucial rare earth materials, after announcing a new round of US-China trade talks will be held in London on Monday.
    


            Trump made the comments a day after holding his long-awaited phone call with Xi, during which the two leaders agreed to resume negotiations stalled over mutual accusations of violating the truce reached in Geneva last month.
    


            For Washington, a major sticking point has been China's export restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets, which are essential for everything from cars to fighter jets, and critical to American industries and defense.
    


            In the weeks since the fragile detente, Washington has accused Beijing of slow-walking approvals for rare earth exports and reneging on its promise made in Geneva, with Trump expressing increasing urgency to speak to his Chinese counterpart to iron things out.
    


            After a 90-minute call on Thursday, Trump said he and Xi had “straightened out” some points related to rare earth magnets, describing it as “very complex stuff.” But he did not specify what exactly had been agreed upon.
    


            Asked Friday if Xi had agreed to restart the flow of rare earth minerals and magnets, Trump told reporters abroad Air Force One: “Yes, he did.” He did not further elaborate on how fast that would happen, or the volume of the materials that would be released.
    


            The Chinese readout of the call did not mention rare earths. Instead, it quoted Xi as saying that China had “seriously and earnestly” complied with the trade truce agreement.
    


            Asked about it at the Chinese foreign ministry's daily briefing on Friday, a spokesperson sidestepped the question, saying it was a matter for other agencies to address.
    


            China, which controls 90% of the global processing of rare earths, imposed export restrictions on some minerals and magnets on April 4 at the height of the tariff war, after Trump slapped “reciprocal” levies on Chinese goods. The new system does not ban exports outright, but requires government approval for each shipment.
    


            Chinese scholars who advise the government suggested on Thursday that Beijing is not ready to give up the powerful leverage bestowed by its dominance on the rare earth supply chain – and may seek to use it to get Washington to ease its own export controls aimed at blocking China's access to advanced US semiconductors and technologies.
    


            While American businesses are likely to see more shipments approved in the next couple of weeks, the export licensing regime is here to stay, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.
    


            He noted that, according to official rules set by China's Commerce Ministry, applications for export licenses can take up to 45 working days to be approved.
    


            “In principle, I can agree to export to you, but I can speed things up or slow them down. In reality, on a technical level, it also depends on the overall bilateral trade and economic atmosphere,” he said. “If the bilateral relationship is good, then I'll go a bit faster; if not, I'll slow down. But you can't say I'm violating the agreement – I'm still following the standard procedures.”
    


            Some Chinese suppliers of US companies have recently received six-month export licenses, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said Friday, but it noted that uncertainty remains amid a large backlog of license applications.
    


            Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said the importance Trump attaches to rare earths shows how effective China's “rare earth card” is.
    


            “I hadn't realized just how important this rare earth card was before. Now the US side is clearly anxious and eager to resolve this issue,” he said in a video on social media on Thursday. “But of course, we'll link this issue to others – the US is restricting China on chips and jet engines, then China certainly has every reason to make use of this card.”
    


            “As for whether China will change its rare earth export control policy, that probably still needs to be negotiated in more detail” Jin added.

            Some Chinese scholars have expressed hope that US technology restrictions on China may now be up for negotiation, after Trump announced that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick – whose department overseas US export controls – will join Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in the next round of trade talks.
    


            “The issue of US export controls may no longer be an area that is completely non-negotiable in the future,” Cui Fan, an economics professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and advisor to the Chinese Commerce Ministry, wrote in a social media post.
    


            Beijing has insisted that its export controls are in line with international practices, non-discriminatory and not targeted at any specific country.
    


            Hours before the two leaders jumped on the phone on Thursday, a spokesperson for China's commerce ministry reiterated that stance at a regular news conference, citing the “clear dual-use attributes” of rare earth materials. Dual-use items refer to those with both civilian and military applications.
    


            “The Chinese government reviews export license applications for dual-use items in accordance with laws and regulations, and for applications that meet the requirements, China will grant approval to promote and facilitate compliant trade,” spokesperson He Yongqian said.
    


            The strict licensing system has significantly disrupted the global supplies of these materials and triggered production turmoil across industries in America and Europe, raising alarms among officials and businesses alike.
    


            A survey of member companies conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China late week found that, among those affected by rare earth export controls, 75% say their stock would run out within three months.
    


            Following a meeting in Paris this week, the European Union's trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said he informed Chinese commerce minister Wang Wentao about the “alarming situation in the European car industry” as a result of China's rare earth throttlehold.
    


            In a statement Saturday, China's commerce ministry said that during his visit to Europe, Wang pledged to address the EU's concerns and establish a “green channel” for eligible applications to expedite approvals.

Charles Barkley calls the NCAA 'idiots' and 'fools' during an appearance on OutKick's "Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich."

A federal judge granted final approval on Friday to the $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to begin paying athletes directly.

Judge Claudia Wilken approved the settlement on Friday that will allow schools to pay their athletes next month.

The sweeping terms of the so-called House settlement include approval for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion that will be paid over the next decade to thousands of former players who were barred from that revenue for years.

Payouts will be determined based on the sport and the length of athletic career, with most football and men's basketball players able to receive nearly $135,000 each.

However, the highest estimated payout is expected to be nearly $2 million, thanks to "Lost NIL Opportunities," according to the law firm.

Nearly five years after Arizona State swimmer Grant House sued the NCAA and its five biggest conferences to lift restrictions on revenue sharing, Wilken approved the final proposal that had been hung up on roster limits, just one of many changes ahead amid concerns that thousands of walk-on athletes will lose their chance to play college sports.

The deal covers three antitrust cases — including the class-action lawsuit known as House vs. the NCAA — that challenged NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016. The plaintiffs claimed that NCAA rules denied thousands of athletes the opportunity to earn millions of dollars off the use of their names, images and likenesses.

SIMONE BILES SPARS WITH RILEY GAINES OVER TRANS ATHLETE DEBATE, LAUNCHES PERSONAL ATTACK: 'TRULY SICK'

The NCAA lifted its ban on athletes earning money through endorsement and sponsorship deals in 2021.

At one point, President Donald Trump was considering an executive order to regulate name, image and likeness in college sports after meeting with legendary Alabama Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban, the Wall Street Journal reported.

On Fox News last year, Saban urged Congress to step in and make NIL "equal across the board."

"And I think that should still exist for all players, but not just a pay-for-play system like we have now where whoever raises the most money in their collective can pay the most for the players, which is not a level playing field. I think in any competitive venue, you want to have some guidelines that gives everyone an equal opportunity to have a chance to be successful," he said.

The settlement also called for a clearinghouse to make sure any NIL deal worth more than $600 is pegged at fair market value in an attempt to thwart supposed pay-for-play deals.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tyler Fitzgerald scored on a wild pitch by Pierce Johnson with two outs in the 10th inning and the San Francisco Giants beat the Atlanta Braves 5-4 on Friday night for their third straight win.

After getting picked off first to end the ninth, Fitzgerald began the 10th on second base. He advanced to third on a one-groundout and then scored when Johnson (1-2) threw a 1-2 pitch to the backstop, sending the Braves to their fifth straight loss.

Spencer Bivens (2-2) came on with the bases loaded in the 10th and got Luke Williams on a groundout to end the inning for the win. 

Craig Kimbrel, the Braves' career leader in saves, made his first appearance for Atlanta since the 2014 season when he entered the game in the seventh. He allowed a leadoff single to Heliot Ramos, but got bailed out when Sean Murphy threw out Ramos trying to steal second to keep it tied at 4. 

Kimbrel then walked Jung Hoo Lee, but picked him off first and then struck out Wilmer Flores to get out of the inning. 

The Giants' struggling offense produced three runs in the first with help from two errors by Atlanta and a run-scoring wild pitch thrown by Spencer Schwellenbach.

San Francisco led 4-2 before the Braves tied it in the seventh when Matt Olson hit a two-run homer off reliever Ryan Walker.

There was an odd moment in the fourth inning when Murphy hit a sacrifice fly to right with the bases loaded for Atlanta. Olson easily beat the throw by Mike Yastrzemski, but there was confusion because a ball had been thrown on the field by a fan in the stands. The umpires huddled to discuss it, but let the play stand.




Both teams played their 26th one-run game, tied for the most in the majors. The Giants improved to 14-12 in those games and the Braves fell to 9-17. 

RHP Bryce Elder (2-3, 4.56 ERA) will start the middle game of the series for Atlanta against RHP Logan Webb (5-5, 2.55).

            The Texas Longhorns won the Women's College World Series in dominant fashion, blowing out Texas Tech 10-4 in Friday's winner-take-all Game 3 to clinch the program's first-ever national championship in softball.
    


            Despite Red Raiders superstar pitcher NiJaree Canady returning to the pitcher's mound after her complete-game win on Thursday, the Longhorns did not back down from the challenge to face one of softball's best players.
    


            Texas lit up the junior righthander, scoring five runs in the first inning, knocking the 21-year-old, two-time first team All-American out of the game early.
    


            A dejected Canady, who made national headlines earlier on Friday, after signing a second $1 million-plus NIL deal to keep her in Lubbock, Texas, for her senior year, according to the Associated Press, allowed the most runs in an inning in her illustrious career that started at Stanford.
    


            After left fielder Katie Stewart added another Texas run to extend the lead to 6-0 in the third inning, it was third baseman Mia Scott who made the biggest name for herself.
    


            In the fourth inning, the senior mashed a grand slam to break the game open with a 10-0 lead.
    


            Scott garnered the respect of Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback and Texas Tech alum Patrick Mahomes, who was at Devon Park in Oklahoma City watching his alma mater along with his wife, Brittany.
    

3rd baseman for Texas is cold..


            Like Mahomes has done many times in his career, the Red Raiders put forth a valid effort to get back into the game.
    


            Tech scored three runs in the fifth inning while adding another in the seventh inning, but it proved to be too little, too late after Longhorns starting pitcher Teagan Kavan got Lauren Allred to ground out to seal the victory.
    


            Texas players rushed the mound to embrace Kavan, who threw a masterful complete game, striking out three and allowing eight hits.
    


            The sophomore said being able to get the final out for the team “meant the world.”
    


            “I'm so happy for this team,” Kavan told the ESPN broadcast. “We did it. First Natty. Let's go! My grandma, the last thing she told my brother – one of the last things was to bring home a victory and we did that for her.”
    


            Texas head coach Mike White said that it was “surreal” to finally be lifting the trophy after coming to the school ahead of the 2019 season.
    


            “I can't believe its happened. … For us to come out on top tonight – we're so close to being knocked out. I am speechless to tell you the truth. It doesn't happen very often. But I am so proud of our ladies.”
    


            Texas had lost to Oklahoma in the championship series two of the last three years. The Sooners, who were looking to win their fifth straight title, were defeated by the Longhorns earlier in the tournament.
    


            White added that “in order to be the best, you got to beat the best” while calling Canady “tough and special.”

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, has been returned to the United States to face federal criminal charges, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday.
    


            For months, the Trump administration has been locked in an intense standoff with the federal judiciary over court orders for the government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, where he was mistakenly deported in mid-March, in a situation that one federal judge warned could present an “incipient crisis” between the two branches.
    


            Abrego Garcia has been indicted on two criminal counts in the Middle District of Tennessee: conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.
    


            The indictment unsealed Friday afternoon accuses Abrego Garcia and others of partaking in a conspiracy in recent years in which they “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens who had no authorization to be present in the United States, and many of whom were MS-13 members and associates.”
    


            Abrego Garcia and his family say he fled gang violence in El Salvador and have denied allegations he's associated with MS-13.

How Kilmar Abrego Garcia's case became a political flashpoint



            The White House signed off on the decision to return Abrego Garcia to the US to face criminal charges, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The decision to return Abrego Garcia was made in the last few days, the sources said. The State Department was also involved in the decision-making, one of the sources said.
    


            However, President Donald Trump on Friday praised Bondi and the Justice Department for Abrego Garcia's return, and he said it was the department's decision to bring him back.
    


            “He should have never had to be returned, take a look at what's happened with it. Take a look at what they found in the grand jury,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. “I thought Pam Bondi did a great job.”
    


            While Trump administration officials pointed to the charges as justifying their effort to remove Abrego Garcia from the United States, the decision to prosecute prompted the resignation of the chief of the Justice Department's criminal division in Nashville, people briefed on the matter told CNN.
    


            Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, accused the Trump administration of “playing games” with the legal system and said his client should appear in immigration court, not criminal court.
    


            “The government disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order. Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him. This shows that they were playing games with the court all along,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement to CNN. “Due process means the chance to defend yourself before you're punished, not after. This is an abuse of power, not justice.”
    


ABC News first reported that Abrego Garcia was en route to the US.
    


            “Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,” Bondi said as she announced the charges at a news conference on Friday. She thanked Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele for agreeing to return Abrego Garcia to the US to face prosecution.
    


            The allegations date back to 2016 and involve a half-dozen alleged unnamed co-conspirators, with one, identified as CC-6 of Guatemala, described as being a “primary sources of supply of undocumented aliens for the conspiracy.”
    


            The conspiracy allegations outline how, over the years, Abrego Garcia and others worked to move undocumented aliens between Texas and Maryland and other states more than 100 times.
    


            Working with another co-conspirator, referred to as CC-1, Abrego Garcia and that unnamed individual “ordinarily picked up the undocumented aliens in the Houston, Texas area after the aliens had unlawfully crossed the Southern border of the United States from Mexico,” the indictment said.
    


            The two “then transported the undocumented aliens from Texas to other parts of the United States to further the aliens' unlawful presence in the United States.”
    


            Prosecutors said in the indictment that to cover up the alleged conspiracy, Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators “routinely devised and employed knowingly false cover stories to provide to law enforcement if they were stopped during a transport,” including claims that the migrants being transported were headed to construction jobs.
    


            Though prosecutors portrayed Abrego Garcia as being central to a crime-driven conspiracy, they did not describe him as the mastermind of the yearslong plot. Instead, he's identified as just one part of a sprawling conspiracy that was led by an unnamed co-conspirator.
    


            His conspiracy charges specifically relate to a trip in November 2022 where Abrego Garcia is accused of driving a Chevrolet Suburban and was pulled over on a Tennessee interstate highway, with nine other Hispanic male passengers who didn't have any identification or luggage.
    


            The indictment also describes the co-conspirator CC-1 as being part of an alleged scheme of transferring money alongside Abrego Garcia. Another co-conspirator, CC-2, is alleged with Abrego Garcia and another co-conspirator to have managed the cell phones of undocumented aliens “to ensure (they) could not and would not contact anyone else during the trip” within the US.
    


            Prosecutors allege that Abrego Garcia also transported narcotics to Maryland, though he wasn't charged with any crimes related to illegal drugs.
    


            Federal Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Nashville, Tennessee, determined that Abrego Garcia will be held in custody until at least next Friday, when there will be an arraignment and detention hearing, the Associated Press reported.
    


            Abrego Garcia appeared in court wearing a short-sleeved, white, button-down shirt, according to the AP. When asked if he understood the charges, he told the judge: “Sí. Lo entiendo.” An interpreter then said: “Yes. I understand.”
    


            The chief of Justice Department's criminal division in Nashville resigned over the decision to charge Abrego Garcia, people briefed on the matter said.
    


            The Justice Department's push to pursue human trafficking charges against Abrego Garcia had caused some disagreement among prosecutors in the Nashville US attorney's office, sources said.
    


            Ben Schrader, the chief of the criminal division in the US Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee, resigned the same week of the grand jury indictment last month.
    


            He posted a message on LinkedIn, which did not mention the Abrego Garcia case, saying he had resigned after nearly 15 years. Schrader added, “It has been an incredible privilege to serve as a prosecutor with the Department of Justice, where the only job description I've ever known is to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons.”
    


            Schrader, the Nashville US attorney's office and the Justice Department headquarters declined comment to CNN.
    


            A US official pointed CNN to the seriousness of the allegations in the indictment and said the administration's priority to pursue immigration enforcement means that anyone who didn't want to be a part of the use priorities can leave.
    


            Democratic lawmakers celebrated Abrego Garcia's return, while criticizing the Trump administration for deporting him in the first place and denying due process.
    


            “As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights – and the rights of all. The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along,” said Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador earlier this year.
    


            Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost said constitutional rights “are not subject to the whims of any president, past or present.”
    


            Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington said, “Mr. Abrego Garcia was kidnapped in front of his young child, and disappeared to El Salvador with no due process,” referring to the March traffic stop during which Abrego Gacia was taken into custody while his son was in the car.
    


            Republican members of Congress have commented publicly, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio thanked Bukele and Bondi in a Friday post on X, saying Abrego Garcia's can now “face justice for his crimes.”
    


            Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported in March to El Salvador due to an “administrative error,” according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. He was sent to the country's notorious mega-prison where he was held for weeks before being moved to another facility.
    


            The case became a political lightning rod for the Trump administration and its deportation program, while Trump's shifting rhetoric about whether he could return the Maryland father had raised questions about the administration's willingness to comply with the courts.
    


            But the administration's initial acknowledgement in a court filing that it mistakenly deported him opened it up to heightened scrutiny, even among Republicans otherwise supportive of Trump's agenda.
    


            Across the aisle, Van Hollen drew headlines when he visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, but his party has debated how much to embrace the Salvadoran national's removal and the due process argument as a rallying cry of opposition to the administration.
    


            Trump had said this spring that he could secure Abrego Garcia's return – contradicting previous remarks made by him and his top aides who said the US did not have the ability to bring him back because he was in the custody of a foreign government, despite the Supreme Court ruling that the Trump administration must “facilitate” his return.
    


            The administration's posture and legal arguments in the case had consistently frustrated both conservative and liberal jurists alike, who raised alarm bells about officials' apparent disregard for due process rights given their cavalier response to the deportation, which several different administration lawyers described as an “administrative error” that they were powerless to rectify.
    


            In April, for instance, Bondi insisted that Abrego Garcia “is not coming back to our country.”
    


            Bukele and Trump previously made clear during an April Oval Office meeting that Abrego Garcia would not be returned to the US. But on Friday, he said in a post on X: “We work with the Trump administration, and if they request the return of a gang member to face charges, of course we wouldn't refuse.”
    


            US District Judge Paula Xinis has allowed a fact-finding process to unfold so she can figure out what the government has been doing to comply with her directive that officials bring Abrego Garcia back to the US. But the case largely faded into the background in recent weeks as that discovery process has dragged on mostly out of public view.
    


            In the Maryland case, the Justice Department told the judge on Friday that they had complied with her order to bring Abrego Garcia back to the US, in a bid to end the political standoff that had put pressure on administration attorneys in court.
    


            “Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States today, to stand trial on criminal charges in the Middle District of Tennessee. Considering this development, the Court's preliminary injunction should be dissolved, and the underlying case should be dismissed as moot,” DOJ attorneys wrote in a brief filing.
    


            Abrego Garcia's return is far from a guarantee that he will remain in the US long-term. The administration's decision to deport him to El Salvador violated a 2019 order from a judge that said he could not be deported to his home country because of fears that he would face gang violence.

            That mandate, however, did not preclude the government from removing him to a third country. Officials have previously said if he were returned to the US, they may deport him to another country or attempt to wipe away the 2019 order.
    


            Abrego Garica's case this year went all the way to the Supreme Court, where the justices in April required the administration to “facilitate” his return but not “effectuate” it. That somewhat cryptic language allowed the administration to claim a victory for weeks as Abrego Garcia remained in detention.
    


            The Supreme Court did not give the administration a deadline for when Abrego Garcia should be returned. The opinion was unsigned and no dissents were noted.
    


            As the Trump administration continues its aggressive crackdown on immigration, it has been accused of wrongly deporting at least two other men. Earlier this week, one of the men — a Guatemalan national who was hastily deported to Mexico — was returned to the US.

KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA RETURNS TO THE US — BUT NOT THE WAY HIS SUPPORTERS WANTED. For two months, Democrats have agitated on behalf of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant, alleged gang member, and suspected human trafficker whom the Trump administration deported to El Salvador. Picked up by police in Maryland in 2019, Abrego Garcia was given a deportation order on the basis of his unlawful presence in the United States and gang activity. But the immigration judge specifically ordered that Abrego Garcia not be deported to his home country of El Salvador, where Abrego Garcia claimed he would be in danger.

As it turned out, Abrego Garcia never went anywhere until March of this year, when he was arrested as part of the new Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants who have received deportation orders. But as everyone knows, U.S. authorities deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — precisely where the judge had said he should not be sent.

The Trump administration admitted it made a mistake but also maintained that once Abrego Garcia was in prison in El Salvador, the U.S. had little power to bring him back. By then, many Democrats had turned Abrego Garcia into an anti-Trump cause. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador and said he passed on a “message of love” from Abrego Garcia's wife to Kilmar. Van Hollen assured reporters that all the efforts to bring Abrego Garcia home, plus his family's love, gave Abrego Garcia “the strength to persevere.” For many Democrats, activists, and their allies in the media, it was a touching story.

Not long after, though, the administration passed on information about Abrego Garcia's alleged gang activities and allegations he had abused his wife, who had sought protective orders against him. And then came information that he had been stopped driving in Tennessee in 2022 with a car full of what appeared to be illegal immigrants. 

The Tennessee story looked quite suspicious. “On December 1, 2022, subject was observed speeding and unable to maintain its lane and was subsequently pulled over,” police documents said. “Upon approach to the vehicle, encountering officer noted that there were eight other individuals in the vehicle with the subject, who was identified as the driver. Subject stated he was driving ‘three days ago' from Houston, TX to Temple Hills, MD to bring in people to perform construction work. There was no luggage in the vehicle, leading the encountering officer to suspect this was a human trafficking incident. All the passengers gave the same home address as the subject's home address. During the interview, subject pretended to speak less English than he was capable of and attempted to put encountering officer off-track by responding to questions with questions.”

It very quickly appeared that the Tennessee matter might become a serious problem for Abrego Garcia and his supporters. And now, that has turned out to be the case. On Friday afternoon, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that federal prosecutors in Tennessee have indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts of human smuggling. 

Prosecutors allege that Abrego Garcia, acting with several coconspirators, “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens who had no authorization to be present in the United States, and many of whom were MS-13 members and associates.” There were more than 100 trips in all, prosecutors say. The indictment also alleges that Abrego Garcia “worked with transnational criminal organizations in Mexico to transport undocumented aliens through Mexico and into the United States.”

The indictment refers to Abrego Garcia's alleged coconspirators as “CC-1” and “CC-2,” etc., and gives readers an idea of how the scheme worked. For example, CC-1 was at one time imprisoned for alien smuggling. During CC-1's time in jail, CC-1 directed another coconspirator, CC-2, to work with Abrego Garcia to transport illegal immigrants deep inside the U.S. When CC-1 was released from prison and deported, he turned around and illegally reentered the U.S. and returned to his work with Abrego Garcia, CC-2, and others. The indictment also says Abrego Garcia and his coconspirators occasionally smuggled illegal guns and drugs from Texas into Maryland. 

Then, Abrego Garcia was stopped on Interstate 40 in Putnam County, Tennessee. Contrary to the early reports, the indictment says he had nine, not eight, passengers with him. (Abrego Garcia apparently modified his Chevy Suburban to turn it into a little bus.) He allegedly lied to police, telling them he had been in St. Louis when in fact he had been taking his usual route of picking up illegal immigrants in the Houston, Texas, area. 

“The grand jury found that over the past nine years, Abrego Garcia has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring,” Bondi said Friday. “They found this was his full-time job, not a contractor.” So much for the hardworking Maryland dad thing.

Now, Abrego Garcia is back in the U.S., behind bars in Tennessee. Acting on Democratic lawsuits and the actions of an activist judge, the Supreme Court in April ordered the administration to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador. Now, the administration has done precisely that.

Early on, after reports came out of Abrego Garcia's alleged gang membership and spousal abuse, the Democrats who took up his cause hurried to explain that they did not really support Abrego Garcia personally — they just wanted to make sure he received due process in the U.S. Well, now Abrego Garcia is receiving due process in the U.S. It should be a satisfying ending for both sides.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela beat Bolivia 2-0 on Friday to extend its advantage in seventh place in South American World Cup qualifying and a potential spot in an intercontinental playoff for next year's tournament in North America.

Bolivian Héctor Cuellar scored an own goal in the fifth minute after a simple pass to goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra ended in the back of the net. The hosts added a second in the 30th minute with striker Salomón Rondón, Venezuela's all-time top goal scorer with 47 goals, after he chested down a cross from Nahuel Ferraresi and scored with his left foot.

Bolivia, which now trails Venezuela by four points with only three rounds to play, never threatened goalkeeper Rafael Romo at the Monumental Stadium in the eastern city of Maturin, Venezuela. 

“It was a very important win for us. But we haven't won anything yet,” said Venezuelan midfielder Telasco Segovia. “We have to keep winning, we are going for our dream. It will be another final on Tuesday.”

Venezuela has not lost at home in the current edition of South American qualifying. So far, it has four wins and four draws. Only Argentina is also unbeaten at home.

Also on Friday, Colombia drew Peru 0-0 at home and failed to overtake Brazil in the standings. It was Colombia's fifth consecutive match without a win. 

The hosts at the Metropolitano Stadium in Barranquilla missed suspended striker Luis Díaz, who scored six goals in World Cup qualifying. Jhon Córdoba and Rafael Santos Borré were also out due to injury.




World Cup champion Argentina, which secured its 2026 berth in March, leads South American qualifying after 15 matches with 34 points. Ecuador and Paraguay are next with 24 points, but the Ecuadorians have better goal difference. Brazil is in fourth place with 22 points. 

Uruguay and Colombia, both with 21 points, are in fifth and sixth, respectively, separated by goal difference. Venezuela, the only South American team to have never competed in a World Cup, has 18 points. 

Bolivia, which still has a chance of moving into seventh place, has 14. Peru and Chile have 11 and 10 points respectively.

Several teams could secure their World Cup spots in Tuesday's next set of matches. Ecuador will clinch its spot with a win at Peru and Brazil could also secure its berth with a win, provided Venezuela doesn't add points at Uruguay.

Colombia will have to beat Lionel Messi's Argentina in Buenos Aires to come close to its spot before the two final rounds in September. Bolivia will have to overcome Chile at home to keep its chances alive.

All 10 South American nations play each other home and away. The top six countries qualify directly to the finals next year.

The seventh-place South American team will go into the intercontinental playoffs in March 2026 in North America when six teams will vie for the remaining two spots in the main tournament.

President Donald Trump told reporters Friday on Air Force One that he has been so busy working on foreign policy that he has not had time to think about Elon Musk after his feud with the billionaire.

Trump fought with Musk over social media Thursday, exchanging threats ranging from cancelling government contracts to starting a new centrist political party. Musk even accused the president of being in the Jeffrey Epstein files, citing that as the reason for their delayed release.

“I've been so busy working on China, Russia, Iran … I'm not thinking about Elon,” Trump said. “I just wish him well.”

When asked about a New York Times report surrounding Musk's alleged drug abuse, Trump opted not to attack his adviser-turned-adversary and instead said the report sounded “unfair.”

Musk disagreed with the government spending in Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” which the Tesla CEO believes will add to the national debt.

A call had been reportedly scheduled between Trump and Musk for Friday, but Trump said Friday morning that he was not interested in a call. He said Musk had gone “crazy” after the Epstein comments and after Musk claimed that Trump's tariffs would cause a recession. The billionaire also decommissioned the Dragon spacecraft before reversing his move later.

“No, I won't be speaking to him for a while, I guess, but I wish him well,” Trump told CNN, the outlet reported Friday morning.

“I'm not even thinking about Elon,” Trump said. “He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem.”

Musk signaled a willingness to reconcile with Trump on Thursday evening, saying, “You're not wrong,” in response to a post by Bill Ackman, who said the pair should make peace “for the benefit of our great country.”

But Musk suggested on Friday afternoon that Trump's attacks on him were unwarranted because he was initially criticizing Congress. 

“Elon criticized Congress, not Trump. Trump then attacked Elon personally,” an X user wrote, with Musk responding, “Exactly.”

President Donald Trump told NBC News on Saturday that Elon Musk would see "serious consequences" if he backs Democratic candidates who challenge Republicans supporting the "big, beautiful bill."

"If he does, he'll have to pay the consequences for that," Trump told NBC News' Kristen Welker in a phone interview.

"He'll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that," he continued, without giving specifics on what that would look like.

Trump also said that he thinks his relationship with Musk is done after their public feud erupted this week.

"I gave him a lot of breaks, long before this happened, I gave him breaks in my first administration and saved his life in my first administration," Trump said.

"I have no intention of speaking to him," Trump added.

When asked whether he thinks his relationship with Musk is over, he said, "I would assume so."

Trump also accused Musk of being "disrespectful to the office of the president."

Trump's remarks are among his most extensive public comments yet on his feud with Musk, and the latest sign that the president is not interested in mending his relationship with the onetime ally.

Musk has been a vocal critic of the Trump-backed spending bill that moved through the House last month.

Earlier this week, Musk called the spending bill a "disgusting abomination" that will lead to exploding federal budget deficits.

"In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people," he wrote in a separate X post.

Musk's criticism of the spending package — which is now being considered in the Senate — is in part what spurred the clash between the two men.

Trump told NBC News that he is still "very confident" that the bill will be passed by July 4, and that he doesn't think Musk could derail the bill.

"If you look at the Republicans, we've never been more unified," Trump told NBC News. "The bill is fantastic."

Twenty-five minutes of live TV, more than a dozen posts on X, and three posts on Truth Social over the period of five hours (and counting) — that's how the already fractured friendship of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump publicly unraveled on Thursday.

The first signs of trouble began when Musk showed opposition to Trump's spending bill, the "One Big Beautiful Bill," though he never explicitly targeted Trump.

"Shame on those who voted for it," Musk tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Congress members who voted for Trump's tax cut bill.

Trump, for his part, had stayed uncharacteristically mum about Musk's criticism of the bill.

But that all changed on Thursday morning.

Here is a minute-by-minute breakdown of how the relationship between two of the most powerful men on the planet devolved.

Musk began digging up Trump's old posts on what was then Twitter about the deficit, including one from January of 2013.

Wise words https://t.co/6juH1jEjtc

Musk unearthed another old X post by Trump from back in July 2012, presumably as a swipe at the new Republican tax bill that many economists and the congressional Budget Office said would increase the country's deficits.

I couldn't agree more! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/sZ6xgisZEA

Trump responded to Musk's attacks for the first time when answering press questions during a White House event to welcome German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

"And you know Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles," said Trump. "And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Elon knew this from the beginning; he knew it from a long time ago."

Trump's comments about Musk continued at the press appearance.

"He knew every aspect of this bill — better than almost anybody —and he never had a problem until right after he left," said Trump. "He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn't said bad things about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot."

"People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile," Trump continued.

"I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it, but we have it with others, too. They leave and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour's gone. The whole world is different, and they become hostile," he added.

Musk began a whirlwind of tweets soon after, responding in near real time to what Trump said during the press appearance.

"False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!" Musk posed on X.

False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! https://t.co/V4ztekqd4g

Musk then began a series of tweets directed at the president beyond the bill, including saying that without him, Republicans would have lost.

Such ingratitude

Musk polls his X followers about creating a new political party "that actually represents the 80% in the middle." Mark Cuban quoted the post with three checkmarks.

Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?

Musk gives Trump's bill — known on paper as the "One Big Beautiful Bill" — a new name: "Big Ugly Spending Bill."

Not even those in Congress who had to vote on the Big Ugly Spending Bill had time to read it! https://t.co/mBOQyhQYwX

Trump responds to Musk with two consecutive posts on his own social media platform, Truth Social.

"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!" Trump wrote.

"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!" the president continued.

Musk responds to Trump's posts on Truth Social, calling them "such an obvious lie."

Such an obvious lie. So sad. https://t.co/sOu9vqMVfX

A minute later, Musk appeared to dare Trump to cancel government contracts with his companies.

This just gets better and better 🤣🤣Go ahead, make my day … https://t.co/APmy7cV8iL

Musk makes another accusation.

Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT!

Trump posts on Truth Social again to defend his tax bill.

"I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress," Trump wrote.

"It's a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn't pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn't create this mess, I'm just here to FIX IT," Trump added.

Musk says SpaceX will decommission its Dragon spacecraft "immediately."

SpaceX's Dragon spaceships transport NASA astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. Prior to partnering with SpaceX, the agency depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions.

Musk says that Trump's tariffs will "cause a recession in the second half of this year."

Some economists have also predicted that Trump's tariffs would hurt the economy, and Trump himself declined to rule out the chances of a recession back in March.

JPMorgan had predicted a 60% chance of a US recession after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on April 2. The bank adjusted the possibility down to below 50% recently after Trump paused most of his highest tariffs.

Musk retweeted what appears to be a video of Trump partying with Epstein from the 1990s, doubling down on his earlier statement about the Epstein files.

"This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Business Insider in a statement. "The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again."

Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Musk took a softer tone later on Thursday night.

Some five hours after his post about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, he walked back the decision in a response to an X user.

"This is a shame this back and forth. You are both better than this. Cool off and take a step back for a couple days," X user Fab25june wrote on the platform.

"Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon," Musk wrote at 9:20 p.m.

In a separate exchange on X, billionaire investor Bill Ackman encouraged Musk and Trump to make up.

"I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart," Ackman wrote.

"You're not wrong," Musk responded at 9:27 p.m.

Trump spoke about the feud on Friday morning during a phone call with CNN's Dana Bash.

"I'm not even thinking about Elon," Trump said. "He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem."

Trump doesn't intend to speak to Musk "for a while" and wishes Musk well, according to Bash.

Bash said people in Musk and Trump's orbit are trying to mend the rift.

The President appears to respond to Musk's allegation that he's in the so-called "Epstein files."

On Truth Social, Trump posted a screenshot of an X post from David Schoen, Epstein's defense attorney. Schoen said in the post that Epstein "had no information to hurt President Trump."

"I specifically asked him!" Schoen wrote.

Trump reiterated that he wasn't thinking about Musk while traveling with reporters aboard Air Force One.

He wished Musk the best of luck on his Tesla business.

"I mean, I hope he does well with Tesla," he said.

Musk found a name for his new political party proposal: "The America Party."

The America Party https://t.co/hO5S8Kjb5O

In a separate post on X, Musk said the "people have spoken" as the polling results showed that 80% of the 5.6 million participants voted "Yes" to creating a party that represents "the middle."

Musk said on X that he would apologize to Trump "profusely as soon as there is a full dump of the Epstein files."

The CEO was responding to a post from James Fishback, an investor who proposed the idea of DOGE dividend checks, who posted on X that Musk should send Trump a "full-throated apology."

"You can substantively disagree with the President on policy, but you should not have baselessly and personally attacked him," Fishback wrote.

Trump and Musk appeared to extend each other an olive branch — at least for a brief moment.

Likewise

The White House rapid response account on X posted a clip of Trump's gaggle with the press on Air Force One, highlighting the president saying he wishes Musk well.

"Likewise," Musk said in response at 10:46 p.m.

Musk deleted some of the X posts he made on Thursday, including one in which he said Trump was named in the Epstein files. He also deleted a tweet announcing his intention to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft.

However, other the X posts Musk made, including criticism of the tax bill, remain on his account.

Elon Musk has appeared to delete some of his posts on his social media platform X that escalated his bitter feud with President Donald Trump this week.

One post, no longer available as of Saturday morning, accused Trump of being mentioned in "files" of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Musk's accusation, which the White House has disputed, marked an escalation in the public spat between the men.

"Hmm...this page doesn't exist. Try searching for something else," said the X page that once displayed Musk's post.

On Thursday, Musk also responded "yes" to a user's post that called for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vice President JD Vance.

That post was also no longer available as of Saturday morning. 

In an interview on Friday with "manosphere" comedian Theo Von, Vance said Musk was making a "huge mistake" going after Trump, while attempting to downplay the billionaire's attacks as an "emotional guy" who got frustrated.

It was not immediately clear why Musk deleted the posts. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Nonetheless, it's the latest twist in the rapidly deteriorating relationship between the onetime allies.

Just over one week ago, Trump and Musk exchanged compliments at the conclusion of Musk's official time leading the Department of Government Efficiency.

But their relationship devolved this week as the two men exchanged barbs on social media, stemming in large part from Musk's vocal opposition to Trump's "big, beautiful bill," CNBC previously reported.

In one of the now-deleted posts, Musk accused Trump of being mentioned in files related to Epstein, without providing any evidence of his claim.

Musk alleged, "that is the real reason they have not been made public."

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected Musk's allegations.

"This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted," she said in a statement to CNN.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has spent the past 28 years helping turn the e-commerce giant into one of the biggest companies on earth.

But the 57-year-old executive didn't start his career with aspirations of being a high-powered CEO. In a May 15 podcast appearance on "How Leaders Lead with David Novak," Jassy said he too often sees young people who think they should be entering the professional world knowing what they want to do with the rest of their lives.

"I have a 21-year-old son and a 24-year-old daughter, and one of the things I see with them and their peers is they all feel like they have to know what they want to do with their life at that age," he said. "And I really don't believe that's true."

Before Jassy landed at Amazon in 1997 at age 29, he tried his hand at sportscasting, sports production, product management and entrepreneurship, he said. On top of that, he spent time working at a retail golf store, coaching his high school soccer team and investment banking.

Even though many of those jobs didn't work out as he might've hoped, the experiences helped him understand the type of career that he wanted — and didn't want — to have, he said.

"I think early on it's just as important to learn what you don't want to do as what you want to do because it actually helps you figure out what you want to do," said Jassy. "I do feel like one of the lucky parts for me was that I tried lots of things and was able to sort for myself what appealed to me and what didn't."

Jassy credited his eventual success to his willingness to find out what he was good at and what he liked, rather than doggedly following a strong vision of what he wanted to do: "I think your attitude is an embarrassing amount of your success or lack thereof."

Being reliable, trustworthy, hard-working and a good learner are more important than being good at every single thing you try, Jassy added. "I feel like those are things that you can control. It's actually amazing to me how often people don't. I worked hard at those things over time," he said.

The Amazon CEO isn't alone in preaching dependability: Being a reliable and hard worker is the No. 1 way to build a strong reputation in the workplace, author and former Google executive Maha Abouelenein told CNBC Make It on Oct. 9.

Having a consistent level of effort and doing your best to anticipate the needs of those around you will get you recognized, no matter where your career takes you, said Abouelenein.

"Reputation is like a currency," she said. "It's the only thing you own, and I want you to invest in it ... Without your [personal brand], you can't do anything."

Little Caesars co-founder Marian Ilitch is the third-richest self-made woman in the U.S., according to a new Forbes list.

Ilitch has an estimated net worth of $6.9 billion, Forbes reported on Tuesday. Most of that wealth likely comes from the Little Caesars pizza restaurant chain, which she co-founded with her late husband Michael Ilitch in Garden City, Michigan, in 1959. Little Caesars brings in an estimated $5 billion in annual systemwide sales, Forbes estimated.

Ilitch, 90, took the reins as chairwoman of her family's holding company Ilitch Holdings, which owns Little Caesars, after her husband died in 2017.

Growing up, Ilitch refilled napkin dispensers and salt and pepper shakers in her father's restaurant, according to Ilitch Holdings' website. As an adult, she worked in retail and as a reservation clerk for Delta Air Lines before getting married and becoming a full-time mother. The couple invested their family savings to open the first Little Caesars location, the website says.

Little Caesars opened its first franchised location in Warren, Michigan, in 1962, and grew rapidly from there: It opened its 50th location seven years later, the company's website says. It has thousands of locations worldwide, with roughly 80% of them franchise-owned, according to the company.

Other parts of the Ilitch family's wealth come from their investments in the city of Detroit. Ilitch and her husband bought the Detroit Red Wings for a reported $8 million in 1982. Her husband also bought the Detroit Tigers from Dominos Pizza founder Tom Monaghan for a reported $85 million in 1992.

The couple purchased the Fox Theater, located in the heart of the city, in 1987 — and spent $12.5 million restoring it, according to the Detroit News. And Ilitch owns Detroit's MotorCity Casino Hotel, first investing in it and then buying out her partners for $525 million in 2005, according to ESPN.

Some of the Ilitches' efforts to invest in the city sparked controversy. The family promised a $200 million development around Little Caesars Arena, which opened in September 2017 — but some locals were skeptical the investment actually helped residents, The Guardian reported in October 2018.

Ilitch has generally avoided the spotlight throughout her adult life, as did her husband. Notably, Michael quietly helped pay rent for civil rights icon Rosa Parks during the 1990s, after Parks moved into an apartment in downtown Detroit, the Sports Business Journal reported in 2014.

"It's important that people know what Mr. Mike Ilitch did for Ms. Rosa Parks because it's symbolic of what he has always done for the people of our city," Damon Keith, a former circuit judge on the 6th U.S. Court of Appeals who connected Parks with Michael, told the publication.

"You don't find people like Mike and Marian often, who want to help when they're needed," Keith said to the Washington Post in February 2017.

Americans earning a regular salary may have trouble living comfortably in all 50 states.

The median annual wage for individuals was just below $62,000 at the end of 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But it takes a salary of at least $80,829 for a single adult to live comfortably in West Virginia, the most affordable state, according to a recent SmartAsset study.

SmartAsset defines "comfortable" as earning enough to follow the 50/30/20 budget method, which recommends putting 50% of your income toward essentials like rent and food, 30% toward discretionary spending and 20% toward debt repayment and savings. It used the latest estimates from Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Living Wage calculator to estimate individuals' cost of necessities in each state.

On the other side of the spectrum from West Virginia, residents in Hawaii need to earn a minimum of $124,467 a year to live comfortably, SmartAsset finds. That's the highest of any state and one of two states — along with Massachusetts — where individuals need to earn at least $120,000 a year to afford a comfortable lifestyle.

Here's how much money it takes for a single adult to live comfortably in every U.S. state 2025.

While the 50/30/20 budget can be an effective tool to manage your money, it can also be difficult to follow if you have high fixed costs. And though data suggests wage growth nationwide is actually outpacing price inflation, many Americans don't feel that way.

About 7 in 10 Americans feel stressed about their finances, according to a CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll conducted in April. Plus, President Donald Trump's tariffs threaten to push prices up even further.

Boosting your income by switching jobs or getting a side hustle may be easier said than done, but it can help give you some breathing room in your budget, especially if you've already cut out as much discretionary spending as you can.

Vice President JD Vance said Elon Musk is making a “huge mistake” in going after Donald Trump and expressed hopes the billionaire will come back into the fold following the public feud that unfolded. 

“I'm always going to be loyal to the president and I hope that eventually Elon kind of comes back into the fold,” Vance said in an interview on the podcast “This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von” released on Saturday. “Maybe that's not possible now because he's gone so nuclear, but I hope it is.”

LAKE ORION TOWNSHIP, Mich. — In a nondescript supplier park in suburban Detroit, an electric vehicle startup backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is building what it hopes will be America's newest automaker.

The facility is filled with dozens of prototypes, crash-tested vehicles, a crude lab vehicle skeleton adorned with wires and, most importantly, a busy "beta" assembly line that has been building electric vehicles since December for the startup, Slate Auto.

Slate is using the location — a stone's throw away from a massive General Motors assembly plant — to produce more than 70 vehicles for internal testing, certification and everything else a company needs to prepare to produce and sell vehicles in the United States.

The beta production line features roughly a dozen labeled stations for things such as the vehicle's doors, tailgate and front ends that sit in bins or on surface areas made out of wood and steel parts.

Employees move back and forth between the bins, tables and assembly line as songs such as Whitney Houston's "Saving All My Love for You" and Pat Benatar's "Love is a Battlefield" echo throughout the lively facility.

The largely hand-built vehicles being made are bare-bones, two-seat, two-door electric pickup trucks that can also be converted to different body styles of SUVs, such as a five-seat fastback or into a squared-off look like a Jeep Wrangler.

The vehicles have injected-molded composite exteriors, crank windows, no infotainment systems and a litany of do-it yourself options. The plan is for every vehicle coming off the line to be the same to reduce complexity, before adding any additional features or different covers/tops.

Auto executives have tossed around the idea for such a modular, stripped-down vehicle amid the rise of connectivity and affordability concerns, but so far the challenges have outweighed the potential opportunities, or companies have struggled to keep prices down.

Slate believes it can succeed where others have failed through simplified manufacturing and lower costs – two areas where other EV startups have failed in recent years.

"This one's going to be different for a number of reasons," Eric Keipper, an auto veteran and Slate's head of engineering, told CNBC after a tour of the company's manufacturing facility. "We took the back-to-basics, only-the-essentials approach, and, really, we're building a completely new category of product."

Slate exited its "stealth mode" in late April by revealing its first vehicles — several two-door electric pickup trucks and converted SUVs — that it expects to begin deliveries of by the end of next year. It's in the process of building out a full production facility at a former printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana, where it expects to have capacity for up to 150,000 vehicles a year.

It's a daunting timeframe even for an established automaker, let alone a new startup that's establishing its supply chains, production processes and workforce, among other things. Hand-building vehicles at a small facility is one thing; mass producing them is another.

"We've put together a really solid plan, and we're working to achieve the plan," Slate CEO Chris Barman told CNBC. "It doesn't mean that we follow the plan exactly. We gotta pivot when different information comes, but we understand what we've got to do to ultimately get to the goal of having vehicles that meet all of our requirements."

Slate revealed its unnamed vehicle (the company is telling customers to name it themselves) to notable fanfare, attracting more than 100,000 reservations that required a $50 deposit. For other companies, however, vehicles reservations have fallen significantly short of actual sales.

The company said it is conducting a Series C round of financing after raising $700 million in its first two rounds of financing. TechCrunch first reported the Series A round in 2023 raised $111 million from 16 investors, including Bezos.

Other EV startups have needed significantly more funding and have quickly blown through billions of dollars annually attempting to get a vehicle into production. But Slate believes it can be far less capital intense thanks to the engineering and production of the vehicle.

"We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never been delivered," Barman said during the April 24 debut. "But with a twist, it's a vehicle people are actually going to love and be proud to own."

The company declined to discuss future targets such as sales and profitability, as well as expected capital requirements, other than that it plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in its Indiana plant.

Barman and Keipper — veterans of Stellantis predecessor Fiat Chrysler, among other companies — met nearly three years ago to discuss the vehicle and Slate's business plan as the first employees of the startup.

"It started with a blank slate," said Keipper. "The CEO and I sat together on the fifth of July in 2022 and looked at a blank whiteboard, and I filled it. I said, 'Here's the plan. Let's do this.'"

During the reveal, the company positioned itself and its vehicle as a "a radically simple, radically affordable, radically personalizable car."

The vehicle — which has a targeted starting price of under $20,000 with an up to $7,500 EV credit — features many "off the shelf" parts from suppliers, lowering costs. Its body also is exclusively injected molded composite instead of steel or aluminum, bringing down cost and weight.

It does not feature any "connectivity" such as a modem or large screens, just a small driver information screen. Instead of a center infotainment system, drivers can use their own devices such as a smartphone or tablet for navigation and music. Speakers also are optional.

The exteriors of the Slate vehicles also won't be painted. The company says it was engineered to be wrapped with a vinyl film, eliminating the need for a costly paint shop — a massive investment for automakers.

The basis for the company is for consumers to be able to easily change the vehicle themselves or add whatever they'd like to it after purchase through the removal or addition of bolts. The company plans to offer some services such as the vehicle wrapping, but customers aren't required to do those things through Slate and can purchase add-ons later.

Slate says the truck — about the length of a two-door Ford Bronco — features roughly a fifth less parts compared to a typical vehicle, including only 500 to 700 "end items," or parts, for final assembly. That compares with a Slate estimate of 2,500-end item parts for other competitors and thousands of more overall pieces.

"Fundamentally, there's no new technology because technology costs money to develop," said Jamie Standring, formerly with Karma Automotive and Stellantis/Fiat Chrysler, standing by the beta assembly line.

Standring said the initial idea was to have the vehicle's frame that everything is built upon be bolted together – almost like an erector set – to remove the need for a full body shop, much like it's attempting to not use a paint shop. But the drawbacks eventually outweighed the benefits, he said.

The Slate truck is expected to ship with a standard 52.7-kWh battery with an estimated range of around 150 miles, or a 84.3-kWh pack with a target of 240 miles of range. Its battery supplier is SK On, according to the company. Its top speed is only 90 miles per hour.

"I'm really proud of the team for how they really thought out of the box," Barman said. "We'll have kits, and we're doing it in a way that's lean as well, but we want to offer people many choices."

But more choices for consumers mean more complexity.

On the company's website, there are 11 categories for customers to customize with a combined 160 options, excluding customizable exterior colors for wraps. That's a lot of options – ranging from dozens of decals to lighting, audio and tires and wheels – for a customer to pick and a company to store and offer.

Slate executives say the point of the customization is for customers to be able to make the vehicle their own and easily upgrade or change it when they'd like, but auto analysts see it as one of many potential problem areas.

In addition to traditional startup challenges such as capital, profitability and scaling up, other hurdles include: A limited market for two-door vehicles, slower-than-expected adoption of EVs and regulatory uncertainty regarding federal tax credits that Slate is relying on for the vehicle's affordability, among other things.

"They have an interesting idea," said Stephanie Brinley, associate director in AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility. "The question is, how many people really want to do that much themselves, and how big is the adjustable market?"

The sale of two-door regular cab pickup trucks like Slate's debut vehicle only accounted for less than 90,400 registrations in 2024. That compares to more than 2.5 million registered four-door crew cab trucks.

Brinley, who attended Slate's reveal event in California, said if the company wants to be sustainable, it would need to expand its product lineup to four-door models, which the platform seems to be able to support, as well as additional vehicles in the future.

"Just like every other startup before it, their sustainability is not going to be determined by the first product in the first six months," Brinley said. "The first product just gets you in the door."

A handful of auto startups such as Lordstown Motors, Electric Last Mile Solutions, Fisker, Canoo and Nikola all made it into various forms of production but went bankrupt. Even better capitalized EV startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group have continually had to raise capital to stay afloat.

Industry insiders also have raised concerns about the affordability of Slate's vehicle once customers add options or a new SUV top, which can be installed and uninstalled using bolts.

"I think it's super interesting. The idea behind it, we've talked about that idea a million times," Tim Kuniskis, CEO of Stellantis' Ram Truck brand, said recently when asked about Slate. "Now, what's it going to actually transact at in the marketplace … when people start to option them up, it's not going to be $20,000. It's going to be $35,000, and by the time you get to $35,000, you're in midsize truck territory. "

Slate has not announced pricing for customizations or exact pricing of the vehicle without a federal tax credit that's in jeopardy under President Donald Trump.

"Slate is an example of why and how hard it is to produce a cheap EV" said Karl Brauer, a veteran auto analyst with iSeeCars.com. "They are producing an electric vehicle with only two seats, 140-mile range, manual windows, no touch screen, and it's still $27,500 … To me, it's not a competitive vehicle at that point."

Brauer said there are other EVs close to that price, as well as smaller pickups such as the Ford Maverick hybrid with a lot more features that could be a better buy for consumers.

Both Brauer and Brinley gave Slate credit for trying something new and attempting to address affordability concerns, but the auto industry isn't an easy busy to break into, even when starting from a blank slate.

"It's modular. It's cool. It's a really clever idea," Brinley said. "The question for me comes down to how many people want to do that? And we'll find out, but I don't know that it's as high as they think it is."

A wave of high-profile kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives has rattled the industry — and prompted a quiet security revolution among some of its most visible evangelists.

Didi Taihuttu, patriarch of the so-called "Bitcoin Family," said he overhauled the family's entire security setup after a string of threats.

The Taihuttus — who sold everything they owned in 2017, from their house to their shoes, to go all-in on bitcoin when it was trading around $900 — have long lived on the outer edge of crypto ideology. They travel full-time with their three daughters and remain entirely unbanked.

Over the past eight months, he said, the family ditched hardware wallets in favor of a hybrid system: Part analog, part digital, with seed phrases encrypted, split, and stored either through blockchain-based encryption services or hidden across four continents.

"We have changed everything," Taihuttu told CNBC on a call from Phuket, Thailand. "Even if someone held me at gunpoint, I can't give them more than what's on my wallet on my phone. And that's not a lot."

CNBC first reported on the family's unconventional storage system in 2022, when Taihuttu described hiding hardware wallets across multiple continents — in places ranging from rental apartments in Europe to self-storage units in South America.

As physical attacks on crypto holders become more frequent, even they are rethinking their exposure.

This week, Moroccan police arrested a 24-year-old suspected of orchestrating a series of brutal kidnappings targeting crypto executives.

One victim, the father of a crypto millionaire, was allegedly held for days in a house south of Paris — and reportedly had a finger severed during the ordeal.

In a separate case earlier this year, a co-founder of French wallet firm Ledger and his wife were abducted from their home in central France in a ransom scheme that also targeted another Ledger executive.

Last month in New York, authorities said, a 28-year-old Italian tourist was kidnapped and tortured for 17 days in a Manhattan apartment by attackers trying to extract his bitcoin password — shocking him with wires, beating him with a gun, and strapping an Apple AirTag around his neck to track his movements.

The common thread: The pursuit of crypto credentials that enable instant, irreversible transfers of virtual assets.

"It is definitely frightening to see a lot of these kidnappings happen," said JP Richardson, CEO of crypto wallet company Exodus. He urged users to take security into their own hands by choosing self-custody, storing larger sums on hardware wallets, and — for those holding significant assets — exploring multi-signature wallets, a setup typically used by institutions.

Richardson also recommended spreading funds across different wallet types and avoiding large balances in hot wallets to reduce risk without sacrificing flexibility.

That rising sense of vulnerability is fueling a new demand for physical protection with insurance firms now racing to offer kidnap and ransom (K&R) policies tailored to crypto holders.

But Taihuttu isn't waiting for corporate solutions. He's opted for complete decentralization — of not just his finances, but his personal risk profile.

As the family prepares to return to Europe from Thailand, safety has become a constant topic of conversation.

"We've been talking about it a lot as a family," Taihuttu said. "My kids read the news, too — especially that story in France, where the daughter of a CEO was almost kidnapped on the street."

Now, he said, his daughters are asking difficult questions: What if someone tries to kidnap us? What's the plan?

Though the girls carry only small amounts of crypto in their personal wallets, the family has decided to avoid France entirely.

"We got a little bit famous in a niche market — but that niche is becoming a really big market now," Taihuttu said. "And I think we'll see more and more of these robberies. So yeah, we're definitely going to skip France."

Even in Thailand, Taihuttu recently stopped posting travel updates and filming at home after receiving disturbing messages from strangers who claimed to have identified his location from YouTube vlogs.

"We stayed in a very beautiful house for six months — then I started getting emails from people who figured out which house it was. They warned me to be careful, told me not to leave my kids alone," he said. "So we moved. And now we don't film anything at all."

"It's a strange world at the moment," he said. "So we're taking our own precautions — and when it comes to wallets, we're now completely hardware wallet-less. We don't use any hardware wallets anymore."

The family's new system involves splitting a single 24-word bitcoin seed phrase — the cryptographic key that unlocks access to their crypto holdings — into four sets of six words, each stored in a different geographic location. Some are kept digitally through blockchain-based encryption platforms, while others are etched by hand into fireproof steel plates using a hammer and letter punch, then hidden in physical locations across four continents.

"Even if someone finds 18 of the 24 words, they can't do anything," Taihuttu explained.

On top of that, he's added a layer of personal encryption, swapping out select words to throw off would-be attackers. The method is simple, but effective.

"You only need to remember which ones you changed," he said.

Part of the reason for ditching hardware wallets, Taihuttu said, was a growing mistrust of third-party devices. Concerns about backdoors and remote access features — including a controversial update by Ledger in 2023 — prompted the family to abandon physical hardware altogether in favor of encrypted paper and steel backups.

While the family still holds some crypto in "hot" wallets — for daily spending or to run their algorithmic trading strategy — those funds are protected by multi-signature approvals, which require multiple parties to sign off before a transaction can be executed.

The Taihuttus use Safe — formerly Gnosis Safe — for ether and other altcoins, and similarly layered setups for bitcoin stored on centralized platforms like Bybit.

About 65% of the family's crypto is locked in cold storage across four continents — a decentralized system Taihuttu prefers to centralized vaults like the Swiss Alps bunker used by Coinbase-owned Xapo. Those facilities may offer physical protection and inheritance services, but Taihuttu said they require too much trust.

"What happens if one of those companies goes bankrupt? Will I still have access?" he said. "You're putting your capital back in someone else's hands."

Instead, Taihuttu holds his own keys — hidden across the globe. He can top up the wallets remotely with new deposits, but accessing them would require at least one international trip, depending on which fragments of the seed phrase are needed. The funds, he added, are intended as a long-term pension to be accessed only if bitcoin hits $1 million — a milestone he's targeting for 2033.

The shift toward multiparty protections extends beyond just multi-signature. Multi-party computation, or MPC, is gaining traction as a more advanced security model.

Instead of storing private keys in one place — a vulnerability known as a "single point of compromise" — MPC splits a key into encrypted shares distributed across multiple parties. Transactions can only go through when a threshold number of those parties approve, sharply reducing the risk of theft or unauthorized access.

Multi-signature wallets require several parties to approve a transaction. MPC takes that further by cryptographically splitting the private key itself, ensuring that no single individual ever holds the full key — not even their own complete share.

The shift comes amid renewed scrutiny of centralized crypto platforms like Coinbase, which recently disclosed a data breach affecting tens of thousands of customers.

Taihuttu, for his part, says 80% of his trading now happens on decentralized exchanges like Apex — a peer-to-peer platform that allows users to set buy and sell orders without relinquishing custody of their funds, marking a return to crypto's original ethos.

While he declined to reveal his total holdings, Taihuttu did share his goal for the current bull cycle: a $100 million net worth, with 60% still held in bitcoin. The rest is a mix of ether, layer-1 tokens like solana, link, sui, and a growing number of AI and education-focused startups — including his own platform offering blockchain and life-skills courses for kids.

Lately, he's also considering stepping back from the spotlight.

"It's really my passion to create content. It's really what I love to do every day," he said. "But if it's not safe anymore for my daughters ... I really need to think about them."

Gen Z seems to have a case of economic malaise.

Nearly half (49%) of its adult members — the oldest of whom are in their late 20s — say planning for the future feels "pointless," according to a recent Credit Karma poll.

A freewheeling attitude toward summer spending has taken root among young adults who feel financial "despair" and "hopelessness," said Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma.

They think, "What's the point when it comes to saving for the future?" Alev said.

That "YOLO mindset" among Generation Z — the cohort born from roughly 1997 through 2012 — can be dangerous: If unchecked, it might lead young adults to rack up high-interest debt they can't easily repay, perhaps leading to delayed milestones like moving out of their parents' home or saving for retirement, Alev said.

But your late teens and early 20s is arguably the best time for young people to develop healthy financial habits: Starting to invest now, even a little bit, will yield ample benefits via decades of compound interest, experts said.

"There are a lot of financial implications in the long term if these young people aren't planning for their financial future and [are] spending willy-nilly however they want," Alev said.

That said, that many feel disillusioned is understandable in the current environment, experts said.

The labor market has been tough lately for new entrants and those looking to switch jobs, experts said.

The U.S. unemployment rate is relatively low, at 4.2%. However, it's much higher for Americans 22 to 27 years old: 5.8% for recent college grads and 6.9% for those without a bachelor's degree, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data as of March 2025.

Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business.

Young adults are also saddled with debt concerns, experts said.

"They feel they don't have any money and many of them are in debt," said Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Sun Group Wealth Partners, based in Irvine, California. "And they're wondering if the degree they have (or are working toward) will be of value if A.I. takes all their jobs anyway. So is it just pointless?"

About 50% of bachelor's degree recipients in the 2022-23 class graduated with student debt, with an average debt of $29,300, according to College Board.

The federal government restarted collections on student debt in default in May, after a five-year pause.

The Biden administration's efforts to forgive large swaths of student debt, including plans to help reduce monthly payments for struggling borrowers, were largely stymied in court.

"Some hoped some or more of it would be forgiven, and that didn't turn out to be the case," said Sun, a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.

Meanwhile, in a 2024 report, the New York Fed found credit card delinquency rates were rising faster for Gen Z than for other generations. About 15% had maxed out their cards, more than other cohorts, it said.

It's also "never been easier to buy things," with the rise of buy now, pay later lending, for example, Alev said.

BNPL has pushed the majority of Gen Z users — 77% — to say the service has encouraged them to spend more than they can afford, according to the Credit Karma survey. The firm polled 1,015 adults ages 18 and older, 182 of whom are from Gen Z.

These financial challenges compound an environment of general political and financial uncertainty, amid on-again-off-again tariff policy and its potential impact on inflation and the U.S. economy, for example, experts said.

"You start stacking all these things on top of each other and it can create a lack of optimism for young people looking to get started in their financial lives," Alev said.

Young adults should try to rewire their financial mindset, experts said.

"Most importantly, you don't want to bet against yourself," Sun said.

"See it as an opportunity," she added. "If you're young and your expenses are low, this is the time to invest as much as you can right now."

Time is working in their favor, due to the ability to compound investment growth over multiple decades, Alev said.

While investing might "feel impossible," every little bit helps, even if it's just investing $10 a month right now into a tax-advantaged retirement account like a Roth IRA or 401(k).

The latter is among the easiest ways to start, due to automatic payroll deduction and the possibility of earning a "match" from your employer, which is "probably the closest thing to free money any of us will get in our lifetime," Alev said.

"This is actually the most exciting time to invest, because you're young," Sun said.

Instituting mindful spending habits, such as putting a waiting period of at least 24 hours in place before buying a non-essential item, can help prevent unnecessary spending, she added.

Sun advocates for paying down high-interest debt before focusing on investing, so interest payments don't quickly spiral out of control. Or, as an alternative, they can try to fund a 401(k) to get their full company match while also working to pay off high-interest debt, she said.

"Instead of getting into the 'woe is me' mode, change that into taking action," Sun said. "Make a plan, take baby steps and get excited about opportunities to invest."

ByteDance Ltd., TikTok's parent company, has been replacing US-hired staff near Seattle with leaders connected to China, aiming to replicate its e-commerce success in Asia after sales fell short in America.

TikTok Shop initially set a goal to increase its US e-commerce business tenfold last year to $17.5 billion in transaction volume, but the company had to drastically lower that goal, according to people familiar with the plan who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly.

LG Electronics ClOi robots displayed at the LG Group Sciencepark R&D complex in Seoul in 2023. South Korea is still labeled an emerging market despite being a global leader when it comes to automation and robot technology. 

 If I told you there's a country with more than 1,000 robots for every 10,000 workers—and another with barely more than 100 per, which would you guess is classified as an emerging market? 

You'd likely be wrong. In 2023 it was the UK that had only 119 robots per 10,000 workers. South Korea meanwhile had 1,012. But for some reason, MSCI classifies the latter as an emerging market, just as it does Poland, Chile, Brazil, Taiwan, the UAE and China.

Global spirit makers are staring down a sobering cocktail of challenges as tariffs and brand boycotts threaten to exacerbate wider shifts in drinking habits.

French cognac maker Rémy Cointreau on Wednesday became the latest spirits maker, following Diageo and Pernod Ricard, to withdraw its sales targets on increased economic and trade uncertainty.

"Given the continued lack of macroeconomic visibility, the geopolitical uncertainties surrounding U.S.-China tariff policies, and the absence to date of a recovery in the U.S. market ... the conditions required to maintain [Remy Cointreau's] 2029-2030 targets are no longer in place," it said in a statement.

The move came as full-year sales at the group's cognac business, which includes its namesake Remy Martin brand, fell 22% on an organic basis on slowing U.S. consumption and "complex market conditions" in China.

The popular brandy variety, which hails from the French region of Cognac, has been particularly caught in the crosshairs of ongoing U.S.-Sino tensions. LVMH similarly saw a 17% drop in its Hennessy cognac in the first quarter.

But the specialty drink is far from alone as trade barriers weaken already drying demand for spirits. LVMH's wine and spirits remains the French luxury group's worst performing division, while Diageo spirits including Tanqueray, Gordon's and Smirnoff saw the steepest declines in the first quarter as sales of Irish stout Guinness rallied ahead.

"Distilled spirits in the U.S. are going through a correction, and U.S. tariffs add another layer of uncertainty," Jefferies said in a note last month.

The prestige — and often legal requirements — associated with spirits and wines mean that they are heavily dependent on local production and thus heavily exposed to U.S. import levies. Champagne must be produced and bottled within the Champagne region, for instance.

"With spirits and wines you have terroir caches, and that means you're producing locally and exporting. Hence it's much more vulnerable to geopolitical tensions," Sanjeet Aujla, analyst at UBS, told CNBC via video call.

Remy Cointreau estimated that tariffs as they currently stand could serve a 65-million-euro blow ($55 million) to its business after mitigating measures. Diageo, meanwhile, said about 25% of its business is set to be impacted by duties.

The same does not apply for beer, which relies on local production and has been flagged as an unlikely winner from brewing trade divisions. Notably, the world's largest brewer AB InBev, as well as Dutch and Danish beermakers Heineken and Carlsberg all maintained their full-year guidance in the first quarter.

As a result, wines and spirits are potentially more exposed to brand boycotts too, with consumers more likely to swap out a particular product on political grounds in favor of a locally-made alternative.

The tariff hit comes as the industry has slowed over recent years following a strong decade of growth, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Locked-down consumers forked out more on alcohol in 2020 and 2021, fueling a simultaneous surge in premium brands.

"During the pandemic, not only did people drink more, they premiumized more," Aujla said.

Spirits are often seen as an affordable luxury, especially in good economic times. But they nevertheless tend to be an occasional purchase, with many Covid-era stockpiles remaining in liquor cabinets across the world.

As economic conditions turn, however, consumers may be less inclined to cough up $100 for a good bottle, instead downtrading or opting for lower-cost ready-to-drink (RTD) alternatives.

"Spirits-based RTDs are weighing on distilled spirits growth alongside the impact of cumulative inflation," the Jefferies note said, adding that downtrading was most visible in vodka and rum products, while demand for premium whisky, tequila and gin remained more robust.

"That [premiumization] is on pause today, given the cyclical headwinds we have in the industry," Aujla added.

The drying demand comes as health and wellness trends spark a shift in consumer habits, with more people becoming "sober curious" and experimenting with lower alcohol consumption. Indeed, many drinks makers have sought to embrace that shift with new ranges of low and no alcohol products.

Meanwhile, the proliferation of weight loss drugs — and early evidence of their role in suppressing alcohol cravings — pose another potential challenge for the industry.

Nevertheless, analysts remain divided over the severity and permanence of the downturn.

"There is considerable debate over the extent to which currently anemic demand is cyclical or structural," James Edwardes Jones, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in emailed comments.

Cyclical pressures refer to economic headwinds and hangover supplies from the Covid-era, while structural shifts refer to changing consumer patterns.

"It's a bit of both, and more cyclical than structural," Aujla said. "But when the cyclical headwinds dissipate, we think US Spirits industry growth will be 1-2% lower than the 4-5% historical growth."

Bitcoin BTC$105,784.84 held firm above $105,000 on Saturday despite an unusually combative and personal escalation in the Trump-Musk feud that could rattle traditional markets next week.

On Saturday, in a phone interview with NBC News, President Trump warned that there would be “serious consequences” if Elon Musk financially backed Democratic candidates running against Republicans who support the GOP's budget bill. “If he does, he'll have to pay the consequences for that,” Trump said, adding later, “He'll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that.”

Trump, who has often boasted of past support from Musk, firmly dismissed the idea of mending ties. “No,” he said when asked whether he wished to repair the relationship. “I would assume so, yeah,” he added when asked if the rift was permanent. 

Despite the intensifying feud between two of the most influential figures in U.S. politics and technology, Bitcoin remained unfazed. The cryptocurrency held onto earlier gains and continues to trade near weekly highs. The market's composure suggests that traders may increasingly view BTC as a hedge against institutional dysfunction, or at least as an asset insulated from the partisan fallout that tends to impact equities more directly.

The crypto exchange Bitget has just announced a strategic partnership with the University of Zurich. The goal: to support the international summer school Deep Dive into Blockchain.

This partnership aims to make high-level crypto training accessible to the best students from around the world. To do this, Bitget will finance up to 10 full crypto scholarships covering all expenses. This includes:

This project is part of the Blockchain4Youth framework. It is an educational project backed by a $10 million fund. It illustrates Bitget's commitment to uniting academia and industry in a concrete dialogue around blockchain and crypto.

By betting on education, Bitget confirms its long-term vision for the crypto industry. The fact is that the partnership with the University of Zurich goes beyond funding.

The cryptocurrency market is on the path of concluding the week on a neutral note as Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins record a consolidated price action. Notably, with a trading volume of $128.33 billion, the crypto space has grown by 2.65% today. With this, Bitcoin price has maintained its $105,000 mark this week, suggesting a strong bullish action in the market.

Additionally, the altcoin market has followed in the footsteps by displaying a similar price trend this week. While the Ethereum price hovers around the $2,500 range, the XRP price continues to breach its $2.35 mark.

Considering the present market sentiments, are you planning on investing in the crypto run? Moreover, are you closely monitoring the price action of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP daily? In this article, we will explore the market sentiment and possible price action of these 3 cryptocurrencies.

Despite a major correction in the crypto market, the Bitcoin price successfully regained momentum over the last 48 hours. This has resulted in it comfortably reclaiming the $105,000 mark. Adding to this, the BTC price is hovering extremely close to the resistance trendline of the descending channel pattern, suggesting a high possibility of a micro breakout rally situation shortly.

While the market shows signs of destability, the BTC token continues to dominate the market by 63.73% as its market cap has stabilized around the $2 trillion mark.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator breakout of the neutral point and is currently valued at 53.70 (Slightly bullish). If the trend continues to move upward, this indicator could experience a bullish convergence in the daily time frame, resulting  in a short rally.

In the Bitcoin's daily price chart, the trendline remains above all four EMAs, suggesting strong bullish momentum. Moreover, each EMA acts as dynamic support during price corrections, suggesting multiple safe exit points for short-term investors.

A bullish breakout of the descending channel pattern could result in the BTC price heading toward its upper resistance levels of $109,000 and $122,000, respectively. Negatively, an increased liquidation may pull the price of Bitcoin toward its lows of $105,000 or $102,000 next week.

The ETH coin price successfully holds its $2,500 mark this week. However, it has entered into a consolidated price action as it has been constantly trading within the $2,750 and $2,500 range. When considering the longer time frame, this altcoin hints at bullish reversal as the market is stabilizing. With a project valuation of $304.026 billion, it dominates by 9.2557%.

The Cross EMA 50-day displays a constant rise and is currently valued at $2,344.94, whereas its 200-day EMA shows a strong support around the $2,450 mark. With a potential Golden Cross in the daily time frame, the Ethereum shows a sign of bullish action.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a constant fading in the red histogram this week. However, its 12 & 26-day EMA records a constant downtrend. By evaluating the market trends, this highlights increased volatility in the upcoming time.

The Ethereum price could retest its immediate resistance level of $2,750 if the bullish maintain the positive influence. However, a setback may result in it retesting its crucial support trend level of $2,400.

Ripple's XRP price records a neutral price action over the past seven days as it has displayed a variation of less than 1%. This highlights a cool-off period for the altcoin in the market. However, with a market capitalization of $128.64 billion, it continues to dominate the 4th position with a contribution of 3.945% in the total market valuation.

The Stoch RSI lines are at 33.70 (blue) and 28.58 (orange). A bullish crossover indicates the beginning of upward momentum in the 1D time frame. Notably, this indicator measures the level of high-low range over a set period. It helps traders identify overbought and oversold conditions more accurately than traditional RSI.

Additionally, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator records a bullish convergence in the daily time frame, highlighting increased buying pressure for the XRP price. This type of trend action in the SMA suggests rising optimism among the investors and whales toward this altcoin.

Maintaining the value above the support trendline of the triangle pattern could push the XRP price toward its $2.28 mark. Other key resistance for this altcoin stands at the $2.5 mark. Conversely, its key support trendline is $2 if the market experiences a bearish turnaround.

Overall, the cryptocurrency market shows high signs of a positive price action this month as top cryptocurrencies display bullish sentiments despite a volatile action this week. Additionally, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP tokens could ignite a short rally this month as their technical sentiments are now showing signs of greed.

However, investors are suggested to brace themselves as unexpected liquidations or increased feud between Donald Trump & Elon Musk could trigger a short squeeze.

SOL SOL$150.82 showed renewed strength Saturday as it rebounded from a low of $147.13 to trade back above $151, despite lingering global macroeconomic headwinds. The recovery comes amid a spike in on-chain activity, with Coin Days Destroyed surging to 3.55 billion—its third-highest level this year—indicating movement of long-dormant tokens.

The bounce off $147 confirmed a bullish double bottom pattern, supported by rising volume and a return to a short-term bullish channel on the 6-hour chart. Solana now faces overhead resistance near $152.85, where sellers previously stepped in, but a move above that level could open the door toward the $155–$157 zone.

While Solana's network fundamentals remain strong, the broader macro environment continues to inject volatility into crypto markets, with ongoing US-China tariff disputes and rising global bond yields weighing on investor confidence.

XRP holds strong above 200-EMA as Dogecoin and UNIL rally; UNIL presale tops $2.4m amid rising DeFi interest.

Table of Contents

Despite the recent market downturn, the XRP price hovers above the 200-EMA, while the Dogecoin price begins a comeback. With an overall market rally anticipated in the coming days, DOGE and Unilabs Finance (UNIL) are bullish waves not to miss — top DeFi coins to invest in.

Priced below $1, Dogecoin and UNIL are not only pocket-friendly; they are also high-potential altcoins. Hence, investors have been showing significant interest, pushing the ongoing UNIL presale above $2.4 million in record time.

Amidst a general market downturn, the XRP price has seen a 2% decrease over the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, it hovers above the 200-EMA ($2.08), which has proven to be a solid support.

Further supported by technical indicators like Momentum (10) and Commodity Channel Index (20), an XRP price bounce is on the table. Next key level to watch is a retest of its 30-day high of $2.64, positioning it among the top DeFi coins to invest in.

Top analysts believe a rally above this level could push the XRP price above $3 and potentially flip its all-time high of $3.84. Meanwhile, WestBfieldLa's optimistic price prediction has become a subject of much interest, highlighting why it is one of the top DeFi coins to invest in. However, UNIL's significant upside potential has been attracting more investor interest.

The Dogecoin price dipped by 10% on the weekly chart, pushing it back down to the $0.17 level. Does that mean it is over? Certainly not. Technical indicators like the Williams Percent Range and Commodity Channel Index give a strong buy signal, suggesting now is the time to double down on the dog-themed cryptocurrency. 

Moreover, Investments_CEO is optimistic that the Dogecoin price will climb toward $2 this year, which is considered a bold forecast. Hence, at the current price, it presents a great entry to what could be significant gains. A modest price prediction is by John Mark, suggesting the leading memecoin could hit $0.739 and surpass its 2021 all-time high.

The above highlights its potential, placing DOGE on the list of the top DeFi coins to invest in. With the Dogecoin price underpriced at less than $0.2, it is a promising wave not to miss, although experts consider UNIL, a new AI coin, to be more attractive due to its small market size.

Unilabs Finance's native utility coin, UNIL, is among the top DeFi coins to invest in this year for several reasons. At the heart of an AI-powered DeFi ecosystem, its outlook is promising, also functioning as a governance token. In addition, it is in its early stages, meaning participation in the ongoing presale can yield significant ROIs.

At $0.0062 in the third stage of the ICO, a jump toward $0.0074 is anticipated by the fourth round. With early investors positioned for gains as the presale progresses and well after the token's market debut, there are other benefits to holding.

UNIL holders are eligible for periodic airdrops of tokens from projects that launched on the Unilabs AI Launchpad and a share of platform-generated profits through consistent dividends. Also, there will be early access to high-potential investment opportunities through the UNIL token, positioning it among the top DeFi coins to invest in this year.

The XRP price hovers above the 200-EMA despite market downturn, while the Dogecoin price is tipped to surpass $2 this cycle. Meanwhile, Unilabs Finance's UNIL token is on experts' lists of the top DeFi coins to invest in. Investors have been doubling down on the AI coin due to its solid fundamentals as the native utility token of a DeFi asset management platform.

Bitcoin Hyper has seen rapid traction in its presale, raising close to $700,000 just days after going live. 

Touted as the first true Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, this innovative project addresses the network's long-standing limitations—high transaction fees, slow processing speeds, and the lack of native smart contract support—through the integration of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). 

By combining Solana's lightning-fast architecture with Bitcoin's security, Bitcoin Hyper brings programmability and high-speed transactions to the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

The project is already gaining momentum in the crypto community and has attracted coverage from major crypto media outlets.

Summary

Bitcoin Hyper is designed as a Layer 2 blockchain to scale Bitcoin by enabling faster transactions, lower fees, and smart contract capabilities. While Bitcoin remains the most secure and established blockchain, its base layer is limited by slower speeds and lacks support for decentralized applications (dApps).

To overcome these issues, Bitcoin Hyper leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), combining Solana's high-throughput architecture with Bitcoin's unparalleled security. 

This hybrid approach introduces programmability to the Bitcoin network, allowing near-instant transaction processing and unlocking a new world of use cases.

Operating as a low-latency Layer 2 network, Bitcoin Hyper processes transactions on a high-performance virtual machine and settles them on Bitcoin's Layer 1. 

This reduces congestion and cuts costs significantly compared to native Bitcoin transactions. Developers can build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications with ease—capabilities previously unavailable on Bitcoin's native layer.

Furthermore, Bitcoin Hyper features a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge that connects its Layer 2 blockchain with the Bitcoin mainnet. 

Users can deposit BTC, convert it into Layer 2 tokens, and use them within the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, with the option to redeem tokens back to BTC seamlessly, enabling trustless interoperability between layers.

Security remains a core focus for Bitcoin Hyper. The project's smart contract has been thoroughly audited by Coinsult, confirming no mint functions, no blacklisting capabilities, no honeypot risks, and zero high-severity vulnerabilities. 

Trading is already enabled, providing investors with confidence in the project's reliability. The Bitcoin Hyper white paper outlines a bold vision to become the leading programmable Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. 

By offering fast smart contract execution, low-cost dApp deployment, and a seamless bridge to Bitcoin's base layer, the ecosystem aims to deliver true scalability without compromising Bitcoin's foundational security.

Integration of Solana's technology stack ensures a familiar and robust environment for developers, attracting builders seeking the combined benefits of both Bitcoin and Solana.

Bitcoin Hyper is actively growing its community, boasting over 6,900 followers on X since launching in May 2025. It also maintains active engagement on Telegram and through its official website. 

The project has gained coverage in respected crypto media such as Cryptonews, Cryptonomist, InsideBitcoins, and Bitcoin.com, and is featured on platforms like Cointelegraph and CoinMarketCap. 

As further proof of its rising presence, more crypto analysts have begun discussing Bitcoin Hyper on their YouTube channels—many of which have thousands of subscribers—highlighting the growing recognition the project is receiving across the crypto space.

The Bitcoin Hyper presale is currently offering tokens priced at $0.0118. Over $680,000 has been raised so far, and the token price is set to increase within the next 24 hours—making this an ideal opportunity for early investors to secure tokens at a discount.

To participate, users need a compatible crypto wallet such as Best Wallet, MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet. The presale primarily accepts Ethereum (ETH), with additional support for Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and stablecoins like USDT.

For newcomers or those without ETH, direct purchase options via credit or debit card are also available. After funding their wallet, participants connect it to the presale page, enter the desired investment amount, and complete the transaction.

Once the presale concludes, participants will be able to claim their HYPER tokens, currently issued on the Ethereum blockchain. In just a few days, the project has raised nearly $700,000 and is attracting growing interest from crypto analysts and major media outlets.

Bitcoin Hyper is quickly emerging as one of the most compelling Layer 2 innovations for Bitcoin—combining Solana-level performance with Bitcoin's trusted foundation.

Tron coin has reached a major milestone as it handled more than 8 million transactions in a single day. This figure has placed it ahead of Bitcoin in daily price shift.

The network's rise in usage comes as its native digital currency, TRX price shows early signs of a rebound.

Analysts say the surge in active addresses and stablecoin movement may set the stage for further gains.

Tron coin is making a quiet but strong comeback. As of June 6, 2025, TRX price was trading at $0.2782, up 2.72% in 24 hours. In contrast, Bitcoin price fell as low as 2.2% to the $103,000 support level.

While that may not grab headlines, the bigger picture tells a more interesting story. Analysts tracking the market noted that TRX price is in what they call a rebound and decoupling phase.

That means it is starting to move independently, no longer following broader market trends too closely.

CryptoQuant data shows that the number of active addresses on the Tron network has reached new all-time highs.

This is not a one-off event. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages for activity have both climbed steadily, showing that the user base is growing at a consistent pace.

Analyst Cryptoonchain pointed out that these metrics often lead to positive price action.

The increase in peer-to-peer transfers and the rise in decentralized application use are helping TRX stand apart.

In a market where many coins rise and fall together, TRX price is starting to behave differently.

If the pattern holds, that difference could be the first step toward a breakout. With more users and steady engagement, the signs point to building momentum.

Tron's biggest achievement this year may not be tied to price, but to performance. The network processed more than 8 million transactions in a single day, topping Bitcoin in daily volume.

This marks a 30% increase since February 2025, adding around 2 million transactions per day in just four months.

The numbers highlight a key difference between Tron and Bitcoin. 

While Bitcoin's transaction count is often tied to exchange-related activity, Tron's growth comes from real usage. This is mainly peer-to-peer transfers and stablecoin movement.

The most active of these is USDT, which now forms a core part of the Tron ecosystem. Tron's low transaction fees and fast processing times are likely major reasons behind the surge.

Developers are also choosing it for dApps due to the lower costs and smooth user experience.

With millions of daily transactions now a regular feature, Tron is beginning to look like a leader in practical blockchain utility.

The big question now is whether TRX price can reach $0.5, drawing on the positive trend within its ecosystem.

The price currently sits at $0.2782, but the growth in activity has investors watching closely.

The fundamentals are in place: more users, more transactions, and a steady rise in daily wallet activity. This usually leads to TRX adoption and a potential upward movement in price.

Still, the road is not guaranteed. Broader market conditions and investor sentiment will play a role.

But if Tron coin's current bullish trend continues, the $0.5 level may come into view sooner rather than later.

With stablecoin use growing and developer interest holding strong, the building blocks for a price breakout are already there.

American singer Jonathan Mann lost $3 million, which he had earned from NFT sales, to crypto tax and an unexpected Ethereum price crash.

Jonathan Mann, an American singer and songwriter, recently experienced a notable crypto loss due to the market crash. The musician behind the “Song A Day” project lost the $3 million he earned from the sales of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in part to crypto tax.

Consequently, Mann has turned his ordeal into a musical tale, advising other investors to be cautious. He shared his new track on X, recounting how he made the $3 million.





According to the thread on the social media platform, the songwriter confirmed that he sold his entire back catalog as digital collectibles. Then, it vanished when the crypto landscape crashed during the Terra ecosystem collapse.

“This is the story of how I made three million dollars and lost it,” Mann sings. “And how I owed the IRS more money than I made in 10 previous years.”

Three years ago, Mann sold 3,700 songs at $800 each, generating roughly $3 million in Ethereum (ETH) from these sales. With so much excitement and a lack of preparation, the singer and his wife chose to HODL Ethereum. They expected the largest altcoin by market capitalization to surge in price.

6000 days.6000 songs.

A story that almost broke me:

The $3 million I made and lost.My $1.1 million tax bill.The Autoglyph that saved me

This is SONG A DAY #6000

🌩️CRYPTO TAX NIGHTMARE🌩️

Instead of increasing as the couple had expected, the ETH price followed a downtrend pattern in January 2022. While the couple was still trying to figure out their next course of action—how much to sell or when to sell—the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came after them.

The IRS taxed his earnings from the sales of the NFTs as income, valuing the ETH at the price it was when Mann first received it. This was an unfortunate situation, considering that the price of ETH had significantly dropped since then.

While the $3 million in ETH has gone down in value, the tax due remained the same.

Mann and his wife were trying to avoid losses. Hence, they took a loan from Aave, a prominent lending protocol, and used the ETH as collateral, rather than selling it. When Terraform Labs crashed in 2022, more disaster struck for the American musician, as massive crypto liquidations occurred. In the blink of an eye, Mann's $3 million vanished.

He and his wife ended up with a debt of $1,095,171.79. Mann sold a rare Autoglyph NFT he purchased in crypto's early days to save the day. After some setbacks, he found a broker who was willing to pay $1.1 million for the NFT. Mann said that he accepted the deal because it was sufficient to cover the taxes.

After this unpleasant ordeal, the American singer has not stopped writing songs and selling them as NFTs. He hopes to make as much as $3 million in another sale soon. Notably, the NFT ecosystem is not receiving as much traction as it used to.

Bitcoin's journey from digital experiment to mainstream investment has been marked by one defining characteristic: extreme price volatility. However, data from NYU Stern's Volatility Lab reveals a remarkable transformation in how dramatically Bitcoin's price swings, offering important lessons for today's investors.

Between 2010 and 2017, Bitcoin experienced volatility that would make even the most seasoned traders nervous. During this period, annualized volatility frequently exceeded 200% and occasionally spiked above 400%. To put this in perspective, traditional stocks typically see volatility between 15-30% annually.

This extreme volatility reflected Bitcoin's status as an unproven digital asset with minimal institutional backing. Small trading volumes meant that even modest buy or sell orders could trigger massive price swings. News events, regulatory announcements, or technical developments could send prices soaring or crashing within hours.

The 2017 cryptocurrency bubble perfectly exemplified this era. Bitcoin's price rocketed from under $1,000 to nearly $20,000 before crashing back down, creating the kind of volatility that attracted speculators while terrifying traditional investors.

Following the 2017-2018 market correction, something interesting began happening. Bitcoin's volatility started declining meaningfully. Between 2018 and 2020, volatility generally ranged between 50% and 150% – still extreme by traditional standards, but a significant improvement from the earlier chaos.

This period coincided with several important developments: major companies began accepting Bitcoin payments, institutional investors started taking notice, and cryptocurrency exchanges became more sophisticated and regulated. These factors contributed to deeper liquidity and more stable price discovery.

Current data shows Bitcoin's volatility has continued moderating, now typically ranging between 30%-80%. While this remains substantially higher than stocks or bonds, it represents a dramatic evolution from Bitcoin's early days.

Recent analysis shows Bitcoin's average volatility sitting around 80%, with minimum levels reaching as low as 31%. This represents remarkable progress for an asset that once regularly experienced 300%-400% volatility.

This volatility evolution carries several important implications. First, Bitcoin has become more accessible to risk-conscious investors who were previously deterred by extreme price swings. Institutions and retail investors alike can now consider Bitcoin allocation with more predictable risk parameters.

However, “more stable” doesn't mean “stable.” An 80% volatility level means investors should still expect significant price movements. Bitcoin can easily gain or lose 20%-30% in a single week, making it unsuitable for investors who can't tolerate substantial short-term losses.

The data also suggests this maturation trend may continue. As Bitcoin's market capitalization grows and institutional adoption increases, basic economics suggests volatility should continue declining gradually.

For investors considering Bitcoin exposure, this volatility evolution suggests several strategies. Dollar-cost averaging becomes particularly attractive, as it helps smooth out price fluctuations over time. Position sizing remains critical – financial advisors typically recommend limiting Bitcoin exposure to 1%-5% of total portfolios.

Risk management takes on heightened importance. Even with reduced volatility, Bitcoin remains far more volatile than traditional assets, requiring careful consideration of overall portfolio risk.

Bitcoin's volatility journey from 400% to 80% represents one of the most significant developments in cryptocurrency history. While still volatile by traditional standards, this evolution reflects Bitcoin's gradual transition from speculative experiment to legitimate asset class.

For investors, this trend suggests Bitcoin is becoming more investable while remaining distinctly different from traditional assets. Understanding this evolution helps investors make informed decisions about whether and how to include Bitcoin in their portfolios, recognizing both its progress and its continued unique risk profile.

Eric Trump said that World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project with ties to the Trump family, plans to acquire a "substantial position" in the TRUMP memecoin for its long-term treasury as it “aligns” with the project.



The announcement, posted to X on Friday, framed the move as part of a shared vision for “crypto, patriotism and long-term success.”



While few concrete details were provided, the commitment suggests an effort to bring a veneer of institutional weight to a token that, like most memecoins, trades largely on attention and branding.



It's unclear how much capital the firm plans to commit. Other holdings in its portfolio include major altcoins like ether ETH$2,514.10, bitcoin BTC$105,565.52, and TRX TRX$0.28103, along with some stablecoins.



The project has nevertheless accumulated several lesser-known tokens, including BUILDon (B) after the project announced it would use WLF's USD1 stablecoin for real-world use cases.

One of the reasons that the altcoin season seemed to not have begun until now is the fact that Bitcoin has dominated the market recovery, and thus, the BTC dominance remains very high. For the altcoin season to actually begin, past market performances show that there needs to be a major decline in the Bitcoin dominance. This is the ultimate trigger the market needs to confirm that altcoins will begin their own independent run.

Bitcoin Dominance Needs To Fall To 62%

The Bitcoin dominance is still trending at a high 64%, and this continues to be a thorn in the side of altcoins. With the dominance this high, the Bitcoin price continues to dictate where the market goes and has seen altcoins suffer crashes as a result of even the tiniest movement triggering a decline in prices.

However, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend has pointed out an interesting formation in the chart, which is a 7-wave crashing pattern. This pattern has been completed, and this signals a possible drop in the Bitcoin dominance as time goes on. The last phase of the 7-wave pattern was when the dominance hit a peak of 64.6% before declining back down toward 64%.

This pattern suggests that the Bitcoin dominance could possibly drop to 62%, which would be good news for those waiting for the altcoin season. The last time that the dominance was this low was back on May 14, and altcoins had rallied hard as a result.

For this decline to be completed, the crypto analyst reveals that confirmation lies below 63.45%, as this is the Wave 6 lows. Once this support is broken, a sharp drop toward 62% is expected from here. As the analyst explains, “real momentum kicks in under 62%,” and this is when altcoin season moves with full force.

Altcoin Season Is Not Over

The topic of a possible altcoin season is currently one of the most debated in the crypto community as market participants remain split on where it is in the cycle. Some have said there will be no altcoin season similar to what was seen in 2021, while others have maintained that it is still possible.

One analyst on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has lent their voice, pushing the narrative that the altcoin season is far from over. For a 2021-style altcoin season to happen, though, the crypto analyst says the altcoin market, which excludes the top 10 cryptos by market cap, must break above the $470 billion resistance like it did in previous cycles. Once this happens, then they expect the altcoin season to begin.

 After earning $3 million from NFT sales, Jonathan Mann watched it vanish in a crash, and now he's turned the ordeal into a painfully honest crypto tax tune. 

Non-fungible token (NFT) artist Jonathan Mann, the musician behind the “Song A Day” project, has turned his crypto tax ordeal into a cautionary musical tale. 

In a new track shared on X, Mann recounted how he made $3 million selling his entire back catalog as NFTs, only to see it vanish as the market crashed during the Terra ecosystem collapse. 

“This is the story of how I made three million dollars and lost it,” Mann sings. “And how I owed the IRS more money than I made in 10 previous years.” 

Mann said it all began on Jan. 1, 2022, when he sold 3,700 songs at $800 each, netting him roughly $3 million — all in Ether (ETH). 

Excited but unprepared, Mann and his wife decided to hold onto the crypto, hoping ETH prices would increase. “We didn't have a plan,” Mann admitted in the song. 

Things took a turn when ETH's value declined in January 2022, and the couple was unsure about how much to sell or when. To add to their woes, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came knocking at their door. 

As Mann explained in the song, his earnings from selling NFTs are taxed as income. This means that tax is based on the value of the ETH when received, regardless of whether the crypto asset later crashes in value. Because of this, even though their $3 million in ETH went down in price, their tax bill remained the same.  

To avoid selling their crypto at a loss, Mann said they took out a loan through the lending protocol Aave, using some of the ETH as collateral. But disaster struck as the market started to crash, driven by the Terra collapse. 

The incident triggered a cascade of liquidations across the ecosystem, which included Mann's loan. In a flash, 300 ETH disappeared. “A lifetime of work erased in a moment,” he lamented. 

Scrambling to find a way out, Mann spent months combing through transactions with his accountant to determine how much they owed — they found out it was $1,095,171.79.

With the threat of potential liens on their home and risks of losing his wife's retirement account, Mann turned to one last option: selling a rare Autoglyph NFT he purchased back in crypto's early days. 

The musician said he attempted to sell the NFT through X but did not get a good reception. However, he found a broker with a client who offered $1.1 million for the NFT. Mann said that he accepted the deal to pay for the IRS taxes. 

Because of the losses incurred in the Aave loan, Mann did not owe capital gains taxes on the Autoglyph sale. “It felt so bittersweet to be done,” he sings at the end. 

Despite the ordeal, Mann continues writing daily songs and selling them as NFTs, still hopeful he'll one day earn another $3 million.

Ethereum attracts investor interest even when it maintains a healthy upward trend this month. Currently, with a 24-hour trading volume of $17.05 billion, ETH trades at $2,487.15 and has posted a 2% gain over the last 24 hours.While the weekly momentum was slightly bearish, the month-on-month increase of 30.45% illustrates excellent underlying momentum together with a fresh interest from institutional as well as retail investors.

The price recently followed the sharp rally from early in the month of May, which propelled Ethereum into consolidation with tighter trading ranges.There are minor price fluctuations, but the asset remains resilient to the downside, which suggests strong buying interest and potential continuation of the prevailing trend.

The 12-hour chart of Ethereum shows a symmetrical triangle pattern, clearer under technical analysis. This pattern is most commonly drawn with continuation moves but currently reflects indecision within the market since neither the buying nor selling pressure has taken control.Converging trendlines depict a compressing range, thus hinting at an impending significant breakout. In the previous trading sessions, Ethereum bounced off the support zone near $2,460 and regained ground towards the mid-range of the triangle.Currently, it approaches a crucial resistance zone that lies between $2,670 and $2,700, which coincides with the upper boundary of the triangle. This area has previously resulted in sell-offs; however, the tightening structure increases its chances of breaking out within days.

A clear move above the current resistance range would likely open up a rally target toward $3,300, as expected from the height measurement of the triangle. This bullish scenario would likely draw quite a bit of buying volume, which would continue to propel Ethereum higher.

The market is still cautious, though. If Ethereum cannot climb above the resistance, then the price could drop into the range between $2,430 and $2,250.This area is considered a significant support zone and may indeed become flavored with selling pressure if it were to be retested. Traders are waiting for a clear direction from volume and momentum as it gets closer to the apex of the triangle.

Crypto keeps offering not just an alternative financial system but a platform for global innovation. Amidst this evolution, one segment of the digital asset space consistently draws high-level attention: cryptocurrencies with high-growth potential. These assets aren't just promising when it comes to gains; they are reshaping how finance, data, and infrastructure operate across borders. 

A new class of blockchain projects is emerging that combines utility, scalability, and financial performance to deliver exponential upside. Among them, Qubetics stands out due to its transformative approach to cross-border transactions.

This article is about 6 of the best cryptos for 100X potential, from new entrants like Qubetics to top performers like Solana and Litecoin.

Qubetics introduces a novel solution to one of the most persistent problems in global finance: inefficient cross-border payments. The project's native token, TICS, enables near-instant, low-cost settlements that surpass the traditional SWIFT system in both speed and transparency. By using an advanced blockchain protocol, Qubetics eliminates intermediaries and minimizes delays.

Its protocol design focuses on interoperability, ensuring smooth integration with legacy banking systems and upcoming fintech platforms. 

With regulatory compliance built into the architecture, Qubetics allows banks and financial institutions to execute cross-border transactions while meeting global standards. The result is improved customer experience, operational efficiency, and a competitive edge for early adopters.

Qubetics is currently in the final stage of its crypto presale. The price per TICS token stands at $0.3370. More than $17.7 million has already been raised, with over 515 million $TICS tokens sold. The project has attracted more than 27,500 token holders, signaling strong community confidence and market readiness. 

Just 10 million $TICS tokens are left in the presale at $0.3370 before it lists at a forecasted $0.40. That means early birds stand to gain nearly 20% the moment it goes live. After a dramatic supply cut—from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens—the scarcity is real, and the shift of 38.55% of tokens to public hands signals a major move toward decentralization. 

With buzz building and demand heating up, a post-launch breakout is looking more and more likely.

If you drop $4,000 into $TICS today at $0.3370, you'll secure around 11,869 tokens. If the token hits $0.40, your holding would be worth about $4,747.60—a tidy $747.60 gain.

Better yet, if TICS reaches $1 post-presale, this amount turns into $11,867 — a 196% return. 

Should the token appreciate to $5, the value increases to $59,335, delivering a 1,383% ROI. At $10, the return jumps to $118,670, and at $15, it could reach $178,005, representing an astounding 4,349% ROI.

These projections are based on historical crypto market patterns and the unique utility $TICS brings to financial networks. It's important to note that while the projections are promising, actual outcomes depend on continued development, regulatory acceptance, and global adoption.

Why this crypto makes it to this list: Qubetics addresses a trillion-dollar market inefficiency with a working, regulatory-compliant solution. Its real-world utility for banks and financial systems enhances both adoption potential and long-term token value among the best cryptos for 100X potential.

Celestia proposes a revolutionary approach to blockchain architecture through modularity. By separating consensus and data availability layers, it offers developers a flexible environment to build scalable decentralized applications without inheriting the limitations of monolithic blockchains.

The platform empowers developers to deploy their own sovereign blockchains using minimal computational resources. With increasing demand for highly customizable blockchain environments, Celestia positions itself as an infrastructure cornerstone for future dApp ecosystems among the best cryptos for 100X potential.

Why this crypto makes it to this list: Celestia lays the groundwork for next-gen blockchain development, reducing entry barriers for developers while maximizing scalability and customizability.

Often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin's gold, Litecoin has sustained its reputation as a reliable digital currency since 2011. With faster transaction confirmation times and lower fees, Litecoin offers a practical alternative for everyday crypto payments.

Its recent adoption of the MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) upgrade enhances transaction privacy, making Litecoin more appealing to both individual users and payment-focused enterprises. Widespread exchange support and a strong developer community ensure continuous improvements.

Why this crypto makes it to this list: Litecoin's long-term stability, consistent development, and enhanced privacy features make it a solid bet for scalable digital currency usage.

Filecoin addresses the growing need for decentralized cloud storage by creating a marketplace where users pay for storage space using its native token, FIL. Providers earn FIL tokens by offering unused storage space and maintaining data integrity.

With partnerships spanning academic institutions, research facilities, and enterprise users, Filecoin provides a tangible utility in storing verifiable, censorship-resistant data. The protocol's alignment with Web3 principles adds an extra layer of relevance in today's privacy-focused environment.

Why this crypto makes it to this list: Filecoin merges technical innovation with a real-world use case: secure, distributed storage. Its economic model incentivizes trust and reliability, boosting long-term value.

Cardano stands apart due to its science-first approach, backed by peer-reviewed research and formal verification methods. Designed by academics and engineers, Cardano focuses on creating a sustainable, secure blockchain optimized for real-world applications.

The platform uses a unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, which consumes significantly less energy than proof-of-work chains. Cardano's ongoing upgrades, such as Hydra and Mithril, aim to enhance transaction speed and interoperability.

Why this crypto makes it to this list: Cardano's commitment to research, scalability, and environmental sustainability positions it as a forward-looking blockchain solution.



Solana boasts unmatched transaction speeds and minimal fees, making it ideal for high-frequency DeFi applications and NFT marketplaces. Its hybrid consensus model combines proof-of-history and proof-of-stake, optimizing performance without sacrificing decentralization.

Despite previous network congestion issues, Solana's ongoing improvements and strong developer ecosystem continue to attract new projects. From gaming platforms to DeFi protocols, Solana powers a growing number of high-traffic applications.

Why this crypto makes it to this list: Solana's technical capabilities, vibrant ecosystem, and strong institutional support make it a contender for long-term exponential growth.

The digital asset market rewards innovation, adoption, and utility. Each cryptocurrency discussed above brings a unique value proposition to the table. 

Qubetics redefines cross-border financial flows. Celestia offers developers a fresh, modular framework. Litecoin remains a reliable medium of exchange. Filecoin meets real-world storage demands. Cardano integrates science with scalability, and Solana delivers performance at scale.

These assets aren't just digital currencies; they represent the evolution of modern finance and infrastructure as the best cryptos for 100X potential.

But remember, while high potential returns exist, so do market risks. Regulatory changes, technological hurdles, and adoption rates will all influence future performance.

The meme narrative is one of the most promising in the crypto scene, meaning the Dogecoin price would skyrocket and the Shiba Inu price would reach new ATHs. Another narrative with massive potential is artificial intelligence, with Unilabs Finance (UNIL), a new AI-powered DeFi asset manager, at the forefront. 

According to experts, DOGE, SHIB and UNIL are top DeFi coins to buy now. Backed by bullish narratives and with significant upside potential, they could outperform this cycle. As an emerging cryptocurrency with a small market size, UNIL could be this year's biggest gainer. 

Investments_CEO's $2 Dogecoin price prediction at the start of the year might have sounded ambitious, but it isn't now. Trading upward on the yearly chart, the dog-themed cryptocurrency could break out above the 2021 all-time high of $0.7376, making it one of the top DeFi coins to buy now. 

Javon Marks' bullish Dogecoin price prediction also suggests the meme token could reach a minimum price of $0.739—a new high. Considering meme's outperformance, it isn't surprising that investors have been betting on DOGE, supported by bullish technical indicators like the Commodity Channel Index and Williams Percent Range. 

With summer set to be explosive, the current Dogecoin price presents a great entry. At the same time, UNIL, a new AI coin, is also among the top DeFi coins to buy now and could be a better bet than DOGE due to its small market size. 

The Shiba Inu price, already budget-friendly, entered an attractive buy zone following the latest market downturn. It hovers above $0.000012, but bulls could push the price toward the 30-day high of $0.000017 in the coming days. 

At the same time, technical indicators show a strong buy signal, notably the Williams Percent Range (14), positioning SHIB among the top DeFi coins to buy now. While Crypto_Twittier expects the Shiba Inu price to range between $0.00017 and $0.00032 this year, LordOfAlts believes growing Shibarium adoption could spark a 790% upswing. 

Given the above, SHIB is among the top DeFi coins to buy now for significant gains. Additionally, the current Shiba Inu price presents a great entry, allowing investors to position themselves for gains without breaking the bank.

Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is a groundbreaking innovation in DeFi—an alternative to traditional financial markets. Its AI-backed DeFi asset manager emerges amid demand for sophisticated, intelligent systems capable of identifying market trends and hidden opportunities. 

Compared to conventional asset managers, the platform will scan the crypto market for early and high-potential projects across promising narratives like AI, DePIN and RWAs. Insights from these analyses will, in turn, position investors for substantial ROIs and minimize risks through diversified exposure. 

A core offering of the protocol is the Memecoin Identification Tool, which analyzes virality potential, liquidity and risk—uncovering the next DOGE and SHIB. In addition, its AI-powered portfolio management will automatically adjust investors' portfolios based on market conditions, all without manual input. With adoption a matter of when and not if, experts consider the protocol's utility token, UNIL, one of the top DeFi coins to buy now. 

While the Dogecoin price is on track to explode and the Shiba Inu price targets a new ATH, UNIL, a new AI token, is among the top DeFi coins to buy now. It is significantly discounted at $0.0062 in stage 3 of its presale, selling out fast after $2.4 million was raised in funding. 

Besides its upside potential, the UNIL token can be staked and holders will also have governance rights. Additionally, 30% of the total fees generated by the platform will be redistributed to holders, thereby incentivizing the community.

 The price of Official Trump coin briefly spiked 6% before pulling back, following Eric Trump saying the team "remain focused on building the most exciting MEME on earth." 

Eric Trump, son of the US President, announced that Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLF) plans to acquire a significant amount of the Official Trump memecoin following his endorsement of the token.

Some users in the crypto community were surprised that Official Trump (TRUMP) didn't see a stronger price reaction.

“I am proud to announce the $TRUMP Meme Coin has aligned with @WorldLibertyFi,” Trump said in a June 6 X post.

“We're proud to announce that World Liberty Financial plans to acquire a substantial position in $TRUMP for their Long-Term Treasury,” he said. Minutes after Trump published the X post, Official Trump's price jumped 6.40%, before retracing to $10.10 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. It is ranked as the 45th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $2.03 billion.

Some crypto commentators were skeptical that the news didn't drive a stronger price increase. Crypto commentator Pluid said in a June 6 X post, “The coin hasn't pumped on this news - not a good sign at all.”

It comes just weeks after the top 220 holders of Trump's memecoin met at the president's golf course in Virginia on May 23 for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.

Trump also dismissed the Official Trump Wallet launch following controversy earlier this month. “Although their meme wallet isn't moving forward, they remain focused on building the most exciting MEME on earth - $Trump,” he said. 

The controversy began on June 3, when non-fungible token marketplace Magic Eden and the team behind the president's memecoin, Official Trump, both said that they were linking up to launch “the Official $TRUMP Wallet.”

Eric Trump responded at the time, stating that the wallet “is not authorized by Trump” and warned Magic Eden to “be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization.”

Donald Trump Jr. later clarified that the family's crypto platform “will be launching our official wallet soon.”

Eric Trump, who is known for his pro-crypto stance, also spoke at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 15, saying that from families to government funds, “everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now.”

Crypto World News

June 7, 2025 by Sheila 

Mythical Games, a blockchain gaming studio, has confirmed the global launch of its crypto-powered soccer title, FIFA Rivals, scheduled for June 12. The game will feature Adidas-branded digital assets from the outset, facilitated by a new multi-year licensing agreement with the sportswear brand. Players will gain access to exclusive Adidas kits, jerseys, and virtual shoes, all connected to the iconic football brand's heritage.

FIFA Rivals brings Adidas' football heritage into the cryptocurrency gaming world. Players can buy, sell, or collect distinct Adidas digital items as unique, tradable assets. Additionally, a virtual Adidas Training Facility will be incorporated into the game enabling players to upgrade their team cards and finish tasks to unlock extra rewards.

FIFA Rivals is a mobile football game that curates official FIFA licensing with fast arcade action and blockchain features. With crypto technology Mythical Games gives players actual ownership of their in-game assets. Adidas gear, player cards, and other digital items are represented as collectibles on the blockchain, with secure ownership and easy trading on the Mythical Marketplace.

The game features a crypto-enabled ecosystem in which players can build their dream squads, engage with the global community, and compete in real-time PvP matches. Users have full control of their digital collections and can buy, sell and trade assets. Furthermore, FIFA Rivals takes a different approach to traditional mobile games, which makes the gameplay transparent and more engaging for both crypto and football fans.

Mythical Games CEO John Linden added that by integrating Adidas, the players will now be better connected to the culture of football. The partnership indicates a new milestone for digital brands in the crypto gaming space, featuring the reach of global sports and the advantages of blockchain technology.

Mythical Games has garnered investment from key stakeholders in the crypto/Web3 space, including a16z, ARK Invest and Animoca Brands. The company's blockchain based games have already processed $650 million in transactions with over seven million users. The addition of Adidas to FIFA Rivals highlights growing interest in the intersection of crypto gaming and sports.

Additionally, players will be able to collect limited edition crypto assets associated with real-world football moments, such as when a special Adidas in-game event takes place and digital drops. Through the blockchain infrastructure, the Mythical Marketplace will support secure trading and ownership of all forms of digital collectibles.

 JAN3 founder Samson Mow says Elon Musk should go all in on Bitcoin before “they freeze his fiat assets.” 

The Bitcoin community is calling on Tesla CEO Elon Musk to stack Bitcoin as a way to gain the upper hand in his ongoing public feud with US President Donald Trump.

“The best way for Elon to get back at Trump is by full porting Bitcoin,” crypto trader and analyst Will Clemente said in a June 6 X post. Echoing a similar sentiment, JAN3 founder and CEO Samson Mow said in an X post on the same day, “@elonmusk, it's time to go all in on Bitcoin.”

Mow urged Musk to accept Bitcoin (BTC) payments for Tesla and adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. In 2021, Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment due to environmental concerns. However, the firm still holds digital assets. On April 23, Cointelegraph reported that Tesla's digital asset holdings dropped 11.61% in value from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1.

Mow also proposed that Musk's SpaceX offer launch discounts to customers who pay in Bitcoin.

“Force a hard money standard on the money printers,” Mow said. It comes after Mow recently told Cointelegraph Magazine that it's been three months since Trump signed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order, but he is yet to buy any additional Bitcoin. He said the US “has to start” acquiring Bitcoin this year to avoid being front-run by other nations.

In another comment to Musk, Mow added:

Some Bitcoiners speculated that if Musk backed Bitcoin, he wouldn't hold back. Lomob co-founder and CEO Boyd Cohen said, “If Musk were to go BTC maxi, all bets are off in so many ways. He doesn't do anything small.”

“He'd build or buy his way to the biggest BTC treasury, he'd accept BTC in all his businesses, he'd be joining Bitcoin Presidents on the world stage promoting it as the only path to freedom,” Cohen said.

The feud started after Musk left office as an adviser to Trump and then called his tax bill a “disgusting abomination” on June 3. It escalated on June 5 after both traded public insults on social media. Musk said Trump's plan for sweeping global tariffs “will cause a recession in the second half of this year.”

Meanwhile, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that terminating Musk's government subsidies and contracts would save “billions and billions of dollars” for the US government. 

Musk has frequently mentioned cryptocurrency over the years. Most recently, on June 2, he said his social media platform X is rolling out a new messaging feature, XChats, which will have “Bitcoin-style encryption.”

Jonathan Mann decided to hold the ETH from the sale, which turned out to be a bad decision in hindsight.

Singer-songwriter Jonathan Mann recently shared the story of how earning millions in Ethereum (ETH) during a one-hour sale of his NFTs eventually became a “tax nightmare.”

Mann has published one song a day over the past 17 years and released his 6,000th song on June 5, which was about the purported nightmare resulting from the sale.

In 2022, he sold 4,000 songs worth 13 years of work within 60 minutes for a total of roughly $3 million in Ethereum. He retained the earnings in Ethereum instead of converting to dollars.

 However, a week later, market price slipped below $3,000, shrinking the sale's dollar value.

 The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats revenue earned directly in crypto as ordinary income at the moment of receipt, he owed a massive tax obligation even though his assets were no longer worth the same dollar amount.

The tax man calculated Mann's tax obligations based on the $3 million initial valuation rather than on subsequent lower prices.

Mann had already accumulated $1 million in 2021 obligations linked to earlier NFT mints and airdrops, including Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and ConstitutionDAO tokens. 

To cover part of that balance, he borrowed $400,000 against 518 ETH through the Aave lending platform. However, little did he know that his collateral was about to evaporate.

However, the May 2022 collapse of the Terra ecosystem cut the collateral's value from $1.5 million to about $200,000, forcing a last-minute repayment that left Mann with 163 ETH and a net capital loss of roughly $1.3 million.

IRS notices during 2023 and 2024 cited unpaid income tax of nearly $1.1 million and threatened asset seizure. Mann recounted that at the time he was “dreading” the only option he had left to solve his dilemma – selling his “autoglyph.”

He wrote:

“My Autoglyph.

Minted April 8th, 2019.  

(Day before my birthday)  

It cost $36.

And this wasn't just an NFT. 

Matt Hall and John Watkinson (of Cryptopunks fame) had made something special. The day after the mint, I turned mine into music. John built a custom “glyph to midi” tool because of it.

It was a piece of my soul from when 50 people knew what NFTs were.  

By 2024, it was worth over $1 million.”

The sale offset the losses from his borrowing and helped him clear his tax obligations. As a conclusion to his story, Mann urged creators to convert crypto from NFT sales to dollars.

He wrote:

“The moral for every NFT creator: SELL. THE. ETH. IMMEDIATELY.”

This will match revenue with prospective tax liabilities. He cited using the protocol 0xSplits to automatically convert half of NFT proceeds into USDC to reduce exposure to price swings.

Unlike birds, which navigate unknown environments with remarkable speed and agility, drones typically rely on external guidance or pre-mapped routes. However, a groundbreaking development by Professor Fu Zhang and researchers from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Faculty of Engineering at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), has enabled drones and micro air vehicles (MAVs) to emulate the flight capabilities of birds more closely than ever before.

The team has developed the Safety-Assured High-Speed Aerial Robot (SUPER), capable of flying at speeds exceeding 20 meters per second and avoiding obstacles as thin as 2.5 millimeters - such as power lines or twigs - using solely on onboard sensors and computing power. With a compact design featuring a wheelbase of just 280 mm and a takeoff weight of 1.5 kg, SUPER demonstrates exceptional agility, navigating dense forests at night and skillfully avoiding thin wires.

Professor Zhang describes this invention as a game-changer in the field of drone technology, "Picture a 'Robot Bird' swiftly maneuvering through the forest, effortlessly dodging branches and obstacles at high speeds. This is a significant step forward in autonomous flight technology. Our system allows MAVs to navigate complex environments at high speeds with a level of safety previously unattainable. It's like giving the drone the reflexes of a bird, enabling it to dodge obstacles in real-time while racing toward its goal."

The breakthrough lies in the sophisticated integration of hardware and software. SUPER utilizes a lightweight 3D light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor capable of detecting obstacles up to 70 meters away with pinpoint accuracy. This is paired with an advanced planning framework that generates two trajectories during flight: one that optimizing speed by venturing into unknown spaces and another prioritizing safety by remaining within known, obstacle-free zones.

By processing LIDAR data directly as point clouds, the system significantly reduces computation time, enabling rapid decision-making even at high velocities. The technology has been tested in various real-life applications, such as the autonomous exploration of ancient sites, and has demonstrated seamless navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments.

"The ability to avoid thin obstacles and navigate tight spaces opens up new possibilities for applications like search and rescue, where every second counts. SUPER's robustness in various lighting conditions, including nighttime, makes it a reliable tool for round-the-clock operations." said Mr Yunfan Ren, the lead author of the research paper.

The research team envisions a wide range of applications for this innovative technology, including autonomous delivery, power line inspection, forest monitoring, autonomous exploration, and mapping. In search and rescue missions, MAVs equipped with SUPER technology could swiftly navigate disaster zones - such as collapsed buildings or dense forests - day and night, locating survivors or assessing hazards more efficiently than current drones. Moreover, in disaster relief scenarios, they could deliver crucial supplies to remote and inaccessible areas.

The math doesn't add up.

In the history of studying the proliferation of humanity across the globe, there has long been one question that has stumped researchers: How did the islands of Southeast Asia (ISEA) become so well-inhabited so long ago? 

It probably required technological seafaring advancements beyond what was considered likely during the Paleolithic era. But those experts may have a surprising new answer thanks to research that shows the ancient people of the Philippines and ISEA may have mastered seafaring well before anyone else. 

The pivotal archaeological evidence comes in the form of stone tools excavated at sites in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste, showing strong evidence that as far back as 40,000 years ago, there was a technological sophistication from these ancient seafarers that rivals much later civilizations. In a study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, researchers from Ateneo de Manila University challenge the accepted belief that Paleolithic technical progress was centered in Africa and Europe. 

Proving seafaring history represents a tricky endeavor, since organic wood and fiber that would have likely been used in constructing Paleolithic seacraft rarely survive in the archaeological record. These stone tools offer a new way in. The most recent discovery, according to the study, shows traces of plant processing that features the “extraction of fibers necessary for making ropes, nets, and bindings essential for boatbuilding and open-sea fishing.”

Add in the discovery of fishing hooks, gorges, net weights, and the remains of deep-ocean fish such as tuna and sharks, and these archeological sites are a rich exploration of what is obviously a robust seafaring culture. 

“The remains of large predatory pelagic fish at these sites indicate the capacity for advanced seafaring and knowledge of the seasonality and migration routes of those fish species,” the study authors wrote. The collection of fish and tool remains “indicates the need for strong and well-crafted cordage for ropes and fishing lines to catch the marine fauna.” 

As the archaeological finds point toward a sophisticated method of deep-ocean fishing, the study authors believe the ancient seafarers constructed boats from organic materials and held them together with plant-based ropes. That same rope technology was then adapted for the actual fishing. 

While widely accepted that the presence of fossils and artifacts across a range of islands provides evidence that early modern humans moved across the open sea, the study's authors fight against the prevailing theory that the prehistoric migrations were passive sea drifters on bamboo rafts. Rather, they posit that the movement came from highly skilled navigators equipped with the knowledge and technology to travel to remote locations over deep waters. 

“The identification of boat-building materials through direct or indirect evidence is vital in understanding movements across and within island environments,” the authors wrote in the study. 

“The presence of such advanced maritime technology in prehistoric ISEA highlights the ingenuity of early Philippine peoples and their neighbors,” the authors said in a statement from the university, “whose boat-building knowledge likely made the region a center for technological innovations tens of thousands of years ago and laid the foundations for the maritime traditions that still thrive in the region today.”

In the name of open science, the multinational scientific collaboration COSMOS on Thursday released the data behind the largest map of the universe. Called the COSMOS-Web field, the project, built with data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), consists of all the imaging and a catalog of nearly 800,000 galaxies spanning nearly all of cosmic time. And it's been challenging existing notions of the infant universe.

"Our goal was to construct this deep field of space on a physical scale that far exceeded anything that had been done before," said UC Santa Barbara physics professor Caitlin Casey, who co-leads the COSMOS-Web collaboration alongside Jeyhan Kartaltepe of the Rochester Institute of Technology. "If you had a printout of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field on a standard piece of paper," she said, referring to the iconic view of nearly 10,000 galaxies released by NASA in 2004, "our image would be slightly larger than a 13-foot by 13-foot-wide mural, at the same depth. So it's really strikingly large."

The COSMOS-Web composite image reaches back about 13.5 billion years; according to NASA, the universe is about 13.8 billion years old, give or take one hundred million years. That covers about 98% of all cosmic time. The objective for the researchers was not just to see some of the most interesting galaxies at the beginning of time but also to see the wider view of cosmic environments that existed during the early universe, during the formation of the first stars, galaxies and black holes.

"The cosmos is organized in dense regions and voids," Casey explained. "And we wanted to go beyond finding the most distant galaxies; we wanted to get that broader context of where they lived."

A 'big surprise'

And what a cosmic neighborhood it turned out to be. Before JWST turned on, Casey said, she and fellow astronomers made their best predictions about how many more galaxies the space telescope would be able to see, given its 6.5 meter (21 foot) diameter light-collecting primary mirror, about six times larger than Hubble's 2.4 meter (7 foot, 10 in) diameter mirror. The best measurements from Hubble suggested that galaxies within the first 500 million years would be incredibly rare, she said.

"It makes sense -- the Big Bang happens and things take time to gravitationally collapse and form, and for stars to turn on. There's a timescale associated with that," Casey explained. "And the big surprise is that with JWST, we see roughly 10 times more galaxies than expected at these incredible distances. We're also seeing supermassive black holes that are not even visible with Hubble." And they're not just seeing more, they're seeing different types of galaxies and black holes, she added.

'Lots of unanswered questions'

While the COSMOS-Web images and catalog answer many questions astronomers have had about the early universe, they also spark more questions.

"Since the telescope turned on we've been wondering 'Are these JWST datasets breaking the cosmological model? Because the universe was producing too much light too early; it had only about 400 million years to form something like a billion solar masses of stars. We just do not know how to make that happen," Casey said. "So, lots of details to unpack, and lots of unanswered questions."

In releasing the data to the public, the hope is that other astronomers from all over the world will use it to, among other things, further refine our understanding of how the early universe was populated and how everything evolved to the present day. The dataset may also provide clues to other outstanding mysteries of the cosmos, such as dark matter and physics of the early universe that may be different from what we know today.

"A big part of this project is the democratization of science and making tools and data from the best telescopes accessible to the broader community," Casey said. The data was made public almost immediately after it was gathered, but only in its raw form, useful only to those with the specialized technical knowledge and the supercomputer access to process and interpret it. The COSMOS collaboration has worked tirelessly for the past two years to convert raw data into broadly usable images and catalogs. In creating these products and releasing them, the researchers hope that even undergraduate astronomers could dig into the material and learn something new.

"Because the best science is really done when everyone thinks about the same data set differently," Casey said. "It's not just for one group of people to figure out the mysteries."

For the COSMOS collaboration, the exploration continues. They've headed back to the deep field to further map and study it.

"We have more data collection coming up," she said. "We think we have identified the earliest galaxies in the image, but we need to verify that." To do so, they'll be using spectroscopy, which breaks up light from galaxies into a prism, to confirm the distance of these sources (more distant = older). "As a byproduct," Casey added, "we'll get to understand the interstellar chemistry in these systems through tracing nitrogen, carbon and oxygen. There's a lot left to learn and we're just beginning to scratch the surface."

The COSMOS-Web image is available to browse interactively; the accompanying scientific papers have been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal and Astronomy & Astrophysics.

Hailed as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century, transistors are integral components of modern electronics that amplify or switch electrical signals. As electronics become smaller, it is becoming increasingly difficult to continue scaling down silicon-based transistors. Has the development of our electronics hit a wall?

Now, a research team led by the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, has sought a solution. As detailed in their new paper, to be issued in 2025 Symposium on VLSI Technology and Circuits , the team ditched the silicon and instead opted to create a transistor made from gallium-doped indium oxide (InGaOx). This material can be structured as a crystalline oxide, whose orderly, crystal lattice is well suited for electron mobility.

"We also wanted our crystalline oxide transistor to feature a 'gate-all-around' structure, whereby the gate, which turns the current on or off, surrounds the channel where the current flows," explains Anlan Chen, lead author of the study. "By wrapping the gate entirely around the channel, we can enhance efficiency and scalability compared with traditional gates."

With these goals in mind, the team got to work. The researchers knew that they would need to introduce impurities to the indium oxide by 'doping' it with gallium. This would make the material react with electricity in a more favorable way.

"Indium oxide contains oxygen-vacancy defects, which facilitate carrier scattering and thus lower device stability," says Masaharu Kobayashi, senior author. "We doped indium oxide with gallium to suppress oxygen vacancies and in turn improve transistor reliability."

The team used atomic-layer deposition to coat the channel region of a gate-all-around transistor with a thin film of InGaOx, one atomic layer at a time. After deposition, the film was heated to transform it into the crystalline structure needed for electron mobility. This process ultimately enabled the fabrication of a gate-all-around 'metal oxide-based field-effect transistor' (MOSFET).

"Our gate-all-around MOSFET, containing a gallium-doped indium oxide layer, achieves high mobility of 44.5 cm2/Vs," explains Dr Chen. "Crucially, the device demonstrates promising reliability by operating stably under applied stress for nearly three hours. In fact, our MOSFET outperformed similar devices that have previously been reported."

The efforts shown by the team have provided the field with a new transistor design that considers the importance of both materials and structure. The research is a step towards the development of reliable, high-density electronic components suited for applications with high computational demand, such as big data and artificial intelligence. These tiny transistors promise to help next-gen technology run smoothly, making a big difference to our everyday lives.

The article "A Gate-All-Around Nanosheet Oxide Semiconductor Transistor by Selective Crystallization of InGaOx for Performance and Reliability Enhancement" was issued in 2025 Symposium on VLSI Technology and Circuits.

Giant viruses play a role in the survival of single-celled marine organisms called protists. These include algae, amoeba, and flagellates, that form the base of ocean food webs. And since these protists form an important part of the food chain, these large DNA viruses are often responsible for various public health hazards, including harmful algal blooms.

A new study from scientists at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science may help unravel the many types of viruses present in our waterways and oceans. This knowledge could help local leaders better prepare for when a harmful algal bloom may be impacting their coastline or if any other viruses are present in local bays, rivers or lakes.

Using high-performance computing methods, researchers identified 230 novel giant viruses in publicly available marine metagenomic datasets and characterized their functions.

Published in the journal Nature npj Viruses, their findings include the discovery of new giant virus genomes previously unknown in literature. Within these genomes, 530 new functional proteins were characterized, including nine proteins involved in photosynthesis. This indicates that these viruses may be able to manipulate their host and the photosynthesis process during infection.

"By better understanding the diversity and role of giant viruses in the ocean and how they interact with algae and other ocean microbes, we can predict and possibly manage harmful algal blooms, which are human health hazards in Florida as well as all over the world," said Mohammad Moniruzzaman, a co-author of the study and an assistant professor in the Department of Marine Biology and Ecology. "Giant viruses are often the main cause of death for many phytoplankton, which serve as the base of the food web supporting ocean ecosystems and food sources. The novel functions found in giant viruses could have biotechnological potential, as some of these functions might represent novel enzymes."

Until recently, giant viruses were largely undetected by scientific methods due to limitations in bioinformatic pipelines. The researchers created an innovative tool called BEREN (Bioinformatic tool for Eukaryotic virus Recovery from Environmental metageNomes), designed to identify giant virus genomes within extensive public DNA sequencing datasets.

"We discovered that giant viruses possess genes involved in cellular functions such as carbon metabolism and photosynthesis -- traditionally found only in cellular organisms, said Benjamin Minch, the lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the Department of Marine Biology and Ecology at the Rosenstiel School. "This suggests that giant viruses play an outsized role in manipulating their host's metabolism during infection and influencing marine biogeochemistry."

The authors used the University of Miami's Pegasus supercomputer at the Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC) to process and assemble large metagenomes -- often exceeding a gigabase per library -- enabling the reconstruction of hundreds of microbial community libraries.

"This study allowed us to create a framework to improve existing tools for detecting novel viruses that could aid in our ability to monitor pollution and pathogens in our waterways." Minch added.

The research team downloaded DNA sequencing data from nine large global ocean sampling projects spanning from pole to pole. Using BEREN, they recovered giant virus genomes from the data. The genomes were then annotated using publicly available gene function databases to characterize the functions encoded by these viruses. These genomes were compared to all currently available giant virus representatives to identify novel functions.

The BEREN program used to facilitate this research fills a gap in the research field by providing an easy-to-use, one-stop tool for identifying and classifying giant viruses in sequencing datasets. BEREN is available for anyone to use and can be download at: https://gitlab.com/benminch1/BEREN

The study titled, "Expansion of the genomic and functional diversity of global ocean giant viruses," was published on April 21, 2025 in the journal Nature npj Viruses. The authors are Benjamin Minch and Mohammad Moniruzzaman from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science.

Millions trust their lives daily to floppy disks and Windows 95.

The head of the Federal Aviation Administration just outlined an ambitious goal to upgrade the U.S.'s air traffic control (ATC) system and bring it into the 21st century. According to NPR, most ATC towers and other facilities today feel like they're stuck in the 20th century, with controllers using paper strips and floppy disks to transfer data, while their computers run Windows 95. While this likely saved them from the disastrous CrowdStrike outage that had a massive global impact, their age is a major risk to the nation's critical infrastructure, with the FAA itself saying that the current state of its hardware is unsustainable.

“The whole idea is to replace the system. No more floppy disks or paper strips,” acting FAA administrator Chris Rocheleau told the House Appropriations Committee last Wednesday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy also said earlier this week,” This is the most important infrastructure project that we've had in this country for decades. Everyone agrees — this is non-partisan. Everyone knows we have to do it.” 

The aviation industry put up a coalition pushing for ATC modernization called Modern Skies, and it even ran an ad telling us that ATC is still using floppy disks and several older technologies to keep our skies safe.

Unfortunately, upgrading the ATC system isn't as simple as popping into your nearby Micro Center and buying the latest and greatest gaming PC. First and foremost, some systems can never be shut down because it is crucial for safety. Because of this, you can't just switch off one site to swap out ancient components for newer ones. Aside from that, the upgrades to this critical infrastructure should be resistant to hacking and other vulnerabilities, as even a single breach could cripple the nation, costing time, money, and lives.

The FAA is pouring a lot of money into maintaining its old ATC systems, as they have to keep running 24/7. Nevertheless, age will eventually catch up no matter how much repair, upkeep, or overhaul you do. Currently, the White House hasn't said what this update will cost. The FAA has already put out a Request For Information to gather data from companies willing to take on the challenge of upgrading the entire system. It also announced several ‘Industry Days' so companies can pitch their tech and ideas to the Transportation Department.

Duffy said that the Transportation Department aims to complete the project within four years. However, industry experts say this timeline is unrealistic. No matter how long it takes, it's high time that the FAA upgrades the U.S.'s ATC system today after decades of neglect.

Since you're burning audio data to create the visual image, you can't also store data, etc.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A developer has dusted off an almost 20-year-old software project for burning visual artwork onto the data recording surface (the bottom) of a Compact Disc. Arduinocelentano stresses that the applied imaging technique involves “No LightScribe, no LabelTag. No hardware hacks or gimmicks.” All an interested CD artist needs is “A regular CD-RW drive and a regular Compact Disk.” The trick works because ones and zeros burned into the surface of the CD reflect light differently, thus allowing the creation of images.

However, please note that this technique will make your Compact Disc into artwork, nothing more. This is because the process burns an ‘audio track' as the visual app's output, meaning there's no room left for files, archives, or anything else you may care to store on a CD in 2025.

Arduinocelentano is the first to admit that this project is based on prior works by fellow hobbyist developers like argon and unDEFER. Actually, it is argon, who published their Instructables post around 18 years ago, who provides the clearest insight into the underlying technology here. In brief, “By carefully choosing the right 1s and 0s to burn to a CD, it is possible to burn visible images on normal CD-Rs.” Check out that link for more technical insight into how creating pictures on garden-variety CDs is possible.

Many optical media users in previous decades will have noticed that it was sometimes possible to see if a blank disc had any data written to it because the uniform reflective surface changed after writing. These visual writing techniques rely on the same phenomenon for their artistic tricks.

Argon is the developer who also seems to have first considered the problem presented by the variable geometry of different CD brands. The tool from arduinocelentano actually notes that “If your Compact Disc is not mentioned in the track generating dialog, you'll probably fail”—and only four discs have been profiled for imaging due to the time/effort required to create accurate new calibration data.

We downloaded and tested the tool from arduinocelentano. Thankfully, a Windows binary of cdimage-release-win64-20220722 was available. The software was intuitive and uncluttered. Basically, it is used for just two things: loading an image and creating the ‘audio track' data with the specially formed arrays of 1s and 0s that you will burn to a CD (as an audio CD) using your current tool of choice.



The main window shows a blank CD workspace. Users open an image file from the Edit menu (jpg, png and xpm images are supported). Once the image has been positioned (click and drag) and scaled (mouse wheel) satisfactorily, it is time to move on to the create track option in the Edit menu.

Remember, at this stage, you are creating a file for a CD burning app to write to disk, but you have several parameters to fill in. There are geometry presets for four types/brands of CD-RW (rewritable) media: two from Verbatim, one from TDK, and another ePerformance-branded disc.

Tom's Hardware looked closely at technologies such as Lightscribe and LabelFlash in 2006; you can dive into an 11-page feature via that link. The key difference with Lighscribe was that the media had a side specially designed/surfaced to carry a visual image, with no effects on the data side. So you would typically write your data, flip the disc, and then burn the visual label. CDs and DVDs were popular during this era, so appropriate media with the scribe/flash surface was quite widely available.

In the mid-noughties, I was firmly in the Lightscribe camp. In 2008, I even wrote a couple of articles about using﻿ Lightscribe, providing some grayscale test print calibration images to help readers.

Some people preferred their optical media with a plain white ink-jet printable reverse. That was faster and easier to print with an ink-jet equipped with the correct feed system, but output could be easily smudged at a later date.

Smelling good is as important as getting that kill streak.

Gaming hardware company Zotac, known for its graphics cards, mini-PCs, and gaming handheld consoles, just launched a new product line designed for gamers. According to the Facebook post of HKEPC [machine translated], the company is launching the F5 Esports Perfume designed for players “to keep their body smell refreshed in intense gaming, fight mental fatigue, improve attention, and speed up reactions.”

Zotac first released an April Fool's post about this fragrance earlier this year on the Zotac news page, saying that the fragrance uses a “proprietary blend of caffeine, taurine, and other secret ingredients.” It also listed what F5 smells like — a combination of sea breeze, cypress, mint, and white musk, delivering an aquatic and woody scent. We're unsure if the details on this page are still accurate, but one of our teammates here at Tom's Hardware got their hands on it during Computex 2025. According to them, the fragrance smells sweet and is suitable for everyone.

The box says that the F5 is Eau de Parfum, meaning it's supposed to last about four to six hours. Its top note lasts about 30 minutes, while the heart or body notes stay on for another half hour. Its base note stays on the longest, but according to our experience, the scent sticks around for just a couple of hours, at best.

This isn't the first time a PC gaming company has dabbled in olfactory accessories. Asus launched a laptop with a fragrance dispenser last year, designed for laptop users who are also into fashion. It then followed this up with an aromatic wireless mouse to keep your hand and workstation smelling fresh. If you're into gaming but want to smell something nice coming from your GPU instead of melting plastic, you can choose some of Yeston's Radeon RTX 9070 XT models, which come with a fragrance module in their shroud.

HKEPC says that the fragrance is in open beta, and you need to apply by June 13 to try on this unique gaming accessory. We hope that this beta test is successful and Zotac decides to launch this as a regular product. After all, we also want to check out the other scents listed on its page, like Ctrl+Alt+Scent, Critical Hit, and GG.

If you own a PS5, having multiple controllers is almost a necessity as there's nothing better than sharing your favorite PlayStation games with friends or family in the same room. While it's always wise to have a spare controller ready for multiplayer sessions or simply as a backup, genuine discounts on the PlayStation DualSense wireless controller are rare.

Even during Black Friday, major promotions were hard to find which makes this moment the perfect opportunity to add another controller to your setup. Right now, the PlayStation DualSense controller is available on Amazon for just $54 which is a substantial 27% off its usual $74 price. This limited-time deal marks an all-time low, so it's an ideal time to buy, especially if you missed out on previous sales.

The biggest feature of the DualSense controler is haptic feedback which puts the feel of in-game action and environments right in your hands. Whether you're racing down rough roads, wielding guns or feeling the crash of a collision, the controller's next-gen vibration motors plunge you further into the game.

Aside from the haptic feedback, adaptive triggers provide varying levels of force and tension so that you can feel the distinction between drawing back a bowstring or slamming on the brakes in a racing title. They work together to create a feeling of realism and immersion that was not achievable on previous PlayStation controllers.

The built-in microphone allows you to chat online without a headset and the 3.5mm audio jack allows you to plug in your favorite headphones for individual use. The create button is convenient to use to capture and stream your most excellent gaming moments in case you're playing with buddies or capturing highlights to playback later. The controller's iconic appearance has been fine-tuned for comfort with enhanced sticks and an intuitive layout that feels great in your hand even after long gaming sessions.

DualSense isn't only for PlayStation 5 gamers: With its USB Type-C and Bluetooth connectivity, you can easily play it on Windows desktops and Macs too which gives you even more gaming possibilities outside of the console. Most high-end PC games currently support advanced features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which lets you experience the same immersive experience playing from your computer.

With over 33,000 reviews and a lovely 4.6 out of 5-star rating, the PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller is a proven winner among gamers. Don't hesitate too much: These sales don't come around often, and the stock may not be here.

Storing your precious photos and precious memories on an outside hard drive is not only a smart backup strategy: it's also a safe way to protect your files from hacker attacks and data intrusions. While cloud storage is convenient, there are ongoing costs and potential privacy issues that come with it.

That's where the Seagate external hard drive (HDD) enters as a great alternative and offers enormous storage space and durable protection at a fraction of the cost. Right now, Amazon is selling this essential 4TB device for just $99 which is a 20% discount from its regular price of $124 (and it is an all-time low).

See at Amazon

The Seagate external hard drive connects via USB 3.0 for fast data transfer speeds that are compatible with a wide range of devices, including PCs, Macs, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles. Whether you're backing up your computer, expanding your gaming library or transferring files between systems, this drive is ready for any task. At 4TB capacity, you can store 100,000 photos, 1,000 hours of HD video, or uncountable amounts of documents and music files.

You will also love its plug-and-play convenience: No software installation, no configuring complicated settings – just plug it in, and off you go. The compact and light weight design makes it easy to transport in a briefcase or backpack, with your papers coming with you wherever you go. The drive is also extremely durable, with a strong reputation and 4.6 out of 5 stars user rating from over 250,000 reviews.

In addition to its technical features, the Seagate hard drive also includes a one-year Rescue Data Recovery Services plan. This useful extra is a peace-of-mind feature with the assurance that should something happen to your drive, Seagate experts can assist in the recovery of your precious data. This feature is comforting for those maintaining priceless memories or key work files. The Windows and Mac compatibility of the drive ensures you won't have to worry about issues with formatting, and it is equally simple to reformat if you ever need to switch to a different operating system.

The cost and durability of this Seagate external hard drive ensure this is a much better long-term option than cloud storage subscription plans: You save money on monthly expenses but you also enjoy complete control of your own information and privacy. The solid construction of the drive and consistent performance make it perfect for anyone seeking a dependable backup unit.

This tiny device is great if you're looking to safeguard their digital life. Don't miss this short-term deal.

Let the internet guessing games begin!

you might have bought your @BambulabGlobal H2D too early!the brand new 340mm build volumesingle extruder flagship is coming!!!!!!!!!!!image credit:"丫丫" from wechat pic.twitter.com/lihZ6ieDEWJune 4, 2025

A user on X posted a blurry image they claim to be the next Bambu Lab 3D printer, leaked from WeChat on June 4th (expand the above tweet to see the image). Internet gurus immediately began the time-honored sport of image dissection to determine the type of printer that had been leaked.

When the H2D leaked in March 2025, we did not report on it because Tom's Hardware was under embargo and already had the H2D in our workshop. This time around, there is no embargo, because we haven't been told of the next release yet. Nothing is alarming about this chain of events, as we saw it happen with the P1P, Bambu Lab's budget follow-up to the X1 Carbon in 2022. It was released without fanfare, and only a few units were sent to reviewers before the announcement.

I recently spoke with one of Bambu Lab's PR people for a brief catch-up call to see how I liked the H2D's laser after spending more time with it. We also spoke of new filament lines, the successful launch of Bambu's CyberBrick modular RC vehicles, and new tools coming to MakerLab. When I asked if there was a new printer in the pipeline, she shrugged it off. Maybe later.

There are always more printers coming out later. Bambu Lab is clearly determined to dominate the 3D printing landscape, with offerings for both home and business users at several price points. The A1 Mini is our favorite 3D printer for beginners and the H2D tops our list for professionals. 

Since we don't have any insider information, let's take a look at the leaked photo together. We adjusted the contrast on the photo and placed a few arrows at the most interesting parts of the leaked image.



First, we can see that this is a single-nozzle machine, with the same yellow rotating extruder wheel as the A1 behind a similar bubble window on the tool head shroud. Lower on the right-hand side is the same tool head camera from the H2D, used to read printed codes and perform printer calibration. What we can see of the nozzle and fans looks very much like an H2D tool head with a single nozzle.

The edge of the built platform only shows one number: 340mm. The last number is always the build height, so this printer is 15mm taller or has a little more headroom than the H2D's 325mm build height.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Finally, there is a faint white timestamp in the lower right corner: 2025.04.2? This would suggest the photo is recent.

Here is a photo of the Tom's Hardware H2D Laser Combo for comparison. I tried to capture a similar angle.



Armchair internet sleuths are predicting the leaked photo is of a stripped-down H2D, perhaps a less expensive model with a single nozzle and larger build volume. This would fit the pattern of Bambu Lab releases: after the launch of the flagship X1 Carbon, we saw the cheaper P1P and P1S. The P1 line of printers shares the same print quality due to its use of the same build volume, motion system, and hotend; however, it is more affordable due to a simpler user interface.

The photo would seem to back this up. The back wall has the same structure with an internal filter, the left wall curtain fan is the same, and so is the gantry sliding on a steel rod. There is no green tint to the window, suggesting a non-laser model. An A1-style extruder is not surprising, as the H2D and the A1 share a similar nozzle.

Other details are obscured or confusing: is there a poop chute? We hope so, as a cheaper H2D with only one color would be absurd. Why is the extruder window oval? Is it hiding an attachment point for a cutter and plotter? Does it have the same build width? It's hard to say, but it would make a lot of sense.

Although the H2D already has a less expensive model that ships without an AMS for $1,999, it's a far cry from the $549 P1P. Why? Because the H2D is laser capable. Even if you don't buy the laser attachment, the H2D is ready for one, with all the extra safety precautions, sensors, camera, and flame-resistant coating. A larger, less expensive 3D printer (perhaps an H1D or P1D) without any possible way to attach a laser could be just the printer the market is looking for.

Kit costs 9,999 Alienware Reward Points (ARP), which you can earn via the firm's community app.

Alienware has added a tiny NUC-sized PC to its roster and is selling it to its app users for 9,999 ARP (Alienware Reward Points). However, the new Alienware Area-51 Brick Kit is not a functioning PC; it is simply a Lego set with instructions to build a cute, blocky custom Alienware Area-51 replica.

This Alienware desktop PC replica construction set includes 318 "authentic Lego bricks." Once you finish building this desktop model, it will stand 2.2 x 5.3 x 5 inches (55 x 132 x 130mm) in size, which is just under a liter, roughly similar in size and volume to a modern NUC or NUC-a-like. Of course, this model is designed to stand on one side as a tower, just like the Alienware Area-51 Desktop that inspired it.

The brief blog post about the Area-51 PC Lego set offers a few viewing angles and a sideways glance at the packaging. We see the tower with and without its side window in place.

It is pleasing to see another PC tech-related Lego set, but this product is a little underwhelming in some ways. Part of the blame might be on the 2025 Area-51 design – this gaming desktop's latest incarnation is not as instantly recognizable as an Alienware artifact as previous models. You might recall the H. R. Giger-esque Area-51 Predator designs in the early 2000s, or the angular triple bay hexagon designs from the mid-2010s. Both those examples were unmistakable chassis shapes, even at a distance.

Another criticism is that we feel this is somewhere a little actual RGB LED lighting might have made a nice difference. The kit is built to be an ornament, after all. Or, perhaps someone could work on this kit to include RGB, and even some degree of PC functionality...

Getting your hands on an Area-51 PC Lego set isn't as straightforward as we would like. Alienware has shoved it in the ARP Marketplace, where customers spend loyalty points on Alienware merchandise like keychains, stickers, and socks. The new Lego set is by far the most expensive (and desirable) thing in the marketplace, but it took some nosing around to find out how to get these points.



You can collect this ARP currency by installing the Alienware Arena app, participating in community events, and engaging with the rest of the community. You even gain ARP drops through daily log-ins, browsing time, and quests. Other quick ways to gain ARP include connecting your Steam, Twitch, and Discord accounts and completing quests on these platforms.

How long it would take to gather 9,999 ARP is probably somewhat variable, but hopefully, people interested in Alienware and Lego might already have collections of this digital resource. Alienware says it wants a high redemption rate for this new Lego kit.

We are seeing increasing numbers of Lego and semiconductor industry crossovers. Last December, we reported on the fantastic ASML TWINSCAN EXE:5000 Lego set. This was officially described as a "masterpiece in technology" but came with a prohibitive sticker price at $228, and was an employee exclusive, sadly.

This year, we also saw Oxford Toys and SK hynix release a model allowing plastic brick construction fans to build their own Package and Test facility. SK hynix's set seemed to be on offer, advertised at under $30 equivalent in Korean currency, when it surfaced on social media. However, we aren't sure about the availability of the SK hynix Oxford Blocks set outside of Korea.

10 million IOPS per drive, but there is a slight catch.

Kioxia aims to change the storage paradigm with a proposed SSD designed to surpass 10 million input/output operations per second (IOPS) in small-block workloads, the company revealed at its Corporate Strategy Meeting earlier this week. That's three times faster than the peak speeds of many modern SSDs. The company also says it will collaborate with Nvidia in the design. 

One of the performance bottlenecks of modern AI servers is the data transfer between storage and GPUs, as data is currently transferred by the CPU, which significantly increases latencies and extends access times. 

To reach the performance target, Kioxia is designing a new controller specifically tuned to maximize IOPS — beyond 10M 512B IOPS — to enable GPUs to access data at speeds sufficient to keep their cores 100% used at all times. The proposed Kioxia 'AI SSD' is set to utilize the company's single-level cell (SLC) XL-Flash memory, which boasts read latencies in the range of 3 to 5 microseconds, significantly lower than the read latencies of 40 to 100 microseconds offered by SSDs based on conventional 3D NAND. Additionally, by storing one bit per cell, SLC offers faster access times and greater endurance, attributes that are crucial for demanding AI workloads. 

Current high-end datacenter SSDs typically achieve 2 to 3 million IOPS for both 4K and 512-byte random read operations. From a bandwidth perspective, using 4K blocks makes a lot of sense, whereas 512B blocks do not. However, large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems typically perform small, random accesses to fetch embeddings, parameters, or knowledge base entries. In these scenarios, small block sizes, such as 512B, are more representative of actual application behavior than 4K or larger blocks. Therefore, it makes more sense to use 512B blocks to meet the needs of LLMs and RAGs in terms of latencies and use multiple drives for bandwidth. Using smaller blocks could also enable more efficient use of memory semantics for access. 

It is noteworthy that Kioxia does not disclose which host interface its 'AI SSD' will use, although it does not appear to require a PCIe 6.0 interface from a bandwidth perspective.

The 'AI SSD' from Kioxia will also be optimized for peer-to-peer communications between the GPU and SSD, bypassing the CPU for extra performance and lower latency. To that end,  there is another reason why Kioxia (well, and Nvidia) plan to use 512B blocks as GPUs typically operate on cache lines of 32, 64, or 128 bytes internally and their memory subsystems are optimized for burst access to many small, independent memory locations, to keep all the stream processors busy at all times. To that end, 512-byte reads align better with GPU designs.

Kioxia's 'AI SSD' is designed to support AI training setups where large language models (LLMs) require fast, repeated access to massive datasets. Also, Kioxia envisions it being deployed in AI inference applications, particularly in systems that employ retrieval-augmented generation techniques to enhance generative AI outputs with real-time data (i.e., for reasoning). Low-latency, high-bandwidth storage access is crucial for such machines to ensure both low response times and efficient GPU utilization.

The Kioxia 'AI SSD' is scheduled for release in the second half of 2026 and will be developed in collaboration with the world's largest GPU manufacturer (read Nvidia).

Bing has added a new AI-powered video generation tool to its mobile app, that's built on OpenAI's Sora text-to-video model. That's a feature that, even now, is exclusive to ChatGPT subscribers—but Bing users will get it for free.

The vertical video creations are 5 seconds long but aren't generated instantly—once you type in a prompt, you'll get a notification when the video is ready. The Standard generation speed is free, but you'll also be able to access the “Fast” option 10 times before you'll need to cough up 100 Microsoft Reward points to keep using it at that speed. You can share these videos anywhere, and they'll be stored in the Bing app for 90 days.

The video generation wars have been heating up over the last year. Google debuted its Veo 3 model at Google I/O in May, with significant upgrades to quality. Chinese phone brand Honor also recently partnered with Google to add a feature that converted still images in the Gallery app into 5-second video clips through Google's Veo 2 model. With the ability to now generate videos at our fingertips, it'll make it easier than ever to share exactly what you're envisioning to a friend or loved one, but it'll be even harder to distinguish what's real and what's not.

London-based Nothing took a year-long break from its top-end smartphone line after it debuted the Phone (2) in 2023. In that time, it created the Phone (2a) in 2024, which went on to be one of the company's best-selling handsets. There's already a successor for those budget phones—the Phone (3a) series—but now it's time for a new flagship from the brand. The company announced this week that it will unveil the Phone (3) at an event in London on July 1 at 1 pm ET.

This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

We have a few details so far. The phone may not have the Glyph light interface on the back anymore, though it seems like Nothing has cooked up a new dot matrix light pattern instead. The company says it'll be its first true flagship phone with premium materials, and it'll have a high price to boot: somewhere around £800.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

But the spotlight won't just be on a new phone. This week, Nothing also shared that it will be entering “a new product category" at the event with its first-ever pair of headphones. Creatively dubbed Headphone (1), it'll be Nothing's first over-ears, but follows a long line of wireless earbuds. Not too long ago, Nothing announced a partnership with iconic audio brand KEF. Perhaps these headphones will be the pair's first collab.

Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event is also expected to take place in July, and rumors abound that we'll see the Galaxy Z Fold7, Galaxy Z Flip7, and even a Flip 7 FE—a cheaper version of the company's flip folding phone. But Samsung took time to tease something else: an Ultra variant of its folding phone. Or so we think.

In a blog post on Samsung Newsroom, the company vaguely talks about a folding device that can match the capabilities of its existing Ultra phones, like the Galaxy S25 Ultra. What remains unclear is if the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold7 will offer an Ultra-like experience with no compromises, or if there will indeed be a dedicated Ultra version of that phone. Until now, there have been trade-offs between the Fold phones and Samsung's Galaxy Ultra phones, with the latter offering a nicer camera experience, better battery life, and other perks like the stylus. Perhaps Samsung has found a way to replicate the true Ultra experience on its next generation of the Fold.

The company has a teaser video showing the silhouette of the Fold opening and closing. There have been rumors that Samsung is working on a tri-fold phone, like Huawei's version that nets you an even bigger screen when unfolded; you'd think if anything got the Ultra moniker, it'd be that device. We'll have to wait and see.

The Ruark MR1 have been some of the best sounding, most stylish desktop stereo speakers you can buy at their price for over a decade. Now in their third generation, they have been rebuilt from the ground up, with the aim of improving sound quality, refining the hand-crafted design and adding in some great new features to make them even more versatile than before. This includes adding aptX HD playback for higher quality Bluetooth sound, a USB audio connection for easy high-resolution playback and a moving magnet phono stage for powering a turntable. The petite package is available now, and costs $579/£399. —Verity Burns

Adobe has finally released Photoshop for Android. No, this isn't Photoshop Express or Photoshop Touch—previous, largely failed attempts at bringing Photoshop to mobile. Photoshop for Android mirrors the version of Photoshop for iPhone released earlier this year. You can download the public beta for Android today.

The mobile app has nearly everything you'll find in Adobe's desktop version, including layer-based editing and tools like masks, clone stamp, intelligent selection options, and all the tone and curve adjustment tools. The user interface is radically different, but Photoshop veterans will likely get the hang of the mobile version quickly.

I've been testing the Android app for a couple of days now, and it's fairly impressive, but a few things are missing. The biggest for me is the ability to crop by pixels rather than ratio, which seems like a very odd limitation. Content-aware fill is also still "coming soon." Adobe has been heavily touting the AI features, which make it possible to do smart selections that would be difficult otherwise. I've found this feature works like on desktop (it relies on the same cloud backend), but I still don't have much use for it. —Scott Gilbertson

"Throw your laptop out the damn window and drag that 1994 Kawasaki 750SX stand-up jet ski out of Uncle Pete's garage, because summer is officially here." This is how Poolsuite, possibly the finest curated music app for outdoor frivolity, announces the arrival this week not only of a throughly revamped and upgraded version of its already superb iOS media player, but also that it's finally available on Android as well.

This perfectly judged throwback tone pervades throughout the app, which now adds hundreds of new tracks across seven channels, as well as mobile mixtapes to go with the aesthetic overhaul. Sun-drenched playlists lovingly curated to lift spirits and deliver virtual vitamin D for free. If you haven't downloaded it already, do so right now—and never worry about what tunes to play at a BBQ ever again. —Jeremy White

Continuing the summer theme in style is this new limited edition beach-ready Big Bang from Hublot. “As light as a sea breeze with its featherlight ceramic,” says the brand, with a micro blasted “orange case that glows like the golden hour.” Well, I tried it on at Watches & Wonders in April, and unlike some other darker hued versions of this watch, it's playful and thoroughly approachable, yet with 100 meters of water resistance is equally at home either at a pool party or in deep waters. A one-click system also allows the included three interchangeable white rubber-lined straps in sky blue, dark blue or orange to be swapped in a jiffy, and the 72-hour power reserve keeps things going when off the wrist. The price? $31,300 (£26,900) but only 100 will be released. —Jeremy White

Indian grocery delivery startup KiranaPro's recent data loss story has more holes than Swiss cheese, as the startup remains unclear whether the incident was an internal breach or an external hack.

Last week, the Bengaluru-based startup discovered that it could not access its back-end servers and that all its data, including its app code, had been deleted from GitHub. The startup on Friday blamed a former employee for the breach. However, in an interview, KiranaPro co-founder and CEO Deepak Ravindran conceded that the company had not deactivated the employee's account after they departed the company and cannot rule out the possibility of subsequent malicious misuse of their account.

“If we go deeper, we have to do a real forensic investigation. We are going to talk [about] this with our board, the investors, and we are going to get a formal opinion on that also with our legal advisers,” Ravindran told TechCrunch.

Earlier on Friday, Ravindran claimed in a post on X that the incident that affected its data was an internal breach.

“After careful investigation, we conclude that this was not a hack. No external party penetrated our ordering or payment systems, exploited vulnerabilities, or bypassed security protocols,” he wrote.

The co-founder also explicitly shared a screenshot of a LinkedIn profile of one of KiranaPro's former employees on X on Thursday, alleging that they had deleted the startup's code. (TechCrunch is not sharing the post's link, as the startup has yet to offer concrete proof supporting its position.)

“[T]his was an internal data breach. Specifically, it was the result of actions taken by a trusted internal employee who had legitimate access to our systems,” the co-founder wrote in his post on Friday. “This individual intentionally deleted critical server logs while they were being tested and/or edited, an action that goes directly against our policies, our principles, and the trust we place in our team.”

When TechCrunch asked if KiranaPro could rule out whether any third party had maliciously gained access to the former employee's account, Ravindran could not.

“We have to do a complete forensic check on the company. We have to do the entire IP scan. We have to look at where the tracks happened. We have to check the computers, MacBooks, and whatever is used. Everything has to be done. Then we have to spend money … so, that's why we decided not to,” he told TechCrunch.

Then what was the basis of Ravindran's allegation? It was a GitHub response, a copy of which he shared with TechCrunch.

The response included a username, which Ravindran said was associated with the former employee.

“All we have is the emails that we got from GitHub, stating that [the former employee's username] as an individual is the one who deleted the account. We haven't done the investigation further,” Ravindran told TechCrunch. 

Launched in late 2024, KiranaPro operates as a buyer app on the Indian government's Open Network for Digital Commerce. The startup allows more than 55,000 customers in 50 cities to purchase groceries from their local shops and nearby supermarkets using its voice-based interface. The company also supports local language inputs, including English, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil.

Ravindran stated that they decided to call out the former employee based on the company's “belief system,” as they claim the former employee deleted the data after their sudden termination.

However, the startup said it is not aware if there were enough protections on the former employee's devices, such as multi-factor authentication, to restrict malicious third-party access, like malware. 

The company confirmed it did not remove the employee's access to its data and GitHub account following his departure.

“Employee offboarding was not being handled properly because there was no full-time HR,” KiranaPro's chief technology officer, Saurav Kumar, confirmed to TechCrunch.

Alongside its code saved in GitHub, KiranaPro  also lost access to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, which included its customer data and their transaction details.

Ravindran told TechCrunch that the GitHub data was restored after getting its backup from one of their employees. The startup also regained access to its AWS account along with its customer data.

Both the co-founder and CTO said the AWS account was protected by multi-factor authentication, but neither could say how the account was accessed, as nobody else had physical access to Ravindran's phone, which generates the multi-factor code.

Nonetheless, Ravindran claimed that the customer data stored in the AWS cloud remained intact and was not accessed by any third parties, nor was it downloaded by the former employee in question.

“Because if that is the case, I will get its notification on email or anything [sic],” he said.

That said, Ravindran stated that the startup has enough evidence to file a formal complaint with the police, but said that its investigation is ongoing.

The startup has also not fully paid its current employees, the company's co-founder confirmed, soon after the company raised a seed round of ₹100 million Indian rupees (about $1.2 million), which Ravindran said has yet to be fully wired.

The startup counts Blume Ventures, Unpopular Ventures, and Turbostart among its institutional venture backers, as well as Olympic medalist PV Sindhu and Boston Consulting Group managing director Vikas Taneja among its angel investors. It has 15 employees located in Bengaluru and Kerala.

Fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) have been touted as a potential treatment for a variety of conditions, from inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, and type 2 diabetes to autism. New research from the University of Chicago, however, cautions against widespread use of FMT because of the potential for long-lasting, unintended health consequences for recipients.

FMT involves transferring microbes in the stool from a healthy person to a sick one, in hopes of restoring a healthy equilibrium in the gut microbiome. Since stools contain primarily anaerobic microbes from the colon (i.e. they can't tolerate oxygen), FMT can cause mismatches in the gut ecosystem when those bacteria colonize the small intestine and other parts of the digestive system.

In experiments with mice and studies with human tissue samples, the researchers conducting the new study saw that anaerobic microbes from the colon not only colonized the small bowel after a single transplant but also persisted there for months. These microbes also changed their new intestinal environments to their advantage, "terraforming" them in ways that caused changes in the recipient's metabolism, behavior, and energy balance.

"I think it's a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn't willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn't be there," said Orlando (Landon) DeLeon, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at UChicago and lead author of the new study, which was published in Cell. "If we're designing good therapeutics, we should be aware of the importance of matching the regional microbiota to their proper environments, so that we provide better overall health benefits."

FMT is approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for treating repeated infections with Clostridium difficile (C. diff), an opportunistic bacterium that often causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation in hospital patients who have been on antibiotics. Seeing the success in treating C. diff patients, many physicians have been eager to use FMT to treat other digestive conditions. Researchers understand that gut microbiome health can impact all vital organs and systems of the body, so the idea is that replacing a "sick" gut microbiome with a "healthy" one could fix the problem in one fell swoop.

The gut isn't simply one consistent environment with the same microbiota throughout, however; instead, it has several distinct regions that are vastly different microbial ecosystems, each tailored for specific microbes that can provide functions vital to the health of their host.

There are microbes along the entire intestinal tract, and we just study predominately the last third of it (the colon). So, how can you expect an FMT, with microbes from a third of the intestinal tract at the end of it, to fix the rest of the intestine?"

Orlando (Landon) DeLeon, PhD, postdoctoral researcher at UChicago and lead author of the new study

To test the effects of FMT on different parts of the intestine, DeLeon, Eugene B. Chang, MD, the Martin Boyer Professor of Medicine at UChicago and senior author of the study, and their team carried out a series of experiments with mice. One group of mice was given a transplant of microbes taken from the jejunum, the first portion of the small intestine. A second group was given a standard FMT, and a third group was given a transplant from the cecum, a section connecting the small and large intestine, which has a mixture of microbes from both.

Recipients of FMT are usually treated with antibiotics first to clear out the microbes living in the gut, leaving a clean slate for newly transplanted microbes to take up residence – sometimes, however, in the wrong places. Testing showed that microbes from each of these transplants successfully colonized the entirety of the intestinal tract in the mice, not just their native niches. This created regional gut mismatches persisting up to three months after just one transplant.

The altered microbiomes also changed the production of metabolites in each intestinal region, which can have health effects on the host. The researchers saw changes in liver metabolism, including activity in genes associated with immune function. They also observed differences in eating behaviors, activity, and energy expenditure in the mice after transplants.

The most striking finding was that having the wrong microbes in the wrong place reshaped the tissue identity to make it more suitable for them. DeLeon saw that mismatches changed gene and protein expression in the intestinal lining in ways that more closely resembled expression levels from the microbes' original or native intestinal regions.

"It's like they're engineering or terraforming their environments to help them fit in," DeLeon said.

Chang said that this research highlights the need for more caution with FMT before we fully understand the long-term effects of introducing one set of microbes into a new environment.

"We have absolutely no idea what's in FMT, except that it's a combination of microbes," Chang said. "But even a single FMT will cause a change in the host-microbe relationships in these very different regions of the bowel that may be very difficult to reverse."

Both DeLeon and Chang advocate for "omni-microbial transplants," or OMT, instead. This approach would transfer microbes taken from all the different regions of the intestine, not just those largely from the colon. Whether given via an endoscopy or in pill form, microbes naturally settle in the right places, especially when they are competing side by side with others that normally inhabit a certain region.

"If there's an open space, something's going to fill it," DeLeon said. "But the microbes that were supposed to be there are better suited for it, so they're more naturally going to fill it even in the presence of other microbes."

DeLeon plans to keep studying how different microbes exert their influence in different parts of the intestine, using different approaches like single cell sequencing and metabolomics to track their activity. He is also exploring how the gut regions terraformed by microbiota mismatches can be restored to their original state, which could help restore normal gut function. Such deeper understanding could lead to improvements in the application of microbial transplants, ultimately helping them live up to their significant promise.

The study, "Regional microbiota mismatches from fecal microbiota transplants promote persistent, off-target consequences to the host," was supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the UChicago GI Research Foundation.

The U.S. men's national soccer team finally takes to the pitch again on Saturday when it hosts a tough Turkey team in what should be a great test for manager Mauricio Pochettino's men.

Things haven't gotten off to quite as glorious a start as some expected in the Pochettino era, as the team's new caretaker is just 5-0-3 thus far in his Team USA career as the manager.

The U.S. has lost its last two matches heading into this game against Turkey, falling 1-0 against Panama in the CONCACAF Nations League semifinal before then again losing, this time to rival Canada, 2-1, in the third-place game, despite a 35th-minute goal by Patrick Agyemang. Needless to say, with the 2026 World Cup not all that far away, the U.S. will need to start shifting its momentum.

Making matters more complicated for the U.S. is the fact that the national team is currently riddled with injuries. Some of the notable names set to miss this next batch of friendlies for the team are some of the team's best players: Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, and Folarin Balogun.

This could not come at a worse time for Pochettino, as the national team desperately needs to find its footing after a rough recent stretch, with the 2026 World Cup, which it hosts, coming next summer. Will the U.S. be able to turn things around, starting with Turkey on Saturday?

Updated 27m ago

A second-half Harry Kane goal saved a desperately disappointing England's blushes against a stubborn Andorra side.

The 1-0 victory preserved England's perfect start to World Cup qualifying as Thomas Tuchel became the first manager in the nation's history to win his first three games in charge without conceding a goal.

But England were dull and lethargic against Andorra, who are ranked 173rd in the world by FIFA, and they were jeered off at the half-time break.

England are next in action against Senegal in Nottingham on Tuesday.

Andorra 0 England 1 – Tuchel's men largely underwhelming, might they regret narrow win?

England endured a largely frustrating evening in Barcelona, as they scraped a 1-0 World Cup qualifying win against Andorra.

Thomas Tuchel's team would have expected to rack up a more convincing score line against a team ranked 173rd in the world, but ended up with just Harry Kane's second-half goal to show for their efforts.

The result leaves England top of their qualifying group but improved performances will surely be required later in the campaign.

The Athletic's Dan Sheldon and Rob Tanner assess the key talking points…

Andorra 0 England 1 – Tuchel's men largely underwhelming, might they regret narrow win?

Thomas Tuchel has just been interviewed by ITV and could not hide his disappointment with his side's laboured performance.

💬 “We're not happy with the performance, of course. We started quite well in the first 20 or 25 minutes, but that was the only time it felt like it was only a matter of time.

“We created a lot of chances, half-chances and set pieces, and it felt like we were going to score and keep on going. But we completely lost our momentum and couldn't get it back for the whole of the first half. 

“We got a little bit in the first 15 minutes of the second, but then ended up in a period which was by far not good enough. There was a lack of urgency, quality and energy.”

A slightly sheepish Harry Kane has just been interviewed by ITV.

💬 “It's one of those. For sure, we can play better. It wasn't our greatest performance, not a lot of people will remember it but we can learn from it.

“It's very hot, a dry pitch, very similar conditions to the World Cup next year. So we'll go away and analyse, we had good spells in the game but we couldn't consistently have attack after attack. We take the points and move on.”

A game that will almost certainly be forgotten about come tomorrow morning is over.

England, courtesy of Harry Kane, won by a single goal, but their performance was nothing to shout home about. England's fans booed them off at half time and there were a smattering at full time, too, such was the display.

Tuchel knows there is plenty of room for improvement, and there is enough time before next year's World Cup to iron out any problems, but there is a lot of work to be done if England are going to be genuine contenders to win next year's World Cup.

England win. Now let's never speak of this again. 

90+3' Andorra 0-1 England

That sums it up! England break forward at the death but Gordon pokes Gibbs-White's cross wide. Madueke prevents the ball from going out and the goal is at his mercy but he slots it straight at Alvarez.

90+1' Andorra 0-1 England

Morgan Gibbs-White is coming on, for some reason. He replaces Jude Bellingham with two minutes remaining. 

90' Andorra 0-1 England

There will be three minutes of additional time. 

89' Andorra 0-1 England

Noni Madueke goes down in the box after contact with Oliviera but the referee isn't interested. 

Garcia then breaks down the left for Andorra and crosses into the box but England clear.

88' Andorra 0-1 England

It's now 15 minutes since England last had a shot on target.

Thomas Tuchel is about to become the first England manager to win his first three games in charge without conceding … but this has been a dreadfully dreary performance.

81' Andorra 0-1 England

Alexander-Arnold does indeed seize the ball but Reece James ends up taking the set-piece.

He should have left it to Alexander-Arnold. The Chelsea captain wafts the ball harmlessly over the bar. That's an atrocious effort.

Morgan Rogers is hacked down on the edge of the box and Alexander-Arnold's eyes light up.

More changes for England. Declan Rice and Anthony Gordon are introduced, with Curtis Jones and Rogers making way. 

Tuchel's heart must have been in his mouth as Guillaume Lopez, an Andorran substitute, marauded into Jordan Pickford's penalty area. His shot was eventually blocked, but it will serve as a reminder, no matter how little attacking Andorra are doing, that England only have a one goal lead going into the final 10 minutes.

77' Andorra 0-1 England

That almost got interesting. Vales, who has only just come on, completely outfoxes Burn with a smart backhell into space. Lopez collects the ball and slaloms forward and, for a moment, it looks as though he's clean through. But Konsa catches up and does well to block his shot before it troubles Pickford. 

74' Andorra 0-1 England

Brilliant save from Alvarez!

Jude Bellingham does ever so well in the penalty box, flicking the ball into a pocket of space and then chipping it across the face of goal. Eze gets up well above Borra and nods the ball towards goal, but Alvarez reads it well and does fantastically to tip it over the bar.

The corner comes to nothing. Alvarez is man of the match as it stands! 

72' Andorra 0-1 England

Another good pass from Curtis Jones releases Harry Kane into space down the right. The angle is too tight for England's captain to shoot, so he cuts the ball back across the face of goal. Jude Bellingham hares forward to get involved but Kane's pass is too far behind him and, once again, Andorra scramble it away to safety.

69' Andorra 0-1 England

Trent Alexander-Arnold has been lively since coming on a few moments ago. He takes a corner on the right-hand side and it's a good delivery, although Borra heads it away.

The ball falls to Eze on the edge of the area who volleys it downward, into the turf. It's a good idea but he cuts across it too much and the ball bounces wide of Alvarez's right post. 

65' Andorra 0-1 England

Trent Alexander-Arnold replaces Jordan Henderson. Cole Palmer comes off for Eberechi Eze. 

England shuffle things around. Alexander-Arnold goes to right-back. Jones shifts into midfield. And Madueke switches flanks to allow Eze space on the left. 

63' Andorra 0-1 England

Thomas Tuchel is about to shuffle his pack. Eberechi Eze and Trent Alexander-Arnold are getting ready.

Chelsea looking to strengthen in the winger position following the decision not to take up the option to sign Jadon Sancho permanently; club want player signed ahead of Club World Club

Chelsea have made an offer to sign Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund, with the player keen on the move. 

The club are hoping to sign him before Tuesday's deadline as they want him to play in the Club World Cup.

Dortmund are also taking part in the competition.

The west London club are looking to strengthen in the winger position following the decision not to take up the option to sign Jadon Sancho permanently.

The 20-year-old winger was a target in January and has remained high on a list of eight or nine attacking names Chelsea are working on this summer.

Gittens is valued at £50m but lost his place in Dorrmund's starting XI towards the end of the season.

Chelsea may also sign another striker after already completing deal for Liam Delap with Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko on their shortlist.

But goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga looks set to leave Stamford Bridge.

Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign him and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause in his contract.

Sky Sports' Adam Bate:

When it comes to honing young English talent, Dortmund know how to do that better than most clubs in the Premier League. But Gittens' story is different to those of Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham who came before him before moving on for big money.

Bellingham arrived having had a season in the Championship with Birmingham City. Sancho ranked alongside Phil Foden as one of the jewels in the Manchester City academy. Gittens, signed at the age of just 16, did not come with quite the same guarantees.

A prospect at Reading, he had spent only two years at City, but was not close to the first team when Dortmund made their move.

"We do not want to find 30 players like other teams in England do it. We want to find the one player who can reach our first team," said Dortmund CEO Lars Ricken.

"When we signed him, he was not on Sancho's level but we said, we can develop him to the level of a great player. It was a good cooperation between our scouting department, professional department and youth department."

Group G qualifying continues on Saturday in the battle for the UEFA spots in the 2026 World Cup. In this game, Finland takes on the Netherlands.

Finland sits second in the group right now with four points, two back of leader Poland. The Netherlands is set to play its first game of the group play, as the team was in the Nations League during the first window of games.

Finland opened play against Malta, winning 1-0, but the team was unable to follow that up with a victory, squandering an early 2-0 lead against Lithuania and drawing with the team.

The Finnish team is trying to shake off a poor end to 2024, having lost its final six matches last year. It's yet to lose in 2025, but has played just two games.

The Netherlands has played two UEFA Nations League matches in 2025, drawing in both legs of the quarterfinals against Spain but losing on penalty kicks. Overall, the nation has won three consecutive draws, with its last victory coming in November against Hungary.

The Netherlands has advanced to the World Cup knockout stage in four of the last five tournaments, including a runner-up finish in 2010. However, sandwiched between them was a 2018 World Cup that the team failed to qualify for.

World Cup

live

Updated 26s ago

England face Andorra in Barcelona today as Thomas Tuchel's side look to maintain their perfect start to World Cup qualifying.

England: Pickford, Jones, Konsa, Burn, James, Bellingham, J Henderson (Alexander-Arnold 64'), Madueke, Palmer (Eze 64'), Rogers, Kane. 

Andorra: Alvarez, Borra (Chus Rubio 75'), Llovera, Marc Garcia, Olivera, San Nicolas, Rodrigo Tapia (Garcia 64'), Babot (Vales 75'), Guillen, Cervos, Ricard Fernandez (Lopez 64'). 

77' Andorra 0-1 England

That almost got interesting. Vales, who has only just come on, completely outfoxes Burn with a smart backhell into space. Lopez collects the ball and slaloms forward and, for a moment, it looks as though he's clean through. But Konsa catches up and does well to block his shot before it troubles Pickford.

60' Andorra 0-1 England

England might have their noses in front but there's a lot of frustration out there on the pitch.

Madueke shakes his head at Palmer for delaying a pass to him while Pickford is annoyed at something in England's goal, waving his arms frantically and shouting in the direction of his defence.

Andorra have kept the exact same shape after conceding that opening goal. 

That was Harry Kane's 450th career goal for club and country, in his 697th game.

He has scored 5 of those goals for Leyton Orient, 9 for Millwall, 2 for Leicester City, 280 for Tottenham Hotspur, 82 for Bayern Munich and 72 for England.  

Some breaking news from David Ornstein: Chelsea have submitted an official proposal to sign Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund and have agreed a seven-year contract with the forward.

The 20-year-old is keen on a move and only wants to join Chelsea, who hold a long-standing interest in the England Under-21 international.

51' Andorra 0-1 England

Who else? England's skipper gets his 72nd international goal.

It's a touch unfortunate for Andorra's goalkeeper Alvarez, who has been having a good game. Jones plays a wonderful slide-rule pass from the right which Kane runs onto, but the goalkeeper gets behind it, parrying the ball away.

It falls to Madueke on the left who shapes as if to shoot, but instead pulls it back for Kane. The ball skips past the despairing Alvarez for Kane to smash into the roof of the net from just inside the six-yard box. 

50' Andorra 0-1 England

Finally! Harry Kane gets England off the mark.

46' Andorra 0-0 England

Chance for Andorra! Jones plays a sloppy ball to Konsa and Ricard Fernandez pounces, stealing possession and shooting from the edge of the box.

He slashes his shot well wide but that should ring alarm bells for Tuchel, who is yet to make a change. 

We're back underway in Barcelona. Buckle up, ladies and gentlemen.

John P: “Same old England. So much aimless passing and zero incision. Time for Eze and Alexander-Arnold.”

Greg P: “How can Tuchel spend the whole week talking about England playing with pace and then send them out there like that? Either the players aren't listening or they can't be bothered at the end of a long season.”

Myles H: “The formula for an England World Cup qualifier: boring first half. Absolute headloss online. Harry Kane to score twice in the second half. Lots of grumbling at FT. Then we all move on and forget this ever happened.” 

Remember: you can get involved by emailing live@theathletic.com.

An uninspiring first half performance from England — and they are booed off the pitch by their supporters for good measure. There was little intensity to their build-up play, they were sloppy on the ball and failed to properly test an Andorra team that were more than happy to sit deep and let England have the majority of the ball. There was half a chance for Harry Kane to open the scoring in the 19th minute, but little else beyond that. Significant improvements needed in the second half if England are going to — and they should — get on the scoresheet.

HT: Andorra 0-0 England

England end the half with a good opportunity, but Bellingham nods Madueke's cross straight at Alvarez.

And that's that. England are booed off. 

43' Andorra 0-0 England

Jude Bellingham is dropping deeper and deeper in an attempt to get something going for England. This is pretty turgid stuff.

He collects the ball just inside Andorra's half and lofts a ball over the top of their defence, inviting Cole Palmer to run forward. It's a neat idea, but Alvarez gets to the ball first.

The 23rd edition of the most televised sporting event in the world is already in the making.

Tickets for the FIFA Men's World Cup will soon be up for grabs, and the classification matches involving the host nations - Mexico, Canada, and the United States - have already been assigned dates and venues.

Here's what FIFA, the event's governing body, has announced so far:

The World Cup is in 2026. The global tournament is set to run from June 11 through July 19.

Mexico's team will play in the inaugural match, set to be held in Mexico City. The opposing team has yet to be announced.

Team USA is scheduled to debut on Friday, June 12, in Los Angeles at SoFi Stadium. After that, the U.S. team will play on Friday, June 19, at Seattle's Lumen Field, and then return to Los Angeles for a match on June 25.

Additional match dates for Team USA will be announced as the tournament progresses, depending on their performance in the group stage and whether they advance to the knockout rounds.

The World Cup final is slated to take place at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. The venue sits in the borough of East Rutherford, 8 miles west of Manhattan.

Here's a recent U.S. soccer story from the Associated Press:

NEW YORK (AP) — Christian Pulisic is among a slew of regular starters who will be missing when the United States plays in next month's CONCACAF Gold Cup, another blow for a team coming off dismal performances at the Copa America and CONCACAF Nations League.

Given the absences, coach Mauricio Pochettino wants players who will convince worried fans a turnaround is ahead.

“It's our responsibility to send some signal to them,” he said Thursday during a Zoom news conference after announcing his 27-man roster. “I think our fans need to see our team fighting and playing and performing and playing well, yes, but fighting for the flag and being always in every single game (to) match the aggressivity of the opponent.”

Pulisic, the top American player, asked to be left off the roster for the last competitive matches before the 2026 World Cup in order to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons.

Yunus Musah also asked out, Antonee Robinson was dropped because he has been playing with an injury, and Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna were blocked because FIFA gave the expanded Club World Cup priority over national teams.

Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Tanner Tessmann were omitted in what Pochettino called “football decisions.”

U.S. Soccer Federation sporting director Matt Crocker said Pulisic and his advisers asked for the possibility to be left off because of the amount of games he has played in the last two years.

“Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup,” Pochettino said. “We decided the best for him, the best of the team, the best for the national team is the decision that we made.”

Pochettino replaced Gregg Berhalter after the team's first-round elimination at the Copa America last summer. After the Gold Cup, he will have just four brief training windows on FIFA international dates before players report ahead of the World Cup.

In the team's first significant test under Pochettino, the Americans lost to Panama and Canada in the Nations League in March. Without saying players had been complacent, Pochettino said “we learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March, and it's about to be — maybe use a different way to approach these opportunities.”

Sixteen of the players picked are from Major League Soccer, the most in a FIFA window since the U.S. sent a B team to the 2023 Gold Cup.

“If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?” Pochettino asked out loud. “No, no, no, no, no. What we want do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused and spend all my focus and energy in the national team. ... If we want be good in one year time, we need to think that today is the most important day.”

Outside back Sergiño Dest returns to the national team for the first time since March 2024 after recovering from a torn ACL. Forward Folarin Balogun is with the team for the first time since last September following his recuperation from shoulder surgery.

Pochettino's roster included Alex Freeman, a son of former NFL All-Pro receiver Antonio Freeman. The 20-year-old right back made his Major League Soccer debut for Orlando in April 2023 — his only league match that season. He had two MLS appearances last year and has become a regular this season.

Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, a 24-year-old son of the former coach, also was picked for the first time along with 20-year-old forward Damion Downs and 21-year-old defender Quinn Sullivan.

Downs has played on youth teams of Germany and the U.S., and helped Cologne gain promotion to the Bundesliga for 2025-26 after a one-season absence.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese, who has attended national team camp previously but not played in a game, also was selected.

Players will start reporting June 1 for training in Chicago, and the 26-man Gold Cup roster is due June 4. The U.S. plays Turkey on June 7 at East Hartford, Connecticut, and Switzerland three days later at Nashville, Tennessee, then meets Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti in the first round of the Gold Cup.

The roster:

Goalkeepers: Matt Freese (New York City), Patrick Schulte (Columbus), Zack Steffen (Colorado), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace)

Defenders: Max Arfsten (Columbus), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando), DeJuan Jones (San Jose), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse), Tim Ream (Charlotte), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati)

Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson (Leeds), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis), Luca de la Torre (San Diego), Diego Luna (Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia), Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus)

Forwards: Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte), Folarin Balogun (Monaco). Damion Downs (Cologne), Brian White (Vancouver), Haji Wright (Coventry)

Names will be made this summer in United States men's national team action, which starts when Mauricio Pochettino's team meets up with European powers Turkiye in East Hartford on Saturday.

The international friendly pits the Yanks against a top-25 team for the first of two UEFA friendlies, with Switzerland coming soon, and good performances will show Pochettino a player's potential against similar opposition in the 2026 World Cup.

MORE — How will USMNT line up versus Turkiye?

The nerves will be plenty for the USMNT players, who have chances to be center stage while Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Timothy Weah, Antonee Robinson, and others are absent from the fold.

But there are still a lot of regulars here, as Tyler Adams and Johnny Cardoso keep things steady and vicious in the midfield and Chris Richards gets more time as one of the leaders at the back.

Richards returns to the team with an FA Cup on his resume, and Crystal Palace teammate Matt Turner is likely to also start for the USMNT.



Kickoff: Saturday, June 7, 3:30pm ET

Who is going to seize the opportunities presented in the front four positions in the team?

Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Damion Downs, and Brian White all have claims of form and will feel they can claim the center forward spot with Folarin Balogun leaving camp through injury.

Malik Tillman can show so much without Reyna, Weah, and Pulisic, and has to be thrilled at the prospect of orchestrating the attack in front of steady midfielders.

The wings are very intriguing, as we'll learn how highly Pochettino already rates Diego Luna, and there are a bunch of talented options who could claim starting spots.

The Crescent Stars essentially cruised through Nations League B, winning promotion with a decisive two-legged triumph over Hungary.

Former AC Milan and Sevilla boss Vincenzo Montella is missing some familiar names for this match as Bournemouth's Enes Unal, Brighton's Ferdi Kadioglu, and Hoffenheim's Ozan Kabak are out through injury and Cenk Tosun was not called into the team.

This is a squad based largely in Turkiye's top flight, but Real Madrid starlet Arda Guler and Juventus young star Kenan Yildiz — both 20 years old — are in the fold.

Dortmund midfielder Salih Ozcan and Inter Milan hero Hakan Calhanoglu, the side's captain, lead the way in the midfield. Man United backstop Altay Bayindir and Trabzonspor keeper Ugurcan Cakir are the keepers with experience.

This is a solid team with lots of experience. Many will know the names Merih Demiral, Caglar Soyuncu, Mert Muldur, Okay Yokuslu, and Orkun Kokcu. It's a huge test for this USMNT.

Anything can happen in these friendlies once teams start making loads of subs in the second half, so it's almost more worthwhile to predict the score after 55 minutes or so. Either way, we'll venture chances in this one. We also expect a gritty midfield battle that sees both sides finding the ball on the perimeter. The hosts will be slight favorites to win here, but we'll take that down a notch. USMNT 1-1 Turkiye.

The Club World Cup will feature five new rule changes as well as a brand new format when it begins next week.

The new tournament kicks off in the United States on Sunday June 15, with Al Ahly taking on Inter Miami in the tournament's opening match.

In total, 32 teams will take part from all over the globe, including Manchester City and Chelsea from England as well as the likes of Real Madrid, Juventus and Bayern Munich.

Previous iterations of the competition have included just seven teams, with Manchester City winning the last tournament in 2023.

But this year's competition has an enormous prize fund of £777m ($1bn), to be split among the teams.

The Club World Cup has typically been viewed as a minor affair for European clubs and fans, but FIFA wants it to be 'the football event of the year'.

As well as the new format, the competition is also going to feature a host of 'trailblazing' rule changes, which FIFA claim will 'improve football.

The most significant innovation is that referees will wear body cameras, allowing fans to see closer into their decision making process.

The footage will used during live match broadcasts on DAZN, who agreed a $1billion (£787m) deal with FIFA for rights to the tournament. 

 The new camera angle will be trialled to see if it can improve the viewing experience for fans at home, while FIFA will use the experiment to create guidelines for its possible use in other competitions.

Fans at the game will finally be able to watch footage from the VAR monitor inside the stadium, and it will be displayed live on giant screens to 'enhance transparency'. 

Advanced semi-automated offside technology will also be used as referees seek to make quicker decisions throughout the match. 

The Club World Cup will also see an increased use of artificial intelligence-driven data, while substitution tablets will be used and will replace the traditional manual process

Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee, said that the referees taking part in the tournament will be 'making history'.

The new Club World Cup format has received criticism from players and FIFA is currently facing legal action surrounding the tournament's scheduling.

Players' union Fifpro says the footballing calendar is too busy and 'risks player safety and wellbeing'.

Manuel Akanji, currently in the US on Switzerland duty for their upcoming pair of friendlies, has candidly spoken out against the fixture congestion. 

The Manchester City defender said: 'I have been a strong critic of this competition for some time now. We players would love to have some holidays, and some time for our bodies to rest.' 

My City teammates are not exactly overjoyed about the tournament either. But it's now right in our faces, and there is nothing we can do about it.

'If we take part, then of course we want to win it. But if we reach the final, then the time period for us to recover ahead of the new season will become even shorter.'

Qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup continue this weekend with a number of UEFA games, including this one on Saturday between Andorra and England.

England currently leads Group K, putting it in position to qualify directly to the World Cup, though there's a lot of time still left to go. Andorra has lost both of its games so far.

In the first matchday of this group, Andorra lost 1-0 to Latvia while England won 2-0 against Albania. In the next game, Andorra was shut out again, falling 3-0 to Albania while England rolled to a 3-0 win over Latvia.

England is looking to make the World Cup once again. The team has qualified for the last seven World Cups, but it last missed in 1994 when the tournament was held in the United States.

The English side has won its last five matches overall, including four consecutive shut-out victories.

As for Andorra, a World Cup trip feels incredibly unlikely, but weirder things have happened. The team sits just 173rd in the FIFA rankings and consistently struggles to win games, especially against strong competition like England, which has won all six previous matchups between these teams, both by shutout and multiple goals.

Tune in on Saturday for this UEFA region FIFA World Cup qualifying matchup, available to stream live on Fubo.

Portugal forward has ‘practically decided' not to take part

Mbappé: PSG Champions League win ‘doesn't affect me'

Cristiano Ronaldo has said he does not plan to play at the Club World Cup in the United States, despite being courted by clubs participating in the 32-team tournament. Speculation over the Portugal forward's future intensified last month when the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, said discussions were under way about Ronaldo playing despite his club side, Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr, failing to qualify.

Asked about the possibility of signing for another club in order to play Ronaldo said: “It's irrelevant, at the moment it doesn't make sense to talk about things other than the national team.

“There has been plenty of contact [from clubs], I see things that make sense, others that don't. You can't go to all of them, you have to think short, medium and long term. It's something that's practically decided on my part, which is not to go to the Club World Cup, but I've had plenty of invitations.”

Al-Nassr's sporting director, Fernando Hierro, said last month they were negotiating with Ronaldo over a contract extension but faced competition from clubs eager to sign the five-times Ballon d'Or winner. Ronaldo added to the uncertainty, posting on social media: “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written.”

The 40-year-old scored the winner as Portugal beat Germany 2-1 in the semi-final at Munich's Allianz Arena – also the venue for the final against Spain on Sunday. The Portugal captain played down suggestions that it is a face-off between himself and the 17-year-old Barcelona sensation, Lamine Yamal. “It's always been like that, whenever I've played football, whenever I've played a big game it's always been Cristiano against this one, against that one,” he said.

“It's been twentysomething years and it's still the same. It doesn't keep me up at night any more, it's a normal thing. “[We] are completely different generations, a generation that's starting out, another that's finishing, which is my case. In reality it's not like that, it's a team against a team. It will always be like that.

“What I want most is for Portugal to be at a good level, confident that things can go well, that we can play a great game and win against a very good team, possibly the best in the world.”

Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappé has insisted he was happy to see his former club, Paris Saint-Germain, win the Champions League for the first time after his departure last summer. PSG thrashed Inter 5-0 in Munich last week to lift the trophy, 12 months after Mbappé left on a free transfer in acrimonious circumstances. The France forward moved to the Real Madrid, who were knocked out of this year's tournament by Arsenal in the quarter-finals.

“I was happy, they deserved it,” Mbappé said. “They've been through so many problems, I've been through that too. I've been through every stage of the Champions League except winning it,. They were the best team in Europe.

“I can't remember ever seeing them go 5-0 up. It's 100% deserved, they're becoming the team everyone wants to beat.”

Speaking before France's Nations League third-place playoff against Germany in Stuttgart on Sunday, Mbappé also backed compatriot Ousmane Dembélé to win the Ballon d'Or award, ahead of Spain and Barcelona's Lamine Yamal. “Would I vote for Dembélé? Yes. Is there really any need to explain? I'm going for Dembélé. It's very clear.”

Mbappé scored 43 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid, winning the European golden shoe award, but his team failed to win a major trophy, beaten by Barcelona in the title race and Copa del Rey final. The 26-year-old has also been involved in a legal dispute with PSG over €55m in wages he claims the club have not paid him.

The France forward claimed there were no hard feelings over his departure and PSG's European success. “PSG won the Champions League without me, that doesn't affect me. That's a good thing. We all face challenges in our careers.

“I'm a bit more in the eye of the storm, which is good. I've always liked being in these positions, it's up to me to work. I've reversed quite a few trends in my career, I've had a lot of things stuck on my back and I've managed to get them off.

“Did I leave too soon? No, my story was over, it had to end,. There was no bitterness, I'd reached the end of my tether.”

Names will be made this summer in United States men's national team action, which starts when Mauricio Pochettino's team meets up with European powers Turkiye in East Hartford on Saturday.

MORE — How will USMNT line up versus Turkiye?

For live updates and highlights throughout USMNT vs Turkiye, check out PST's live blog coverage below.



Kickoff: Saturday, June 7, 3:30pm ETLocation: Rentschler Field in East Hartford, ConnecticutTV: Telemundo, UniversoStream en Espanol: Peacock



The Yanks are in dark blue, while Turkiye sport all white kits with a thick horizontal red stripe across their chests.

Well, Arda Guler and Kenan Yildiz, two very good 20-year-olds from massive clubs in Real Madrid and Juventus, respectively.

The Yanks will be challenged everywhere, but Turkiye's attack is the one area in which they may have a significant advantage on the U.S.

And Turkiye coach Vincenzo Montella has his team well-prepared for games.

Pochettino does not start Tyler Adams, opting for Luca de la Torre in partnership with Johnny Cardoso in the heart of the midfield.

There's space for Malik Tillman, too, and captain Chris Richards is the only other starter based outside of MLS.

Matt Freese starts over Matt Turner in goal, while Patrick Agyemang starts up top instead of Haji Wright.

Freese, Arfsten, Richards, M. Robinson, Freeman, Cardoso, De la Torre, McGlynn, Luna, Tillman, Ageymang.

Ozer, Celik, Demiral, Soyuncu, Kokcu, Akturkoglu, Guler, Yildig, Elmalu, Yuksek, Aydin

The international friendly pits the Yanks against a top-25 team for the first of two UEFA friendlies, with Switzerland coming soon, and good performances will show Pochettino a player's potential against similar opposition in the 2026 World Cup.

The nerves will be plenty for the USMNT players, who have chances to be center stage while Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Timothy Weah, Antonee Robinson, and others are absent from the fold.

But there are still a lot of regulars here, as Tyler Adams and Johnny Cardoso keep things steady and vicious in the midfield and Chris Richards gets more time as one of the leaders at the back.

Richards returns to the team with an FA Cup on his resume, and Crystal Palace teammate Matt Turner is likely to also start for the USMNT.

Who is going to seize the opportunities presented in the front four positions in the team?

Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Damion Downs, and Brian White all have claims of form and will feel they can claim the center forward spot with Folarin Balogun leaving camp through injury.

Malik Tillman can show so much without Reyna, Weah, and Pulisic, and has to be thrilled at the prospect of orchestrating the attack in front of steady midfielders.

The wings are very intriguing, as we'll learn how highly Pochettino already rates Diego Luna, and there are a bunch of talented options who could claim starting spots.

The Crescent Stars essentially cruised through Nations League B, winning promotion with a decisive two-legged triumph over Hungary.

Former AC Milan and Sevilla boss Vincenzo Montella is missing some familiar names for this match as Bournemouth's Enes Unal, Brighton's Ferdi Kadioglu, and Hoffenheim's Ozan Kabak are out through injury and Cenk Tosun was not called into the team.

This is a squad based largely in Turkiye's top flight, but Real Madrid starlet Arda Guler and Juventus young star Kenan Yildiz — both 20 years old — are in the fold.

Dortmund midfielder Salih Ozcan and Inter Milan hero Hakan Calhanoglu, the side's captain, lead the way in the midfield. Man United backstop Altay Bayindir and Trabzonspor keeper Ugurcan Cakir are the keepers with experience.

This is a solid team with lots of experience. Many will know the names Merih Demiral, Caglar Soyuncu, Mert Muldur, Okay Yokuslu, and Orkun Kokcu. It's a huge test for this USMNT.

Anything can happen in these friendlies once teams start making loads of subs in the second half, so it's almost more worthwhile to predict the score after 55 minutes or so. Either way, we'll venture chances in this one. We also expect a gritty midfield battle that sees both sides finding the ball on the perimeter. The hosts will be slight favorites to win here, but we'll take that down a notch. USMNT 1-1 Turkiye.

After disappointment in the Concacaf Nations League, the United States men's national team is back in action with a friendly against Turkiye as a tune up for the Gold Cup, which kicks off in just over a week. It's a strange international break with the Club World Cup and rest for players thinning out Maucicio Pochettino's squad which will be without regulars such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Sergino Dest, Gio Reyna and Folarin Balogun for this match.

Turkiye will be one of the better teams that the USMNT has faced, ranking 27th in the FIFA men's rankings, so with a squad that's mostly from Major League Soccer, this will be a true test of Pochettino's tactics.

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more.

These teams haven't met since 2014 when the United States defeated Turkiye in a tune up match for the World Cup in Brazil. That was a World Cup where the United States did make it to the knockout stage before falling to Belgium in extra time. Despite that game being 11 years ago, Hakan Calhanoglu did come off the bench in that match for Turkiye and will be expected to start this match, playing a critical role in their midfield.

Call it What You Want: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.



With such an inexperienced roster on the international stage, Pochettino has been asked if the squad at his disposal is good enough to win these games before heading to the Gold Cup but he quickly dismissed that notion.

"I think we need to respect the players that are here. We need to respect every single player and see if we are good enough," Pochettino said. "I will let you know after. We weren't good enough to win the Nations League. We were not good enough, if we go back to the World Cup, we were not good enough to win the World Cup in 2022. I think we cannot judge or analyze in this way. I think we need to wait, and then if we win, so happy. If we don't win, you can criticize."

While he's not wrong about how the USMNT has performed, this will be an important time for him to get the team to a stage where they are good enough to win these matches. Since taking over in September of 2024, this will be the longest camp that Pochettino has spent with the squad, which will give him a chance to make tactical breakthroughs. If they're still not good enough to win these games after spending that much time with the Argentine, that's when alarm bells will begin to ring about what this team's ceiling is. 

With camp newcomers in Sebastian Berhalter and Quinn Sullivan, Pochettino will have new options in midfield. Sullivan has represented the USMNT at youth levels, but has mostly played as a winger while he has taken up central positions for his club. Alongside Jack McGlynn, Luca De La Torre, Malik Tillman, Diego Luna, and Tyler Adams, there are quite a few directions that Pochettino can go in for this friendly, and that choice could have major implications on an eventual World Cup squad.

USMNT: Matt Turner, John Tolkin, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Nathan Harriel, Tyler Adams, Johnny Cardoso, Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright

Türkiye: Ugurcan Cakir, Mert Muldur, Samet Akaydin, Caglar Soyuncu, Mustafa Eskihellac, Salih Ozcan, Hakan Calhanoglu, Arda Guler, Kenan Yildiz, Baris Tilmaz, Kerem Akturkoglu

John Tolkin, Holstein Kiel: While this is Tolkin's first USMNT camp since being relegated from the Bundesliga, he did put in some good performances for Holstein Kiel after joining in January. Without Antonee Robinson, he could get a chance to be the starting left back for the USMNT, a position that has no true backup. When depth will be needed at multiple positions if the USMNT wants to succeed at the World Cup in 20206, figuring out Robinson's backup will be critical.

Which USMNT shows up? If the same USMNT from the Concacaf Nations League comes into this match, it will be quite a disappointment as their performance facing Panama and Canada won't be good enough to win this match facing off against Turkiye. With the World Cup looming, that can't happen as questions will also be asked about whether Pochettino is the right man for the job. They may not have to win the game in this friendly, but an improved performance is certainly needed.

In a tense game with pressing on display, these two teams will end up playing to a draw. It will at least be an eventful one with Arda Guler scoring before Brian White comes off the bench to rescue a result for the USMNT in a match that, while it won't be pretty, will build confidence for this squad. Pick: USMNT 1, Turkiye 1

Moves are happening...

According to Sport Bild journalist Christian Falk, the Club World Cup has made things more difficult for Bayern Munich's squad planning initiatives: 

Bayern take this competition very, very seriously. Partly because it's their first time, but also because of what's at stake in terms of financial rewards. If Bayern Munich win the Club World Cup, they could secure over €100m. This would represent a very welcome boost in the transfer market.

At the moment, you can see that Bayern have a big problem in defence. It's not clear if Kim Min-jae can play, which is partly why they're so keen to get Jonathan Tah over the line as soon as possible in time for the Club World Cup. Bayer Leverkusen want a fee said to be around €4m-5m to release Tah early, which is too much for Bayern Munich. They would have been willing to sanction half a million euros, perhaps a little bit more, but not as high a figure as €4m.

As we now know, Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen put their heads together and did work out a deal. It remains to be seen how Tah's presence could affect Kim Min-jae's situation. 

As for Tom Bischoff, Hoffenheim is still looking to capitalize on holding his rights for a few more weeks: 

There's now a separate issue with Tom Bischof, as Hoffenheim has now realised it can also squeeze some money out of Bayern. So, the club is struggling to get a team together and have a big squad for the Club World Cup. Otherwise, things could get a little difficult. Eric Dier, for instance, isn't in the team any longer, so things aren't quite clear at the moment.

The winger faces a huge decision on his future after failing to agree a permanent transfer to Stamford Bridge

Another summer, another transfer window where Jadon Sancho finds his future up in the air. Having been unable to negotiate a permanent contract at Chelsea after an indifferent loan spell in west London, the Manchester United outcast will once again weigh up his options in the coming months.

Despite the Blues' openness to keeping him, the winger's £300,000-per-week wages have put paid to a long-term stay at Stamford Bridge and he now finds himself in limbo with one year remaining on his lucrative deal at Old Trafford. Chelsea even paid a £5 million penalty fee to send him back, as they reneged on the £25m ($34m) obligation to buy that they agreed last year.

However, it seems Sancho did enough during his loan spell to ensure that he will have plenty of options on the table when he comes to choose his next move. It's a decision he must get right as he risks his once prodigious career drifting into obscurity.

Jack Grealish isn't holding back when it comes to letting his doubters know how he feels after a tumultuous season.

The Manchester City winger made 20 appearances in the Premier League this season scoring just one goal along with a single assist. He did appear in every game of the club's run to the FA Cup final before being left on the bench against Crystal Palace. 2024–25 marked just the second season since Pep Guardiola's arrival to Manchester where the Cityzens failed to win a trophy.

His future has been widely discussed after reports surfaced that he's likely going to be left off Man City's squad list for the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. As such, talks of a potential summer move have heated up.

Former Aston Villa forward Gabi Agbonlahor criticised Guardiola's decision to leave Grealish on the bench in their loss to Crystal Palace. Agbonlahor felt as if it was Guardiola sticking it to Grealish one final time. When the clip was posted to social media, one user responded: “Dude Jack is (sic) been bad lately and I'm not surprised Pep did that.” 

Grealish responded, “Haha I've been bad lately? Scored three goals in my last three appearances over 45 mins but okie dokie love x.” The City forward also commented, “What u want me to do, score a hatty in 20?”

Much has been made about Grealish since his move to Man City. The once exciting winger, much like most Guardiola signings, was deployed as a controlling option on the left flank. The Spaniard has his style of play and he particularly coaches players to fill certain roles, even despite Grealish's tantalising performances for Aston Villa. 

He was a crucial piece in the Cityzens' treble-winning campaign back in 2022–23, but this season marks the second domestic campaign in a row where he's made just 20 appearances in the league. For comparison, he made 28 during the treble season and 26 in his first season in Manchester.

Coco Gauff is a champion once again.

Gauff, 21, won her first French Open title by defeating top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 in Saturday's final.

The win marks Gauff's second major championship -- she previously won the 2023 US Open, where she also defeated Sabalenka in the final. Gauff joins Serena Williams (6), Chris Evert (6), Venus Williams (4) and Tracy Austin (2) as the fifth American woman in the Open era (i.e., since 1968) to win multiple singles Grand Slam titles at age 21 or younger, according to ESPN Research.

Gauff is also the first American woman to win the French Open since Serena Williams in 2015.

As Gauff walked off the court, she was congratulated by legendary film director Spike Lee.

"Get it sista!" Lee said to Gauff from the stands.

A post shared by ESPN (@espn)

Lee wasn't the only star to react to Gauff's win. Here are more athletes who took to social media to congratulate the American on her second major trophy.

🫶🏻 Many congrats @CocoGauff!!!

Coco Gauff defeated Aryna Sabalenka in three sets on Saturday to win the French Open, marking the first time the 21-year-old has won at Roland Garros in her young career. 

To claim her second career Grand Slam title, Gauff won the three-set battle (6-7, 6-2, 6-4) to beat Sabalenka. After the victory, Gauff expressed nothing but respect for Sabalenka, the No.1 ranked player in the world. 

“I'd like to congratulate Aryna," Gauff said. "You're a fighter. You're the #1 player in the world. I know today was a tough match, but you deserve all the results you've been having. Every time we play, it's such a tough match for me. Congratulations. Hopefully we play many more.”

Sabalenka fought back tears acknowledging the loss hurt, especially after not playing her best tennis, but she was congratulatory of Gauff on the well-earned victory. 

"Coco, congrats," Sabalenka said. "In these tough conditions you were a better player than me. Well done on a great two weeks. Congrats on the second Grand Slam, well deserved here. You're a fighter, hard worker, so congrats to you and your team."

Entering Saturday's matchup, Gauff and Sabalenka had previously faced off twice in majors and split those matchups 1-1. Gauff beat Sabalenka in the 2023 U.S. Open final to win her first Grand Slam, while Sabalenka won the most recent Grand Slam matchup between the two, defeating Gauff in the 2024 Australian Open semifinals. 

There will surely be more matchups to come between the two great competitors. Sabalenka has three Grand Slam titles but is still seeking her first French Open win, and Gauff is now up to two Grand Slam victories.

Two years after winning her first Grand Slam title, Coco Gauff has taken home her second crown. The 21-year-old American — and the No. 2 player in the world — won the 2025 French Open with a strong 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 win over world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka on Saturday.

The victory at Roland-Garros came three years after Gauff last made the final, where she fell to Iga Światek in a disappointing loss. This time, she got to lift the trophy.

On a windy day in Paris, with rain threatening to fall, Sabalenka showed her power early in the match, taking a 4-1 lead in the first set. But Gauff rallied to tie Sabalenka and later force a tiebreaker. Sabalenka, who grew visibly frustrated, was able to win the tiebreak after a comeback of her own.

But the second set was all Gauff's: The young American controlled the pace, forcing the increasingly unhappy Sabalenka to make several crucial mistakes. In the third set, Gauff took an early lead, but Sabalenka stayed right behind her, finally getting some momentum of her own.

Sabalenka had a stunningly high number of errors throughout the match, finishing with 70 unforced errors. Gauff, who stayed calm the entire match, was able to take advantage of those in order to get the victory.

The final game was intense: Gauff dropped one championship point but came back to secure the game and the title. Sabalenka hit the ball just out of bounds, and Gauff immediately dropped to the floor, overwhelmed with emotion.

Gauff's win makes her the first American woman to take the French Open title in a decade, after Serena Williams won the Slam in 2015.

Notably, Gauff's second major title came in much the same way as her first. Gauff defeated Sabalenka to win the 2023 U.S. Open, beating the Belarusian in three sets after dropping the first set.

But both players are better than they were three years ago, even playing with very different styles. Sabalenka's strength tends to come from her power, whereas Gauff's typically comes from her quickness and creativity on the court.

Sabalenka will have to settle for second place after making her first French Open final, and she was emotional in the ceremony after the game. But the 27-year-old, who is the reigning U.S. Open winner, is much stronger on the hard court as opposed to the clay, and will have another chance at a title this summer.

Women will play at Queen's Club next week for the first time in more than 50 years at the inaugural HSBC Championships, featuring the likes of Raducanu, Katie Boulter and top-10 stars Madison Keys and Zheng Qinwen

Saturday 7 June 2025 18:15, UK

Emma Raducanu could face current Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova in the second round of the HSBC Championship at Queen's Club, which starts on Monday.

The 22-year-old will face a qualifier in the first round and could face Krejcikova after that if she comes through her match with Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova.

Raducanu will be in action for the first time since losing in straight sets to Iga Swiatek in the second round of the French Open last month.

The 2021 US Open champion's best results on clay saw her reach the round of 16 in both Rome and Strasbourg and she is now turning her attention to the grass court season where she is scheduled to play at Queen's and Berlin ahead of Wimbledon in early July.

Saturday's draw for the inaugural HSBC Championships also paired British No 1 Katie Boulter with a qualifier in her opening match.

If she advances to the second round, she will play either Diana Schnaider or Magdalena Frech.

Other British players competing in the first home tournament of the season include Francesca Jones, who will play American McCartney Kessler in the first round and could face world No 7 Qinwen Zheng in the second round.

Sonay Kartal will play Daria Kasatkina in the first match and might face fellow Brit Jodie Burrage, who will play Amanda Anisimova in the first round.

Queen's returns to the WTA calendar after a 52-year absence with Zheng the highest ranked player in the field after world No 3 Jessica Pegula withdrew last week.

2024 US Open runner-up Pegula was set to be the highest ranked player in the draw, but the American withdrew along with Japan's four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka on Thursday.

The four highest-ranked players in the draw - Zheng, Madison Keys, Emma Navarro and Elena Rybakina were all handed byes into the second round.

The tournament will run from June 9-15.

The Lawn Tennis Association has committed to paying equal prize money to female players at Queen's and Eastbourne by 2029.

The LTA announced on Thursday it would pay total prize money of $1.415m (approximately £1m), the highest for a WTA 500 event of its draw size this year.

But that is still less than half of the prize pot that will be paid out to the male players the following week for the equivalent tournament on the ATP Tour.

At the Lexus Eastbourne Open, a joint WTA and ATP event staged the week before Wimbledon beginning on June 23, the difference is even starker, with the women's prize fund of $389,000 (approximately £287,000) significantly inferior to the more than £630,000 that will be paid to the men.

While prize money is equal at the grand slams and some joint tour events, generally remuneration on the WTA Tour is substantially lower than the ATP.

Scott Lloyd, the governing body's chief executive, said: "We are making significant increases this year to the women's prize money at Queen's and Eastbourne and want to achieve equal prize money as soon as possible."

Coco Gauff, the 21-year-old American tennis star, has defeated Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open women's singles final to claim the second Grand Slam title of her young career.

Saturday's final between Sabalenka and Gauff, who are respectively ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the world, was the first Grand Slam women's final to feature the world's top two players since 2018. Gauff is the first American champion at the French Open since Serena Williams in 2015.

The two players battled over three sets. After Sabalenka won the first set 7-6, Gauff stormed back to dominate the second set, 6-2, before outlasting the Belarusian player 6-4 in a gutsy final set. After Sabalenka's final volley landed just wide of the line, Gauff collapsed to the red clay of Roland-Garros, her hands high in the air.

"I don't think either of us were playing great," Gauff said in an interview with TNT after the match. "But I knew as soon as I stepped on to the court when I felt that it was windy that it would be one of those matches. So I was just trying to give myself the best chance and fight every point."

Gauff had reached the final after defeating fellow American Madison Keys, No. 7, in the quarterfinal, then breezing past the crowd darling Lois Boisson, the French player ranked just No. 361 who had mounted a thrilling Cinderella run at the Open. On the other side of the bracket was the imposing Sabalenka, who ascended to the world's No. 1 spot last year after winning in Australia and the U.S. Open in New York. Sabalenka had toppled the Polish star Iga Swiatek, winner of the past three consecutive French Opens, in the semifinal.

Gauff burst into the tennis world as a teenager — including a juniors title at Roland-Garros in 2018, her first career junior Grand Slam win.

Americans have won both women's Grand Slam titles so far this year. Gauff's victory follows Keys' title at the Australian Open in January.

The French Open men's final between No. 1 Jannik Sinner and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz is set for Sunday.

After a slow start in the first set, Coco Gauff staked her claim as one of this season's queens of clay, storming back to upset top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 in a sloppy, mistake-filled French Open final on Saturday.

It's the second Grand Slam title for the 21-year-old Gauff, who adds the 2023 U.S. Open crown to her triumphs. Gauff, who had split the previous 10 matches with Sabalenka, became the first American woman to win the French Open singles title since Serena Williams in 2015, despite eight double faults and having trouble with her serve at times in the match that took two hours and 37 minutes.

Down 3-1 in the third set, the Belarus native broke Gauff to even the match at three, but was broken again in the seventh game, as the rain started to come down at Court Philippe-Chatrier with the roof remaining open, but couldn't maintain the momentum.

Sabalenka, who had 70 unforced errors and six double faults, was clearly frustrated with her play at times, yelling at her coaches in the stands after a shot out of play or into the net and nearly hitting a kid running after a ball following one of those mistakes. Despite the loss, Sabalenka will keep the No. 1 spot in the next WTA rankings.

After winning the first game of the match, Gauff was broken in the third and fifth games. Sabalenka neutralized Gauff's serve, sprinting out to a 4-1 lead and a 40-love lead in the next game. But Gauff showed resilience, breaking back after losing seven straight points on serve before saving a triple break point.

Sabalenka was broken again in the eighth game, and Gauff squared up the match, thanks to the top-seed unraveling, at one point losing 12 straight points.

In a recurring theme, Sabalenka, who had four double faults and 32 unforced errors, thanks to a nearly 30 mph gusting wind, and Gauff took turns breaking each other's serve, including Gauff getting the upper hand in a 13-minute 10th game. The hour and 17-minute set went to a tiebreak, with Gauff taking the first three points, before Sabalenka stormed back to take the set 7-6.

Here's a recap of the French Open women's final:

In the second set, it was Gauff who got out to a 4-1 lead, and Sabalenka continued to pile up the unenforced errors. After racking up 32 unforced errors in the first set, Sabalenka added 15 more, as Gauff settled down and blitzed the three-time major winner, taking the second set 6-2.

On to the third and deciding set, in what has been a thrilling, yet mistake-filled final.

After winning the first game of the match, Coco Gauff was broken in the third and fifth games as Aryna Sabalenka neutralized Gauff's serve, sprinting out to a 4-1 lead and a 40-love lead in the next game. But Gauff showed resilience, breaking back after losing seven straight points on serve before saving a triple break point.

Sabalenka was broken again in the eighth game and Gauff squared up the match, thanks to the top-seed unraveling, at one point losing 12 straight points. In a recurring theme, Sabalenka, who had four double faults and 32 unforced errors, thanks to a nearly 30 mph gusting wind, and Gauff took turns breaking each other's serve, including Gauff getting the upper hand in a 13-minute 10th game. The hour-and-18-minute set went to a tiebreak, with Gauff taking the first three points before Sabalenka stormed back to take the set 7-6.

The head-to-head matchup between Gauff and Sabalenka is tied 5-5 overall, 1-1 in majors and 1-1 on clay. Most recently, Sabalenka edged out Gauff 6-3, 7-6 to win in the Madrid finals on clay in Spain last month. 

Their last meeting in a major came in the semifinals of the 2024 Australian Open, where Sabalenka defeated Gauff 7-6, 6-4 on a hard court. Before that, Gauff defeated Sabalenka 2-6, 6-3 in the 2023 U.S. Open final – also on hard court – to claim the first Grand Slam singles title of her career.

The French Open women's final between American Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus is set for Saturday at 9 a.m. ET (3 p.m. in Paris).

Coco Gauff claimed her first French Open title by beating Aryna Sabalenka in windy conditions on Saturday, winning 6-7, 6-2, 6-4.

The world's top two tennis players met at Roland Garros, with both of them chasing their maiden French Open title. World No. 2 Gauff, who already has a huge net worth after a record-breaking payday last year, went into the event with just one Grand Slam to her name, the 2023 U.S. Open.

Top-ranked Sabalenka, meanwhile, boasted three major titles, having previously won the Australian Open twice and last year's U.S. Open. She went into Saturday's match as the favorite after beating Gauff on clay at the Madrid Open final last month.

Sabalenka made the perfect start in Paris by winning the first set 7-6. But Gauff, the 21-year-old, immediately bounced back by winning the second set 6-2. She then got the job done during a nervy final game, just managing to hold her serve to win 6-4.

Gauff is the first American to win the women's singles at Roland Garros since Serena Williams picked up her third and final French Open title in 2015.

"I am emotional," said British tennis star Naomi Broady on BBC Radio 5 Live. "I think it's since I've had children. It is the reaction of her (Gauff's) mum and dad as she makes her way up to the box. They are the first people she sees.

"Her mum was ready and waiting, her dad sprinted down the stairs. The three of them just enjoyed an embrace down there together. It's very much a team effort in Team Coco."

Sablenka said after the match: "This one hurts so much. Especially after such a tough two weeks.

"Playing great tennis and then in these terrible conditions to show such terrible tennis in the final, it really hurts. But it's OK. Anyway, Coco, congrats. In these tough conditions, you were a better player than me. Well done on a great two weeks.

"Congrats on the second slam. You're a fighter. Hard worker. Congrats to you and your team."

Wind in Paris made Saturday's match tough for both players, with only 15 service games won and 13 double faults made.

Greg Rusedski, the former British No. 1 who lost to Patrick Rafter in the 1997 U.S. Open final, noticed the brutal conditions in Paris while commentating on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It is gusty out there! Look at the ball kids' shirts," said Rusedski during the first set. "The wind is really spinning in this stadium, so I think this is going to be a tricky opening game for Coco Gauff, especially with her service toss."

Rusedski went on to compare the match to a "yo-yo." He then added during the second set: "These conditions are so mentally challenging.

"If you just turn off for one second, the ball can just get away from you very quickly because of the gusts of wind. Both players are having to move their footwork constantly.

"These are some of the most difficult conditions to play in, especially when you're trying to win your first French Open title."

Coco Gauff has won the French Open for the first time by defeating top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 in Saturday's final.

The second-ranked Gauff came out on top of a contest that was full of tension and momentum swings to claim her second major trophy after the 2023 U.S Open, where she also came from a set down to beat Sabalenka in the final.

It was the first No. 1 vs. No. 2 final in Paris since 2013, when Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova, and just the second in the last 30 years.

After Sabalenka sent a backhand wide on Gauff's second match point, the 21-year-old American fell onto her back, covering her face with both hands before resting her forehand on the clay. After greeting Sabalenka at the net, she hugged film director Spike Lee and celebrated with her entourage, three years after she lost in her first final at Roland-Garros.

Sabalenka started the deciding set strongly, sticking to her high-risk approach to hold her first service game.

Gauff responded by raising her level, winning a superb rally in the third game that drew loud cheers and applause from the crowd. After an intense exchange of drop shots, Gauff hit a lob that Sabalenka chased down before attempting a shot between her legs — only for Gauff to intercept it at the net and finish with a winner.

Gauff was consistent from the baseline and earned a break point which she converted when Sabalenka double-faulted, giving her a 2-1 lead. Sabalenka turned toward her box and shouted in frustration but then regained her composure, breaking back to level the match at 3-3. 

She was broken again at love, however, and Gauff then held serve twice to claimed the title after a match that lasted 2 hours, 38 minutes.

LINK: ATP Tour Stuttgart Draw | ATP Tour ‘s-Hertogenbosch Draw | WTA ‘s-Hertogenbosch Draw | WTA London Draw

As summer nears, the tennis world shifts gears for the short but thrilling grass court season. Beginning June 9, 2025, three key tournaments mark the first week of play on the lawns of Europe: Stuttgart's BOSS Open, the dual-gender Libema Open in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, and the long-awaited return of WTA action to London's Queen's Club.

Let's take a closer look at the singles draws that promise to captivate fans across both the ATP Tour and WTA.

The ATP 250 event in Stuttgart once again lives up to its reputation as a player-favorite warm-up for Wimbledon. German No. 1 Alexander Zverev headlines the draw, hoping to lift the trophy on home soil and find his rhythm on grass.

He'll be joined by an electric mix of American firepower: Tommy Paul, Taylor Fritz, and Ben Shelton, all of whom have posted strong results on faster surfaces. Meanwhile, all eyes were set on Nick Kyrgios's return, although the unpredictable and entertaining Aussie has sadly had to withdraw from the entire grass-court season with continued injury concerns. 

This draw promises a dynamic blend of finesse and aggression, tailor-made for Stuttgart's slick courts.

Over in the Netherlands, the ATP 250 field at the Libema Open is equally stacked. Former World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev tops the draw, bringing his counterpunching brilliance to the grass, a surface he's grown increasingly comfortable on in recent years.

Joining him is Aussie speedster Alex de Minaur, whose ability to retrieve and redirect pace makes him a dark horse on this surface. Local hero Tallon Griekspoor will carry Dutch hopes, while France's Arthur Fils, one of the most exciting young players on the ATP Tour, looks to notch a statement win on grass.

Expect a wide-open affair with multiple potential champions.

The women's draw at the Libéma Open is quietly one of the week's most competitive. Big-serving Liudmila Samsonova, a proven grass-court performer and defending champion, returns to the Netherlands looking to repeat her 2023 success.

She'll face stiff opposition from compatriots Ekaterina Alexandrova, Veronika Kudermetova, and Anastasia Potapova, all of whom are capable of deep runs. Danielle Collins, fresh off a resurgence in form, adds an American flavor to the draw.

Other names to watch include Belgium's Elise Mertens, Poland's Magda Linette, and Colombian standout Camila Osorio. With a mix of seasoned veterans and rising stars, this draw is as balanced as it is unpredictable.

In a historic return, the WTA makes its long-awaited comeback to Queen's Club with the HSBC Women's Championships, the first WTA event at this venue in over five decades. The draw reads like a who's who of top-tier grass-court contenders.

Jessica Pegula, Elena Rybakina, and Petra Kvitova headline the field, each boasting powerful, efficient grass-court games. Rybakina, a former Wimbledon champion, and Kvitova, with two Wimbledon titles of her own, are likely favorites.

Americans Madison Keys and Amanda Anisimova bring their aggressive styles to London, while rising Chinese star Qinwen Zheng adds further intrigue. Former French Open finalist Barbora Krejcikova, Brazil's Beatriz Haddad Maia, and Canadian crowd favorite Leylah Fernandez round out a field that is loaded with title threats from top to bottom.

This event marks an important stepping stone for Wimbledon preparations—and with such a stacked lineup, fans are in for a treat.

From Stuttgart to ‘s-Hertogenbosch and now to London, the first week of grass court play in 2025 is shaping up to be one of the most compelling in years. With Grand Slam champions, breakout stars, and hometown favorites all in action, the stakes are high and the margins slim.

Whether you're following the big hitters in Germany, the all-court strategists in the Netherlands, or the power-laden battles in London, this week is the perfect start to the grass-court season. Stay tuned, because the road to Wimbledon begins here.

Aryna Sabalenka continues to dominate the sport of tennis, with the Belarus native at No. 1 in the world and Grand Slam wins at the Australian Open and U.S. Open, plus a finals appearance at the 2025 French Open.

And if you're wondering: does she have a boyfriend? The answer is: yes!

As we've written before: "She's also spoken about how happy she is with her current boyfriend, Georgios Frangulis. The Brazilian owner of brand Oakberry and the tennis star went Instagram official in May of 2024 ... and he's been seen at her matches ever since."

Are they still together? That answer is yes, given the photo of Sabalenka and Frangulis that popped up on her Instagram page while they were in France as she competed in the Grand Slam:

She's said some lovely things about him as they've dated, including this Instagram post in 2024:

He's been extremely supportive as she's risen to the top of the tennis world, and it's great to see them still together as she tries to win more Grand Slams.

Jim Courier has outlined what he'll be looking out for at Wimbledon to confirm if Novak Djokovic is close to retiring from the sport.

The Serbian superstar fought well last night against the overwhelming favourite, arguably providing Jannik Sinner with his toughest challenge of the tournament thus far.

However, his efforts were in vain, and he subsequently lost in straight sets.

It was a frustrating and unfair reflection of how the match went, but Sinner was just too good.

Novak Djokovic, clearly demoralised by the nature of the result, seemed to bid farewell to Roland Garros in a more emotional way than many expected. This has sparked mass fear of his potential retirement.

Speaking live on TNT Sports' US coverage just last night, naturally Djokovic was the main topic of conversation.

After all, not only had he put in a strong showing against the world number one, but the manner in which he exited Philippe Chatrier left many wondering whether the French Open would ever see him again.

Kissing the clay that has brought him so much success, Courier theorised that, whilst retirement might not be imminent, one thing would confirm its proximity that he'll keep an eye on at Wimbledon.

He stated: ‘I will say this, too: My big takeaway from this match is if I see his emotional state like this at Wimbledon and at the US Open, when he's playing a match of this magnitude against a player of this magnitude, and he's not snarling, if he's smiling. Yeah, he's on his way out. 

‘I mean, time's undefeated, but that was not representative of the emotional state when he's played his best tennis. He's always looking for edges in angles and things to get him motivated. He was smiling in combat. 

‘That's Alcaraz's MO. That's never been Novak's.

It should come as no surprise to suggest that Djokovic could compete at Wimbledon, but now more than ever his chances of success are amplified.

After all, given the torrid form he has suffered for the bulk of 2025, many had written him off, especially heading into the slow, laborious clay-court Grand Slam.

However, his 38-year-old body held strong, despite Djokovic admitting he was carrying an injury, and took him into the semi-finals.

He performed so admirably, and will likely only get better on a surface where he has enjoyed supreme levels of success.

If he is to win that coveted record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title, Wimbledon is likely his best bet.

Djokovic has given himself the perfect platform to head back to Centre Court full of confidence and belief that he can once again challenge at the apex of the sport.

Jannik Sinner's classic win against Novak Djokovic saw the world No. 1 set up a mouthwatering men's singles final against Carlos Alcaraz (2) on Sunday at the 2025 French Open.

Top seed Sinner beat seven-time finalist Novak Djokovic (6) in straight sets, 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(3) to make his first French Open final. Afterward, Djokovic admitted it could be his last ever match at Roland Garros.

Defending champion Alcaraz reached the showpiece after Lorenzo Musetti (8) retired with an injury when down 6-4, 6-7(3), 0-6, 0-2 on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

It will be the first time that Sinner and Alcaraz will meet in a Grand Slam final. The Spaniard is looking for major No. 5, while the Italian aims for his third consecutive slam.

Jannik Sinner's formula for mastering tennis on clay? Ignore the red brick entirely

If Carlos Alcaraz wins Sunday, he will have back-to-back French Open titles to his name. The last Spaniard to do that was the King of Clay himself Rafael Nadal. 

Alcaraz will have five slam titles, moving him in a tie with Frank Sedgman and Tony Trabert. He will be one back of tennis superstars Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg. 

Remember, Alcaraz is only 22 years old.

If Jannik Sinner were to win Sunday, it would be his first career French Open title. 

The Italian would have three consecutive slams dating back to the 2024 U.S. Open. It also gives him four slams, tied with his opponent Carlos Alcaraz.

When the world No. 1 arrives to the All England Club at Wimbledon, he will be a Championships title away from the career grand slam and the “Sinner Slam” (all four majors at once). 

As Djokovic left Chatrier he put down his bags and waved to every corner of the stadium, before leaning down and touching the clay. 

Asked in his news conference just now about whether this was an indication that this was his last ever French Open, the three-time champion here said: “This could have been the last match ever I played here, so I don't know. That's why I was a bit more emotional even in the end.

“But if this was the farewell match of the Roland Garros for me in my career, it was a wonderful one in terms of the atmosphere and what I got from the crowd.”

I asked him whether this was an all-options-are-on-the-table situation, or if he's leaning towards it probably being his last, to which he replied: “I said it could have been my last match. I didn't say it was. So I don't know right now. 12 months at this point in my career is quite a long time.

“Do I wish to play more? Yes, I do. But will I be able to play in 12 months' time here again? I don't know. I don't know. So, yeah, I mean, that's all I can say for the moment.”

Djokovic went on to say that he plans to play this year's Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, but those are the only events he's really thinking about right now.

Novak Djokovic, 38, has admitted after the match that this could be his last ever match at Roland Garros.

More as we have it.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have met three previous times at majors. The Spaniard has a 2-1 record over the Italian.

Their last meeting at a slam happened at the 2024 French Open, where Alcaraz rallied from two sets to one down to win in five 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.

Arguably their most epic slam match occurred at the 2022 U.S. Open quarterfinals, where the No. 2 seed emerged victorious over the world No. 1 in five sets in the wee hours of the morning. 

Men's tennis gets the Grand Slam final it has craved since 2022 —when Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz produced five hours and 15 minutes of the impossible on Arthur Ashe Stadium at the U.S. Open — but that it has never had. 

Their dominance of the sport is such that whoever loses likely won't hurt as much as the rest of the tour that has to try and beat them to the biggest prizes.

Sunday's final will be the 12th meeting between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. 

The Spaniard has a 7-4 lead in the career head to head over the Italian.

On clay, Alcaraz is 2-1 against Sinner on clay. 

They last met at the Italian Open final this year, with the No. 2 seed winning 7-6 (5), 6-1 against the world No. 1. 

Ultimately, it solidified the men's tennis order of the moment. Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who will meet in Sunday's final, are just a couple levels better than everyone else. They hit harder. They run faster. They have more magic in their hands. 

They see a ball streaming over the net that would make everyone else feel hopeless, and they sense an opportunity, not just to win a point but to snuff out any thought that the impossible might be beyond their reach.

Djokovic used every ounce of his determination, power, creativity and experience to nudge Sinner out of his comfort zone. 

But for one game late in the second set, when Djokovic got his first break points against him in nearly seven full sets of tennis and sneaked within shouting distance of levelling the match, Sinner had every answer.

Then came the tiebreak that looked set to be a microcosm of the match, before Sinner did what Sinner does when he's had enough. He got his toes up on the baseline and let his arm fly and pinned Djokovic in the back court. 

Djokovic fought his way forward. Down 2-0, with the chance to get proceedings back on serve, he got to the net, took dead aim at a short lob and pounded it into the net. 

His shoulders dropped, the air left his lungs. His head sagged. Sinner finally had the lead he was never going to relinquish.

Friday night at the French Open, Novak Djokovic played a level of tennis that few people on this planet will ever reach, and Jannik Sinner still beat him in straight sets.

With his unmatched precision, and his ability to turn defense into offense with a snap of his hips and a flick of his wrists, Sinner beat Djokovic 6-3, 6-4, 7-6(3) in a match that was tight, nervy and at times physically wrenching. 

It was also an exhibition of baseline tennis, a barrage of changes in angle, redirections of pace and sliding lateral movement, from the man who redefined those things in the 2010s and the man who has remade them once more.

Jannik Sinner beats Novak Djokovic to set up French Open final against Carlos Alcaraz

As Lukas mentioned earlier, both the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in the men's singles have made the final.

As have the women, with Coco Gauff (2) facing Aryna Sabalenka (1) tomorrow.

The last time the top two seeds have met in the final for both men's and women's singles at Roland Garros was all the way back in 1984!

Below is what Jannik Sinner accomplished with his semifinal victory today over Novak Djokovic, per the TNT broadcast:

It's been five years since the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds have met in the men's singles final at Roland Garros. 

That was the COVID-19 pandemic 2020 French Open final in the fall, where Rafael Nadal defeated Novak Djokovic.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will be the latest No. 1 and No. 2 slam final matchup in Paris on Sunday. 

Jannik Sinner spoke on Philippe-Chatrier after reaching his first French Open final without dropping a set.

The world No. 1 said: “First of all, thank you so much for coming, for supporting us. That's why we love to (play tennis). It was such a special occasion for me. It's just amazing. I had to step up, play my best tennis, and am very happy how I handled these situations.

“Novak showed how much of a role model he is. What he's doing is incredible, I wish him the best for the rest of the season, and we are very lucky to see him playing such high-level tennis.

“He has achieved so many things, is the best player in the history of our sport. Playing against him here is amazing. Of course I try not to think about this, but before going on court, you feel the tension and what is coming against you.

“I try to prepare myself in the best possible way. Of course on Sunday it's gonna be very, very difficult. My head-to-heads lately don't look great against Carlos Alcaraz but I'm happy to be in the final, we will do our best and I will see what I can do.”

He added: “These are very rare and special moments in my career. I'm trying to enjoy it. We have tomorrow off and I will try to enjoy. Thank you for being so nice to me throughout the whole tournament and I will try to be prepared for the final.”

Djokovic beat Carlos Alcaraz in four sets at the Australian Open in January, but overall I think he's been better tonight. 

Which feels odd to say given he has just lost in straight sets, but he's been sensational here. 

His best performance since last year's Olympic final by some way.

Jannik Sinner secures the win in straight sets, 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(3).

Novak Djokovic's tournament is over. His bid for 25 Grand Slam singles titles is over. At least for now.

He applauds the crowd but leaves Philippe-Chatrier the vanquished rather than the vanquisher.

Sinner 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(3) Djokovic

Jannik Sinner, ball on his own serve, three match points to play with. 

And Novak Djokovic nets!

Sinner 6-4, 7-5, 6-6 (*6-3) Djokovic

Djokovic errs. 5-2. Fans' hands are on their faces, covering their mouths, on their heads.

That's poor from Novak Djokovic. He slashes at a central forehand.

Four match points to Sinner. Now three.



It's reassuring in a way that the athlete who has come as close to anyone to sporting perfection can still have a weakness. 

Novak Djokovic will have nightmares about that missed smash if he loses this set.

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff are familiar foes, especially when it comes to the latter stages of tournaments.

The pair meet for the third time with a trophy on the line in Saturday's French Open final, with a seven-figure prize on the line.

In May's Madrid Open, with Sabalenka reigned victorious with a 6-3, 7-6 win. 

But the 2023 US Open was the American's time to shine.

Gauff was just 19 when she took on Sabalenka, who had already won a major that year at the Australian Open, and many expected her to claim her second. 

When the first set went to Sabalenka 6-2, many would have been forgiven for thinking the match was already a foregone conclusion.

However, what followed was one of the most thrilling comebacks in a major final as Gauff rallied to win the next two sets 6-3, 6-2 as Sabalenka uncharacteristically collapsed and lost all composure in her tennis. 

The result left both players emotional, with Sabalenka unwilling to hide hers as she stormed to her bench and began to uncontrollably cry. 

When asked in her post-match interview what she's most proud of from this year, she fought back tears again as she said: "I don't know."

That match still haunts the 26-year-old to this day, who admitted that while she has learnt lessons, she still gets flashbacks from it. 

"That was very difficult match, I got a little emotional and had this little flashback on last year's final, meaning the crowd atmosphere," said after the 2024 US Open final.

For Gauff, the 21-year-old admitted that she was surprised she cried, as it's something that she and her Dad never do.

"I do never cry but the US Open happened. I wasn't expecting that, okay? Y'all say what you want, I was not expecting that," she said on Instagram at the time.

"I don't think I was crying, to be honest, I think that girl in the video was crying because I don't like to cry. Not in front of people, I'll cry alone, I'll cry over a movie or a TV show but in front of people, no.

"Because I'm supposed to be a thug. Just kidding. I'm like my dad though, for real. Today was the first time I've ever seen my dad cry. He doesn't want me to tell y'all that but he got caught in 4K. He thinks he's so hard but he's not."

Since that US Open final, the pair have met four times - three semifinals and one final - with Sabalenka winning the most recent clash at the Madrid Open

Their overall record is now tied at 5-5, and after their last contest, the pair hailed each other for an incredible tournament.

"First I want to congratulate Coco and her team on an incredible few weeks here," Sabalenka said.

"I'm super happy to see you back in the finals, playing your best tennis.

Gauff shared positive sentiment towards her opponent as well.

"I'd like to congratulate Aryna on an incredible tournament. You're always tough to face. Congrats to your team.

"Congrats on all the success you've been having.”

Gauff came into the final as the No.4-ranked player in the world.

With the victory, Sabalenka has her 46th-ranked win over a top-10 opponent, with six consecutive triumphs and 12 consecutive sets.

Sinner beat Novak Djokovic 6-4 7-5 7-6(3) in a generational battle on Court Philippe Chatrier to deny his Serbian opponent a record 25th Grand Slam and leave him unsure whether he will ever return to Roland Garros, where he has won three major trophies.

The 23-year-old Italian, who is seeking his fourth Grand Slam title, booked a mouth-watering meeting with his main rival Carlos Alcaraz, who will aim to retain his crown at Roland Garros and add a fifth major crown to his trophy cabinet.

With Djokovic now the only active member of tennis' Big Four that also included Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Andy Murray and yielded a collective 69 major titles in more than two decades, Sinner sensed an opportunity for himself and Alcaraz.

"It takes time to compare us with the Big Three or Big Four, no? Only time can tell, to be honest," Sinner told reporters.

"For sure, from my point of view, he's a player who makes me a better player. He pushes me to the limit. We try to understand where we have to improve, for the next times I play against him.

"I believe that tennis or every sport needs rivalries. This could be potentially one of them, but there are amazing players coming up. There can be so many different and other players joining or one drops. You never know."

Sunday's clash on Court Philippe Chatrier will mark only the 12th time that Sinner and Alcaraz have faced off, with the 22-year-old Spaniard looking for a fifth straight victory over his opponent to successfully defend his title.

Djokovic said the pair would have to keep going to match the rivalry that he had with Federer, Nadal and Murray.

"At the moment, that's hard, because they need to play against each for at least 10-plus years non-stop in order to be part of the same discussion," Djokovic added.

"But they're definitely great for tennis, both of them. I think their rivalry is something our sport needs."

Sinner said he and Alcaraz had a similar aura and could get more fans interested in the sport.

"He's a player with charisma, with that aura," Sinner said.

"The moment he steps on court, you can feel his presence. In the end, that's exactly what tennis needs. The more people like that, the more players like that, the better.

"In the end, it's exactly those players who bring people closer to the sport and make them want to watch tennis."

There are, Katie Boulter reckons, two main paths to success in tennis – especially in women's tennis. You can, in the first instance, be a teenage prodigy, the kind of freak who blazes on to the scene like a comet, taking on players double your age and beating them, all while studying for your A-levels. But this road is fraught with danger.

“In some ways you want to be that child who's going to be the next big thing, a superstar from a young age, but there are caveats to it. Things that people don't see that can be pretty brutal,” Boulter says. ‘I've seen it throughout a lot of people's careers. Some people are made to handle it and some people aren't. It's interesting to watch. I don't personally wish for it.'

And then there's the other path. The slow, winding route to glory, away from the brightest glare of public and media attention. This way may take longer, but the destination's the same, and when you arrive, you tend to be better able to deal with being there.

This is the road Boulter's taking. At 28, having toiled as a professional for more than a decade, she is now Britain's number one-ranked women's tennis player and intends to stay there. “I'm not expecting to be an overnight success. I'm expecting to work for it,” she says. “I like working hard. I like getting credit for the achievements I've made, but I also enjoy being… not exactly an underdog, but the quiet one.” She smiles. “I like being that person.”

It's 8am on a Monday in south-west London, a decent forehand's distance from the All England Club. We're in tennis country, at a vast, beautiful house tucked down a long drive, where Boulter will be photographed today. “I must have driven this road a thousand times and never knew it was here,” she says, gazing at the place as she alights from an Uber.

Boulter, who's in Nike athleisure with her trademark high ponytail, woke up at her home nearby only 20 minutes ago. She apologises immediately if she doesn't make any sense before she's had several coffees, but proceeds to be more lucid and honest about her sport than many manage in a career. She's only just overcome jetlag after flying home from the Miami Open. After all these years, it never gets any easier, even now she's in business class.

“I never used to [be in business] when I was younger, but then I got injured and had to say to myself, ‘You need to take care of yourself if you're going to do these miles.' In tennis you pay your own expenses – your coach, everything. So it's quite challenging for a lot of players. You don't really break even unless you're top 100. There's people trying to change that, but it's pretty tough. You're always trying to save in places, but not to the detriment of your health.”

Boulter's rise certainly wasn't without incident. Born and brought up in Leicestershire but with stints in Florida and London, she showed great childhood promise that was interrupted by debilitating chronic fatigue in her late teens, while other injuries – including a spinal stress fracture in 2019 – mean she's hit her physical prime only in recent years. Now fit, she's soared up the rankings, rising to a career-high world number 23 at the end of last year, after winning her first WTA titles, and in the process overtaking Emma Raducanu to be Britain's top woman for the past two years.

“Tennis is a fascinating sport,” she says. “You've got 17-year-olds playing against 35-year-olds, you've got people having their best years as teenagers and others having their best years in their 30s. Anything can happen, and for me it was going to be a matter of time before I got my ducks in a row. It's been nice seeing that come to fruition.”

This year is proving an “enlightening” one. She ignored a foot injury for too long, which ended up halting 2024's momentum when it sidelined her earlier in the year, but she returned to help Great Britain into the finals of the Billie Jean King Cup when she and her doubles partner Jodie Burrage beat the Netherlands this April, before breaking new ground by earning the first WTA Tour clay-court win of her career, at the Trophée Clarins in Paris.

That's all before the grass-court season starts, including playing at The Queen's Club as it hosts professional women's tennis for the first time in more than 50 years, and of course Wimbledon. Grass is Boulter's strongest surface, and she says, “The epitome of tennis for me is Wimbledon and the grass season and playing at home in front of my friends and family.” And, occasionally, even more esteemed guests: in 2023 the Princess of Wales surprised her by turning up to watch her on day two of Wimbledon.

Boulter comes from a tennis family. Her mother, Sue, whom she “idolises”, was her first tennis coach, while her maternal grandparents, Brian and Jill Gartshore, were county champions who met on court. Her older brother, James, was also a promising junior, but gave it up as a teenager and now slogs it out as an agent to Hollywood stars. Their father, David, a businessman who used to work for BP, and Sue were “the total opposite” of typical tennis tiger parents, encouraging Boulter to keep an all-round education and to focus on tennis only when she decided to.

When Boulter was starting secondary school, her father's work took the family to Florida, where she was briefly homeschooled and met various other young tennis starlets, including her now best friend, Laura Robson. Her parents' marriage ended, after which the 13-year-old Boulter and her mother moved to London while her father stayed in Florida. Boulter hasn't seen him since, she says; her grandfather is “probably the biggest male influence I had growing up”.

On court, Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Roger Federer and “some people outside of tennis, like Jessica Ennis” were her idols. She played Williams and Federer in the same few days at a tournament once. “It was quite the week…” she says, shaking her head.

Chronic fatigue, which struck in her late teens, now “feels like a long time ago, but I didn't feel like I could train or get the work done to be a tennis player”. She changed her lifestyle and diet, and the cure came ultimately from “the support from my family, plus the medical team at the National Tennis Centre, which I know I'm very lucky to have [compared] to a lot of kids in the same situation,” she says. “I think [the fatigue] showed me what I wanted, it led me to this path. I wouldn't change it, because I don't know if I'd be here right now without that.”

The coffee has arrived. “Praise the Lord,” Boulter says. As, in fact, has her agent, Dino Marcan, a tall, friendly Croatian. Boulter's support team has steadied in recent years, but it has also swollen by one, with the addition of her fiancé, Alex de Minaur, the Australian currently ranked number seven in the men's game.

The pair have been an off-court couple since 2020 and engaged since December, and they frequently play doubles together – teasing each other in post-match interviews and on social media. They've been variously compared to “the new Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf”, and “the real life Tashi and Art from Challengers”. (People who say the latter possibly haven't seen that film in full.)

“We're the most lax people out there, we're always just having fun,” Boulter says. “We played in the mixed doubles at Wimbledon a few years ago, and I think it was the most fun I've had in my life. I just love every second on the tennis court with him. He just knows how to support me.”

I'd wondered if she might be less than keen to be asked about de Minaur, but she beams whenever he comes up. “My career's been very up and down, but I've been through a lot and I feel like I can help him. He can be quite narrow-minded and he focuses on tennis, tennis, tennis and can lose perspective sometimes with just being human and remembering to enjoy it. I try to have a positive impact on that, and he brings me so much great advice. He's been the stable part of my life, and it's so important to have that.”

I cannot help but notice she's wearing a diamond ring the size of Uluru. She laughs: “Alex and my mum did very well.” Boulter is a “Rare Jewels ambassador” for Pragnell, and always wears beautiful pieces on court, but the ring doesn't go with her. “I'm just a tad paranoid about losing it. My team are always keeping an eye on it for me.”

No date or location is set for the big day – Boulter's family are in Leicestershire, de Minaur's is split between Australia and Spain. “I've not been a massive dreamer about my wedding – as long as my family are there, I'll be happy. [But] I did sort of dream about a destination wedding, having a place you can go back to that's your place. So it's possible it'll be in the middle of nowhere.”

Having de Minaur around gives Boulter an insight into men's tennis, which may be just as fiercely competitive as the women's game, but the off-court experience is different. It has always struck me, I say, that women in tennis are held to a far higher standard, especially when it comes to receiving criticism for doing anything other than training and winning.

“Yeah, possibly,” Boulter says, weighing this up. “You do see a lot of [criticism] on social media, even I get a lot of that. You kind of get ridiculed for spending one second off the tennis court, which wouldn't be healthy for anyone in any other job. People expect you to be practising and playing at all times. But half of tennis is recovery, rehab, switching off – all these things people do not see.

“People judge but they don't see the full story. That's where [players] take it pretty hard, when you've got people telling you how to live your life. They don't see that we're human, and don't see the less glamorous side of things, they don't see me late at night in the treatment room having done 10 hours of work that day, they see one snippet of my time on court that day.”

Boulter spoke last year about how common threats and stalking are in the women's game; how she and de Minaur have been followed around west London in a car, and a man once messaged her at the Nottingham Open to say, “I'm outside. I'm going to hurt you if you come outside.” He was caught: he really was there, waiting.

“It's apparent in tennis, there's a lot that goes on,” Boulter says today. Marcan nods. “Some of it you don't even see, it comes to my email and I don't even tell you.”

What sort of thing?

“Threats. I've had people tell me they're going to kill me even after one of my clients has won a tournament. Some of them are gamblers, some of them are stalkers, it's a mix of people,” Marcan says. “And some of them are just bored, hiding behind a keyboard. There's a few of those out there too,” Boulter adds. Has she ever been asked to throw a game? “They ask you everything. Obviously you report it straight away to the authorities. Ultimately you get abused. And I get double now, because every time Alex loses, they blame me…”

She and de Minaur do, at least, make sure to stop talking about tennis as much as they can. “That side of things is important, you have to know when to draw the line and take a moment for yourself. But when we're home we could be doing anything, him dragging me to the golf course, going on a date night in town, hanging out with my girlfriends, seeing my family.”

Where would they go on a date night? “We've changed, it could be going to a restaurant we've seen on Instagram or TikTok, or we just go into the arcades, or to Putt Putt [a crazy golf and karaoke place], the dodgems. Something fun but competitive.”

She knows she's switched off, she says, when she's not in tennis clothes. “A lot of the time I'm in my Nikes, I love that and I've been with them pretty much my whole career, but getting out of my training kit is such a nice switch-off for me, knowing I'm in my casuals that day.”

Fashion is Boulter's other great passion, and may well end up being the primary one in the long term. “I love it. It's something I want to get into when I finish tennis. I want to run my own business, designing my own stuff. That'd be pretty cool,” she says.

Katie wears: Piqué jacket, £2,300, poplin shirt, £1,150, matching skirt, £1,290, metal belt, £1,100, calfskin belt, £510, suede shoes, £710, and silk socks, £290, all Miu Miu

“I love finding vintage pieces. I've got one of the oldest Loro Piana dresses, very traditional, very pleated. I resonate a lot with tradition, in tennis as well, with Wimbledon being my favourite. I find little boutiques around the world thanks to tennis, and love the feeling of finding something unique.”

For now, though, the athleisure years continue as tennis reigns. A lot of the players Boulter met and played with or against when she was a teenager have long since dropped out. They burnt too bright, played too hard, or simply fell through the cracks.

But Boulter, whose motto is “perseverance is everything”, is still on her steady, winding ascent. She has won titles, earned buckets of prize money, secured sponsorship deals and become a fan favourite, but a deep run in a Grand Slam tournament still eludes her. Now, with Queen's and Wimbledon in the offing, she plans to kick on again.

“The stars align for some people, they don't for others. But look at someone like [US player] Madison Keys, who won her first Grand Slam this year. She's 30, and could easily have quit a couple of years ago. But she persevered.”

Boulter smiles. “It's something I think about a lot. That's why it's my motto.”

            It's crunch time in Paris as we reach the business end of the French Open.
    


            World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka came through a battle against four-time winner and defending champion Iga Świątek to make the women's final where she will face American star Coco Gauff, who ended Lois Boisson's Cinderella story.
    


            Meanwhile, in the men's draw, Carlos Alcaraz defeated Italian star Lorenzo Musetti to make it to the final against world No. 1 Jannik Sinner.
    


            We look set for another memorable weekend of action on the iconic red clay of Roland Garros.
    


            Here's everything you need to know about one of the world's oldest tennis tournaments:
    


            Starting out as the “French Clay-Court Championships” in 1891 – allowing only players from France to compete – the French Open was officially created in 1925 when foreign players were first invited.
    


            In 1927, a new arena was purpose built for France's defense of its 1927 Davis Cup title and named after Roland Garros – not a sportsman, but a pioneering French aviator who was killed in World War I.
    


            The French Open is one of tennis' four grand slam tournaments along with Wimbledon, the US Open and the Australian Open – and the only one played on clay.
    


            But are the courts really made of clay? The answer is not much.
    


            Clay makes up just a small part of the tennis court, with 1-2 millimeters of crushed red bricks giving them their famous red hue.
    


            Playing on clay is considerably different to playing on grass or hard courts.
    


            Clay is more physically demanding as it is the slowest of the three surfaces, producing longer rallies, more running and more shots.
    


            Grueling five-set matches on clay can push players close to their physical limits.

Roland Garros: Why is clay the most difficult surface to play on?



            Matches on clay are also sometimes referred to as chess matches, where a well-placed shot can set up a winner two or three shots later.
    


            Clay also has considerably more friction than grass or hard courts, allowing the ball to grip to the dust and bounce much higher, in particular shots with heavy topspin.
    


            Even for a player as accomplished as Novak Djokovic, one of the sport's all-time greats, clay continues to be a tricky surface to master.
    


            “It's a very demanding surface,” Djokovic said after recently winning his first clay court match since completing the “Golden Slam” at the Paris Olympics.
    


            “We all know how tricky it is to play on clay; compared to the other surfaces, you always have to expect an extra one or two shots, balls coming back.”
    


            While Roland Garros is considered the pinnacle of the clay season, there are many other ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (Women's Tennis Association) tournaments played on the red dust.
    


            This year, there are 18 tournaments scheduled to be played on clay in the ATP Tour, while the women will play 11 clay court tournaments in 2025.
    


            But hard court is still the most popular surface on both tours in 2025. Hard court is also favored by US players as most of the American tournaments are played on that surface.
    


            While some smaller tournaments pay the male winner more than female players, all four grand slams offer equal prize money. The US Open was the first to award both tournament winners equal money in 1973 – something championed by Billie Jean King.
    


            The Australian Open followed suit 11 years later, offering men and women equal pay but reverted to paying men more in 1996. In 2001, they reversed course again and offered both men's and women's winners $440,000.
    


            Roland Garros implemented equal pay in 2006, and one year later Wimbledon committed to equal pay. Today, the four slams offer equal pay for each round of the draw.
    


            The last time Rafael Nadal – the most accomplished tennis player in history on clay – won the tournament was in 2023.
    


            In November 2024, the “King of Clay” played his final match of professional tennis when Spain lost in the Davis Cup. With 22 grand slams in his pocket – including a record 14 French Opens – we look at the new generation of tennis players who perform well on the red stuff.
    


            Will we ever see someone match Nadal's achievements on clay?
    


            What makes the French Open different to the other grand slams?
    


            With Paris being the fashion capital of the world, players have debuted some eye-catching outfits at Roland Garros.
    


            This year, Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen modeled a unique calf-length pleated skirt – inspired by Suzanne Lenglen's iconic style – though she said she is “too shy” to wear it on the court.

            However, the most famous of all the Roland Garros outfits has to be Serena Williams' superhero-esque ‘catsuit' she wore in 2018 just months after giving birth to her first child.
    


            The glitz and glamor of the tournament also draws celebrities from all walks of life, with singer/producer/composer Pharrell Williams, actor Ben Stiller and three-time Formula One world drivers champion Jackie Stewart among those in attendance last year.
    


            The French Open crowd is also known for being among the most boisterous on the tennis calendar.
    


            The famous chant taken from the pasodoble “En Er Mundo” can be heard across Roland Garros throughout the tournament's two weeks.
    


            Somebody in the crowd will sing “Popopopopopopo pololoooo!” with the rest of the arena responding with an: “Olééé!”
    


            We are guaranteed to see a brand new winner of the women's title – who will see their name etched in history this weekend: Sabalenka or Gauff?
    


            In the men's draw, can Alcaraz become the first man to go back-to-back since his idol Nadal in 2020 or will Sinner win his first French Open?

Novak Djokovic is yet to decide whether Friday's semifinal defeat against world No.1 Jannik Sinner would be his final appearance at Roland Garros.

The 24-time Grand Slam winner and three-time French champion was beaten in straight sets after missing three set points in the third.

"This could have been the last match ever I played here. I don't know," Serbian Djokovic told a press conference after losing 6-4 7-5 7-6(3). "That's why I was a bit more emotional even in the end.

"But if this was the farewell match at the Roland Garros for me in my career, it was a wonderful one in terms of the atmosphere and what I got from the crowd."

The 38-year-old was given a standing ovation by a roaring crowd as he exited Court Philippe Chatrier, bending down to touch the clay and saluting the fans.

He said he was planning to play at Wimbledon later this month as he is the US Open starting in August, with his focus firmly on the Grand Slams.

He refused, however, to commit to any tournaments beyond those two at this stage.

"At the moment I will try to stick with the plan what I had, which is play the Grand Slams. Those tournaments are the priorities of my schedule," he said.

"Wimbledon and US Open, yes, they are in plans. Those two, for sure. For the rest, I'm not so sure."

Djokovic had been in pursuit of a record 25th Grand Slam singles title in Paris. He is currently tied at 24 for most majors won, with Australian Margaret Court.

"I don't know really what tomorrow brings in a way at this point in my career," he said.

"Wimbledon is next, which is my childhood favourite tournament. I guess my best chances maybe are Wimbledon to win another Slam or faster hard court, maybe Australia or something like that.

"Twelve months at this point in my career is quite a long time. Do I wish to play more? Yes, I do. But will I be able to play in 12 months' time here again? I don't know. That's all I can say for the moment."

Djokovic last lifted the Musketeers' Cup in Paris in 2023, while his most recent Grand Slam triumph came at that year's US Open.

Since then, Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have combined to win the past five majors, and will make it a sixth after setting up their first Grand Slam final showdown.

There is only one infinity stone missing from the Jannik Sinner vs. Carlos Alcaraz collection. Five are already in place. They have faced each other in a Challenger, an ATP 250, an ATP 500, a Masters 1000, and a Grand Slam. Only a Grand Slam final showdown is missing from what is currently the best rivalry in tennis.That will finally change–and the proverbial the sixth stone will be added–when Sinner and Alcaraz battle for the French Open title on Sunday afternoon.Their biggest match of all marks their 13th meeting, with Alcaraz leading the head-to-head series 8-4 (7-4 on the main tour). The Spaniard is ahead 3-1 on clay (1-0 at Roland Garros) and he has won four straight overall against Sinner. In the semifinals 12 months ago, Alcaraz came back from several deficits to prevail 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. He most recently defeated the Italian 7-6(5), 6-1 in last month's Rome championship match.Of course, Sinner has a valid excuse for losing that one–as if anyone needs an excuse for getting beat by Alcaraz. Rome was the world No. 1's first tournament back from a three-month suspension, so he did well simply to reach the final. In Paris, however, anything less than the title would be a disappointment. After all, the 23-year-old is atop the rankings with room to spare and he is only eight matches away from a “Sinner Slam”–holding all four major trophies at the same time. His bid is alive and well following French Open victories over Arthur Rinderknech, Richard Gasquet, Jiri Lehecka, Andrey Rublev, Alexander Bublik, and Novak Djokovic. Nobody–not even Djokovic–has taken a set.

If anything short of lifting La Coupe des Mousquetaires would be a disappointment for Sinner, anything less than this showdown turning into an instant classic would leave tennis fans unfulfilled. Why should expectations be any lower than that? These are by far the two best players on tour, with Sinner sporting an 18-1 record this season while Alcaraz is the ATP leader in wins (36) and titles (three). The recent Monte-Carlo and Rome champion finds himself in yet another final after taking out Giulio Zeppieri, Fabian Marozsan, Damir Dzumhur, Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul, and Lorenzo Musetti.In this match and perhaps even extending into the grass-court swing, Sinner's ban could be a blessing in disguise. While everyone else was slogging away on the grueling clay-court grind, the best player in the world was resting up. Now, to the surprise of no one, he is ready to pounce.Alcaraz still might have an advantage in a marathon match, as the 22-year-old's five-set record is impeccable (12-1, including 2-0 in slam finals). Sinner, though, could be able to wrap this up before it gets to that point. It is true that Alcaraz's peaks are more altitudinous than Sinner's on clay, but the No. 2 seed's valleys are considerably lower. In a best-of-five struggle on clay, it's usually the player with a higher floor that comes out on top against a player with a higher ceiling.Look for Sinner to equal his rival with four major titles overall, putting himself one step away from the career slam–and the Sinner Slam.Pick: Sinner in 4    1042WWW: Sinner vs. Alcaraz?

WHO YA GOT?

Same

Carlos in 4 . Sinner avenging in Wimbledon Finals

Wasnt me

Both finals are intriguing and could go either way.
I like the point that Sinner has been more consistent ,Alcaraz too up and down.
Tries for too many winners and makes more errors. I think Djokovic would have done better against Alcaraz than Sinner , so Ill go for the Carrot in five.

yup, I think Djoker would have had (somewhat of) a chance against Alcaraz

Plus I like Sinner better than Alcaraz, he quieter and doesnt show off as much.

agreed!

Yep, a different draw could've had a very different outcome.

There's still a chance he will win another one.

Tough to predict, should go to 5 sets, Sinner would be the first Italian to win it since Adriano Panatta in 1976.

Meanwhile Djokovic will continue on his journey of delusion, still believing he can win another major…

he can win Wimby

he won't, but he can

Guest agree it's getting tougher for him as he's not getting any younger, he's still beating the lesser players, but finding it harder against the top players now, still he has could do a Sampras and have that 1 last hurrah, and eek out one more GS, it won't be easy but if anyone can he can

Sinner seems to be playing better than Alcaraz, having said that when Alcaraz gets his head straight he's the best there is on this surface, somebody said the next Rafa, wouldn't go that far just yet, but maybe Guga lol

A long way off but if he's still playing, probably the AO

Tennis is in great hands with the new era

Andy Roddick predicted Novak Djokovic's Wimbledon finish during his recent podcast episode. The Serb impressed in the latter half of the 2025 clay season, finishing with an ATP 250 title and semifinal exit at the French Open.

Djokovic has been inconsistent in the past year, making deep runs at several events while also exiting early in a few. However, the last month has been fruitful for him. He bagged his 100th ATP Tour-level title with a triumph in Geneva before heading to the 2025 French Open.

In Paris, the 24-time Grand Slam champion defeated unseeded players in straight sets in the first four rounds. Next, he got the better of World No. 3 Alexander Zverev 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 in the quarterfinal. World No. 1 Jannik Sinner stopped the Serb from advancing further with a 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(3) win in the semifinal.

During a short podcast episode, where Roddick recapped Day 13 of the French Open, the American made a bold prediction.

Roddick believes that Djokovic's semifinal run at Roland Garros has significantly boosted his chances at Wimbledon. He noted that the Serb has now found the right rhythm for a Grand Slam, avoiding the long gap that often left him questioning whether to enter smaller events that offered little motivation.

Andy Roddick heaped praise on Novak Djokovic following his semifinal loss at the French Open. The American highlighted the 38-year-old's relentless effort and love for the sport. Despite being down two sets and struggling to gain control in rallies against Jannik Sinner, Djokovic continued to fight with the same passion he displayed early in his career.

Roddick added that these moments of "limited upside" are, in some ways, even more impressive than Djokovic's dominating Slam wins, as they reflect a deep love for the game.

	Horror director Mike Flanagan has opened up about how his work has helped him deal with grief and loss.


	Closing the inaugural SXSW London before a premiere of his new movie The Life of Chuck, Flanagan said the creation of his Netflix series The Haunting of Hill House was a coping mechanism following a suicide in his family, which was part represented in the storyline of Nell Crain committing suicide in the show.


	“There are images in that that are dreams and nightmares I had during that time,” he said. “That show is me trying to deal with grief and loss. I'm going to be dealing with it forever but having a creative outlet to try and pour that into has been incredibly therapeutic and I hope it's therapeutic for people going through a similar situation to me.”

	Flanagan is best known for hit Netflix series The Haunting of Hill House and movies including Oculus, Gerald's Game and Doctor Sleep. He is also showrunning Amazon's upcoming TV version of Stephen King's Carrie.


	Fans have oft speculated that grief and suicide serve as central themes of The Haunting of Hill House, a show that was loosely based on the 1959 Shirley Jackson novel.


“Bias against horror”


	During a wide-ranging SXSW session, Flanagan said there is a “bias against horror” from audiences and the industry that resets when an award-winning project comes along. 

	











	He said there has always been a “misperception of what horror can be,” using the example of Jordan Peele's Oscar-winning work, which quickly legitimizes the genre before this is once again forgotten.


	“People outside the genre remain perpetually surprised that there is a really good story in here and it's not just about the scares,” he said. “But that's always been the case. Horror was always a popular genre in film but then the industry and some audiences tend to reset and be surprised again that it is just as dramatically viable, complex and beautifully artistic as any other genre.”


	Much of Flanagan's oeuvre has been adaptations of iconic horror scribe King's work and he is said to be working closely with King on a long-gestating adaptation of the Dark Tower series, while King has praised his projects in the past.


	For Flanagan, and perhaps surprisingly, King “is not a horror writer.” He described him as a “gooey-hearted, lovely humanist” who is “kind, fun and goofy.”


	“He writes emotional and empathetic stories about human nature and the horror elements are born organically out of the characters he creates,” added Flanagan. “It took me until my twenties to realize that [Stephen King novel] It is not about a shapeshifting clown, it's about kids and friendship.”


	To audience applause, Flanagan also made an impassioned plea for monologues to remain part of film as he argued that the auteur has to stay strong against the desires of the streamers and studios.


	“Monologue is a dying art but there is nothing more impressive than watching an actor completely change reality with just words,” he added. “I argue every time with the studio. They say they love it but ask if it could be half as long. But I love to watch it and want to push back against this cultural shift of low attention spans and bursts of entertainment.”


	Flanagan was speaking just before the The Life of Chuck‘s premiere on the final day of the inaugural SXSW London. The movie stars Tom Hiddleston as a man whose life is chronicled in reverse-chronological order and is seemingly having an impact on the world and universe around him. The Life of Chuck is less overtly horror than Flanagan's prior work, although it is also based on a King novel.

	With Netflix series Dept Q., Matthew Goode stars as DCI Carl Morck, a curmudgeonly cop afflicted by PTSD and almost Sherlock-level powers of deduction. Based on the novels by Jussi Adler-Olsen, which have also been made into a series of Danish-language films, the Netflix series is developed by and partially directed by Scott Frank, of The Queen's Gambit fame. Frank moves the action to Scotland, with Goode starring as the English outsider alongside such Scottish favorites as Kelly Macdonald, Chloe Pirrie, Mark Bonnar, Shirley Henderson and Kate Dickie. 


	As Morck reels from an incident that almost killed him and paralyzed his colleague DI Hardy (Jamie Sives) he finds himself sidelined to a ‘lost cause' basement cold case unit with his sidekicks Akram (Alexei Manvelov) and Rose (Leah Birne). Here, in a Zoom chat from his home in the U.K. with his wife and children making excellent background appearances, Goode reveals how Morck's mindset might have “infected” him, a favorite memory of working with the late, great Maggie Smith on Downton Abbey, and how he felt about his Robert Evans role in the making-of-The Godfather limited series The Offer, when not everyone loved that version of the story—least of all Coppola.

DEADLINE: When I heard about this show, I was beyond excited because I've read every book. I've seen all the films. I know you were told not to do that, but —


			Watch on Deadline		







GOODE: We weren't told. No, we weren't dictated to in that way. Scott [Frank] said, “I just think you'll find it more freeing not to be bound to something that sort of doesn't make any more sense because we've now brought it to Edinburgh and made you English.” But I met [the author] Jussi [Adler-Olsen] the other day for the first time.


DEADLINE: What was that like?


GOODE: He's charming. Lovely. I was quite scared, obviously, because I've done something probably not hugely different. But anyway, he loves it. He's thrilled with it. What a relief. Obviously Jussi gave Scott license to go ahead and change things in bits and bobs, which he really has, I suppose.

	











DEADLINE: Carl Morck is just one of my favorite characters. I'm addicted to any kind of detective story, but Carl really got me.


GOODE: So is there a big difference between what I did and the guy before?


DEADLINE: When I started watching I did wonder how you would do it, because in the original he's so Danish. That Scandinavian noir vibe is so central to the books and films, or so I had thought. But, seeing this version, there's a way about him that's also so British. So, I think it's like you're cousins in the way you do Carl, and nothing is lost and so much is gained by the Britishness. It's different, but in the right ways.


GOODE: This is such a wonderful company of actors. Even though I was the only English one, and they could have easily hated me, obviously with that lovely Scottish-English situation, it wasn't the case. And such great personalities, such great talent. And obviously I'm central to the story, so I get to work with everyone. I'd wanted to work with Shirley Henderson—‘Shenderson'—for years. And Kelly Mcdonald, and then this fairly relatively new actress, Leah Byrne, who is a revelation in this show. It's very difficult to be talking about some of the things that she has to talk about and make them hilarious. It's quite a staggering… Well, it's writing and talent, where they meet, I suppose. I love them all. That's why we're desperate to do a second season.


DEADLINE: I have zero doubts that you're going to get a second season, if not more. Would you do more than two?


GOODE: I don't know. There's 10 books now.


DEADLINE: When you sign on to something like this, there's always a future that could go on for quite a long time. Do you talk about that up front? I'm just wondering how long you're thinking.


GOODE: It is quite a modern phenomenon, really, as an actor, that you would get to sit in something for time. And now I think I'm at the right age that I'd like to have a character that I can come back to that has great, exciting, dark, hopefully funny stuff happening within the story, but also, how's this man going to change? Is he going to change? What will be something that will change him? Even if it's by minutia, there will be certain changes. Even if it's just my hair color or the girth of my beard.


DEADLINE: Yeah, the beard.


GOODE: Will I come back with a sheepskin jacket again?


DEADLINE: I love that jacket.


GOODE: I know. But you know what happens to me at the end, so we're unsure. Or does he go out and splurge and get another one?


DEADLINE: I don't know. Because I saw that jacket and I thought that jacket is probably about 800 pounds minimum. So I'm like, has he bought it from a vintage store or more likely, did his wife get it for him when they were together? And I think it's the last one.


GOODE: By the way, you're absolutely bang on. That was exactly I was thinking, because she's the one with the nice flat.


DEADLINE: He would never buy himself that coat ever. The beard thing I was really interested in, because it fits with Carl wanting to retreat, right? He wants to have this layer between him and everyone else.


GOODE: My wife hates it.


DEADLINE: Well, I was going to ask because the men that I've known that wear beards that always have that personality trait where they'd like to be left alone a little bit.


GOODE: Oh OK. So in the opening scene, it would've been possibly interesting to have him clean shaven.

	











DEADLINE: Right. Before things go so very wrong for him.


GOODE: He is someone that screams, “Don't come near me.” And my wife didn't come near me for six months because she hates beards. Absolutely hates them.


DEADLINE: Were you a bit infected by Carl's personality?


GOODE: I'm that person already, can't you tell? No. So basically, the job is going to do that to you anyway in the little ways when you are working that many hours. And also, you don't stop for six months because it's always a huge amount of dialogue to learn. So, you start off and you're two or three weeks ahead, I learned the first two scripts. I had those in. That was great. And then you've got to just keep learning. But you're filming through the day. So, then you get home, you're up at 3 in the morning. My routine was up at 3, run bath, get in bath, bath is cold because at 3 in the morning the heating hasn't come on. Awesome. Still getting in it. And I'm going learn my day's lines and then I'm going to go through and make sure that the next three weeks are still in there as well [one of his kids interrupts to hug him]. I've lost my train of thought. Oh and then make massive cafetiere of coffee which 12 people normally have. And my treat is Ken Burns documentaries. So, I started with baseball. [His wife Sophie Dymoke interrupts to hug him, then the conversation digresses to skincare, fond talk of the children, best North London pubs and how “sickeningly” handsome Jude Law is.]


DEADLINE: So in terms of embodying Carl, I know you spoke to an old friend who was a murder investigator. What did they tell you?


GOODE: He was on the murder squad over here. He became my driver. He got out of [the force] and was driving me around for a while on a particular film that I was doing. And it was amazing. It was fascinating. He'd tell me these stories. One of his first days he was told to go to this house and check because the owner hadn't been heard of for a while, as you can imagine. And he was like, “Oh, the curtains are closed.” And as he got up to the house, he was like, “Oh, those aren't curtains. Those are flies.”There were a lot of stories. And so actually, in some ways, like anything, they have an interesting sense of humor, some of those people because it's sort of a survival instinct.


DEADLINE: How did he specifically help you become Carl with his stories?


GOODE: Well, just the level of the detail that he would remember of a crime scene was what I always found fascinating. This is a guy who's able to recall so much. So that's part of it, the checklists that you go through as a detective. It's a science it in its own way. But it's the observation that needs to be done of any scene you come to. Then obviously, I then had to look into PTSD. I've had friends who've been in war zones. Some of them still. And f*cking terrifying jobs, some of these people have. But we've crossed paths, and we've remained in touch and I love them to death, but I wouldn't want that job.


DEADLINE: I hate to tell you this, but just based on the books, Carl's mental health does not really improve.


GOODE: Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm assuming he doesn't change very quickly.


DEADLINE: Well, most men don't, I find.


GOODE: Yeah. My wife's been waiting for me to grow up for years.


DEADLINE: That's a sidebar that we could talk about at length when your wife returns.


GOODE: I hope she doesn't make it back in time.

	











DEADLINE: I was obsessed with The Offer and I know it was always meant to be a limited series, but if that ever came up again, would you want to do Bob Evans again? What was so interesting too, is that Coppola came out and said, “That's not how it happened,” which might have felt quite scary to you?


GOODE: A lot people of did. It really angered some people. I was like, “Oh, come on. It's just a show. It's an adaptation, whatever it is.” So listen, it was terrifying because I was just minding my own business. I'd originally gone up for a part in that. No, not even gone up. I was asked to read for another part. I won't say which one. And I didn't hear anything. I was like, “Oh, right. OK. Well it's obviously going to be load of big stars, and blah, blah, blah and I'll still watch it because it was really good scripts.” And then I was playing golf on a golf course during the pandemic, for the first time in ages, and it was p*ssing down rain. And I got a call from all my agents just saying, “Dexter Fletcher has offered you Bob Evans.” I said, “What? Why? That's so weird.”


	I loved it. I was proud of myself for getting for the job. Again, not mucking it up and people liking it, which was great. But then there's a fear. Paramount's been going through a whole load of structural change, with people going out and going in, so I think that time [for another season] might have passed and I don't know if a series could take Bob being the center of it. I don't know if he could, because obviously the author was Miles' character [Albert Ruddy].


DEADLINE: I know why you are not doing the third Downton Abbey film. You had knee surgery and you've explained all that, but —


GOODE: It was a half-a-page scene.


DEADLINE: Were they going to kill you off?


GOODE: I spoke to Michelle [Dockery] at length about what we could possibly… I think we were going to try and ask for a slight rewrite or something or other. And then eventually it was just that they were moving ahead. It was a big racecourse day, so the thing was booked, and I was never going to be able to do it, which was a shame because I love that cast. To be on a set with Hugh [Bonneville] and Allen [Leech]. I've got great stories from those sets. We actually gave Maggie Smith one of the greatest days of her life, she said. She came off [set], and she said, “I think that might've been my favorite day on a set ever.”


DEADLINE: What did you do?


GOODE: It was the wedding of our characters, and we shot it out very secretively somewhere out in the countryside. I think in Oxford somewhere. And our green room for 20 actors was the garden of an ex-Concorde pilot. This is going to sound jolly unprofessional, and it is a bit unprofessional, but it's f*cking funny. He came out with a bottle of rosé and just put it on the table, a bottle of Minuty, which was a nice Aix-en-Province rosé. And obviously all the other actors, they looked at it and they're like, “No. Well, obviously we can't do that.” I'm just a bit naughty. I don't know if it's coming across or not. And it was really hot, and it was looking at me and the perspiration was rolling down the bottle and I said, “I'll have a glass, thank you so much.” And I sat and I quaffed it bloody quickly. And I said, “Is it OK if I have another one?” And then you started to see all the other actors, particularly the ones that didn't have any lines that day, just a big ensemble piece, none of us had that much to do, really. So we all started drinking. We went through 22 bottles of rosé. No one was drunk. But my god, were we merry. And if you've made Maggie Smith happy, then it can't be wrong. He was a gentleman and it was a gorgeous house and gorgeous garden as well. And also we gave them good stories because then suddenly they've got a ton of half-cut, quite famous people in their garden having great fun. So, they've got anecdotes for the rest of their life. I wouldn't do it again though for any future producers listening.

	











DEADLINE: No, of course not. I know this is the final Downton film, but if there was a spinoff, would you ever do it?


GOODE: Ultimately, it's a very difficult thing to balance. And if you think about Mary [Dockery] I was sad I wasn't going to go and do it because it would've been a giggle. But when you think about it in the terms of she's a modern feminist, a feminist icon, Lady Mary. Wouldn't it be great if something surprising happened to her? I don't know, I didn't read the script. I only had the page that they sent me. So, let's hope that someone from her past, the people who Downtonites adore, like a Charles Blake or someone like that. There are a lot of people that loved Charles Blake for her. If he comes back and scoops her up. Or, she doesn't need a man. You know what I mean? Why does she need a man? Why can't she just be Lady Mary? And why can't she keep a harem of men? Use them for sex and then get back on the tractor?


DEADLINE: Right? That was who she was when we met her. She didn't need a man.


GOODE: Yeah. She was killing men when we first met her.

The cancellations and postponements come weeks before his scheduled performance at Glastonbury.

	Mitchell Peters



Rod Stewart has canceled additional U.S. tour dates as he continues to recover from the flu.


	On Saturday (June 7), the 80-year-old music icon announced on social media that he is canceling four concerts and rescheduling two others due to ongoing health concerns.


	“I have to cancel and reschedule my next six concerts in June as I continue to recover from the flu,” Sir Rod wrote on Instagram. “So sorry my friends. I'm devastated and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience to my fans. I'll be back on stage and will see you soon.”


	Three of the canceled shows (June 7, 8 and 10) were part of his Las Vegas residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Another canceled show in Nevada was set for June 14 in Lake Tahoe. Two California dates — Rancho Mirage on June 12 and Paso Robles on June 15 — have been rescheduled for Sept. 20 and 21, respectively.

	











	Earlier in the week, Stewart — who received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2025 American Music Awards in May — had already postponed his June 1 and June 5 shows at Caesars Palace, citing an unspecified illness.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Looking ahead, the “Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?” singer is scheduled to return to his native U.K. for a high-profile appearance on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival on June 29. He recently revealed that he'll be joined by Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, reuniting their classic 1960s–1970s band Faces.


	Other 2025 Glastonbury headliners include The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo.

	











	Following Glastonbury, Stewart will return to North America in July, performing across the U.S. and Canada before resuming his Las Vegas residency in late September. After that, he's set for a run of South American dates before heading to Europe to finish out the year.

	On Friday, the 81st anniversary of D-Day, Casey and his band took to the stage on the National Mall, the headline act as several politicians and activists rallied thousands of veterans in a march on Washington D.C.


	Ostensibly, the rally — organized by an array of veterans groups and backed by labor unions, such as the AFL-CIO — was a non-partisan protest against proposed cuts to veterans benefits and to the federal workforce, including at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).


	In reality, it was an expression of rage against President Donald Trump and his MAGA agenda.


	“I think there's a lot of people in America that think this is a fight between the far right and the far left. And it's not,” Casey tells Rolling Stone. 


	It is impossible to make substantial cuts to the government without disproportionately impacting veterans, who make up nearly 25 percent of the federal workforce, but only five percent of employed Americans as a whole. The VA alone is facing losses of nearly 83,000 jobs, as proposed by the department's secretary, Doug Collins — about 18 percent of its total workforce.

	“When we join the military, we take an oath to this country. And they, in turn, promise certain benefits if we serve,” says Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, which represents about 750,000 government workers across the country. “If you start attacking those workers that provide the services to the veteran then you are attacking, indirectly, the veteran.”

	











	Kelley says his members are keenly watching as lawsuits contesting job cuts make their way through the courts: “They're saying that they want us to continue to stay in this fight. They are very relieved that the courts are seeing that these decisions are not rational, and that they are not in accordance with our Constitution.”

	“We are winning some of these battles, but that's not where we want to be. We want to be winning the war,” he says.


	As the rally warmed up, Rolling Stone caught up with Casey.


	“The facts are that the Trump presidency and all those involved are disrespecting the vets. And that's my opinion. And we're going to sing about it,” Casey tells Rolling Stone. His gentle voice purrs with an unmistakable Boston accent as he sits on a shady bench in the sweltering heat. “We all know what's caused us to be here.”


	“People are slowly waking up to it. I do think that the Trump plan of just throwing so much shit at the wall does work. It makes people just want to put their head in the sand,” he says.


	A young woman nearby, who this reporter later learns also hails from Boston but encountered the protest by accident, curiously eyes the 56-year-old punk rocker — with his old-school sailor tats, dapper black outfit, and neatly trimmed crewcut — and his interlocutor. She strains to listen in without being rude — it's not every day a founding member of one of your hometown's iconic bands plops down beside you to talk politics with a reporter, after all.


	“I think that that's part of what keeps the moderates away, and part of it is that ‘It's not affecting me personally right now,' and that's why that famous old statement from, I forget who said it: ‘First they came for the trade unionists, and then they came for me,'” Casey says, summarizing a confessional-turned-poem by Martin Niemöller, a Lutheran pastor imprisoned by the Nazis, of which there are many versions.

	It's not the first time on this day that Rolling Stone hears a direct reference to the Nazis, or the rise of totalitarian political ideologies in the 1920s and 30s — fascism on the right, and communism on the left. The organizers of the rally, a recently established non-profit called the Unite for Veterans Coalition, likens their movement to the “Bonus Army” of 1932 — a group of World War I veterans who took to the streets amid the Great Depression to get cash payments that had been promised to them — and talk admiringly about Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, a legendary U.S. Marine who was instrumental in crushing a clumsy fascist coup attempt against President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933.

	











	Here, now, in Washington D.C. on the anniversary of Operation Overlord, many veterans consciously sought to evoke that past — summoning the days when America had offered the lives of its citizenry to defeat a dictator.


	“Dad Fought Fascism in Europe,” one man's sign says. “We Will Fight it Here.” A woman holds another: “My Grandpa Fought Nazis.”


	Two men carry flags with three downward pointing arrows, one saying “American Iron Front” on it. This reporter asks Kris, the Navy veteran holding it, what the flag represents. He says that he is part of a local anti-fascist chapter, formed during the first Trump administration.


	He is aware that the Iron Front was a political paramilitary that fought the Nazis, among other forms of totalitarianism: The three downward pointing arrows are generally considered to represent opposition to Nazism, Communism, and Monarchism.


	One of the lessons of that era is that political extremism, fueled by proliferating violence and a masculinity crisis among young men, can create the conditions for the failure of a democracy.


	It forms part of the rationale for why the veterans who organized the rally say they are focused on cultivating a non-partisan, moderate movement. The fight to claim the political allegiance of veterans is, after all, a proxy battle in the war for the future of the American Republic — and both sides get a vote when it comes to war.


	Veterans largely voted in favor of Trump during the 2024 election, perhaps 60 percent to 40 percent. While Trump and his supporters may be ceding some of that ground by cutting veterans benefits, others are waiting to build movements around the political legitimacy supposedly conferred by veteran status.


	Far-right extremists have been omnipresent throughout modern American history, and veterans are a natural target for cultivation by ideologues. Right-wing paramilitary groups like the Three Percenters are explicitly aimed at veterans and law enforcement, while groups like the Proud Boys or Patriot Front adopt the language, dress, and symbolism of the War on Terror-era military. What is common to all of them is the implied threat of violence against dissent, and a willingness to take to the streets.


	Political violence is nothing new, and a number of the veterans who spoke to Rolling Stone fear that civil unrest will be used as a pretext for a government crackdown on liberties, perhaps even used in an attempt to justify martial law.

	











	Other vets were at the rally to protest job cuts inflicted by Trump and Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. A thirtysomething former Marine mortarman who asked to be identified only as Andrew says that he lost his job at the Veterans Administration due to the DOGE cuts. He traveled from Michigan to show up at the protest.


	“I wasn't really political before,” Andrew says. “Like, everyone knows when you're the one liberal in an infantry battalion, but back then I didn't give politics much thought.”


	“Now, I'm fucking furious. I'll show up for anything,” he says.


	Damian Bonvouloir graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1978, and served in the Navy until 1986. He describes generations of family that had served in the military or in federal jobs, proudly counting them on his fingers as he shouts their relationship and role, while the Dropkick Murphys take to the stage. Bonvouloir carries a sign with a shamrock and the words: “Who'll stand with us?”


	That is a reference to “Who Will Stand with Us,” a new single which in the band's promotional material is described as “an urgent call to action to stand up against division and inequality.”


	“So here we are on D-Day today, and it's like everything that so many of our grandparents fought for — you're willing to just walk away from that, because you feel like the world's too ‘woke?' What? How did you do the math there? Like, what do you care if someone else wants to be woke?” Casey says. “Was it really worth it to surrender the democracy of the country, just so you could feel a little more like you had your guy win? It just doesn't add up.”


	Casey tries to put his money where his mouth is. Last month, he traveled to Ukraine as part of a mission to deliver desperately needed ambulances and medical aid. He sees the conflict there as part of the same fight that brought the veterans to the National Mall. “People over there are defending democracy, and people over here are defending democracy,” he tells Rolling Stone.


	The Dropkick Murphys new album, For the People, comes out on July 4 on the band's own label. There's a lot of energy and anger, and much of it is clearly political. But Casey is hesitant to describe it as a protest album: “Not every song is directly in relation to what's going on. But I think even when you're writing music that doesn't directly relate, the times shape that music.”

	











	“There's a song on that album about the day my father died when I was a kid, that I never thought I'd write,” he says. “And I'm just saying… maybe you get to the point where you don't take for granted that you'll be making music in the future, and maybe the times just make you feel an urgency for everything in your life.”


	At the rally, one of the biggest responses from the crowd was for a punk cover of the bluegrass song “Dig a Hole in the Meadow,” an anti-fascist anthem from 1927, popularized by Woody Guthrie and others:


“Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow. Dig a hole in the cold, cold ground. Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow. We're gonna lay you fascists down.”

	Clearly a band whose eleventh album was titled This Machine Still Kills Fascists, is unapologetic about both its politics and its embrace of America's early anti-fascist traditions.


	“I just feel when people say now, like, ‘Shut up and sing!' — whatever. I feel OK. We've been going for 30 years with the same message,” Casey says. “Listen, if you're a punk band and you can't write good angry music in these times… Then something ain't working, you know what I mean?”

When Michel Smith Boyd won the sixth season of “Rock the Block” with his teammate, longtime HGTV star Alison Victoria, the Atlanta-based designer made history as the first person to win the hit competition series twice. Boyd also won season four of the intense renovation challenge in 2023, alongside his former “Luxe For Less” co-star Anthony Elle. 

But as fans celebrated Boyd's history-making win on social media, many also lamented that the interior designer hadn't appeared on his own HGTV show since early 2023, in the first and only season of “Luxe For Less.” With no word on plans for Boyd's show to return in 2025, a fan petition is now collecting signatures to urge the network to re-launch Boyd's show. 

A post shared by Tracy Twinkie Byrd (@iamtwinkiebyrd)

Before season four of “Rock the Block” aired in early 2023, Boyd's new HGTV show “Luxe For Less” premiered on December 1, 2022. In the freshman series, he and his creative team — including Anthony Elle, the designer who was his teammate during his first “Rock the Block” win — employed “clever budget hacks to help homeowners create luxurious renovations without stretching their bank accounts,” per HGTV. But since the first season aired, the show's future has been in limbo, with no announcement of a renewal. 

On June 1, 2025, Boyd posted screenshots from a Country Living article about him winning “Rock the Block” again, and he wrote, “((It's the last quote for me)) ‘Give this king his show back! #LuxeForLess @hgtv'”

Fans flooded his comment section with support, including someone who wrote, “Exactly and we need like 12 episodes per season too.” Boyd replied, “Can a brother get a dozen!?”

Two days later, film and TV casting director Tracy “Twinkie” Byrd, took matters into her own hands, tagging Boyd in an Instagram post and announcing that she'd started a petition on Change.org to bring back “Luxe For Less.” Boyd shared the post in his Instagram stories and wrote, “Wowwwwww” 

Describing the goal of the petition, Byrd wrote on Change.org, “In a world where black culture is consistently thriving, pushing boundaries, and setting new trends, it's disheartening to witness moments where black voices and talents are sidelined. HGTV's remarkable show ‘Luxe for Less' is a beacon of this very creativity and excellence.” 

Byrd also argued, “The absence of ‘Luxe for Less' on our screens isn't just a missing television show; it's a gap in the representation and acknowledgment of black creatives who shift the cultural landscape forward. HGTV has the chance to set a precedent, to make a statement that creativity knows no boundaries of color, and that the contribution of black talents is not only valued but essential.”

A post shared by MICHEL SMITH BOYD (@michelboyd)

At the time of publication on the morning of June 7, the petition had collected 260 verified signatures. HGTV has not responded to EntertainmentNow's request for comment on the petition or the future of “Luxe For Less.”

Fans have been voicing their hope for HGTV to reinstate the show in posts across social media, including on Facebook, where one fan who shared the petition on June 5 wrote, “If you love all things home interior, design on a dime, etc. join me in advocating for Michel Smith Boyd to get his show Luxe for Less back on the air. Besides being a gifted creative, he is a 2x champion of HGTVs Rock the Block home renovation show. Show your support by adding your name below.”

On June 6, another fan tweeted, “I have been on here in a minute but @hgtv you all HAVE to bring the show Luxe for Less BACK! @michelboyd and his team were absolutely AMAZING! One of the most entertaining shows you've ever had. Their expertise and personalities were top notch!”

Boyd has noticed and shared his gratitude for all the love shown to him and his show. On June 3, he wrote in his Instagram Stories, “…these ‘bring back #LuxeForLess' posts/petitions have me blushing like 🥰❤️ Thank you. I'm grateful.”

	Despite his decades of critically-acclaimed experience in motion pictures, Martin Scorsese knows when to stay in his lane.


	After the Oscar-winning director played himself in the premiere episode of the Apple TV+ series The Studio, co-creators and executive producers Alex Gregory and Evan Goldberg said Scorsese “was unbelievable” in his cameo but refused to step on anyone's toes.


	“He had one note, but he didn't give it until later,” Gregory told People of the episode directed by Goldberg and star Seth Rogen.

	“There was a moment where him and Charlize Theron were whispering to each other, and it took like 10 takes to get the shot,” recalled Goldberg. “And then we got it and I was like, ‘What were you whispering about?' He was like, ‘I knew you were doing this wrong, but I didn't wanna be a backseat director, so I just didn't say anything.' And I was like, ‘Well, we could have used that time, but I appreciate that you didn't wanna manhandle us.'”

	











	Gregory said they were “all pretty shocked Martin Scorsese was in the show,” as Goldberg praised him, “I think unanimously we would say Martin Scorsese as an actor was unbelievable.”


	“The fact that he actually showed up, 'cause we kept thinking, ‘He's gonna cancel. It's too amazing. It's too special. He's just the best,'” added Goldberg.


	In The Studio‘s March 26 debut episode ‘The Promotion', newly crowned Continental Studios head Matt Remick (Rogen) pursues Scorsese's passion project about the Jonestown massacre while shepherding a conflicting Kool-Aid movie.

George Clooney is proud of his former “E.R.” co-star Noah Wyle for the success of the Apple TV+ series “The Pitt.” In an appearance on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” June 3, Clooney said he and Wyle had been “dear friends” since shooting their own medical drama.

“He is just the most honorable, talented young man,” Clooney said. “I get to say [that] because I'm an old man and I cannot be happier for his success on the show. The show is just a beautiful show, and he does just a great job with it.”

Wyle is leading many major predictions in the Emmy nominations race for the Best Actor in a Drama Series. Wyle discussed the success of “The Pitt” with Yahoo! earlier this year.

“[It'] extremely gratifying,” he said. “I keep asking my son, where are all these conversations taking place? He's like, ‘Dad, you're not on Reddit.' I don't even know how to find that, so for me, gauging impact has been extremely tricky, except for my own circle of friends and family and what I get from the medical community. It's fucking great. Are you kidding! [laughs] I'm thrilled that this show that we put so much heart into is resonating the way that it is.”

 










Clooney, meanwhile, is appearing in Broadway's “Good Night, and Good Luck,” based on the 2005 film he wrote with Grant Heslov. The Oscar-winning star, who made his Broadway debut with the show, is nominated for Best Actor in a Play at the Tony Awards. The ceremony will air Sunday, June 8, at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.

CNN and HBO Max will air a live performance of the play “Good Night, and Good Luck” at 7 p.m. ET the night before. Clooney told Deadline that his “E.R.” experience will come in handy for the performance.

“I have a little bit of a history with doing live television,” Clooney said. “I talked NBC into doing ‘E.R.' as a live show, and then I did a live movie called ‘Fail Safe' for CBS. Saturday is a good night for us because it's our last evening performance. Our run is over so it's not costing the play anything anymore. Why don't we open it up and show people how fun it is to come to New York to see a play?”

“The Pitt” is now streaming on HBO Max.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM: Refresh for more and chart….One of the most intriguing yet mindboggling dynamics in moviegoing is that which prevents audiences from getting off the couch, even when the word of mouth out there is great on a movie. 


	Such is the dilemma this morning for Lionsgate‘s John Wick off-shoot Ballerina which won't budge from its industry $25.5M projection even after an A- CinemaScore, one of the best in the Wick franchise. Lionsgate is seeing the movie in the $25.5M-$27.5M range. While that grade for the Len Wiseman directed movie is under the franchise's best in show, John Wick: Chapter 4‘s A, it's well above the original John Wick‘s B, and in the same great company as John Wick 2 & 3 which also nabbed A-s. Friday for the Ana de Armas movie was $10.65M including previews. 

	











	It's clear that a portion of the John Wick faithful love this movie (I had zero patience for it, more on that later), but Ballerina isn't showing signs of jumping into its forecasted $30M+ rafters. Again, it's not a good sign for any studio when you show up on tracking at point A, and drop to point B or C. This happened recently with Karate Kid: Legends. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Why aren't more people going? 


	There's something to be said that when the movie popped on tracking three weeks ago, respondents were upbeat that the movie was “From the World of John Wick”, but when they looked closer noticed that Keanu Reeves wasn't entirely in the movie. Lionsgate made it obvious in their marketing that Reeves is in the film, and even featured him in one of their one sheets. 


	One film finance source yelled at me yesterday about the less-than-expected Ballerina performance, “If their exits were so great, why the hell was the review embargo lift so late?!” The review embargo lift was on Wednesday, June 4, the day before previews began. In addition, John Wick: Chapter 4 launched and teed off its excitement at SXSW, and that festival crowd would have embraced and screamed out praise of Ballerina if it was there. SXSW could have used another cool fanboy film this year. 

	











	There's also the sense that many have already seen these girl-with-the-gun movies before, and there are plenty of copycats on streaming (i.e. Charlize Theron's The Old Guard, Gal Gadot's Heart of Stone, Jennifer Lopez's The Mother) — so why rush out? But this one is through the lens of John Wick, and ya know, stunts! But you can't just swap out our favorite puppy loving, gun toting, surfer dude for a female lead, and that's potentially why more of the Wick faithful aren't going. In full confession, I walked out of Ballerina (and I did walk back in for the ending). It was too wash, rinse, repeat in the fisticuffs and bang-bang, and there isn't a biplane scene. This wasn't Nic Winding Refn, John Woo or Ari Aster's version of Ballerina. I noticed fireflies at the Chinese Theater during the screening and chased them out to the lobby. However, my cynicism aside, what matters more to me is the overall worth of motion picture commerce, and if there are movies that I don't like, which rise to the top and beat the odds at the box office, well then, I'm an absolute champ of that, and drop dead fascinated by it.  


	Funny enough, Ballerina in its Russian dancers turned assassins feature is similar to another feature from Lionsgate Hunger Games alums Francis Lawrence and Jennifer Lawrence, 2018's Red Sparrow, however, the de Armas movie is opening higher than that one which 20th Century Fox couldn't figure out at a $16.8M start. 


	Also, as we mentioned, Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning with its submarine and biplane stunts and the whole scheduled viewing by moviegoers for the best seats in Imax isn't doing Ballerina any favors with a third place and third weekend of $14.8M. Granted, Mission: Impossible is older skewing at 62% over 25 to Ballerina‘s 45% over 35, but there's overlap in that both are 63% and 37% male/female, and also with men over 25 (Ballerina at 49%, Mission at 52%) and women over 25 (Ballerina 27% and Mission 32%). 


	I believed back at CinemaCon, Ballerina would have had a better place on the calendar earlier in the year before A Minecraft Movie when we were starving for product. However, the reason why the movie is here in the first weekend of June was due to Reeves' availability on the press tour. As we reported during the preview, while $25M may internally not be the right number for Lionsgate execs and the industry, but exhibition isn't crying: There's meat in the marketplace and this weekend is coming in at $115.5M, +11% a  year ago when Sony's Bad Boys: Ride or Die (which that studio took credit on reviving the sluggish summer box office) opened to $56.6M. In hindsight, Ballerina is better here in its counterprogramming than during the desert days. The industry can be grateful, and there's more hits ahead this summer in Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth and Warner Bros' Superman. 


	Geniuses of box office at the studios shrug their shoulders and observe that this is as good as it gets with solo female action movies; this movie was never expected to do John Wick business (it's only beating the original's $14.4M start), and was always expected to be in line with Furiosa ($26.3M 3-day) and Alita: Battle Angel ($28.5M 3-day). 


	Speaking of Furiosa, she had a similar dilemma in her marketing to Ballerina: You can't just swap out an iconic action hero (Mad Max) for another, and the execution looked very similar to previous installments, which isn't provoking more to flock.  

	











	Note, pre-streaming era, girl with a gun movies did do much better, i.e. Angelina Jolie's Wanted ($50.9M), Scarlett Johansson's Lucy ($43.8M), however, there was a $20M range in Quentin Tarantino's cult classic Kill Bill Vol. 1 ($22.2M), all unadjusted for inflation.  


	It's been a while since Lionsgate had a big a tentpole (arguably since November 2023's Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes), and Ballerina was very important to them that they wanted to delay the film for additional shoots, and get John Wick architect Chad Stahelski's hands in the movie to get this right. We can't deny that they pushed the movie with a $45M domestic P&A. Hell, they created (count 'em) 27 one sheets for the movie, and that type of quantity shows a studio's commitment to a movie's marketing. de Armas has been working it since CinemaCon. However, something isn't bringing horses to water. Maybe tonight.  


	Disney's Lilo & Stitch continue to be monsters at the box office with a $33M estimated third weekend after a $9.3M third Friday. 


	Chart is coming…


FRIDAY EARLY EVENING: Currently, many have Ballerina in the mid-$20M range, but Lionsgate believes there's a potential path to $30M at 3,409 theaters.


	Nobody in distribution land wants to a see a movie with great exits underperform. We need all the wins we can get. Ballerina is a R-rated movie, and the audiences for those always come out at night. What's hard here is that this spinoff came on tracking three weeks ago at $35M+, so if it eases to mid-$20Ms, eeesh. Friday, including $3.5M previews, is just under $11M.


	I'm hearing now the production cost was in the low-$90M net range, more than 60% of that funded by foreign sales. Given that this is part of the crown jewel John Wick franchise, Lionsgate was determined to make the best movie possible, hence the year delay, hence the additional photography. With an estimated $45M P&A spend Stateside, iSpot shows that close to 38% was spent on NBA Finals spots, and those go for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ya can't say that Lionsgate didn't push Ballerina out in the limelight, not to mention Ana de Armas has been promoting in Dwayne Johnson-like fashion since CinemaCon, all over social, etc.


Ballerina has just under 1,000 PLF auditoriums.

	It's a stacked summer, and this male-skewing action movie is in the wake of Paramount/Skydance's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, which has a firm hand on Imax screens, heading to a $14M (-49%) third weekend in third place at 3,496. That's better than Dead Reckoning‘s $10.6M third sesh. Running cume by Sunday is $148.2M.


	As we mentioned all along this week, No. 1 is Disney's to lose as Lilo & Stitch is seeing a third weekend of $32M-$34M after a $9M-$10M third Friday at 4,185 theaters. Running cume is between $335M-$337M.


	Fourth is Sony's Karate Kid: Legends at 3,859 sites. The pic is seeing $2.3M in its second Friday with a second weekend in the $9M range, -56%. Ten day running cume is $35.7M.


	Fifth is Focus Features' second-weekend wide expansion of The Phoenician Scheme, which jumped from six locations in NYC and L.A. to 1,678 theaters with a second Friday of $2.5M and second weekend of $5.7M. Currently, Wes Anderson's second weekend isn't as high as his Asteroid City, which landed at $9M in 2023. We'll see where this goes. Four stars, 81% positive and a good 62% definite recommend from a crowd that's 64% under 35, mostly guys at 57%.

	











FRIDAY AM UPDATE, after exclusive: Lionsgate is reporting $3.75M for the previews to Thunder Road's John Wick spinoff Ballerina. That number is from Wednesday and Thursday shows.


	The Rotten Tomatoes audience score stands at 93%, equal to 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4‘s which is best in the Keanu Reeves franchise.


Ballerina‘s audience score also is higher than previous solo femme action movies Furiosa (88%, 2024) and Alita: Battle Angel (91%, 2019).


	Exits on PostTrak were excellent Thursday night with a 79% definite recommend. Again, that's the fans, but it speaks volumes; we've said this before, but with the Comscore/Screen Engine polling service, “definite recommend” carries more weight than the positivity score which is 87%, still very good. This should bode well for Ballerina prancing past $30M. Men showed up to the guns-blazing ballet Thursday night at 61%. Best definite recommend and positive scores came from women over 25, who showed up at 29% and gave it an 83% and 90%, respectively.


Ballerina takes place during the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum and follows orphaned Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas), who is beginning her training in the assassin traditions of the Ruska Roma. Her father died at the hands of Gabriel Bryne's The Chancellor. She's as mad as hell, and she's not going to take it anymore.

	Social media org RelishMix says: “Convo on Ballerina is running positive for action fans excited to see one of their favorite franchises expand in glorious fashion. The cast is the cause of a lot of the film's positive sentiments including Ana de Armas, who has gained a lot of good will in other roles, and the promise of a returning Keanu Reeves as John Wick. Some comments are, ‘I love Ana de Armas, and I'm so excited to see her doing this kind of film after No Time to Die. She was the best Bond Girl!' and ‘I didn't actually expect Keanu to show up in the movie, glad he is gonna be in it!' plus, ‘Did I spy Norman Reedus? Between Ian McShane, Keanu, and the legendary Mr. Lance Reddick‘. Many are pleased with the direction of this film and the action spotlighted in the trailer, sharing, ‘I was wondering if they were going to do a spinoff with the dancers! This looks EPIC!!!' and, ‘I really hope that this is the start of a trilogy.'”


	RelishMix also notes that Reedus has the most social media followers from the Ballerina cast with his activated 19.2M, and de Armas has 15M fans, while Reeves is still off the grid for his movies.


	And as we told you Thursday night, it was imminent that Disney's Lilo & Stitch would cross $300M at 4,410 theaters, the second movie to do so YTD at the domestic B.O. after Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie. The hybrid/live-action feature take on the 2002 Disney toon made $5M Thursday, -7% from Wednesday, for a second week of $86.1M and a running total of $303.1M. Lilo & Stitch is expected to reign again with a third weekend of $35M.


	Rest of the top five for the week is as follows:


	2.) Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (Par) 3,861 theaters, Thu $2.3M (-10% from Wed), Wk $38.9M (-59%), Total $134.2M/Wk 2


	3.) Karate Kid: Legends (Sony) 3,809 theaters, Thu $1.2M (-10%), Wk $26.7M, Wk 1


	4.) Final Destination Bloodlines (NL) 3,134 theaters, Thu $1.M (-11%), Wk $16.1M (-48%), Total $117M, Wk 3

	











	5.) Bring Her Back (A24) 2,449 theaters, Thu $675K (-12%), Wk $10.4M, Wk 1 


EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us tonight that the John Wick spinoff Ballerina is looking to do around $3.5M-$4M in previews. That's all in, including Wednesday fan screenings that started at 7 p.m. as well as Thursday showtimes that began at 6 p.m.


	The hope is that the $80M-$90M Lionsgate production gets to north of $30M, which, as we told you, is around where recent female solo action movies openings live at the box office, read Furiosa ($26.3M 3-day last year) and 2019's Alita: Battle Angel ($28.5M 3-day in 2019).


	The Len Wiseman-directed spinoff produced by Thunder Road is expected to rank second behind Disney's third weekend of Lilo & Stitch, which is looking to make around $35M; that movie crosses $300M today.


Ballerina was delayed a year to undergo additional photography.  


	Upside on Ballerina is that Thursday night fans are enjoying the Ana de Armas movie with a Keanu Reeves cameo, giving a 94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes — as of this minute, that's higher than any John Wick RT popcorn score; John Wick: Chapter 4 received a 93% in 2023. Critically, even though Ballerina is 72% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, it's not as high as the John Wick movies, which had film review scores ranging from 86%-94% certified fresh.


Ballerina‘s all-in preview cash is on par with the Thursday preview box office of Furiosa ($3.5M) and higher than the $2.4M Tuesday night preview cash of Alita: Battle Angel. Essentially, the thinking is to comp Ballerina to female solo action movies instead of John Wick movies. Female solo action movies are a completely different subgenre and don't always attract the full-on male audience that typically attends an action movie with a male leading star.


	Still, Ballerina‘s combined preview cash is higher than the Thursday night of 2017's John Wick 2 ($2.2M) but far under both 2019's John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum ($5.9M, ) and 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4 ($8.9M, best preview cash in franchise).


	We'll have more updates as they happen Friday morning. Lionsgate didn't return our request for comment.

	In 1994, my parents finally went to see The Rolling Stones. The group released Voodoo Lounge, their twentieth album, in July that year, and immediately began touring it. In August, they came to East Rutherford, New Jersey, to play at a football stadium, and my mom and dad decided it was the right time to check a major show off their bucket list. The moment represented an inflection point for the group. It was the first album the Stones had released in five years and was met with a degree of skepticism. They were firmly in middle age, three decades into their career, and had seemingly come to the realization many sixties era Boomer artists were waking up to: Their largely middle class, middlebrow audience had grown up along with them, and were liquid enough financially to pay exorbitant prices for shitty seats to see the band that had eluded them for so long, even if there was rampant speculation the group was washed, and on the downside of their primes. 


	The Stones were on my mind last night at Lil Wayne's Madison Square Garden concert, because it's been 28 years since the Hot Boys released their debut album, Get It How U Live It! on an independent New Orleans based rap label that called itself Cash Money Records, nearly the same span of time between the Rolling Stones' debut in 1964, and the Voodoo Lounge Tour.

	











	Wayne's show last night, and the venue itself, was a hard booking to figure out, and made complete sense. Wayne has circled New York, a city with a sacred and tortured place in his heart, the entirety of his career. It's where he found his muses in Jay-Z and the Diplomats in the 2000s, as well as where he served an eight-month prison sentence at the peak of his fame and his artistic powers, in Rikers Island over a possession of a loaded weapon charge in 2007. And yet, here he was holding a glorified album release party in the world's most famous arena, ostensibly the first leg of a North American Carter VI tour that opens here the first week in June, but won't resume until the very end of July.

	The album we had all gathered to celebrate, two hours past the advertised start time for the show, is quite simply a fucking disaster. Tha Carter VI is the work of an artist who either doesn't have a creative team around him capable of pushing back on his worst and most indulgent impulses, or one unwilling to listen to dissenting voices. And in lieu of that lack of editorial process, its author has clearly misplaced, if not permanently lost, his once unimpeachable grip on his true north. Since Carter VI was released on Friday at midnight, my timeline's been ablaze with fans, former fans, and haters chiming in on what exactly had gone so terribly wrong.


	And yet the electrified Garden crowd was stuffed to the bleeds by the time Wayne hit the stage just after 10, strutting to the stage with a white electric rockstar axe, sporting blonde dreads, pink sweats tucked into heeled knee high boots, an oversized heavyweight Britney Spears T-shirt with her name in neon pink script, a chunky scarf, a bejeweled grill, white framed sunglasses—which would be subsequently swapped out for glasses so big each lens threatened to blot out Wayne's face—and a frozen wrist and neck, rocking doubled iced out crucifix chains and an iced out crucifix pinky ring to go with an iced out wallet chain and a slowly burning late-90s-sized blunt hanging out of a corner of his mouth. 


	There was a minimal stage show behind him: A steeply pitched platform behind the rapper with the Roman Numerals “I” and “V' glowing, garden variety pyrotechnics and smoke cannons, a live drummer and a DJ, but the real special effect was the music. The polished old pro bent time and space, keeping the unfortunate new work to a minimum and running through his hits, reliving, nearly chronologically, the thrill of experiencing his catalog all over again at a speed run.

	The show is special, as it is for any artist with the generational staying power of Wayne, or say, the Stones, because it can represent entire eras in music, in life, in the career of the artist, a chameleonic constant shifting that is a necessity when you've been around for decades. It's why the live experience in this age of streaming is so vital for younger fans trying to navigate this massive back catalog. 


	A pop animal like Wayne must be experienced outside. Pay attention to the ironclad, near chronological setlist built through generations of trial and error response on the road, and watch how tens of thousands of people who were there for each step of Wayne's career reacts to it. To experience the power of these highlights in the room, with a crowd. He has a roster of endless hits—some that touched the Billboard charts and some that never did because the samples can't be cleared and they're still not streaming but were ubiquitous in the aughts nevertheless—from decades of classic, iconic album and mixtape work, which matters when you're trying to understand the impact of an artist of this magnitude. 

	











	It's a reminder that Lil Wayne is one of the most unique and context-rich rappers of the modern era, thanks to his inventive and influential approach. No GOAT-level rapper less resembles the artist he was when he began, compared to the artist he became, than Wayne does.


	Like LL Cool J (Who made a brief but memorable cameo on the Garden stage), he was a survivor who never stopped evolving. Whose appeal to his longtime followers was in charting his evolution: From yapping adolescent with the good fortune of being in proximity to one of hip hop's great groups, powered by one of its greatest beat architects, to a young solo rapper experimenting with his style on his underground mixtapes while at the same time aping the influences he wore on his sleeve on his safe and pat major label releases, be it an imitation of Jeezy and T.I.'s early aughts southern crack rap, or Jay-Z's traditional, rockist east coast LPs, to finally combining all those years of experimentation, and metabolizing those influences and producing a sound and a style that was entirely personal and unique, that at last blended his strange instinctive mixtape shit and pragmatic one-for-them proper album releases to produce a run that changed rap to such a degree it has clearly become difficult to look back and understand how subversive and groundbreaking it was at the time.


	Old Wayne fans such as myself are a funny breed. We're washed people who haven't quite accepted we're washed, in overlaundered Polos with fucked up collars, wearing sunglasses inside in the dark at night and extremely expensive fendi buckets that look stupid as hell. But the music at MSG made us all children again. And this is why you can more or less skip Tha Carter VI, but can't afford to miss Wayne live this summer if you have the opportunity to go see him. His show recreates the joy of his journey, the sense of wonder, the three-decade progression in style and substance that made Wayne one of the greatest rappers of the modern era. 


	On the 30-year anniversary of the Voodoo Lounge Tour, my parents went back to the Meadowlands to see The Rolling Stones again last year, with a pair of tickets that were still wildly expensive and in demand, this time at a football stadium named after an insurance company rather than a football team. The hand-wringing over Voodoo Lounge and the Voodoo Lounge Tour was both warranted and empty, depending on your perspective and what matters to you as a fan. The album was characterized as a bloated, 15-track, one-hour-long product of the insufferable “CD era”, a glorified excuse to tour that has largely been forgotten, and you could argue that, in terms of new music, it was the official death knell of the Rolling Stones' relevance. It also was the richest tour ever to that point, a record the Stones themselves would break multiple times in the ensuing years, the birth of the band as conveyors of “adult contemporary” bullshit, a nostalgia factory/national mint, that thanks to their longevity made them one of the first groups to capitalize on their boomer fanbase aging into elder feeling-chasers and exploring the limits of what you could charge for a concert ticket, ushering us into this current, deeply fucked era of crazed fans willing to go into significant debt to see Taylor or Beyoncé.

	Mick and Keith are in their 80s; they are multi-millionaires and have spent the last three decades releasing music occasionally, strictly for their hardcore fan base, but largely living off the incredible creative output of their first three decades. I thought about that as Wayne poignantly ended his show with “A Milli”, one of the strangest Grammy-winning, Billboard Top 10 hits in rap history.


	I sat next to a middle aged mother and her teenage son freaking out to Wayne and particularly “A Milli” in the Garden last night, and considered these institutions in pop, the generations of fans who grew up on the Stones' music and Wayne's music, who exposed their kids and grandkids to that incredible initial run and come together whenever these acts go back on the road to appreciate one of the great catalogs in the American songbook again and celebrate their shared love for it. To run back the hits, and remember the glory days, when our favorite artists were young, and so were we.

	When one of his eyes doesn't feel as if it's wobbling up and down, or he doesn't feel so depleted that he has to nap, Matthew Sweet still has moments of hope. Until last fall, one of the downstairs rooms in his Omaha, Nebraska, home was his music room, filled with guitars, a recording console, and assorted gear. But since he can no longer climb stairs for the foreseeable future, he now spends a good deal of his time in that room on a newly installed king-sized bed. What remains of his musical setup is still visible, reminders of a life and career on pause.


	“I guess I have a feeling that I will make music with all of it,” Sweet says, in his first interview eight months after he was rushed to a hospital. “In that way, it's positive. It's a vision of the time when I'll be able to use everything. I don't feel like it's that far away. I don't feel like it will be an impossible thing for me to write songs. Then again, I don't really feel a burning desire to figure that out, because there's just so much stuff making it difficult right now.”

	











	For Sweet, 2024 was shaping up to be a reset. After several years off the road after the pandemic, the man who almost single-handedly kept power-pop alive had put together a new band and played shows in the spring. He was in the early stages of prepping his first album since 2021. In the fall, he started another round of gigs, this time opening for Hanson, whom he's known and worked with for more than 20 years, and doing his own separate shows. “I really felt very positive about it,” he says. “I was doing two-hour-long acoustic shows playing songs from all during my career.”

	Then, last Oct. 12, Sweet and his crew — his small acoustic band, his road manager — arrived at their hotel in Toronto. His tour with Hanson was into its second week, and Sweet had just driven up from the previous stop in Baltimore. As they were checking in, the singer, who had turned 60 a week before, felt a sensation he'd never experienced before. “The first thing I felt was really cool, like cold sweat,” he says. “And I remember saying to one of my band members, ‘Feel my arm. It's freezing cold.' Something wasn't right.”

	Slumping into a chair behind the front desk, Sweet began hearing what he calls “this kind of tinnitus, more like white noise, and that became really, really, really loud, in both my ears. And that's the last thing I remember until I was in an ambulance and I heard a guy say, ‘Sir, you've had a stroke.'”


	In the months since that diagnosis, Sweet has had to cope with more than canceled performances. First in Canada, then in his home state, and now at his house, he's had to relearn how to walk, talk, and play any sort of instrument. He's learned that a stroke can impact other parts of the body and that recovery can be slow and painstaking. Since he didn't have insurance at the time of his stroke, he's also become a representation of artists who can't always afford it and count on touring to pay their bills.  


	“It was really a drag, because the touring went so amazingly well in the first part of the year,” Sweet says now. “And then, bang, I had the stroke, and it was just all over.”


From his studio-bedroom, Sweet recalls the beginnings of his career with one of the chuckles that unexpectedly punctuates a conversation with him. It was the mid-Eighties, and the Nebraska-born Sweet, who'd moved to Athens, Georgia, for college and had become swept up in the burgeoning indie rock of the time, was on tour with the Golden Palominos. Featuring an ever-shifting lineup of New York-area musicians like keyboardist Bernie Worrell, singer Syd Straw, guitarist Arto Lindsay, bassist Bill Laswell, and drummer Anton Fier, the Palominos were Sweet's induction into the life of a traveling musician.

	“I was just a kid, and it was the first time I was ever really on a bus tour, so it was like Touring 101,” Sweet says. “I would like to go see Bernie in his room, and he'd be there with a bunch of girls in the bed with him. Just classic. Chrissie Hynde came to see us in Toronto. We stayed up with her all night in a hotel room, and I was like a fly on the wall, maybe providing the weed. Such cool memories.”

	











	With his winsome voice and penchant for charged guitar melodies rooted in his love of the Beatles, Sweet, along with bands like the Smithereens, kept guitar pop alive after hair metal had overtaken rock & roll. The battle was somewhat uphill, but Sweet's third album, 1991's Girlfriend, established him as an artist in his own pop right. With the advent of grunge the following year, Sweet's subsequent albums didn't have the same commercial impact, but he remained a master of the form, recorded three duet albums with the Bangles' Susanna Hoffs, and helped Hanson make the transition to indie pop by collaborating on their album Underneath. His voice was heard in a 2014 episode of The Simpsons (Homer and other dads form a band, and Sweet provided a Journey parody song for them to play), and he was also glimpsed in Austin Powers in Goldmember.


	For Russell Carter, Sweet's longtime manager, Sweet's return to the road in 2024 was the start of a plan to rebrand him as a legacy artist, especially for the Gen Xers who grew up with his records. But that schedule was tabled when Carter heard from his sons (one of whom was Sweet's road manager, another in his band) that Sweet was headed for an ICU in Toronto. “That was lucky,” Carter says. “He could have been in the middle of nowhere in a van on a trip to Canada. Or he could have been on an airplane. The circumstances of where he was couldn't have been better.”


	Taylor Hanson says he and his brothers were rattled by the news. “We were saying, ‘What's going on?'” Hanson says. “We heard it was something extreme and we knew pretty quickly he was going to the hospital. Everyone jumps to the worst scenario. At first we through it was a heart attack.”


	At the hospital in Toronto, aides had Sweet sit up in bed to demonstrate how his body had been impacted by his stroke: His left side couldn't handle the weight and would fold under him. In time, doctors lowered his blood pressure and some progress was made with his speech, as Carter learned during calls with him. “He had to make great effort to bring thoughts together,” Carter says. “He could make a great deal of sense, but not for long. But he improved day by day.” 


	Sweet also learned that his stroke had taken place in an unusual spot, the pons region in the back of the brainstem. The cause, he was told, was likely a spike in blood pressure. Adding to the mystery, Sweet had high blood pressure in his youth but had lowered it in recent years.

	











	By way of an ambulance transport plane with two nurses, Sweet was eventually flown back to Omaha to begin rehab at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital. “I was the last one to realize how bad it is to have a stroke like that,” he says. “I sort of felt like just everything was going to come back really soon. And then as I got back to Omaha and went to Madonna, they had group classes, where the idea is to explain to you what to expect from it. I found that really depressing. I did not want to go to this class full of people who all had strokes and have to learn how bad it could be, but it was part of my coming to terms with it.”


	At that facility, Sweet began physical therapy, walking exercises, and using a robotic device to help him regain more control of his impacted left arm. But his obstacles were just beginning. At that point, he didn't have health insurance, and the bills, starting with that pricy transportation from Toronto, began piling up. “A good six weeks without insurance, so it was crazy,” he says. “It was so, so expensive, $5,600 a day or something. I didn't know it could be that much. I would sit there and think, ‘What could I have bought with today's money?'”


	To help defray those costs, Carter set up a GoFundMe for Sweet soon after. Fans contributed an average of $50, but another indication of Sweet's respect in the industry was the list of musicians who donated: John Mayer, Pearl Jam's Jeff Ament, producer Brendan O'Brien, and members of R.E.M. (Peter Buck and Mike Mills), the Bangles (Hoffs and Vicki Peterson), and the Go-Go's (Belinda Carlisle and Jane Wiedlin).


	Movie-world admirers like Jon Cryer and Judd Apatow also contributed, resulting in a fund that currently sits at more than $600,000. “I just love his music,” Apatow tells Rolling Stone. “The sound of his voice and his guitar always makes me instantly happy. He's been in heavy rotation in my house forever and I've written entire screenplays to his music. 100% Fun powered me forward through many writing projects. I donated because he has brought me so much joy and wanted to let him know how much his work meant to me.”


	Sweet says he was initially unaware the fund had been set up and was shocked to see the list of donors. “Yeah, I saw those names,” he says. “I was like, ‘I know you, Ducky!' Probably the most emotional moments I had early on in the stroke was a result of being so amazed there were that many people that cared. It was an awakening to see how much heart people have. Part of me was like, ‘How do they all know how bad a stroke is?' I didn't know. You think old people have strokes.”

	











	Says Hanson of the outpouring, “I hope Matthew recognizes that his music has reached and touched a lot of people. More than sometimes he realizes.”


As his early rehab was taking place, Sweet's home, which he shares with his wife Lisa and their niece, was being retrofitted for his return. Carpeting was ripped up and replaced with wood floors to allow him to use his walker, and door frames were widened to accommodate a wheelchair. Until the upgrades were finished, the Sweets checked into a local hotel (“I was really ready to leave after being in a hospital bed all day,” he says), but that resulted in another setback: When Lisa attempted to help bathe her husband, they both slipped on the shower floor, and Lisa broke a leg and had to be hospitalized herself. “So,” Sweet says, “not good luck for us to have that happen.”


	Sweet's life hasn't gotten any easier since then. As likely aftereffectsof his stroke, he's been diagnosed with ataxia, a neurological condition that often leaves him off balance, and nystagmus, which make one's eyes unexpectedly move side to side or up and down. Sweet suspects the latter diagnosis may have resulted from a smaller stroke he could have experienced a few months ago. He'd also been diagnosed long before his stroke with essential tremor, the neurological condition that causes people's hands or heads to shake. (Katharine Hepburn famously suffered from it.) “There is a shaking that's pretty pronounced on the left side of my head, as weird as that sounds,” he says. “So the early part of the day, I'm often shaking a lot in the left side of my head and face.”


	Even with nystagmus, Sweet can see well enough, but aides help him type out texts to friends. A sense of vertigo also accompanies him: “When I look down, the floor looks like it's caving in, which is really kind of unnerving.” That makes it challenging for him to use a walker and has led him to have to rely on a wheelchair and nursing aides, who help transport him to his bed, shower, and bathroom or into a car. He can't walk upstairs and remains confined to the first floor of his home.


	Financially speaking, Sweet is doing better thanks to the GoFundMe, and he's applied for Social Security disability benefits and now has insurance via the Affordable Care Act. But with home-care costs continuing, his GoFundMe has been rebooted. Under the Trump presidency, the future of Social Security itself is uncertain. In the worst-case scenario, Sweet says he may have to sell his house and move to a less expensive place.

	











	The future remains a blank page, physically and professionally. “It's sobering to think I might just have to always have a person that can handle moving me one place to another,” says Sweet. “My thoughts originally were, ‘Well, how likely is it that I'll walk if I have the ataxia?' And no one will say. It's more like they don't know. This might be as good as it gets, or I might make progress.”


	Carter shares that sense of frustration. “He's getting treatment from lots of good doctors, but the most frustrating thing for Matthew is that he still has no prognosis,” he says. “They encourage him to put his nose to the grindstone and do all the PT and just hope for the best. It's somewhat discouraging that he hasn't made more progress, but I don't think that's unusual. It's a very slow process.”


	Then there's his music. Before the stroke, Sweet was in the early stages of making an album he was calling Midsommar. “I don't feel like it's in any way ready to be brought to fruition right now,” he says, “but I certainly remember it.”


	In conversation with Rolling Stone, Sweet speaks in a voice that is occasionally halting, but he's lucid and never losing his breath. Singing, however, could be another issue, despite undergoing speech therapy in rehab. “Maybe I'll regain some of the breath power, but it hasn't happened yet,” he says. “I just kind of run out of air at the end of a word, and then I have to start over and say the word again.”


	Given his issues with his left hand, guitar playing is off the table, but he's hopeful that he can play some keyboards, since he generally relied on his right hand for the instrument. Performing live, however, feels unfathomable. “Most of the venues we were in last fall had stairs in them,” he says. “There's just no way I could ever go up to the dressing rooms. So I think, ‘What would it even be like to tour? Other people play instruments, and I'm just there on stage attempting to sing?'”

	As part of his tour with Hanson, the band had been hoping to bring Sweet onstage for the title song of Underneath, which Sweet wrote for them. “One of the sad personal notes is that we were a show away from doing it at soundcheck and remembering the arrangement and then playing it,” Taylor Hanson says. “But it hadn't happened yet. I'm going to hold out that that will occur, in some form.”


	Sweet insists he is remaining as optimistic as possible. “I have to just be happy to be alive and try to do what I can each day,” he says. “Somedays I'm just tired and want to stay in bed. Some days I can be awake more. I do have a lot of weepy moments, but I'm generally a positive kind of person, and so I try to be hopeful and accepting and think, ‘If this is how I have to be, that'll be okay, and if I have breakthroughs, that'll be great.' All my life, I've been an optimist. So even if a lot of stuff is a little bit out of my reach right now, it doesn't make me not want to try and keep living.”

EXCLUSIVE: If nothing else, Jeremy Clarkson has shown how farmers' livelihoods are beholden to the vicissitudes of the weather gods. But there is now one thing you can guarantee every year: Clarkson's Farm will harvest a bumper crop of ratings for Amazon Prime Video.


	Jeremy Clarkson's adventures on his Diddly Squat dwelling in the Cotswolds continue to resonate with British viewers, with Season 4 on course to become the most-watched to date, according to an analysis of viewing figures by Deadline.


	The final two episodes of the season dropped on Amazon Prime Video on Friday, and while it is too early to analyse how these have rated, it is possible to look back on the first six instalments of 2025. Season 4 has averaged 4.4M viewers so far this year, according to official seven-day viewing figures from Barb and overnights.tv.

	This puts it just a shade ahead of Season 3 over the same number of episodes. Last year's season averaged 4.3M over its first six instalments, even though this included the highest-rated single episode to date: the 2024 premiere, which was seen by 5.2M viewers. The best performing instalment of Season 4 has been episode two with 5M viewers.

Clarkson's Farm has comfortably been Amazon Prime Video's biggest show of the year, while the second episode of Season 4 was the UK's second most-watched TV event in the week to May 25, according to Barb's ranking of the top 50 shows. The only Amazon series that has come close to Clarkson's Farm is LOL: Last One Laughing UK, which chuckled along with audiences of up to 3.1M earlier this year. 


	Produced by Expectation, Amazon Prime Video has renewed Clarkson's Farm for a fifth season, which will premiere next year. Beyond that, there is uncertainty. Clarkson has suggested that it will take a good story to warrant another season, while he also said the team is in need of a break. “We've been filming here two or three days a week, every week, for five years. Everybody could do with a rest,” he told The Sunday Times.

Martin Scorsese has directed more than 20 feature films, including some of the most beloved of the last half-century: Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Departed.


	But now he says he can no longer go to watch movies in cinema theatres because he becomes too riled by the behaviour of his fellow cinema-goers.


The Guardian newspaper reports that Scorsese professed himself so distracted by all the chat and mobile phone behaviour around him, he could no longer concentrate on the events on the screen.


	Scorsese was talking to US film critic Peter Travers who wrote on his blog The Travers Take:

	“I asked the maestro why he doesn't see movies in theatres any more and he went all raging bull about audiences who babble on phones during the movie, leave to order snacks and vats of soda, and keep up a noise level loud enough to drown out the actors.”


	Travers wrote that he challenged the veteran director: “‘Come on, Marty,' I said, ‘we couldn't keep our mouths shut when we were kids.'”


	Travers added: “His [Scorsese's] eyes darkened. ‘Yeah, maybe,' he conceded, ‘but when we talked it was always about the movie and the fun we had chewing over the details.'”


The Guardian reports that Scorsese has multiple projects in production, including a Hawaii-set crime drama starring Dwayne Johnson and a documentary about the late Pope Francis, with whom it is believed he had the final interview.


	In his long career, he has received 16 Academy Award nominations for his work, including winning the Best Director Oscar for police corruption thriller The Departed (2007).

Weezy took a victory lap to celebrate Tha Carter VI's arrival with his first solo headlining show at NYC's Madison Square Garden.

	Rocking a signed Britney Spears shirt, Lil Wayne kicked off his Tha Carter VI Tour in front of a sold-out Madison Square Garden (Wayne's first time as a solo headliner at MSG) on Friday night (June 6). 


	Weezy took a well-deserved victory lap, with Friday also serving as C6 release day, which called for a celebration with thousands of his diehard fans who have been on this unpredictable journey with Wayne for over two decades. 


	“I put out Tha Carter VI,” Wayne told the crowd during the show. “I must say thank you to every single soul supporting that motherf—ing album, supporting me from day one. Damn. I also must thank every single person involved with that album. Everybody came through — I appreciate all of y'all, man.”

	Wayne mixed in live debuts of Tha Carter VI cuts with his endless amount of anthems and timeless gems from his Hall-of-Fame catalog, as the New Orleans rap legend reaffirmed that he's one of the greatest rhymers ever to pick up a mic. 


	Tunechi had a couple of surprises up his sleeve with Cory Gunz joining him for “6 Foot 7 Foot” and LL COOL J hitting the stage to perform “Rock the Bells” after Weezy interpolated LL's 1985 hit on Tha Carter VI‘s “Bells.”

	Lil Wayne squeezed over 36 tracks into his 70-minute set. Tha Carter VI Tour will take a break for a few weeks before the 34-date North American trek picks up again at the end of June in Virginia.

The Bollywood scion's production banner will generate a diverse slate of series and films for Netflix as the streamer continues to build its position in the world's most populous nation. 


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


Netflix has entered into a new creative partnership with Ekta Kapoor's Balaji Telefilms in India, further enhancing its content offering in the world's most populous country. The collaboration, unveiled Saturday in Mumbai, will focus on producing a range of high-quality entertainment, including films, series, and other digital content, designed to appeal to the diversity of India's audiences, the partners say.


	Kapoor, a Bollywood scion and International Emmy Award-winning producer known for her extensive work in Hindi television and film, has been a prominent figure in Indian entertainment for over two decades.

	Monika Shergill, Netflix's vp of content in India, hailed Kapoor's impact on the Indian industry, noting her “deep understanding of the audience's pulse.” Shergill emphasized that this partnership is aligned with Netflix's broader strategy of delivering content that resonates with the varied tastes of its Indian subscribers.


	Kapoor, speaking on the collaboration, highlighted the opportunity to bring “powerful, culturally rooted, and emotionally resonant stories to a global audience,” citing Netflix's unparalleled global reach.


	She added: “The beginning of this new collaboration marks an exciting new chapter where we continue to push creative boundaries and deliver content that entertains, inspires, and connects people everywhere.”


	The deal builds on an existing history of collaboration between Netflix and Balaji Telefilms, which has produced several successful titles together, including Kathal, Pagglait, and Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare. The new partnership will eventually deliver a fresh slate of content, with an untitled series currently in advanced stages of development. The collaboration will involve Balaji's two main divisions, Balaji Motion Pictures and Balaji Telefilms Digital. The partners didn't disclose financials or further terms of the pact. 

	











	Netflix views India as an important long-term growth market and continues to invest heavily there, although it has tempered its ambitions for the country significantly since Reed Hastings' wildly bullish projections during the streamer's early rapid-expansion era. With this partnership, the company continues to strengthen its position in India, where competition in the streaming space remains fierce. Netflix now emphasizes a more measured approach, having adapted to the challenges of the landscape's competition and diverse, price-sensitive audience.

 Best New Reissue

Genre:

Folk/Country

Label:

Asthmatic Kitty

Reviewed:

June 7, 2025

Only three sense memories remain from the night my wife and I came home from the hospital after our daughter died, 10 years ago this May. My brother, sleeping like a dog on the couch behind us, a miserable sentinel. The warmth of my wife's hot tears and breath on my face, inches from my own. And something else, in the background, playing over and over again: Sufjan Stevens' Carrie & Lowell.

Why would we do that to ourselves? The album that opens with “Death With Dignity,” the album whose most memorable chorus is a whispered “we're all gonna die.” And yet I kept returning to the record player, flipping the album over and over. The album functioned as the bleakest kind of prayer, the one that doesn't even ask for things, just offers a beseeching glance skyward: Notice me. Feel me.

In the myopia of my shock and early grief, I barely registered the complicated and brutal autobiographical truth of the record. Yes, it's an album with a Polaroid on the cover, clearly from a personal collection, paired with two first names. Yes, the lyrics are so specific to one man's experience as to approach the forensic: “When I was three, three maybe four….” And yet the thumbprint of tragedy, the outline and silhouette of grief, was all I needed from Carrie & Lowell. I gulped at it, greedily, again and again. My relationship to an album has rarely been more intense. Until this month, I couldn't bear to put it back on. To me, it had become like a death march, or a funeral mass: music for use.

But Carrie & Lowell, newly reissued by Asthmatic Kitty with a modest addendum of bonus tracks and a gorgeous 40-page photo album, survives my bloodshot fixation because it is so formally perfect. The arrangements feel inevitable in the way the harmonic motion of a Bach suite feels inevitable. There isn't a single breath on the album that doesn't feel drawn with specificity. Play the opening of “Death With Dignity” while staring at a creek, and the rhythms of the opening guitar figure will naturally match up with the flow of the water.

There aren't many artists who can capture and preserve this intimacy and intensity. There is an obvious comparison to Elliott Smith, who similarly matched up a shaky and tender vocal with arrangements that felt like you could stare straight through them. But not even Smith bared his soul as directly, simply, and plainly as Stevens does here. Smith was often obfuscating or misdirecting in his lyrics even when it seemed he was confessing, but Stevens lays it all out: times, places, dates, car models. The familiarity that I get from these songs is the same I get from a short story collection rooted in a specific setting—the Nevada of Claire Vaye Watkins' Battleborn, the Wyoming of Annie Proulx's Close Range. Stevens' memories become sacred the more granular they become.

Sufjan Stevens is embarrassed by this album. Mortified, even. He has been commemorating its re-release by disavowing it point-blank. In the essay that accompanies its packaging, he calls it “painful, humiliating, and an utter miscarriage of bad intentions.” He went on NPR recently and stood firm in this rejection in the face of the host's hesitant probing. Didn't he find some pride, comfort, or peace in the fact that his album reached so many people? No, he could only say. He attempted to write the story of his mother, another human being whom he never truly understood, and who had taken whatever secrets she held with her. He was just a lost boy, making patterns in the air from his grief. “I don't have any authority over my mother and her life or experience or her death,” he said. “All I have is speculation and my imagination and my own misery… I still don't feel good about myself for making these songs.”

Watching Stevens castigate himself for self-loathing by performing more of it in public is poignant and painful. He captured the essential hopelessness of making art to replace a person in fewer lines on the album itself: “Nothing can be changed/The past is still the past/The bridge to nowhere,” he sang on “Should Have Known Better.” “What's the point of singing songs/If they'll never even hear you?” he asks on “Eugene.” Lurking inside Stevens' refutation of Carrie & Lowell, deep beliefs insist themselves: The dead keep their secrets. We are left with nothing when they go save for a handful of cherished misconceptions. Death is real, and it's not for making into art.

And yet: What if we belong to other people as much or more as we belong to ourselves? What if our real secrets are not a palmful of baubles we keep inside some protected box, but the stories the loved ones who followed us with their eyes, who lavished their wondering love on us, told themselves? In this view, we don't take secrets with us when we die; we scatter them upon the earth in our passing like a flower releasing pollen. Maybe Sufjan holds more of his mother's secrets than he takes credit for.

Or maybe the dead do abscond with all their mysteries intact, and we'll always be outside, in the cold, yearning for the warmth of what they know. Maybe the songs Stevens wrote and recorded with his mother's name and face on them represent the only way those of us left living generate warmth for ourselves. Stevens' voice was the only sound I allowed to follow me into the darkest cavern. Even if his story was only ever for us, and never for his mother, we are transformed immeasurably, and for the better, by it.

	In his New Rules segment on Real Time, Bill Maher decried some liberal strategists' idea that the Democrats need to find their own version of Joe Rogan.


	“Instead of conjuring up a new Joe Rogan, ask yourself why you lost the old one,” Maher challenged. “Because he used to be on your side.”


	Ditto Elon Musk. 


	Maher called Musk “another guy who five years ago was thought of as a liberal who was driven into the other camp by bad attitudes and bad ideas — a reversal I completely understand although I would never emulate it.

	The Real Time host continued, “I related to the kind of mean girl shit you get from the cool kids in Wokeville. They tried real hard to cancel Rogan.”

	And when Musk hosted SNL in 2021 well before he was Trumper, Maher claimed some of the castmembers gave him the cold shoulder for the sin of being rich. 


	“You think people don't remember when you do this sh*t to them? That it's not going to have blowback?”


	Maher then advanced a proposal for those liberal strategists wandering in the wilderness: “All the guys in American like Joe and Elon, you do have to win them back — and you can.”


	He suggested Musk and Rogan didn't get “that The Last of Us fungal infection and became zombies.” They didn't turn to the dark side, he maintained.


	“No, they just got driven away, because that's how politics works these days. Because a one side gets elected and pushed their agenda way too far and drove people in the opposite direction. The pendulum swings back and forth, not with people voting FOR anything but just to get rid of the latest extremist assh*les who seek to remake American in their image instead of just governing. Well, right now it's the Republicans who are drunk with power.”

From Washington's attitude to YouTube to new money for Hollywood-friendly candidates, the effects in town could be far-reaching.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	OK, so the Donald Trump–Elon Musk feud pretty much IS Hollywood.


	If you had to pitch a script about the world's most powerful man squaring off against the world's richest man in an all-out war over the direction of the planet, you'd get a greenlight on the spot (or get laughed out of the room for implausibility). The popcorn-bucket quotient is unparalleled.




	But such a feud also has a consequence for Hollywood. More than one, in fact. How does the knockdown-dragout brawl impact companies, executives and creators in the town, you ask? Here are five potential ways.

1. Align MAGA Against YouTube and Other Entertainment-related Tech Companies


			Related Video		







	Since he was elected seven months ago, Trump has been largely friendly to the Silicon Valley companies in charge of (among other things) our content and entertainment, pulling many Republicans with him (or at least cowing them into silence). But that's been starting to change with the increasing volubility of Missouri senator Josh Hawley and several others, who have begun to ask accountability-type questions about YouTube and its AI training and social platforms and their content policies. Now, the trend could get Trump behind it too as the friendliest Big Tech voice in his ear is gone. In fact, he could have a new vendetta-ish incentive to go after Big Tech, seeking to bring to heel companies like Amazon and Netflix along with universities, law firms, legacy media and others he's pursued.


2. Cut Down FCC Chair Brendan Carr












	One of the biggest thorns in the side of network news and other content giants is Carr, who has sought to call to the principal's office Comcast, Disney and other media companies — and hold up the Paramount-Skydance merger while he's at it. Carr is actually a major Musk ally — he has visited his Texas SpaceX headquarters, taken selfies with the mogul and gone to bat for him, as he did when slamming FCC colleagues several years ago for not granting Musk's Starlink huge sums in rural broadband subsidy fees. Carr will no doubt try to thread the Muskian needle now that his boss (well, technically his boss is Congress) has fallen out with his big ally. But that may be not an easy eye to get that yarn through, and Carr may find himself a little closer to the margins without his buddy and rabbi. Bob Iger and Shari Redstone might exhale — for a few seconds.


3. Give Hollywood Liberals a New Ally (Maybe)


	Alright this one seems like a stretch, even if plenty of political outlets are happy to indulge it. “Democrats eye a villain-to-ally arc for Elon Musk”: Politico; “Democratic congressman steps up his work to pull Musk toward his party for the midterms”: Semafor.)


	Plenty of Dems still hate Musk; the enemy-of-your-enemy logic only goes so far. Plenty of Dems feel the way Tim “How great is it that that dipshit Elon Musk is out?” Walz does, even if only some will say it.


	But Congressman Ro Khanna, the Northern California progressive in whose district a Tesla assembly plant sits, wants Musk to get California-ized. “We should ultimately be trying to convince him that the Democratic Party has more of the values that he agrees with,” Khanna told Semafor. “A commitment to science funding, a commitment to clean technology, a commitment to seeing international students like him.”

	











	Nothing that Musk has done in the past year suggests this is remotely likely — and let's not forget he needs lots of contracts Trump's agencies provide. Plus if anything, come midterms he's going to be trying to knock down Trump candidates from the right. 


	But the man who in the fall alleged that the entertainment business was conspiring to enable Diddy now mingling with Jeffrey Katzenberg, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and others in Hollywood's fundraising machine would be a juicily ironic specter indeed.


4. Let Entertainment People Keep Their Teslas


	Hollywood loves cars and revenge tales, so it makes sense the Tesla Takedown movement has been rooted here. Alex Winter of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure kind of kicked the whole thing off, and entertainers like Sheryl Crow, Jason Bateman and others have ditched their slick EVs in his wake. While Musk will hardly seem like a good guy to Hollywood liberals, his withdrawal from the government, the defanging of DOGE and newfound rivalry with Trump may make holding on to that Model X Plaid a little easier. Ari could drive his Cybertruck with head held high.


5. Push Trump to Slow Down Content-Gobbling AI Companies


	This one is tricky. Trump has a big AI verdict of sorts coming in July when he is expected to announce his regulation plans. So far he's shown little appetite for such guardrails. In fact, the current Big Beautiful spending bill (also at the center of the Musk fight) has a major provision stopping states from regulating AI for ten years — a huge sop to Sam Altman, Google and the rest of the Silicon Valley AI lobby. But there are already signs it could be slowed down, with Marjorie Taylor Greene, of all people, leading the charge in the name of states' rights. The Senate has just watered down the provision, changing it from an outright ban on states to regulate to an elimination of broadband subsidies if they do.

	











	Could Trump flex his muscle to roll it back further and allow regulation now that he's in a blood feud with Musk, overseer of AI model Grok? It's possible. But also worth noting is that Musk is in a separate blood feud with Altman, who wants pretty much no regulation at all. So by that enemy-of-your-enemy logic the Musk fight could draw Trump closer to Altman and even more opposed to AI regulation, letting the models run wild in music and film. Like all things Musk-Trump, the moves are both giving us entertainment and landing on Hollywood.

The company says the music streamer is now engaging in copyright infringement by continuing to play tracks by artists including Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus and Tate McRae.

	Rachel Scharf



Sony claims in a new lawsuit that streaming platform LiveOne and its subsidiary Slacker Radio owe $2.6 million in unpaid licensing fees yet are refusing to stop playing the label's music, including tracks by Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus and Tate McRae.


	The allegations come in a federal lawsuit Sony filed Friday (June 6) against LiveOne and Slacker, which LiveOne acquired in 2017 and has since folded into the LiveOne streaming app.  


	Sony and Slacker have been doing business with each other since 2007 through a content distribution deal, according to the lawsuit. But Sony's lawyers say LiveOne and Slacker stopped making regular monthly licensing payments in August 2024 and now owe a total outstanding balance of $2.6 million.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“In the past several months alone, Slacker claims to have seen increasing commercial success, touting a surge in usage of the LiveOne app and a year-over-year surge in content views,” write Sony's attorneys. “Despite this self-proclaimed growth, Slacker—true to its name—has failed to make license payments to Sony Music as and when required under the agreement, and its parent, LiveOne, has likewise failed to live up to its guarantee.”


	According to the lawsuit, Sony notified LiveOne and Slacker in March that it was terminating the content distribution deal in light of this contract breach. Sony says it “expressly informed” them that further use of its music would constitute copyright infringement, according to the lawsuit.


	But Sony's lawyers claim the LiveOne app is still streaming more than 200 of the label's songs — also including tracks by Doja Cat, Harry Styles, Justin Timberlake and Khalid.


	“Slacker's conduct has caused and continues to cause substantial and irreparable harm to Sony Music and its artists, while enriching defendants at the expense of Sony Music and its artists,” write Sony's lawyers. “By this lawsuit, Sony Music seeks damages for Slacker and LiveOne's breach of the agreement and for defendants' willful infringement of Sony Music's copyrights since the March 15, 2025, termination of the agreement.”


	Representatives for Slacker did not immediately return Billboard's request for comment on the claims.


	The lawsuit comes three years after Slacker and LiveOne faced a different lawsuit over unpaid fees from SoundExchange, the nonprofit that collects and distributes royalties to record labels and artists. A federal judge ultimately ordered the streaming companies to pay SoundExchange nearly $10 million in past-due royalties.

Bravo has officially found a new cast member for the upcoming 15th season of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” Fashion designer and former reality TV star Rachel Zoe is making her long-awaited return to the network.

Zoe announced the news via Instagram in a personal video message to fans.

“It's official, I am coming back to Bravo! I am joining the cast of ‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills',” she said.

She continued, “It's been a while and you've been asking me to come back to television, and I said when the stars align or it makes sense or I have enough to say to share with all of you—and now is the time. Really excited to be with all of you again, and I hope you are too, so let's have some fun!”

Her casting comes at a pivotal moment for the franchise, which follows the departure of longtime favorite cast member, Garcelle Beauvais.

Beauvais confirmed her exit ahead of the Season 14 finale earlier this year. She also made the announcement via Instagram.

“It's been a wild ride. I mean, some amazing things have happened and some hard things have also happened, but it's been a ride nevertheless,” she shared. “One of the reasons why I'm leaving is my family, my boys.”

She added, “Their last year of high school is next year and I want to be a part of that. And Jade is starting a new career and I want to be a part of that too. And secondly, I have the most exciting projects that I am developing, producing and acting in. I can't tell you anything right now, but you'll know soon.”

A post shared by Rachel Zoe (@rachelzoe)

Zoe is no stranger to Bravo. She originally joined the network back in 2008 with her hit series “The Rachel Zoe Project.” The show chronicled her professional life in the fashion world while also showing a peek inside her personal life, running for five seasons before ending in 2013.

Since then, Zoe has remained a key figure in the fashion industry and a favorite of the network. Primarily through her digital lifestyle brand and newsletter, “The Zoe Report,” which launched in 2009.

In 2024, Zoe made headlines after she and her husband, Rodger Berman, announced their separation. Via a joint statement on Instagram, the couple shared, “After 33 years together and 26 years married, Rodger and I have come to the mutual decision to end our marriage. We are incredibly proud of the loving family we have created and our countless memories together.”

They emphasized that their two children remain their top priority and confirmed they plan to continue working together on their shared businesses.

Season 14 of ‘RHOBH' featured a dynamic cast that left the audience questioning who would return to the show. It included Bozoma Saint John, Sutton Stracke, Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne, Dorit Kemsley, Jennifer Tilly, and Kathy Hilton. However, Bravo has yet to confirm which Housewives will return for Season 15.

Still, Zoe's addition to the cast signals an exciting new era for the series. Fans are expecting to see a fresh blend of fashion, drama, and high-profile storylines. Fans of the show went on to comment on the news, with one writing, “Best casting decision in a long while! Can't wait for this 🎉.”

Another one wrote, “Oh wow, this should make this an interesting season!”

Lacey Chabert is full of surprises! On June 6, 2025, Hallmark Channel announced that the third movie in her popular “Haul Out the Holly” franchise will not center around Christmas like the first two films did. Rather, the cast just wrapped filming “Haul Out the Halloween,” to be released in the fall. But that's not the only surprise. 

While many members of the original cast have returned for the movie, one of Chabert's besties, actress Kimberly J. Brown, has joined the cast alongside her husband, Daniel Kountz. The couple met in 2001 while filming Disney Channel's “Halloweentown II” and Chabert served as a bridesmaid at their April 2024 wedding. 

A post shared by Lacey Chabert (@thereallacey)

In a cute teaser video for the new movie, posted to social media on June 5, Chabert is joined by returning cast members Wes Brown, Melissa Peterman, Ellen Travolta, and Stephen Tobolowsky at the front of door of their new neighbors' house. 

After marveling at all the Halloween decorations on their front stoop, the group decides to knock on the door to meet the new neighbors. Brown and Kountz answer the door — and they're appearance has nostalgic fans of the duo's “Halloweentown” movies flipping out. 

One person commented on the post, “Ahhhhh !!!! I am so excited !!!!! Please say this is for real ?!?”

After Hallmark Channel's social media team replied, “Oh, it's real!” multiple fans wrote about how pumped they were, including one who exclaimed, “This is real? REALLY?! When worlds collide! 🤯 I am SO EXCITED!! 🎃👻🧡🖤🧡🖤”

Another fan wrote, “The gasp I gusped! This is like all of my favorite things and people in one!”

“I was fully unprepared for that reveal 😍,” someone else chimed in. 

Brown played Marnie Piper in Disney's cult classic “Halloweentown” movies and 2004's “Halloween High.” She and Kountz kept in touch after “Halloween II,” but didn't meet up again until 2016, she told People, and the duo wound up falling in love. 

Before their 2024 wedding, Chabert threw a bridal shower for Brown and shared on Instagram that their friendship “has blessed my life since I was about 8 years old and I love her dearly!” 

After the shower, Brown posted photos and wrote of Chabert, “I wouldn't be where I am in my life today without this lady so thank you, Lace, for not only creating the most special shower, but also being such a source of love, inspiration, strength, and uncontrollable laughter in my life. I love you forever.” 

As with 2022's “Haul Out the Holly” and 2024's “Haul Out the Holly: Lit Up,” Chabert serves as an executive producer on the new “Haul Out the Halloween” movie and knew Brown and Kountz needed to be part of it. 

In a press statement, Chabert said, “Kimberly and Daniel have been dear friends for many years. When we started on this third movie, set during Halloween, I just knew that they would be the perfect addition to this hilariously funny cast. I loved making this movie with friends – who so many people grew up sharing this holiday with. It's a dream come true.”

The logline for the movie states, ““For a neighborhood as renowned for its spectacular holiday displays as Evergreen Lane, the street has long been modest when it comes to Halloween. But when fun and spooky new neighbors, Luna (Brown) and Marvin (Kountz) move to the block, Emily (Chabert), Jared (Brown) and the rest of the HOA agree to get in on the seasonal fun and launch EverSCREAM Lane to fundraise for a local charity.”

“As the block pulls together to plan creepy contests,” the synopsis continues, “spine-chilling décor and a spooktacular carnival, new haunted hijinks ensue with Pamela (Peterson), Ned (Tobolowsky), Mary Louise (Travolta) and the rest of the block. Through the process, Emily rediscovers the joys of the holiday that she and her late grandmother once cherished.”

Posted in: Amazon Studios, CW, TV | Tagged: Supernatural, the boys

During a Creation Entertainment this weekend, Misha Collins shared that his scene with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki during The Boys Season 5 reminded him a bit of Supernatural Season 6 Episode 15: "The French Mistake."



Ever since it was announced that Supernatural fam Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins would be sharing screen time with Jensen Ackles (Soldier Boy) during the fifth and final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke and Prime Video's The Boys, fans have been checking out anything and everything that might offer clues to what they can expect. During Creation Entertainment's "The Road So Far… The Road Ahead: Creation Oklahoma City" this weekend, Collins offered an interesting tease about what goes down. While having to stay on "spoiler watch," Collins noted that their on-screen time together in The Boys might vibe a bit familiar for those who've seen Supernatural Season 6 Episode 15: "The French Mistake."

The 2011 episode finds the angel Balthazar trapping Sam (Padalecki) and Dean (Ackles) in an alternate reality where they're known as – you guessed it – "Jared Padalecki" and "Jensen Ackles." Yup, it gets even more meta because "Jared Padalecki" and "Jensen Ackles" play Sam and Dean on a television show. The name of that show? Supernatural. Thankfully, Castiel (Collins) makes the save after some twists and turns (though a much larger threat loomed).

Here's what Collins had to share earlier today during #SPNOKC, and huge thanks once again to Fangasm for getting the word out:

"There are some things that are coming in Season 5 that you're not going to have in your bingo card," Mitchell shared while speaking with Deadline Hollywood during Amazon's Prime Video FYC event last month that also included Jack Quaid, Susan Heyward, Colby Minifie, Claudia Doumit, Tomer Capone, Jessie T. Usher, Antony Starr, Erin Moriarty, and Chace Crawford."I look at the last two seasons … like an accordion. One piece of the accordion is going out, and then this is the compression going back in. There was a lot of setup in Season 4 for Season 5. Everything is gunning towards that climactic end. So it's exciting at the moment because we're filming all that," Starr added.

With regards to Kripke's decision to end The Boys after five seasons, there is a collective respect for the showrunner making the call when he felt it was best for the series. "Every time, it's the same reaction. 'No! Who do I have to murder!?' And that's a good sign. You don't want the opposite, where they're like, 'Oh thank God.'" Quaid explained. Minifie added, "Sometimes things go on too long and then it starts to run away from you and you don't get to tell the story you want to tell. When the announcement came out, Kripke said we get to end it on our terms, which I think is a really beautiful thing. The best stories have a beginning, middle, and end. Knowing the end is in five, we were able to tell the middle really well."

#TheBoys cast discuss the fifth and final season and their experience working on the series

During an interview with Forbes from earlier this year, Kripke discussed how the streaming series has leaned into being a political show and how current events impact the season's writing (but not the show's endgame). "Look, I think 'The Boys' probably, for better or worse, is a political show at this point. I think season four was political. I think the world has sort of grown to resemble the show more and more in a way that's not great. And so, we just sort of lean into it. I mean, the show is about why and how you should question your leaders. You should question anyone who stands in front of you. You should question anyone who is pitching you simple answers to complicated problems and who is saying that they're the only ones who can save you – like those are dangerous people. Obviously, we're not shy about saying that, but I take a little bit of pride in that for our bananas superhero show, we're one of the most current shows on TV in terms of like reflecting exactly what's happening in the world at this moment, and that's great. It's amazing for a superhero show to be doing that. So, I'm really proud that we pulled that off," Kripke shared, noting that over the seasons, the writers began to embrace how the series and real life were reflecting one another.

After noting that not all of the scripts were written at the time of the interview last month, Kripke shared how current events routinely impact the scripts as they evolve from first draft to filming-approved. "I mean, look – things adjust all the time. That happened in season one when like the 'Me Too' movement broke in the middle of the season, and we had to go back and rethink a lot of things. So, we're sort of used to this organic movement of the scripts always transforming a little bit, based on what's happening in the world. So, that doesn't really scare us. That's pretty par for the course. You're always rewriting these things right up until the day before they shoot and, sometimes, the day they shoot. So, we're used to changing things as the world changes – but yes, we definitely adjust scripts as new events come to light," the showrunner explained.

But in terms of where the series and characters are heading during their final run, Kripke adds that the "big picture" endgame plans don't change. "We have, in terms of the big picture of the story, like it stays the same. I mean, especially in the final season when every character has to reach their climax – like we've had those in our back pocket for a while and this season is mostly just figuring out how to get there, you know? So, it's more like the stuff that the characters talk about that's happening in society, and some of the joke targets we're taking, and some of that stuff changes, but the main bones of it stay pretty similar."

"We're gonna look at the chips we have on the table right now. I live in absolute terror of becoming the thing we've been satirizing for five years," Kripke shared during a recent conversation with Collider, explaining why he continues to be cautious about expanding the show's universe too much, too soon. "The thing about 'The Boys' is that it's punk rock, and it hurts extra hard when punk rockers sell out. I'm really working hard to not sell out. We do these shows because we really care about them and we're passionate about them, and they can tell fresh stories that we can't tell in 'The Boys' and not just be about rapid expansion but be very careful and mindful about the choices we're making and being able to defend why we're making them. I worry about that every single day," he added. "I just want people to say, maybe it's for them, and maybe it isn't for them, but gotta hand it to them, they maintain a consistent level of quality."

Thanks to the internet, he now has 40,000 followers on Telegram, a podcast on alternative medicine and geopolitics, and a suspiciously high number of PayPal donations from people called “WolfSpirit88” and “TruthSeeker1972”.

Conspiracy theorists are everywhere now. They walk among us, smiling benignly while secretly believing that the Moon landing was filmed in a warehouse just off the M25, that Greta Thunberg is a hologram generated by the Rothschild banking dynasty, and that Bill Gates is hiding inside your central heating system, collecting your biometric data every time you boil an egg.

It's not that the modern conspiracy theorist is wrong about everything. No, the problem is that they're right about nothing—but deeply, profoundly confident about it. Certainty, you see, is their chief commodity. It's the only currency accepted in their parallel universe, where logic is elitist, facts are fascist, and evidence is what you feel in your waters at 3am after half a bottle of gin and a YouTube binge.Take climate change. Now, to you and me, the notion that pumping billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for two centuries might just be warming the planet is not terribly controversial. But to the conspiracy theorist, this is merely another facet of the Great Lie. The Earth, they say, has always gone through “natural cycles”—though strangely, these cycles now include wildfires in Sweden and beachfront properties in Sheffield.The climate change denier is a curious beast. He will confidently tell you, between puffs on his diesel-powered vape, (why do conspiracy theorists all seem to smoke vapes? ) that global warming is a hoax cooked up by Al Gore and lizard people to sell solar panels and vegan yoghurt. He is often the same man who believes George W. Bush personally detonated the Twin Towers using thermite, WiFi, and a remote control shaped like Dick Cheney's reproductive organ.Indeed, there seems to be a remarkable overlap in conspiracy circles. One moment you're reading a blog post titled “Chemtrails and the Cabbalistic Agenda of the Illuminati”, and the next it's a twelve-page screed explaining how Covid-19 was “a psy-op orchestrated by Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum to force us all to drink cricket smoothies and submit to compulsory yoga”.According to this crowd, the pandemic didn't really happen. The dead bodies were crisis actors. The hospitals were empty. The footage of overwhelmed Italian ICUs was staged—possibly by Stanley Kubrick's ghost. And the vaccines? Ah, those were clearly designed to sterilise the population, implant nanobots, or possibly just make you slightly more left-wing.Of course, they'll say, “I'm just asking questions.” Which is conspiracy-speak for “I watched four hours of TikTok videos and now I have a PhD in virology, atmospheric science, and the globalist occult.” Asking questions is the sacred rite of the conspiracy theorist. But they never ask the one that matters: “What if I'm completely wrong and mildly unhinged?”Another sure giveaway is the use of capital letters where none are needed. “WAKE UP SHEEPLE!” they bellow in comment sections. “THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE! OPEN YOUR EYES!” It's as though they've confused political awareness with being trapped in a malfunctioning Caps Lock key.And then, of course, there's the “New World Order”—the all-purpose bogeyman of the paranoid imagination. To hear them tell it, a cabal of billionaire paedophiles meets every Thursday in a Swiss bunker to decide everything from interest rates to the colour of your socks. The EU, naturally, is their local franchise. And who's the regional manager? None other than the world's worst defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen.Yes, her.To suggest that Ursula von der Leyen is competent at her job is, to the conspiracy theorist, the ultimate shibboleth. Only they, the enlightened ones, understand that she's not a beleaguered bureaucrat wrestling with 27 bickering member states and a terminal shortage of talent. No, she is the High Priestess of the Euro-Soros-LGBT-Woke-Techno-Malthusian cult that secretly runs everything, including your local recycling rota.It's difficult to say how these ideas persist. You'd think, after 23 years of waiting for the “Deep State purge” promised by anonymous online accounts and guys called Dave with shaved heads and GoPros, they'd be a little chastened. But no. The beauty of the conspiracy mindset is its immunity to time, disproof and reality. Like a medieval plague cart, it trundles on regardless, ringing its bell and spreading a miasma of absolute nonsense.You try to reason with them, of course. You point out that the Earth is round, vaccines work, and that if the world really were run by a secret elite, we'd at least have functioning trains. But they just smile, that knowing smile that says, “You're still asleep, my friend. Still clinging to your Newtonian physics and your parliamentary democracy.”Meanwhile, they continue their research—by which they mean watching an unshaven man in a caravan explain why 5G is turning us all into hummingbirds. Their definition of a “source” is “someone I agree with,” and their measure of truth is whether something “feels off”. Which is how we ended up with people earnestly claiming that Prince Philip faked his own death to return as a sentient cryptocurrency.Some of this might be funny if it weren't occasionally tragic. There are people who have lost friends, jobs, and even custody of their children because they genuinely believed they were resisting a global plot to enslave humanity via QR codes and oat milk. Conspiracy theories used to be fringe entertainment for stoners and shut-ins. Now they're public policy in parts of the internet, and occasionally, regrettably, Parliament.So what do we do? Ban them? Debate them? Build giant nets and lure them into humane captivity with leaflets about free energy and Area 51?No. Like bad manners and flatulence, conspiracy theories are probably with us to stay. They fulfil a deep psychological need: to impose meaning on chaos, to find patterns where there are none, and to feel secretly superior to all the dupes and drones who still think Tony Blair is human.But we can mock them. And mock them we must.Because satire, unlike the internet, has not yet been monetised by lizards. And because the best disinfectant is not sunlight—it's ridicule.So the next time someone corners you at a barbecue to explain how a secret cabal of climate scientists faked 150 years of temperature data in order to tax your wood burner, take a deep breath, smile, and ask them gently: “If they're so powerful, why haven't they stopped you from talking?”And then offer them a drink. Something strong. They'll need it when the next full moon rises, and the pigeons start broadcasting 6G brainwaves again.Main Image: Michael Foran via WikipediaClick here for more on News & Current Affairs at EU Today

Just when you thought royal drama had simmered down, Meghan Markle broke the internet again, and no, it is not because of a scandalous Netflix deal or a new podcast drop. This time, it is her pregnant twerking video that has conspiracy theorists foaming at the mouth.

To celebrate her daughter Lilibet's fourth birthday, the Duchess of Sussex posted a throwback video that was supposed to be heartwarming. Spoiler alert: it turned into a full-blown online spectacle. The clip features Meghan, nine months pregnant, dancing her heart out in a hospital room to Starrkeisha's “Baby Mama.” Prince Harry even makes a cameo before she breaks into some joyful twerking, all while heavily pregnant.



The fakest bump I've ever seen in my life https://t.co/gevbY6hHVd

 

Seems wholesome, right? Not to the trolls of the internet.

Conspiracy theorists on X (formerly known as Twitter, but still just as chaotic) wasted zero time. They dove in headfirst, accusing Meghan of faking her pregnancy again — with one term trending harder than ever: moonbump. According to some very loud keyboard warriors, her bump was “too high,” “too firm,” or just moved “weird.” Others screamed “AI-generated!” or claimed the hospital looked like a set built for a Lifetime movie.

Markle's bump is 100% fake though -- she's mocking women in labour and taunting the Royal Family with her fraudulent children.

 

One self-identified nurse went viral claiming Meghan should have had a cannula or IV drip if she was really in labour. Another claimed her ability to dance at full-term was “superhuman,” clearly forgetting that Meghan was not strapped to a bed but literally just vibing.



Screenshots flew. Zoomed-in freeze frames appeared with childish annotations. Someone even tried to point out inconsistencies based on her jewellery and lack of medical equipment. Because obviously, nothing screams “conspiracy confirmed” like earrings in a maternity ward.

Still, Meghan stayed cool. Alongside the video, she dropped unseen photos of Harry and baby Lilibet, including a barefoot beach stroll and a sweet newborn cuddle. She called the duo the “sweetest bond” and described her daughter as Harry's “favourite adventurer.”

Even while the name Lilibet still stirs royal tension, with some reports claiming the late Queen was less than thrilled, Meghan is clearly unbothered. She is busy harvesting honey with her daughter and planning potential future businesses together.

The internet might be spiralling, but Meghan Markle? She is still out here dancing, glowing, and telling her own story, moonbump or not.

I don't know what I was expecting… but to be left crying and filled with regret at how much I'd paid wasn't it.

A few weeks earlier, I decided to book an appointment to have a one-hour tarot card reading with a woman who describes herself as a psychic and medium.

A friend had recently tried it and said how uplifting it was, and a year earlier I'd watched a woman on TikTok discuss her 'eerily accurate' reading.

It just so happened they both went to the same place in London - I took it as a sign.

Around 40 minutes before my appointment, the psychic - who I shall called Harriet - calls me to apologise that she's running late as there is an issue with the Tubes.

Cue my friend's ‘she didn't see that coming' text…

Alas, another reason I'd wanted to give this a go was down to Michael McIntyre.

In his autobiography, the comedian tells how on a whim his then-19-year-old mother goes to a tarot card reading with a psychic who tells her she's pregnant, it will be a son and he will be ‘world-famous'.

When we finally start, Harriet tells me how honoured she is to be giving me my first reading. Gentle music plays in the background and the room is full of crystals.

‘The spirit brings me the right person at the right time.'

The cards from my reading, more on this later

Harriet assures me she won't deliver ‘scary' or ominous news but that ‘every message that comes through is what you need to hear' although ‘sometimes not what you want to hear.'

‘I see you looking out a bus window, wistfully,' she begins.

Harriet wasn't kidding about it not always being what you want to hear.

‘Most people come in when they are at a crossroads in their life. But you feel like you've got it. You've got an underlying sense of what is going to change and what's coming in. We need some reassurance.'

Harriet begins with my career.

‘I just get changes,' she says. ‘But sometimes not in the way you want - and not in a good way.'

Hang on, Harriet. I thought you weren't meant to deliver bad news…

‘There's a feeling of “I need to change”. Maybe relocation.'

Hmm, I ponder, I am quite happy in London and have no desire to move from my lovely flat. So where did she have in mind? A cottage in the countryside? A villa in the sunnier climes of Portugal?

‘Manchester,' Harriet signals her spirit guide is telling her.

Oh. I've never thought twice about that part of the country. I am from the south originally, so Manchester seems quite a rogue choice but you never know in the distant future…

‘Two months. End of August,' Harriet confirms.

Crikey. I'm locked into a contract on my flat until next year so that could be problematic.

‘You're about to jump on that train,' she continues.

Note, I have upgraded from a bus.

‘I feel like it's the same field, same kind of work but it's just broader. More of a place you can get to the top, that you can spread your wings and develop.'

Ok, well this sounds more promising.

‘It feels like you have a bit of a coach around you,' Harriet continues as she ‘tunes in with my energy and her team of spirits'.

‘This spirit pushing you and giving you all these wonderful words: ‘that's the name of the game', ‘we're going to go for it'. It feels like they've been with you for quite a while. It feels like a female spirit that's around you. Do you feel like that.'

Er.. no I don't.

‘Sometimes you might be given a message that this isn't the right time and you have to wait six months or so. But opportunities are coming sooner rather than later.'

So what are the spirit guides telling Harriet my next career move could be?

Brilliant... the death card  which came after the marriage card

‘Behind the scenes, I see scripts,' she says.

‘Have you ever worked in the theatrical arts? I'm seeing theatre and dialogue. It does feel like it's something unexpected. And colourful, I see a lot of colour around what you're writing. Explosions of colours around it.'

I continue to listen, puzzled, I have never worked in theatre and it's never appealed to me.

‘I'm also getting the message keep some mystery and secrecy around what you're doing. You've got some really good ideas that are not quite ready to be revealed.'

I must already be doing such a good job of keeping some mystery, I'm leaving myself in the dark.

‘I'm getting your mum,' Harriet then says. A lump forms in my throat.

‘Feels like you have support there.'

Now might be the time to confess another reason I found myself sitting in front of the psychic was because of my mum.

She died last year from cancer and I have been bereft without her ever since and desperate to somehow feel close to her again.

‘She steadies you,' Harriet says.

‘Feels like a steady relationship. You can confide in her. And that will be stabilising.

‘She feels like she can be an ally through this process. If nothing else really giving you some encouragement. But also she'll catch you if you fall is what I hear. You don't have a lot to lose by taking a leap of faith here. She's got your back.'

At this point I'm feeling both emotional and awkward. My mum was all of those things, but I can't bring myself to say anything to Harriet.

But then it gets worse…

‘I'm seeing your mum again,' she says.

‘Have you ever travelled with your mum? Maybe it would be a nice time for you two to go do something nice together, even if it's a long weekend. Because when you're around your mum's energy it does change your reality.'

Ah the real kick in the teeth. I'm too polite to say anything. 

Could it get any worse?

Yes.

Could have done without this card too... one man on crutches who can barely walk, the other freezing and poor

Harriet pulls out the death card… supposedly it doesn't represent death, but the end of something, it follows the marriage card. Reassuring.

The card showing people being stabbed in the back also makes an appearance, plus the one showing a man barely able to walk and ‘left outside in the cold'.

I make a mental note to quiz my friend again who found her reading ‘uplifting'.

It dawns on me how foolish I was to think my mum would send a message to me via a random woman in a rented room in London, or how she could actually predict my future.

I message my brother in tears feeling silly.

He swiftly brings me down to earth.

‘How much did you pay for that b*******?,' he replies.

‘Everything she said is complete chance and guess work. It means nothing.'

He's right.

Sigh, what a waste of £130 - but a lesson learned*.

*Unless in August I am working at a theatre in Manchester after going on holiday with my mum who has returned from the dead…

Likening a visit to the space station to a camping trip, former NASA astronaut and Axiom-4 mission commander Peggy Whitson said the orbital station has enough food, water and other supplies to sustain the daily lives of those on board.

"We have wet towels that we can use every day to clean ourselves. And we have enough resources from food and water perspectives that we can provide for ourselves. So it isn't like going to some ultra-rich hotel spa or whatever. It is very much a bit of a camping trip. But it's a lot of fun," she told NDTV.

Days ahead of the mission's June 10 launch, Dr Whitson said that the most "special part" would be the integration of her team of four with the seven astronauts already on board the International Space station (ISS). The orbital station, she said, is equivalent to inter-connected bus-sized modules of various sizes with four pull-up laboratories, a toilet, exercise hardware and life support systems. "There's actually a lot more space than you think. But obviously, by increasing the crew size by four, it will be a challenge for us to all integrate and work together," she said when asked if the ISS will become crowded when the Axiom-4 team enters it.

Should the Axiom-4 mission launch be successful, Dr Whitson and her team members Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, European Space Agency project astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski of Poland, and Tibor Kapu of Hungary will be seen floating around the orbital lab amid its screens, plugs, wires, switches, pipes and knobs. But what she is confident of is life far beyond among the billions of galaxies that unfold outside the space station's portal windows.

"I haven't seen any (extraterrestrial life) with my own eyes. But what I have seen is just billions and billions of stars. And this is just our little galaxy. And there's billions and billions of galaxies. And I know, I know there has to be other life out there, because it is so expansive. I'm sure it exists, it may not look or sound like us," Dr Whitson said. That, she said, is the what pushes the idea of exploration and drives the continuous development of technologies further and further to find out about life beyond Earth.

Dr Whitson and her colleague Mr Shukla, who is called "Shux" by the team, will especially look at India from space. "All of planet Earth is beautiful. India is special as well. It's relatively easy to pick out India because of the geography. I'm looking forward to seeing it again," she said.

The Axiom-4 mission will launch on June 10 at 5.52 pm IST on board SpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. Mr Shukla will be the second Indian to travel to space four decades after Rakesh Sharma's iconic spaceflight onboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft in 1984.

Once docked, the astronauts plan to spend up to 14 days aboard the orbiting laboratory, conducting science, outreach, and commercial activities.

The Axiom-4 astronauts will perform around 60 scientific studies and activities representing 31 countries during their 14-day stay at the ISS. Mr Shukla is set to conduct exclusive food and nutrition-related experiments developed under a collaboration between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), with support from NASA.

The experiments aim to pioneer space nutrition and self-sustaining life support systems, vital for future long-duration space travel. ISRO has lined up a set of seven experiments for Mr Shukla, who will also participate in five joint studies planned by NASA for its human research programme. It has drawn up plans to focus on India-centric food for carrying out experiments on the ISS, including sprouting methi (Fenugreek) and moong (green gram) in microgravity conditions.

With 15 years under its belt, The CW's Supernatural is packed full of memorable characters. However, few can equal the gravitas and impact of Death. The inherent power that oozes from actor Julian Richings has become legendary in Supernatural circles. Later in the series, actress Lisa Berry donned the scythe of Death, adding her flair to the character after the on-screen demise of the original incarnation.

Each appearance of Death carried significant weight and serious implications for the overarching storyline. Considering the perceived absence of God in Supernatural, until Chuck's eventual reveal in season 11, Death was the top cosmic, primordial powerhouse present in the show. In Supernatural, everything dies, and that doesn't happen without Death.

When Death first graced the screen in Supernatural, the character's legacy was cemented. Sporting a fancy car and heralded by his theme song, Death's stylish stride down the streets of Chicago is one of the most well-known scenes in the show's history. Death proves instrumental to Sam and Dean's fight against Lucifer in season 5. The rings of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are necessary to unlock Lucifer's cage, and Death's ring is the final piece to the puzzle. At their meeting in the pizzeria, Death reveals to Dean that he is much older than the universe itself and perhaps even older than God.

Death informs Dean that he is bound to do Lucifer's bidding against his will and agrees to give the Winchesters his ring to aid their plans. This is a pivotal point in the season as Sam and Dean are gearing up for their showdown with the Devil. It's made apparent that if Death did not agree to help them, the boys had next to no chance of obtaining his ring due to his power. Dean first approaches with Death's scythe, which can reap any creature, in hopes of coercing Death to give up the ring, and Death makes the scythe disappear and reappear in his hand to a visibly shaken Dean.

In the Supernatural mid-season finale of season 6, Dean seeks Death's help to restore Sam's soul from Lucifer's cage. Dean visits a colleague of his father's named Dr. Robert. He knows the only way to get a face-to-face meeting with Death at this point is if he does. Dr. Robert agrees to stop his heart and warns Dean that he has only about 3 minutes to conduct his business before the situation turns dire. Death seems amused yet entertains Dean's proposal to rescue Sam's soul from Hell, under one condition.

Supernatural is a series that drew in a wide range of fans who loved following Winchester's adventures. But which characters were the best?

Death's counteroffer is that Dean must take over his role for 24 hours. To teach Dean a lesson about the delicate nature of the circle of life and how upsetting it can have catastrophic results, he wanted Dean to see things from his perspective. The result is Dean realizing what a burden it is to bear Death's responsibility, and just how quickly things can go awry by deciding to save only one life that is destined to die. After the 24 hours is up, Death keeps his part of the bargain by saving Sam's soul. This is the turning point in season 6 as it introduces the arc of Sam's tortured soul, eventually breaking through the mental barriers Death placed in his head to keep him from reliving his time in the cage.

After Castiel absorbs the souls of Purgatory, becoming the new "God" in the season 6 finale, the Winchesters decide it would be best to seek Death to help deal with their new problem. To further their issues, the mental wall placed in Sam's head to protect him from his immense trauma suffered in Lucifer's cage is close to breaking. They're aware that a spell exists to bind Death to do their bidding because Lucifer could do so before the apocalypse. The boys summon Crowley and ask him for the spell. Crowley warns them they are playing with deadly forces, but ultimately gives them the scroll that lists the spells' ingredients.

Once they've gathered the ingredients, Sam, Dean and Bobby start the ritual to summon and bind Death. He is not happy at this turn of events. Castiel appears after the spell and threatens to kill them, but Dean says that is impossible since they have Death under control. This leads to Castiel breaking the spell, and a war of words ensues between the new "God" and Death. Death gets over his anger at the Winchesters, becoming increasingly annoyed by Castiel's arrogance. This is a key point in establishing the future villains of season 7, as Death warns Castiel that there are things older than souls in Purgatory, hinting at the presence of the Leviathans.

In the aftermath of the demon trials at the end of season 8, Sam is in a bad way. His body is broken, and all the angels have fallen from Heaven because of Metatron's spell. Dean is searching for answers on how to save his brother, as Sam is unconscious in the hospital. Dean is fighting off rogue angels in the hospital's hallway when he is saved by a seemingly friendly angel named Ezekiel, who is actually the angel Gadreel. Ezekiel offers to try and heal Sam before they are overrun by angels at their position.

Inside his head, Sam encounters Death. Death tells Sam that he has been waiting for him, and Sam is close to giving in. Ezekiel informs Dean that his attempts to heal Sam are not working, but if he can inhabit Sam's body, he can heal himself and Sam from within. Dean enters Sam's psyche with help from the angel Ezekiel and pleads with him not to go with Death, ultimately tricking him into agreeing to allow Ezekiel to enter his body. Sam's choice not to go with Death and allow Ezekiel to heal him sets up the storyline for the entirety of Season 9 of Supernatural, as Sam and Dean become at odds after Sam discovers he was tricked into being possessed by an angel.

The finale of season 10 of Supernatural is also the episode in which the original Death appears. Most of the season sees Dean struggle with the Mark of Cain and becoming prone to ever-increasing violent outbursts. He isolates himself from Sam and Castiel as they search for options to remove the Mark of Cain from him, deciding that using Rowena's Book of the Damned is their best option. Rowena informs them of the ingredients the spell requires while Dean is still causing trouble. Castiel ultimately summons Crowley to help them gather the items for the spell.

The CW's Supernatural took fans on a ride for 15 seasons. With various complex plot devices and storylines, some aspects of the show remain a bit odd.

Dean eventually calls on Death and asks him to kill him as the Mark of Cain is changing him into a monster. Unfortunately for Dean, Death says that not even he can kill him because the Mark requires a host, as it houses a primordial being known as The Darkness. If The Darkness were set free from the Mark, it would mean the end of humanity. Sam finds Dean, and a brutal fight ensues. As Death hands Dean his scythe to kill Sam, Dean uses it on Death and kills him. Dean killing Death is significant as now there must be a new Death, and since the Mark of Cain is removed without transferring hosts, Amara is unleashed, setting the primary antagonist for the following season.

Billie was a reaper under the original Death's reign. She appears in the second episode of season 11, "Form and Void." She is seen in the hallway of a hospital where Sam is trying to cure the disease caused by the Darkness. She is singing the song "O' Death," which plays during the first on-screen appearance of Death in season 5. This hints at her eventual resurrection as Death in season 13. Billie, the reaper, is killed by Castiel in Season 12 to free the Winchesters from a blood oath they took from Billie.

The episode begins as a typical monster-of-the-week Supernatural special. Sam and Dean investigate a haunted sanatorium where two boys were attacked and discover the ghost of an evil doctor still haunts the building, keeping the ghosts of his former patients hostage. There are parallels to Dean's encounter with Death in the "Appointment in Samarra" episode. To find the bodies of the ghosts and set their spirits free, Dean injects himself with medication to stop his heart. He then encounters Billie in her new job as Death. She informs him that now is not his time to die and that he and Sam have a lot of work to do. This establishes Billie as a major player, as she now has access to all of death's powers and abilities.

Rowena is on a rampage as she's traveling through the northwest and murdering the upper management of major pharmaceutical companies. Upset that they trusted her, Sam and Dean pursue her. Not only is she harming humans, Rowena is incinerating the reapers that collect the souls of the recently deceased. Jessica, a reaper assigned to spy on Sam and Dean by Death, tells them she is upsetting the natural balance of the universe by killing people before their time is due, and this can have cosmic consequences.

Rowena reveals to Sam and Dean that she is trying to get Death's attention by killing her reapers. She wants to make a deal to bring her son, Crowley, back from the dead. Billie is not the Death of old, who almost found it amusing for people to return from the dead. She plays strictly by the rules. Billie appears before Rowena, and the witch attacks her with all of her magic, but it does nothing to Death. Billie takes pity on Rowena and tells her she has changed for the better, and sometimes people lose things they can't get back. This marks a major turning point for Rowena as a character, and she aids Sam and Dean in their fight against the apocalyptic world of angels.

The multiverse version of the Archangel Michael has trapped Dean inside his head, placating him with false visions. Dean thinks he owns a bar and continues living out this loop day after day, while Michael uses his body to take over the world. Outside, Sam, Castiel, Jack, and a group of hunters gather to fight off Michael's monsters and attempt to free Dean from his mental prison. Sam decides upon an experimental device found within the Men of Letters headquarters that will allow him and Castiel to enter Dean's mind and convince him to expel Michael. As Sam and Castiel struggle to convince Dean he is living in an illusion, the monsters created by Michael attack the secret bunker.

Once Dean finally comes around to the idea, a fight ensues between Dean, Sam, Castiel and Michael. They can eventually lock Michael inside of Dean's head. Outside, Jack uses his powers to exterminate the siege of monsters, draining a bit of his soul. Dean is alone in his room gathering his thoughts as Death appears. She informs him that his various death books in her library now all end the same, with Michael breaking from his prison and ending the world. The only other option is for Dean to lock himself and Michael in a magical device called a Ma'lak Box, designed to hold archangels. Jack ultimately kills Michael, but the importance of Death's mentioning the Ma'lak Box is shown when the Winchesters use it to contain Jack. This sets up their brief conflict with Jack and eventually God.

In the season 14 finale, Jack is unintentionally causing a worldwide catastrophe. Upset that the Winchesters attempted to lock him in the Ma'lak Box, he flees. As he roams the city, he can hear all the lies being told to each other simultaneously by people in the streets. He orders them all to stop lying, causing everyone to be unable to lie. The result is complete chaos. These events force Chuck to appear and interfere, claiming Jack is a big problem. Dean wants to kill Jack, while Sam and Castiel are torn. Chuck fashions a gun that he says is the only way to defeat Jack, but the catch is that it will also kill whoever shoots it.

In Supernatural, Chuck does not fear much, considering he is God. However, Sam can detect that there is a hint of fear present when it comes to Jack. This episode marks the veil of Chuck's true intentions being lifted. He is more interested in an interesting story than in helping them. As Dean finally tracks Jack down, he realizes he cannot bring himself to kill him. This angers Chuck, and he kills Jack himself, without the gun, proving he was lying about it being the only way. Jack wakes up in The Empty, and Death appears to him. This is a pivotal moment that sets up the final season of the show. With Chuck being the final and ultimate antagonist, Billie begins to groom Jack to be able to kill God.

In the finale of season 14 of Supernatural, Sam winds Chuck with the gun meant to kill Jack. This prevents Chuck from leaving this world and creates a mental bond between Sam and God. Sam is captured by Chuck so that he can examine the mysterious wound that ties them to each other and him to this version of Earth. Meanwhile, Dean and Castiel learn from Michael that there is a spell capable of trapping God, however, one requirement is a Leviathan Blossom, which only blooms in Purgatory. Dean and Castiel set out to find the plant while Sam is tortured by Chuck. Unbeknownst to Sam, the true reason his connection to God via the gunshot wound will not heal is because he still has hope that they can defeat Chuck.

Chuck cooks up a plan to show Sam an alternate future where they defeat Chuck, and the world is in dire straits. Monsters rule, and the Winchesters become vampires as all of their loved ones are killed. This breaks Sam's hopes while simultaneously freeing Chuck from his bind to this world. As Dean and Castiel arrive from their adventure in Purgatory, it is too late, and Chuck easily destroys the magical bomb they crafted for him. As the episode ends, viewers see Jack and Death in The Empty. Billie says to Jack, "It's time." Billie was clever in waiting to return Jack from The Empty as Chuck was tied to their world. She knows Jack is their only hope. Death is instrumental in the true plan to defeat God. If she allowed Jack to return too soon, Chuck would notice him and kill him again.

Former Patriots head coach Bill Belichick still has a lot of explaining to do regarding some of the mystifying decisions he made during his lengthy tenure coaching the team.

More often than not, when a controversy unfolds — in everyday life or even in the wide, wide world of sports — eventually the truth will come out, and folks will be able to say, “Ahhhh — that kind of makes sense.”

But there are several sports mysteries on the Boston sports landscape that, to this day, months, years, perhaps even decades later, we still don't have sufficient answers for.
