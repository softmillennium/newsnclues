                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff defeated Aryna Sabalenka in three sets on Saturday to win the French Open, marking the first time the 21-year-old has won at Roland Garros in her young career. To claim her second career Grand Slam title, Gauff won the three-set battle (6-7, 6-2, 6-4) to beat Sabalenka. ‚ÄúI'd like to congratulate Aryna," Gauff said. I know today was a tough match, but you deserve all the results you've been having. Every time we play, it's such a tough match for me. Sabalenka fought back tears acknowledging the loss hurt, especially after not playing her best tennis, but she was congratulatory of Gauff on the well-earned victory. "In these tough conditions you were a better player than me. Well done on a great two weeks. Congrats on the second Grand Slam, well deserved here. Entering Saturday's matchup, Gauff and Sabalenka had previously faced off twice in majors and split those matchups 1-1. There will surely be more matchups to come between the two great competitors. Sabalenka has three Grand Slam titles but is still seeking her first French Open win, and Gauff is now up to two Grand Slam victories.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two years after winning her first Grand Slam title, Coco Gauff has taken home her second crown. The victory at Roland-Garros came three years after Gauff last made the final, where she fell to Iga ≈öwiatek in a disappointing loss. This time, she got to lift the trophy. On a windy day in Paris, with rain threatening to fall, Sabalenka showed her power early in the match, taking a 4-1 lead in the first set. But Gauff rallied to tie Sabalenka and later force a tiebreaker. Sabalenka, who grew visibly frustrated, was able to win the tiebreak after a comeback of her own. In the third set, Gauff took an early lead, but Sabalenka stayed right behind her, finally getting some momentum of her own. Gauff, who stayed calm the entire match, was able to take advantage of those in order to get the victory. Sabalenka hit the ball just out of bounds, and Gauff immediately dropped to the floor, overwhelmed with emotion. Notably, Gauff's second major title came in much the same way as her first. But both players are better than they were three years ago, even playing with very different styles. Sabalenka's strength tends to come from her power, whereas Gauff's typically comes from her quickness and creativity on the court. Sabalenka will have to settle for second place after making her first French Open final, and she was emotional in the ceremony after the game.</p>

But Gauff showed resilience, breaking back after losing seven straight points on serve before saving a triple break point. In a recurring theme, Sabalenka, who had four double faults and 32 unforced errors, thanks to a nearly 30 mph gusting wind, and Gauff took turns breaking each other's serve, including Gauff getting the upper hand in a 13-minute 10th game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff claimed her first French Open title by beating Aryna Sabalenka in windy conditions on Saturday, winning 6-7, 6-2, 6-4. The world's top two tennis players met at Roland Garros, with both of them chasing their maiden French Open title. 2 Gauff, who already has a huge net worth after a record-breaking payday last year, went into the event with just one Grand Slam to her name, the 2023 U.S. Open. Top-ranked Sabalenka, meanwhile, boasted three major titles, having previously won the Australian Open twice and last year's U.S. Open. She went into Saturday's match as the favorite after beating Gauff on clay at the Madrid Open final last month. She then got the job done during a nervy final game, just managing to hold her serve to win 6-4. Gauff is the first American to win the women's singles at Roland Garros since Serena Williams picked up her third and final French Open title in 2015. "I am emotional," said British tennis star Naomi Broady on BBC Radio 5 Live. It is the reaction of her (Gauff's) mum and dad as she makes her way up to the box. They are the first people she sees. The three of them just enjoyed an embrace down there together. Sablenka said after the match: "This one hurts so much. Especially after such a tough two weeks. "Playing great tennis and then in these terrible conditions to show such terrible tennis in the final, it really hurts. In these tough conditions, you were a better player than me. Well done on a great two weeks. Congrats to you and your team." Wind in Paris made Saturday's match tough for both players, with only 15 service games won and 13 double faults made. 1 who lost to Patrick Rafter in the 1997 U.S. Open final, noticed the brutal conditions in Paris while commentating on BBC Radio 5 Live. "The wind is really spinning in this stadium, so I think this is going to be a tricky opening game for Coco Gauff, especially with her service toss." He then added during the second set: "These conditions are so mentally challenging.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff has won the French Open for the first time by defeating top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 in Saturday's final. The second-ranked Gauff came out on top of a contest that was full of tension and momentum swings to claim her second major trophy after the 2023 U.S Open, where she also came from a set down to beat Sabalenka in the final. 2 final in Paris since 2013, when Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova, and just the second in the last 30 years. After Sabalenka sent a backhand wide on Gauff's second match point, the 21-year-old American fell onto her back, covering her face with both hands before resting her forehand on the clay. After greeting Sabalenka at the net, she hugged film director Spike Lee and celebrated with her entourage, three years after she lost in her first final at Roland-Garros. Gauff responded by raising her level, winning a superb rally in the third game that drew loud cheers and applause from the crowd. After an intense exchange of drop shots, Gauff hit a lob that Sabalenka chased down before attempting a shot between her legs ‚Äî only for Gauff to intercept it at the net and finish with a winner. Gauff was consistent from the baseline and earned a break point which she converted when Sabalenka double-faulted, giving her a 2-1 lead. Sabalenka turned toward her box and shouted in frustration but then regained her composure, breaking back to level the match at 3-3. She was broken again at love, however, and Gauff then held serve twice to claimed the title after a match that lasted 2 hours, 38 minutes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let's take a closer look at the singles draws that promise to captivate fans across both the ATP Tour and WTA. The ATP 250 event in Stuttgart once again lives up to its reputation as a player-favorite warm-up for Wimbledon. 1 Alexander Zverev headlines the draw, hoping to lift the trophy on home soil and find his rhythm on grass. He'll be joined by an electric mix of American firepower: Tommy Paul, Taylor Fritz, and Ben Shelton, all of whom have posted strong results on faster surfaces. Meanwhile, all eyes were set on Nick Kyrgios's return, although the unpredictable and entertaining Aussie has sadly had to withdraw from the entire grass-court season with continued injury concerns. This draw promises a dynamic blend of finesse and aggression, tailor-made for Stuttgart's slick courts. 1 Daniil Medvedev tops the draw, bringing his counterpunching brilliance to the grass, a surface he's grown increasingly comfortable on in recent years. Joining him is Aussie speedster Alex de Minaur, whose ability to retrieve and redirect pace makes him a dark horse on this surface. Local hero Tallon Griekspoor will carry Dutch hopes, while France's Arthur Fils, one of the most exciting young players on the ATP Tour, looks to notch a statement win on grass. Expect a wide-open affair with multiple potential champions. Big-serving Liudmila Samsonova, a proven grass-court performer and defending champion, returns to the Netherlands looking to repeat her 2023 success. She'll face stiff opposition from compatriots Ekaterina Alexandrova, Veronika Kudermetova, and Anastasia Potapova, all of whom are capable of deep runs. Danielle Collins, fresh off a resurgence in form, adds an American flavor to the draw. Other names to watch include Belgium's Elise Mertens, Poland's Magda Linette, and Colombian standout Camila Osorio. With a mix of seasoned veterans and rising stars, this draw is as balanced as it is unpredictable. In a historic return, the WTA makes its long-awaited comeback to Queen's Club with the HSBC Women's Championships, the first WTA event at this venue in over five decades. Jessica Pegula, Elena Rybakina, and Petra Kvitova headline the field, each boasting powerful, efficient grass-court games. Americans Madison Keys and Amanda Anisimova bring their aggressive styles to London, while rising Chinese star Qinwen Zheng adds further intrigue. Former French Open finalist Barbora Krejcikova, Brazil's Beatriz Haddad Maia, and Canadian crowd favorite Leylah Fernandez round out a field that is loaded with title threats from top to bottom. This event marks an important stepping stone for Wimbledon preparations‚Äîand with such a stacked lineup, fans are in for a treat. From Stuttgart to ‚Äòs-Hertogenbosch and now to London, the first week of grass court play in 2025 is shaping up to be one of the most compelling in years. With Grand Slam champions, breakout stars, and hometown favorites all in action, the stakes are high and the margins slim. Stay tuned, because the road to Wimbledon begins here.

Aryna Sabalenka continues to dominate the sport of tennis, with the Belarus native at No. 1 in the world and Grand Slam wins at the Australian Open and U.S. Open, plus a finals appearance at the 2025 French Open.

And if you're wondering: does she have a boyfriend? The answer is: yes!

As we've written before: "She's also spoken about how happy she is with her current boyfriend, Georgios Frangulis. The Brazilian owner of brand Oakberry and the tennis star went Instagram official in May of 2024 ... and he's been seen at her matches ever since."

Are they still together? That answer is yes, given the photo of Sabalenka and Frangulis that popped up on her Instagram page while they were in France as she competed in the Grand Slam:

She's said some lovely things about him as they've dated, including this Instagram post in 2024:

He's been extremely supportive as she's risen to the top of the tennis world, and it's great to see them still together as she tries to win more Grand Slams.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jim Courier has outlined what he'll be looking out for at Wimbledon to confirm if Novak Djokovic is close to retiring from the sport. Novak Djokovic, clearly demoralised by the nature of the result, seemed to bid farewell to Roland Garros in a more emotional way than many expected. This has sparked mass fear of his potential retirement. Speaking live on TNT Sports' US coverage just last night, naturally Djokovic was the main topic of conversation. After all, not only had he put in a strong showing against the world number one, but the manner in which he exited Philippe Chatrier left many wondering whether the French Open would ever see him again. Kissing the clay that has brought him so much success, Courier theorised that, whilst retirement might not be imminent, one thing would confirm its proximity that he'll keep an eye on at Wimbledon. He stated: ‚ÄòI will say this, too: My big takeaway from this match is if I see his emotional state like this at Wimbledon and at the US Open, when he's playing a match of this magnitude against a player of this magnitude, and he's not snarling, if he's smiling. ‚ÄòI mean, time's undefeated, but that was not representative of the emotional state when he's played his best tennis. He's always looking for edges in angles and things to get him motivated. It should come as no surprise to suggest that Djokovic could compete at Wimbledon, but now more than ever his chances of success are amplified. However, his 38-year-old body held strong, despite Djokovic admitting he was carrying an injury, and took him into the semi-finals. He performed so admirably, and will likely only get better on a surface where he has enjoyed supreme levels of success. Djokovic has given himself the perfect platform to head back to Centre Court full of confidence and belief that he can once again challenge at the apex of the sport.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner's classic win against Novak Djokovic saw the world No. 1 set up a mouthwatering men's singles final against Carlos Alcaraz (2) on Sunday at the 2025 French Open. Top seed Sinner beat seven-time finalist Novak Djokovic (6) in straight sets, 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(3) to make his first French Open final. Afterward, Djokovic admitted it could be his last ever match at Roland Garros. Defending champion Alcaraz reached the showpiece after Lorenzo Musetti (8) retired with an injury when down 6-4, 6-7(3), 0-6, 0-2 on Court Philippe-Chatrier. The Spaniard is looking for major No. 5, while the Italian aims for his third consecutive slam. Jannik Sinner's formula for mastering tennis on clay? If Carlos Alcaraz wins Sunday, he will have back-to-back French Open titles to his name. Alcaraz will have five slam titles, moving him in a tie with Frank Sedgman and Tony Trabert. He will be one back of tennis superstars Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg. If Jannik Sinner were to win Sunday, it would be his first career French Open title. It also gives him four slams, tied with his opponent Carlos Alcaraz. 1 arrives to the All England Club at Wimbledon, he will be a Championships title away from the career grand slam and the ‚ÄúSinner Slam‚Äù (all four majors at once). As Djokovic left Chatrier he put down his bags and waved to every corner of the stadium, before leaning down and touching the clay. Asked in his news conference just now about whether this was an indication that this was his last ever French Open, the three-time champion here said: ‚ÄúThis could have been the last match ever I played here, so I don't know. That's why I was a bit more emotional even in the end. I asked him whether this was an all-options-are-on-the-table situation, or if he's leaning towards it probably being his last, to which he replied: ‚ÄúI said it could have been my last match. So I don't know right now. 12 months at this point in my career is quite a long time. But will I be able to play in 12 months' time here again? Djokovic went on to say that he plans to play this year's Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, but those are the only events he's really thinking about right now. Novak Djokovic, 38, has admitted after the match that this could be his last ever match at Roland Garros. Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have met three previous times at majors. Their last meeting at a slam happened at the 2024 French Open, where Alcaraz rallied from two sets to one down to win in five 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. 2 seed emerged victorious over the world No. Men's tennis gets the Grand Slam final it has craved since 2022 ‚Äîwhen Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz produced five hours and 15 minutes of the impossible on Arthur Ashe Stadium at the U.S. Open ‚Äî but that it has never had. Sunday's final will be the 12th meeting between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who will meet in Sunday's final, are just a couple levels better than everyone else. They have more magic in their hands. They see a ball streaming over the net that would make everyone else feel hopeless, and they sense an opportunity, not just to win a point but to snuff out any thought that the impossible might be beyond their reach. Djokovic used every ounce of his determination, power, creativity and experience to nudge Sinner out of his comfort zone. But for one game late in the second set, when Djokovic got his first break points against him in nearly seven full sets of tennis and sneaked within shouting distance of levelling the match, Sinner had every answer. Then came the tiebreak that looked set to be a microcosm of the match, before Sinner did what Sinner does when he's had enough. He got his toes up on the baseline and let his arm fly and pinned Djokovic in the back court. Down 2-0, with the chance to get proceedings back on serve, he got to the net, took dead aim at a short lob and pounded it into the net. Sinner finally had the lead he was never going to relinquish. Friday night at the French Open, Novak Djokovic played a level of tennis that few people on this planet will ever reach, and Jannik Sinner still beat him in straight sets. With his unmatched precision, and his ability to turn defense into offense with a snap of his hips and a flick of his wrists, Sinner beat Djokovic 6-3, 6-4, 7-6(3) in a match that was tight, nervy and at times physically wrenching. It was also an exhibition of baseline tennis, a barrage of changes in angle, redirections of pace and sliding lateral movement, from the man who redefined those things in the 2010s and the man who has remade them once more. Jannik Sinner beats Novak Djokovic to set up French Open final against Carlos Alcaraz As Lukas mentioned earlier, both the No. As have the women, with Coco Gauff (2) facing Aryna Sabalenka (1) tomorrow. Below is what Jannik Sinner accomplished with his semifinal victory today over Novak Djokovic, per the TNT broadcast: It's been five years since the No. 2 seeds have met in the men's singles final at Roland Garros. Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will be the latest No. 2 slam final matchup in Paris on Sunday. Jannik Sinner spoke on Philippe-Chatrier after reaching his first French Open final without dropping a set. That's why we love to (play tennis). It was such a special occasion for me. I had to step up, play my best tennis, and am very happy how I handled these situations. ‚ÄúNovak showed how much of a role model he is. What he's doing is incredible, I wish him the best for the rest of the season, and we are very lucky to see him playing such high-level tennis. Of course I try not to think about this, but before going on court, you feel the tension and what is coming against you. ‚ÄúI try to prepare myself in the best possible way. My head-to-heads lately don't look great against Carlos Alcaraz but I'm happy to be in the final, we will do our best and I will see what I can do.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThese are very rare and special moments in my career. We have tomorrow off and I will try to enjoy. Thank you for being so nice to me throughout the whole tournament and I will try to be prepared for the final.‚Äù Djokovic beat Carlos Alcaraz in four sets at the Australian Open in January, but overall I think he's been better tonight. Which feels odd to say given he has just lost in straight sets, but he's been sensational here. His best performance since last year's Olympic final by some way. Jannik Sinner secures the win in straight sets, 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(3). His bid for 25 Grand Slam singles titles is over. Jannik Sinner, ball on his own serve, three match points to play with. It's reassuring in a way that the athlete who has come as close to anyone to sporting perfection can still have a weakness. Novak Djokovic will have nightmares about that missed smash if he loses this set.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff are familiar foes, especially when it comes to the latter stages of tournaments. Gauff was just 19 when she took on Sabalenka, who had already won a major that year at the Australian Open, and many expected her to claim her second. When the first set went to Sabalenka 6-2, many would have been forgiven for thinking the match was already a foregone conclusion. However, what followed was one of the most thrilling comebacks in a major final as Gauff rallied to win the next two sets 6-3, 6-2 as Sabalenka uncharacteristically collapsed and lost all composure in her tennis. That match still haunts the 26-year-old to this day, who admitted that while she has learnt lessons, she still gets flashbacks from it. "That was very difficult match, I got a little emotional and had this little flashback on last year's final, meaning the crowd atmosphere," said after the 2024 US Open final. "I do never cry but the US Open happened. Y'all say what you want, I was not expecting that," she said on Instagram at the time. Not in front of people, I'll cry alone, I'll cry over a movie or a TV show but in front of people, no. "Because I'm supposed to be a thug. I'm like my dad though, for real. Today was the first time I've ever seen my dad cry. Since that US Open final, the pair have met four times - three semifinals and one final - with Sabalenka winning the most recent clash at the Madrid Open Their overall record is now tied at 5-5, and after their last contest, the pair hailed each other for an incredible tournament. "First I want to congratulate Coco and her team on an incredible few weeks here," Sabalenka said. "I'm super happy to see you back in the finals, playing your best tennis. Gauff shared positive sentiment towards her opponent as well. "I'd like to congratulate Aryna on an incredible tournament. "Congrats on all the success you've been having.‚Äù With the victory, Sabalenka has her 46th-ranked win over a top-10 opponent, with six consecutive triumphs and 12 consecutive sets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner beat Novak Djokovic 6-4 7-5 7-6(3) in a generational battle on Court Philippe Chatrier to deny his Serbian opponent a record 25th Grand Slam and leave him unsure whether he will ever return to Roland Garros, where he has won three major trophies. With Djokovic now the only active member of tennis' Big Four that also included Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Andy Murray and yielded a collective 69 major titles in more than two decades, Sinner sensed an opportunity for himself and Alcaraz. Only time can tell, to be honest," Sinner told reporters. "I believe that tennis or every sport needs rivalries. This could be potentially one of them, but there are amazing players coming up. There can be so many different and other players joining or one drops. Sunday's clash on Court Philippe Chatrier will mark only the 12th time that Sinner and Alcaraz have faced off, with the 22-year-old Spaniard looking for a fifth straight victory over his opponent to successfully defend his title. Djokovic said the pair would have to keep going to match the rivalry that he had with Federer, Nadal and Murray. "At the moment, that's hard, because they need to play against each for at least 10-plus years non-stop in order to be part of the same discussion," Djokovic added. "But they're definitely great for tennis, both of them. I think their rivalry is something our sport needs." "The moment he steps on court, you can feel his presence. In the end, that's exactly what tennis needs. "In the end, it's exactly those players who bring people closer to the sport and make them want to watch tennis."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain's great hope for the Wimbledon women's title opens up about being stalked and navigating the gritty side of a glamorous sport You can, in the first instance, be a teenage prodigy, the kind of freak who blazes on to the scene like a comet, taking on players double your age and beating them, all while studying for your A-levels. ‚ÄúIn some ways you want to be that child who's going to be the next big thing, a superstar from a young age, but there are caveats to it. ‚ÄòI've seen it throughout a lot of people's careers. This way may take longer, but the destination's the same, and when you arrive, you tend to be better able to deal with being there. At 28, having toiled as a professional for more than a decade, she is now Britain's number one-ranked women's tennis player and intends to stay there. ‚ÄúI'm not expecting to be an overnight success. I'm expecting to work for it,‚Äù she says. We're in tennis country, at a vast, beautiful house tucked down a long drive, where Boulter will be photographed today. ‚ÄúI must have driven this road a thousand times and never knew it was here,‚Äù she says, gazing at the place as she alights from an Uber. Boulter, who's in Nike athleisure with her trademark high ponytail, woke up at her home nearby only 20 minutes ago. She apologises immediately if she doesn't make any sense before she's had several coffees, but proceeds to be more lucid and honest about her sport than many manage in a career. She's only just overcome jetlag after flying home from the Miami Open. After all these years, it never gets any easier, even now she's in business class. The Boyfriend Exaggerated Cuff Green Stripe shirt, ¬£130, Devon Jumper Green and White Stripe, ¬£140 (on shoulders) both With Nothing Underneath, Suede Skirt, ¬£749, Cotton cable Knit Cricket Vest, ¬£229, Both Polo Ralph Lauren, Leather mary janes, ¬£200, G.H.Bass So it's quite challenging for a lot of players. There's people trying to change that, but it's pretty tough. Now fit, she's soared up the rankings, rising to a career-high world number 23 at the end of last year, after winning her first WTA titles, and in the process overtaking Emma Raducanu to be Britain's top woman for the past two years. Anything can happen, and for me it was going to be a matter of time before I got my ducks in a row. It's been nice seeing that come to fruition.‚Äù She ignored a foot injury for too long, which ended up halting 2024's momentum when it sidelined her earlier in the year, but she returned to help Great Britain into the finals of the Billie Jean King Cup when she and her doubles partner Jodie Burrage beat the Netherlands this April, before breaking new ground by earning the first WTA Tour clay-court win of her career, at the Troph√©e Clarins in Paris. That's all before the grass-court season starts, including playing at The Queen's Club as it hosts professional women's tennis for the first time in more than 50 years, and of course Wimbledon. Grass is Boulter's strongest surface, and she says, ‚ÄúThe epitome of tennis for me is Wimbledon and the grass season and playing at home in front of my friends and family.‚Äù And, occasionally, even more esteemed guests: in 2023 the Princess of Wales surprised her by turning up to watch her on day two of Wimbledon. Her older brother, James, was also a promising junior, but gave it up as a teenager and now slogs it out as an agent to Hollywood stars. When Boulter was starting secondary school, her father's work took the family to Florida, where she was briefly homeschooled and met various other young tennis starlets, including her now best friend, Laura Robson. Boulter hasn't seen him since, she says; her grandfather is ‚Äúprobably the biggest male influence I had growing up‚Äù. On court, Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Roger Federer and ‚Äúsome people outside of tennis, like Jessica Ennis‚Äù were her idols. She played Williams and Federer in the same few days at a tournament once. ‚ÄúIt was quite the week‚Ä¶‚Äù she says, shaking her head. Chronic fatigue, which struck in her late teens, now ‚Äúfeels like a long time ago, but I didn't feel like I could train or get the work done to be a tennis player‚Äù. As, in fact, has her agent, Dino Marcan, a tall, friendly Croatian. Boulter's support team has steadied in recent years, but it has also swollen by one, with the addition of her fianc√©, Alex de Minaur, the Australian currently ranked number seven in the men's game. (People who say the latter possibly haven't seen that film in full.) ‚ÄúWe played in the mixed doubles at Wimbledon a few years ago, and I think it was the most fun I've had in my life. I just love every second on the tennis court with him. I'd wondered if she might be less than keen to be asked about de Minaur, but she beams whenever he comes up. I try to have a positive impact on that, and he brings me so much great advice. He's been the stable part of my life, and it's so important to have that.‚Äù I cannot help but notice she's wearing a diamond ring the size of Uluru. She laughs: ‚ÄúAlex and my mum did very well.‚Äù Boulter is a ‚ÄúRare Jewels ambassador‚Äù for Pragnell, and always wears beautiful pieces on court, but the ring doesn't go with her. ‚ÄúI'm just a tad paranoid about losing it. My team are always keeping an eye on it for me.‚Äù No date or location is set for the big day ‚Äì Boulter's family are in Leicestershire, de Minaur's is split between Australia and Spain. ‚ÄúI've not been a massive dreamer about my wedding ‚Äì as long as my family are there, I'll be happy. [But] I did sort of dream about a destination wedding, having a place you can go back to that's your place. Having de Minaur around gives Boulter an insight into men's tennis, which may be just as fiercely competitive as the women's game, but the off-court experience is different. It has always struck me, I say, that women in tennis are held to a far higher standard, especially when it comes to receiving criticism for doing anything other than training and winning. ‚ÄúYou do see a lot of [criticism] on social media, even I get a lot of that. You kind of get ridiculed for spending one second off the tennis court, which wouldn't be healthy for anyone in any other job. People expect you to be practising and playing at all times. But half of tennis is recovery, rehab, switching off ‚Äì all these things people do not see. ‚ÄúPeople judge but they don't see the full story. They don't see that we're human, and don't see the less glamorous side of things, they don't see me late at night in the treatment room having done 10 hours of work that day, they see one snippet of my time on court that day.‚Äù Boulter spoke last year about how common threats and stalking are in the women's game; how she and de Minaur have been followed around west London in a car, and a man once messaged her at the Nottingham Open to say, ‚ÄúI'm outside. Katie wears: Cotton dress, ¬£1,710, and leather racquet pouch, ¬£1,460, both Louis Vuitton. ‚ÄúIt's apparent in tennis, there's a lot that goes on,‚Äù Boulter says today. ‚ÄúSome of it you don't even see, it comes to my email and I don't even tell you.‚Äù I've had people tell me they're going to kill me even after one of my clients has won a tournament. ‚ÄúAnd some of them are just bored, hiding behind a keyboard. Has she ever been asked to throw a game? Obviously you report it straight away to the authorities. And I get double now, because every time Alex loses, they blame me‚Ä¶‚Äù She and de Minaur do, at least, make sure to stop talking about tennis as much as they can. ‚ÄúThat side of things is important, you have to know when to draw the line and take a moment for yourself. But when we're home we could be doing anything, him dragging me to the golf course, going on a date night in town, hanging out with my girlfriends, seeing my family.‚Äù Where would they go on a date night? ‚ÄúWe've changed, it could be going to a restaurant we've seen on Instagram or TikTok, or we just go into the arcades, or to Putt Putt [a crazy golf and karaoke place], the dodgems. ‚ÄúA lot of the time I'm in my Nikes, I love that and I've been with them pretty much my whole career, but getting out of my training kit is such a nice switch-off for me, knowing I'm in my casuals that day.‚Äù Fashion is Boulter's other great passion, and may well end up being the primary one in the long term. Katie wears: Piqu√© jacket, ¬£2,300, poplin shirt, ¬£1,150, matching skirt, ¬£1,290, metal belt, ¬£1,100, calfskin belt, ¬£510, suede shoes, ¬£710, and silk socks, ¬£290, all Miu Miu I find little boutiques around the world thanks to tennis, and love the feeling of finding something unique.‚Äù For now, though, the athleisure years continue as tennis reigns. A lot of the players Boulter met and played with or against when she was a teenager have long since dropped out. Now, with Queen's and Wimbledon in the offing, she plans to kick on again. But look at someone like [US player] Madison Keys, who won her first Grand Slam this year. She's 30, and could easily have quit a couple of years ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Aryna Sabalenka came through a battle against four-time winner and defending champion Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek to make the women's final where she will face American star Coco Gauff, who ended Lois Boisson's Cinderella story. Meanwhile, in the men's draw, Carlos Alcaraz defeated Italian star Lorenzo Musetti to make it to the final against world No. Here's everything you need to know about one of the world's oldest tennis tournaments: Starting out as the ‚ÄúFrench Clay-Court Championships‚Äù in 1891 ‚Äì allowing only players from France to compete ‚Äì the French Open was officially created in 1925 when foreign players were first invited. In 1927, a new arena was purpose built for France's defense of its 1927 Davis Cup title and named after Roland Garros ‚Äì not a sportsman, but a pioneering French aviator who was killed in World War I. But are the courts really made of clay? Clay makes up just a small part of the tennis court, with 1-2 millimeters of crushed red bricks giving them their famous red hue. Grueling five-set matches on clay can push players close to their physical limits. Related video Roland Garros: Why is clay the most difficult surface to play on? Matches on clay are also sometimes referred to as chess matches, where a well-placed shot can set up a winner two or three shots later. Clay also has considerably more friction than grass or hard courts, allowing the ball to grip to the dust and bounce much higher, in particular shots with heavy topspin. Even for a player as accomplished as Novak Djokovic, one of the sport's all-time greats, clay continues to be a tricky surface to master. ‚ÄúIt's a very demanding surface,‚Äù Djokovic said after recently winning his first clay court match since completing the ‚ÄúGolden Slam‚Äù at the Paris Olympics. While Roland Garros is considered the pinnacle of the clay season, there are many other ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (Women's Tennis Association) tournaments played on the red dust. This year, there are 18 tournaments scheduled to be played on clay in the ATP Tour, while the women will play 11 clay court tournaments in 2025. But hard court is still the most popular surface on both tours in 2025. Hard court is also favored by US players as most of the American tournaments are played on that surface. While some smaller tournaments pay the male winner more than female players, all four grand slams offer equal prize money. The US Open was the first to award both tournament winners equal money in 1973 ‚Äì something championed by Billie Jean King. The Australian Open followed suit 11 years later, offering men and women equal pay but reverted to paying men more in 1996. In November 2024, the ‚ÄúKing of Clay‚Äù played his final match of professional tennis when Spain lost in the Davis Cup. With 22 grand slams in his pocket ‚Äì including a record 14 French Opens ‚Äì we look at the new generation of tennis players who perform well on the red stuff. Will we ever see someone match Nadal's achievements on clay? This year, Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen modeled a unique calf-length pleated skirt ‚Äì inspired by Suzanne Lenglen's iconic style ‚Äì though she said she is ‚Äútoo shy‚Äù to wear it on the court. Related article ‚ÄòI didn't know it would cause such a stir': Serena Williams reveals how catsuit became an iconic fashion moment However, the most famous of all the Roland Garros outfits has to be Serena Williams' superhero-esque ‚Äòcatsuit' she wore in 2018 just months after giving birth to her first child. The glitz and glamor of the tournament also draws celebrities from all walks of life, with singer/producer/composer Pharrell Williams, actor Ben Stiller and three-time Formula One world drivers champion Jackie Stewart among those in attendance last year. We are guaranteed to see a brand new winner of the women's title ‚Äì who will see their name etched in history this weekend: Sabalenka or Gauff? In the men's draw, can Alcaraz become the first man to go back-to-back since his idol Nadal in 2020 or will Sinner win his first French Open?</p>

Novak Djokovic is yet to decide whether Friday's semifinal defeat against world No.1 Jannik Sinner would be his final appearance at Roland Garros. The 24-time Grand Slam winner and three-time French champion was beaten in straight sets after missing three set points in the third. "This could have been the last match ever I played here. I don't know," Serbian Djokovic told a press conference after losing 6-4 7-5 7-6(3). "That's why I was a bit more emotional even in the end. Gauff's growth: Coco targets more Grand Slam glory Legends gather at Roland Garros to farewell Rafael Nadal Those tournaments are the priorities of my schedule," he said. "Wimbledon and US Open, yes, they are in plans. He is currently tied at 24 for most majors won, with Australian Margaret Court. "I don't know really what tomorrow brings in a way at this point in my career," he said. I guess my best chances maybe are Wimbledon to win another Slam or faster hard court, maybe Australia or something like that. "Twelve months at this point in my career is quite a long time. But will I be able to play in 12 months' time here again? That's all I can say for the moment." Djokovic last lifted the Musketeers' Cup in Paris in 2023, while his most recent Grand Slam triumph came at that year's US Open. Since then, Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have combined to win the past five majors, and will make it a sixth after setting up their first Grand Slam final showdown.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is only one infinity stone missing from the Jannik Sinner vs. Carlos Alcaraz collection. The Spaniard is ahead 3-1 on clay (1-0 at Roland Garros) and he has won four straight overall against Sinner. In the semifinals 12 months ago, Alcaraz came back from several deficits to prevail 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. He most recently defeated the Italian 7-6(5), 6-1 in last month's Rome championship match.Of course, Sinner has a valid excuse for losing that one‚Äìas if anyone needs an excuse for getting beat by Alcaraz. 1's first tournament back from a three-month suspension, so he did well simply to reach the final. In Paris, however, anything less than the title would be a disappointment. His bid is alive and well following French Open victories over Arthur Rinderknech, Richard Gasquet, Jiri Lehecka, Andrey Rublev, Alexander Bublik, and Novak Djokovic. If anything short of lifting La Coupe des Mousquetaires would be a disappointment for Sinner, anything less than this showdown turning into an instant classic would leave tennis fans unfulfilled. These are by far the two best players on tour, with Sinner sporting an 18-1 record this season while Alcaraz is the ATP leader in wins (36) and titles (three). The recent Monte-Carlo and Rome champion finds himself in yet another final after taking out Giulio Zeppieri, Fabian Marozsan, Damir Dzumhur, Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul, and Lorenzo Musetti.In this match and perhaps even extending into the grass-court swing, Sinner's ban could be a blessing in disguise. Now, to the surprise of no one, he is ready to pounce.Alcaraz still might have an advantage in a marathon match, as the 22-year-old's five-set record is impeccable (12-1, including 2-0 in slam finals). It is true that Alcaraz's peaks are more altitudinous than Sinner's on clay, but the No. In a best-of-five struggle on clay, it's usually the player with a higher floor that comes out on top against a player with a higher ceiling.Look for Sinner to equal his rival with four major titles overall, putting himself one step away from the career slam‚Äìand the Sinner Slam.Pick: Sinner in 4    1042WWW: Sinner vs. Alcaraz? Both finals are intriguing and could go either way. I like the point that Sinner has been more consistent ,Alcaraz too up and down. Tries for too many winners and makes more errors. I think Djokovic would have done better against Alcaraz than Sinner , so Ill go for the Carrot in five. yup, I think Djoker would have had (somewhat of) a chance against Alcaraz Plus I like Sinner better than Alcaraz, he quieter and doesnt show off as much. There's still a chance he will win another one. Meanwhile Djokovic will continue on his journey of delusion, still believing he can win another major‚Ä¶ Guest agree it's getting tougher for him as he's not getting any younger, he's still beating the lesser players, but finding it harder against the top players now, still he has could do a Sampras and have that 1 last hurrah, and eek out one more GS, it won't be easy but if anyone can he can Sinner seems to be playing better than Alcaraz, having said that when Alcaraz gets his head straight he's the best there is on this surface, somebody said the next Rafa, wouldn't go that far just yet, but maybe Guga lol A long way off but if he's still playing, probably the AO Tennis is in great hands with the new era Global customers rely on Bloomberg Sources to deliver accurate, real-time business and market-moving information that helps them make critical financial decisions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andy Roddick predicted Novak Djokovic's Wimbledon finish during his recent podcast episode. Djokovic has been inconsistent in the past year, making deep runs at several events while also exiting early in a few. However, the last month has been fruitful for him. He bagged his 100th ATP Tour-level title with a triumph in Geneva before heading to the 2025 French Open. Next, he got the better of World No. During a short podcast episode, where Roddick recapped Day 13 of the French Open, the American made a bold prediction. He noted that the Serb has now found the right rhythm for a Grand Slam, avoiding the long gap that often left him questioning whether to enter smaller events that offered little motivation. Andy Roddick heaped praise on Novak Djokovic following his semifinal loss at the French Open. Despite being down two sets and struggling to gain control in rallies against Jannik Sinner, Djokovic continued to fight with the same passion he displayed early in his career. Roddick added that these moments of "limited upside" are, in some ways, even more impressive than Djokovic's dominating Slam wins, as they reflect a deep love for the game.
