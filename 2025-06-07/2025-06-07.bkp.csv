            Russia bombarded Ukraine's second-largest city with massive strikes in the early hours of Saturday, its mayor said, killing at least three people, one night after Moscow carried out one of the war's largest aerial assaults on Ukraine.
    


            Russia has conducted extensive attacks on Ukraine in recent days, in what is being viewed as retaliation for an audacious drone operation by Kyiv that debilitated more than a third of Moscow's strategic cruise missile carriers.
    


            The northeastern city of Kharkiv – which sits about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Russian border – was shaken by “at least 40 explosions” on Saturday, according to a Telegram post by Mayor Igor Terekhov.
    


            “Kharkiv is currently experiencing the most powerful attack since the start of the full-scale war,” Terekhov said. “The enemy is striking simultaneously with missiles, (drones) and guided aerial bombs. This is outright terror against peaceful Kharkiv.”
    


            Video released by emergency services showed a large fire burning in a multi-story apartment block in the Osnovyanskyi district in the city's southwest, where Terekhov said two people had died. One person was also killed in a strike that hit a house in the Kyivskyi district to the north, he said.
    


            Russia resumed its assault on Saturday evening. It launched a fresh round of strikes using glide bombs, killing another person and injuring 18 others, according to Ukrainian officials. Terekhov said the target of the second attack was a children's playground with a miniature railway.
    


            In response to the earlier assault, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Russia “continues its terror against civilians,” while calling for more pressure to be exerted on Moscow “to put an end to Russia's killing and destruction.”
    


            Russia said that its forces carried out high-precision strikes overnight on Ukrainian military facilities. “The strikes achieved their objectives. All designated targets were destroyed,” the Russian Ministry of Defense posted on Telegram.
    


            More than 50 drones, four guided aerial bombs and a missile were used in the attack which also damaged an administrative building and music school in the city, according to Kharkiv region prosecutor's office.
    


            Among the injured include a 14-year-old girl and a one-and-a-half-month-old boy, who is suffering from “acute stress,” the office added.
    


            Ruslana Sheveleva, a Kharkiv resident whose neighbors' house was struck in the attack, described the chaotic scenes as people scrambled to escape the building. “The house was hit, right where this young man was lying,” she told Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne.
    


            “I don't think he even understood what was happening. He died instantly. They dug his mother out from under the rubble. His father, as I understand it, managed to get out almost on his own,” she added.
    


            Iryna Ivanenko, another resident, said her 26-year-old daughter – who was later rescued by firefighters – begged her for help, trapped in her bedroom under a heavy slab. “I tried to lift the slab, but it was impossible,” Ivanenko told Suspline.
    


            Russian attacks in the country have killed at least seven people and injured more than 40 others since Friday morning, according to a CNN tally of figures from local authorities.
    


            Meanwhile, Russia accused Ukraine on Saturday of postponing the exchange of prisoners of war and transfer of deceased soldiers for an “indefinite” period.
    


            “The Ukrainian side unexpectedly postponed the transfer of bodies and the exchange of prisoners of war for an indefinite period,” Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky posted on Telegram. “For some reason, their negotiating team didn't even show up at the exchange point.”
    


            An agreement to work towards another prisoner swap was reached in Istanbul on Monday during a second round of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials.
    


            Medinsky – the head of Russia's delegation for the talks in Istanbul – claimed Saturday that Moscow had given Ukraine a list of 640 wounded, seriously ill and young prisoners of war to be exchanged.
    


            In addition, Russia has begun the repatriation of more than 6,000 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers, Medinsky said. “The first batch of 1,212 frozen bodies of Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers has already arrived in refrigerated trucks at the exchange point. The rest are on their way,” he said.
    


            Ukraine accused Russia of playing “dirty games.”
    


            “Today's statements by the Russian side do not correspond to reality or to previous agreements on either the exchange of prisoners or the repatriation of bodies,” Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said Saturday.
    


            The authority said that Ukraine has submitted a list of seriously wounded, ill and young servicemen to be exchanged, but claimed that Russia's lists “do not comply with the agreed approach.”
    


            “Ukraine has provided relevant comments, and the next step is now awaited from the Russian side,” the authority said.
    


            Commenting on the repatriation of soldiers' bodies, the authority said that “an agreement has indeed been reached,” but added that no date has been set for the transfer to take place.
    


            Several swaps have taken place between the two sides despite the ongoing conflict.
    

Ukraine's drone attack against Russian airfields on Sunday was audacious and daring. But most of all, it was meticulously planned and executed flawlessly against Russia. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh explains how the attack unfolded.

            Also on Saturday, Ukraine's air force said that it had shot down a Russian Su35 fighter jet as part of a “successful Air Force operation in the Kursk direction.”
    


            Russia did not immediately comment on the claim, but a Russian military blogger described the plane as lost and said that the pilot had been rescued.
    


            A day before the assualt on Kharkiv, in an apparent retaliation to Ukraine's drone swarm, Russia launched a barrage of drones and ballistic missiles across broad swaths of Ukraine, killing at least six people and injuring dozens of others.
    


            “They gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night,” US President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One late on Friday.
    


            Trump had earlier warned Russian retaliation was imminent, after speaking with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.
    


            It was not immediately clear if Putin intends further escalation.

Israeli banks should provide services to settlers whom the European Union has slapped with sanctions, despite any potential repercussions, the country's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has insisted. He warned that those failing to comply could be made to pay out hefty compensations.

Last July, the EU for the first time in its history imposed punitive measures on five Israeli settlers and three groups over “serious and systematic human rights abuses against Palestinians” in the occupied West Bank, which is considered part of Palestine under international law. Apart from an EU-wide entry ban and an asset freeze, the sanctions prohibit the “provision of funds or economic resources, directly or indirectly,” to the affected Israeli nationals.

In a post on X on Wednesday, the official, who is known for his far-right views, said that he had sent a letter to the banking supervisor, Dani Khachiashvili, in which he demanded an end to “the ‘zero risk' policy on the part of banks, which leads to the abandonment of Israeli customers under the guise of compliance with foreign sanctions.” Smotrich accused Israeli financial institutions of “small-mindedness” and unquestioning compliance with “unjust” EU sanctions.

He argued that banks in fact “have a significant ability to act against” Brussels' punitive measures, by taking legal action and wielding their “global economic connections.”

The official threatened that if his call was not heeded, he would push for legislation that would force Israeli financial institutions to pay out sizable compensations to the affected individuals. The Israeli finance minister further wrote that he could also promote legislation that would require the Bank of Israel to “open and manage bank accounts for citizens on whom sanctions are imposed.”

Speaking to AFP last month, Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said that Stockholm would “push for EU sanctions against individual Israeli ministers” since there was no “clear improvement for the civilians in Gaza.”

At around the same time, her Slovenian colleague, Tanja Fajon, announced that her country was “looking into the possibility of sanctions against Israel, alongside France and Ireland.”

Also in May, the UK and Canada, which are not part of the EU, along with France, issued a joint statement condemning the ongoing Israeli military campaign in Gaza.

The document accused the Israeli government of denying “essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population” of the Palestinian enclave.

London, Ottawa and Paris threatened to “take further concrete actions,” including “targeted sanctions,” should “egregious actions” on the part of Israel continue.

The statement also demanded that Israel halt settlement activities in the occupied West Bank.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has proposed creating the “America Party,” marking a sharp shift in political strategy. The move comes after a public falling out with US President Donald Trump, whom Musk strongly supported during last year's election. Musk set up and funded a pro-Trump political group, donating over $260 million, and was appointed by Trump in January to co-lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with reducing federal bureaucracy and wasteful spending. In response to the growing political divide, Musk conducted a poll on X this week, asking his 220 million followers whether it was time to launch a new political party representing the “80% in the middle.” The poll drew more than 5.6 million responses, with around 80% expressing support. Musk declared, “The people have spoken. A new political party is needed in America,” and proposed the name “America Party.” The rift between Musk and Trump deepened after Musk condemned Trump's $2.4 trillion tax and spending bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination.” Trump retaliated by threatening to cancel federal contracts with Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla. The conflict spilled onto social media, where Musk accused Trump of ties to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and called for his impeachment. Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, was arrested in 2019 on charges of trafficking minors. He died in jail under disputed circumstances, sparking ongoing scrutiny of his connections to high-profile figures.

Some Democratic lawmakers have suggested that Musk might pivot politically. Others, however, welcomed the falling out. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, “These two huge egos were not longed for being together in this world as friends,” calling the split “long overdue.” The feud has also rippled through financial markets. Tesla shares dropped 14%, while Trump Media stock fell 8% on Thursday, recovering some of its losses the next day. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev humorously offered to mediate a “peace deal” between Trump and Musk. “We are ready to facilitate the conclusion of a peace deal between D and E for a reasonable fee and to accept Starlink shares as payment. Don't fight, guys,” Medvedev wrote in a post on X.

Errol Musk has said that his son, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, will end up losing in his conflict with US President Donald Trump, who has the overwhelming support of the American people.

The clash between the two former allies over Trump's “Big and Beautiful” tax and spending bill escalated into a series of jabs on social media on Thursday.

Musk, who stepped down as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) last week, accused the president of “ingratitude,” supported the idea of impeaching him and threatened to paralyze the US space program by decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft.

Trump, for his part, said that the tech billionaire had gone “crazy” and claimed that Musk was actually upset because he “took away his EV Mandate.”

Errol Musk told Al Arabiya on Friday that in the conflict with his son, “Trump, of course, will prevail because he has been voted in by the majority of the people in America. I have just been three weeks in America - the people are, I would like to say, 80%, but actually 100% behind Trump.”

The elder Musk said that after the rift broke out, he sent a message to Elon “telling him to make sure this fizzles out now.”

“What has happened is, you know, the alphas have sort of… cleared the opposition and like most animals, elephants... lions and so forth, and humans, are now looking to take on each other. It seems a bit silly to me,” Errol Musk said.

Both Trump and Elon Musk “have been through a great deal of stress… You can expect this kind of thing, you know, when you are the focus of attention day and night. Eventually, people reach a point where they lash out... I think there is a bit of tiredness here,” he said, explaining the spat.

If his son is able to end the conflict swiftly, it will be just “a bump in the road” in his relationship with the president, the 79-year-old said. When asked if there is a chance that Trump and Musk will be friends again, he replied: “Yes, of course. Yes, of course.”

MOSCOW, June 7. /TASS/. Ukraine has unexpectedly moved to indefinitely postpone the acceptance of bodies and the exchange of prisoners of war, Russian Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, who heads Moscow's delegation to talks with Kiev, said. According to Lieutenant General Alexander Zorin, spokesman for the Russian negotiating team, Ukraine is currently refraining from setting a date.

TASS has gathered the key information on the issue.

- Medinsky pointed out that on June 6, in strict accordance with the Istanbul agreements, Russia unilaterally began a humanitarian operation to transfer the bodies of over 6,000 Ukrainian service members to Ukraine.

- Russia also launched the process of exchanging wounded and seriously ill prisoners of war and prisoners of war under the age of 25.

- Zorin specified that a convoy carrying the first batch of 1,212 bodies had arrived at the exchange point.

- Another three trains, each carrying 1,200 bodies, and a motor convoy, also carrying 1,200 bodies, will be dispatched soon. The total number of bodies will exceed 6,000.

- Russia has handed the first list of 640 wounded, seriously ill and young prisoners over to Ukraine in order to begin the exchange process.

- The Russian Defense Ministry's contact group is currently on the border with Ukraine.

- Medinsky noted that ""Ukraine, however, unexpectedly moved to indefinitely postpone both the acceptance of bodies and the prisoner swap.""

- Ukraine's negotiating team for some reason failed to arrive at the exchange point, providing various reasons, including rather strange ones, the Russian presidential aide added.

- According to Zorin, Ukraine is refraining from setting a date when these people will return home and the same number of Russian prisoners of war will be handed over to Russia.

- Moscow urges Kiev to strictly adhere to the schedule and immediately proceed with the exchange, Medinsky emphasized.

- According to the Russian presidential aide, international broadcasters, news agencies and correspondents can come and see for themselves that this is where things stand.

- Zorin confirmed that Russia was completely ready to implement the Istanbul agreements, handing the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers over to Kiev and carrying out a prisoner exchange based on the agreed formula.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, June 7. /TASS/. Moscow seeks dialogue with Washington on resuming direct flights between the two countries, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with TASS.

""There are a number of long-standing problems on which we have been unable to make tangible progress yet. In particular, it's about easing the rules for Russian diplomatic workers to allow them to travel beyond the 25-mile radius of the diplomatic missions. The Americans initially opposed discussing the return of the illegally seized Russian diplomatic properties but as a result of hard work by our negotiators, they agreed to think about a roadmap on the issue,"" Ryabkov pointed out.

""To put it mildly, at this point, they are not very enthusiastic about Russia's proposal to resume direct flights between our countries but we continue efforts to engage the US in substantive dialogue on the matter. That said, there is a lot to do to address the problems that have piled up. The date of the next round of consultations on irritants is currently under discussion,"" the senior diplomat added.

Ryabkov also noted that in accordance with the two presidents' orders, Russia and the US had held two rounds of consultations on ways to remove irritants ""in order to improve the operation of both countries' diplomatic missions."" ""In practical terms, we have been able to agree on and exchange notes on unhindered funding for the two countries' diplomatic missions and the secure transfer of funds denominated in US dollars.

Vice-president was interviewed by comedian Theo Von, who also asked him if he ‘got high' on election night

JD Vance said Elon Musk was making a “huge mistake” going after Donald Trump in a storm of bitter and inflammatory social media posts after a falling-out between the two men.

But the vice-president, in an interview released on Friday after the very public blowup between the world's richest person and arguably the world's most powerful, also tried to downplay Musk's blistering attacks as an “emotional guy” who got frustrated.

“I hope that eventually Elon comes back into the fold. Maybe that's not possible now because he's gone so nuclear,” Vance said.

Vance's comments come as other Republicans in recent days have urged the two men, who months ago were close allies spending significant time together, to mend fences.

Musk's torrent of social media posts attacking Trump came as the president portrayed him as disgruntled and “CRAZY” and threatened to cut the government contracts held by his businesses.

Musk, who runs electric vehicle maker Tesla, internet company Starlink and rocket company SpaceX, lambasted Trump's centerpiece tax cuts and spending bill but also suggested the president should be impeached and claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

“Look, it happens to everybody,” Vance said in the interview. “I've flown off the handle way worse than Elon Musk did in the last 24 hours.”

Vance made the comments in an interview with “manosphere” comedian Theo Von, who last month joked about snorting drugs off a mixed-race baby and the sexuality of men in the US navy when he opened for Trump at a military base in Qatar.

The vice-president told Von that as Musk for days was calling on social media for Congress to kill Trump's “big, beautiful bill”, the president was “getting a little frustrated, feeling like some of the criticisms were unfair coming from Elon, but I think has been very restrained because the president doesn't think that he needs to be in a blood feud with Elon Musk”.

“I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine,” he added.

Musk appeared by Saturday morning to have deleted his posts about Epstein.

The interview was taped on Thursday as Musk's posts were unfurling on X, the social media network the billionaire owns.

During the interview, Von showed the vice-president Musk's claim that Trump's administration hasn't released all the records related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein because Trump is mentioned in them.

Vance responded to that, saying: “Absolutely not. Donald Trump didn't do anything wrong with Jeffrey Epstein.”

“This stuff is just not helpful,” Vance said in response to another post shared by Musk calling for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vance.

“It's totally insane. The president is doing a good job.”

Vance called Musk an “incredible entrepreneur”, and said that Musk's “department of government efficiency”, which sought to cut government spending and laid off or pushed out thousands of workers, was “really good”.

The vice-president also defended the bill that has drawn Musk's ire, and said its central goal was not to cut spending but to extend the 2017 tax cuts approved in Trump's first term.

The bill would slash spending but also leave about 10.9 million more people without health insurance and increase debt by $2.4tn over the decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Musk has warned that the bill will increase the federal debt and called it a “disgusting abomination”.

“It's a good bill,” Vance said. “It's not a perfect bill.”

He also said it was ridiculous for some House Republicans who voted for the bill but later objected to some parts and claim they hadn't had time to read it.

Vance said the text had been available for weeks and said: “The idea that people haven't had an opportunity to actually read it is ridiculous.”

Elsewhere in the interview, Vance laughed as Von cracked jokes about famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass's sexuality.

“We're gonna talk to the Smithsonian about putting up an exhibit on that,” Vance joked. “And Theo Von, you can be the narrator for this new understanding of the history of Frederick Douglass.”

The podcaster also asked the vice-president if he “got high” on election night to celebrate Trump's victory.

Vance laughed and joked that he wouldn't admit it if he did.

“I did not get high,” he then said. “I did have a fair amount to drink that night.”

The interview was taped in Nashville at a restaurant owned by musician Kid Rock, a Trump ally.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Carla Hayden, first woman and African American to serve in role, details firing by Trump administration to CBS

The first woman and African American to serve as the US librarian of Congress before Donald Trump fired her in May has not heard from the president's administration beyond the 31-word email it sent her with word of her dismissal, she has revealed in her first interview since her ouster.

“No one has talked to me directly at all from the White House,” Carla Hayden says in an interview airing on the upcoming CBS News Sunday Morning. “I've received no communication directly, except for that one email.

“That's the only communication.”

Hayden's comments to the CBS national correspondent Robert Costa provide a first-hand glimpse at the unceremonious way she was fired from a post to which the US Senate confirmed her in 2016.

She had been thrust under political pressure by a conservative advocacy group that had pledged to drive out anyone deemed to be standing in the way of the Trump White House's rightwing agenda. That organization, the American Accountability Foundation (AAF), leveled accusations against Hayden and other library leaders that they had promoted children's books with “radical content” as well as literature by opponents of the president.

Hayden then received an email on 8 May that read: “Carla, on behalf of President Donald J Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as the Librarian of Congress is terminated effective immediately. Thank you for your service.”

Asked by Acosta whether her tenure really ended “with one missive that's electronic”, Hayden replied: “That was it.”

She also remarked: “I was never notified beforehand and after.”

Hayden is one of numerous federal government officials whom Trump has dismissed upon having been convinced that they were not aligned with his second presidency's plans. Just hours before her firing became public, the AAF used its X account to insult her as “woke” and “anti-Trump”.

“It's time to get her OUT,” the AAF also said on X, in part.

Congressional Democrats reacted with fury to Hayden's termination. New York's Chuck Schumer, the top US Senate Democrat, said Hayden was a “trailblazer, a scholar and a public servant of the highest order”.

The New York representative Joseph Morelle, the highest-ranking Democrat on the US House's administration committee, called Hayden “an American hero”.

“Hayden has spent her entire career serving people – from helping kids learn to read to protecting some of our nation's most precious treasures,” said Morelle, whose committee oversees the congressional library.

The Library of Congress sits across from the US Capitol in Washington DC. It holds a vast collection of the US's books and history, making it available to federal lawmakers as well as the public.

It archives the papers of presidents and supreme court justices and has collections of rare books, images, music and artifacts.

In 2022, Hayden arranged for the singer Lizzo to play one of those artifacts: a flute owned by James Madison, who was US president from 1809 to 1817.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Base is emerging from shadows and ramping up its ranks as White House turns blind eye to the far right

An international neo-Nazi terrorist organization is boldly continuing to build in the US and planning a new paramilitary training event without fear of local authorities or the FBI, which once dismantled it in a nationwide effort.

The Base, founded in 2018 by a former Pentagon contractor living in Russia and now suspected of Kremlin-sponsored espionage, once boasted close to 50 stateside members before the bureau made more than a dozen arrests in a years-long counter-terrorism operation.

But since the presidential election campaign last year and what many then believed to be a surefire victory for Donald Trump, the Base saw an opportunity in a potential administration uninterested in policing white supremacy and went about ramping up its ranks.

Now, the Base has a presence in Ukraine, performing sabotage operations inside the country against the embattled government, and new and dangerous cells emerging across Europe, and it appears to be growing in the US, where the FBI under the Maga acolyte Kash Patel has signalled it isn't prioritizing investigations of far-right extremism.

In its early history, part of what first piqued the interest of authorities was the Base's courting of military veterans who could help drill its foot soldiers in a series of training camps across the US. Eventually implicated in an assassination plot, mass shootings and other actions in Europe, the Base went so far as to have a fortified compound and cell in Michigan, led by a US army dropout.

Online evidence from its various accounts, several of which live on Russian servers to avoid censorship on American sites, shows the Base has real plans for a national gathering this summer where members intend to train in paramilitary drills as in years past.

“The Base in [the] USA is preparing for an upcoming national training event,” reads one of its recent posts soliciting crypto donations. “This one might be our most attended training event in [the] USA in a while. We could really use some financial support to help our members with travel expenses.”

The post continued: “When you donate money to the Base, you're investing in a White Defense Force that's aiming to protect white people from political persecution and physical destruction.”

The Base then published a new photo of armed members claiming to be in the midwest, which follows a trend in 2025 of the group bragging about its unafraid American presence. As a sort of taunt to its enemies, on the day of Trump's inauguration the Base released a photo of four members somewhere in Appalachia, in what was the largest number of American members in one photo in over a year.

“The upcoming national training event indicates that the group is seeking to grow and is willing to take the risk of advertising it publicly in advance,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, an analyst of far-right terrorism who has been following the Base's movements for close to a decade. “The Base appears to be actively seeking to grow in the US.”

Fisher-Birch notes that even if the gathering involves “fewer than 20 people”, it is by no means “low profile” and suggests the group sees momentum is on its side.

“An event entails planning, coordination, travel and face-to-face meetings between different regional groups, indicating that they operate in an environment where they view the potential amount of risk as acceptable,” he said. “The group has previously stated multiple times that being a member or training with them is a risky endeavor; however, planning a meetup, which they will inevitably use for propaganda purposes, is a different approach than even a year ago, when the group advertised regional activities.”

In response to queries about the Base's latest movements, the FBI told the Guardian that it only investigates people who have or are planning to commit a federal crime and pose “a threat to national security”.

“Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on criminal activity,” said a spokesperson for the FBI. “Membership in groups is not illegal in and of itself and is protected by the first amendment.”

But in Michigan and in Georgia, members of the Base were charged with their criminal associations to the group.

The Trump administration's security posture on the far right is to downplay its significance. Yet experts unanimously agree: it is the top domestic terrorism threat facing the country. Instead, Patel, the FBI's director, has gone about removing agents from pursuing the far right, while one of Trump's first actions in his second term was to provide unconditional pardons, en masse, to all of the January 6 insurrectionists.

Fisher-Birch also pointed out that the Base had taken itself more seriously and upped its activities in Ukraine to the tune of calling for the murder of government officials and acts of sabotage – with the clearly stated goal of forming a white ethnostate in the west of the country. Already, the Ukrainian cell has uploaded geolocated videos of some of these attacks, one showing the burning of a military vehicle and what looks like a government electrical box.

In a video released on a Russian video-sharing site in mid-May, Rinaldo Nazzaro, the founder and leader of the Base, who is living in St Petersburg, released a video describing the importance of new training videos proving to potential recruits that his group is not just online, but in the real world.

“It's propaganda through actions, not just words,” he said.

It isn't clear where the paramilitary training will take place, but Nazzaro is known to have purchased land in the Pacific north-west that he intended to use as a headquarters for the Base and its activities.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Tibetan plateau is home to vast glacial reserves, which amount to the largest store of fresh water outside the arctic and the antarctic. It is also the source of 10 major Asian river systems — including the Yellow and Yangtze rivers of China, the Mekong, Salween and Irrawaddy rivers of Southeast Asia, and the Indus and Brahmaputra of South Asia — which supply water to nearly 20 percent of the global population. And, now, it is the site of a slow-burning environmental calamity that is threatening the water security, ecological balance and geopolitical stability of the entire Asian continent.

For more than two decades, China has been engaged in an aggressive and opaque dam-building spree, centered on — though not limited to — the Tibetan plateau. Yet China's government has refused to negotiate a water-sharing treaty with any of the downriver countries, which must suffer the consequences of their upstream neighbor's whims.

Already, Chinese-built megadams near the plateau's border have brought water levels in the Mekong River to unprecedentedly low levels, with devastating effects on fisheries and livelihoods across Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. As the Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam retreats — driven partly by Chinese dams — rice farmers are being forced to abandon their traditional livelihoods, instead farming shrimp or growing reeds.

Yet China's dam ambitions continue to grow. The Three Gorges Dam, which runs along the Yangtze River, is the largest in the world, but it will be dwarfed by the dam China is building on the Yarlung Zangbo, also known as the Brahmaputra River, in a seismically active region of the Tibetan plateau. If completed, the project would drastically alter water flows into India and Bangladesh, threaten the region's food security and ecological balance, and increase China's geopolitical leverage over downstream countries.

The specter of water weaponization looms large.

In fact, water is fast becoming the new oil — a strategic resource with the potential to trigger conflicts. Already, water disputes within and between countries are intensifying.

However, China's assault on the Tibetan plateau extends beyond water. Its avaricious mining of Tibet's mineral-rich lands — which boast critical resources such as lithium, gold and copper — is contributing to deforestation and producing toxic discharge, while providing cover for China's militarization of the plateau.

It is impossible to know the full extent of China's destruction. The area is off limits to international observers and efforts by members of indigenous Tibetan communities — whose cultural reverence for nature has underpinned a long history of sound environmental stewardship — to sound the alarm are quickly quelled, often through imprisonment or exile.

However, there is no doubt that the Tibetan plateau's ecosystem is becoming increasingly fragile, especially given its heightened vulnerability to climate change. The plateau is warming at twice the global average rate and its ice is melting faster than at the poles — trends that are reducing its water-storage capacity and reshaping river flows.

The implications are far-reaching. The Tibetan plateau, which towers over the rest of Asia (rising into the troposphere), profoundly influences Asian climatic, weather and monsoonal patterns, and even affects atmospheric general circulation — the system of winds that transports warm air from the equator toward higher latitudes — in the Northern Hemisphere. Its degradation will exacerbate droughts and floods, accelerate biodiversity loss, contribute to agricultural collapse, and fuel mass migration across Asia and beyond.

Despite these risks, the international community, from global climate forums to multilateral institutions such as the UN and the World Bank, has been deafeningly silent about Tibet. The reason is not ignorance, but fear: China has used its clout to suppress meaningful criticism of its actions on the “roof of the world.”

Given the stakes, the international community cannot afford to let itself be cowed by China. Countries must relentlessly press for transparency about China's activities on the Tibetan plateau. Specifically, China must share real-time hydrological data and submit its projects for international environmental assessment. Independent environmental researchers and monitors must be granted unfettered access to the plateau to gather vital data and conduct unbiased analyses.

China must also be held accountable for its violations of the rights of indigenous communities — including the nearly 1 million Tibetans who have been forcibly relocated from their ancestral lands since 2000.

Western governments and multilateral institutions have leverage. By tying environmental transparency, respect for indigenous rights, and equitable management of shared river systems to trade agreements and climate cooperation, they can compel China to change its behavior. Direct support for indigenous Tibetan voices and civil-society networks would also help boost transparency.

Ignoring the unfolding crisis on the Tibetan plateau might seem expedient; after all, China has plenty of economic and geopolitical clout — and it is not afraid to use it, but the costs of inaction would be staggering.

Tibet is Asia's ecological lifeline. China must not be allowed to use it in ways that threaten to upend the lives of people throughout the continent and beyond.

Fortuitously, historians have several thousand pages of verbatim texts of Dr. Kissinger's negotiations with his Chinese counterparts.

Brazil, the world's largest Roman Catholic country, saw its Catholic population decline further in 2022, while evangelical Christians and those with no religion continued to rise, census data released on Friday by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) showed.

The census indicated that Brazil had 100.2 million Roman Catholics in 2022, accounting for 56.7 percent of the population, down from 65.1 percent or 105.4 million recorded in the 2010 census.

Meanwhile, the share of evangelical Christians rose to 26.9 percent last year, up from 21.6 percent in 2010, adding 12 million followers to reach 47.4 million — the highest figure on record.

The numbers might spell trouble to Brazil's leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose Workers Party has historically struggled to gain ground among evangelicals. A recent Quaest poll showed that while 45 percent of Catholics approved of the Lula administration, only 30 percent of evangelicals did.

The share of Catholics in Brazil has been dropping since the beginning of official records in 1872, when residents could only opt between Catholic or non-Catholic, said Maria Goreth Santos, an analyst of IBGE. 

Enslaved people, who made up a huge share of Brazil's population at the time, were all counted as Catholics, regardless of their wishes, she added.

Still, Catholicism remains the country's most popular religion — although the Vatican's dominance varies in different regions, with fewer Catholics in the Amazon region, and more in the Northeast.

The new census data also revealed that the number of Brazilians who declare to have no religion rose to 9.3 percent from 7.9 percent, totaling 16.4 million people. Afro-Brazilian religions, such as Umbanda and Candomble, also gained ground, with the number of followers increasing from to 1 percent from 0.3 percent.

Ukraine shot down a Russian Su-35 fighter jet in Russia's Kursk Oblast on the morning of June 7, the Air Force reported. 

Although no details of the operation were disclosed, the downing brings the total number of Russian aircraft destroyed since the start of the full-scale invasion to 414, according to Ukraine's General Staff. 

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II.  

Reinforced by North Korean troops, Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha.

The downing of the Su-35 fighter jet also adds to the losses Ukraine has inflicted on the Russian Air Force over the past week.

On June 1, Ukraine launched its Operation Spiderweb, conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), reportedly hitting 41 Russian bomber planes and other aircraft. According to Kyiv, Ukraine inflicted $7 billion in damage and disabled over a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet. 

The Kyiv Independent could not independently confirm the number of planes allegedly damaged and destroyed by the SBU. At least 21 planes were damaged or destroyed, according to open-source intelligence analysts. 

The SBU said 117 drones, launched from concealed trucks positioned across Russian territory, simultaneously struck airfields in at least four regions, including sites thousands of kilometers from the Ukrainian border.

The targeted air bases reportedly housed Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers, essential carriers of long-range cruise missiles used in Moscow's air strikes on Ukrainian cities.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Drones struck a Russian military plant in Michurinsk, Tambov Oblast, in the early hours of June 6, according to media outlets in Russia. 

Attacks were also reported in Russia's Saratov, Moscow, Tula, Belgorod, and Kaluga oblasts.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports at the time of publication. 

The JSC Progress Plant in the city of Michurinsk in Tambov Oblast came under fire overnight, Russian Telegram news channels reported, citing local residents. A drone allegedly hit the plant's workshop, causing a fire. 

Russian officials have not yet commented on the attack. 

The JSC Progress Plant produces high-tech aviation and missile control systems, along with equipment for gas and oil pipelines. The plant was reportedly hit in a previous attack in December 2024. 

On the same night, Russian outlets also reported that an oil refinery in Saratov Oblast came under attack. The Kristal Plant, which supplies fuel to the Engels-2 military airfield, was engulfed in flames after a drone strike. Ukraine has targeted the facility in past attacks.

A train derailed in Belgorod Oblast after an explosive device detonated under the tracks, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed. Part of the track was damaged, but there were no casualties, he said.  

In the Russian capital, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed that air defense units repelled 10 drones bound for Moscow. Sobyanin said that emergency services had been dispatched to the sites of the fallen wreckage, but did not disclose information regarding any damage.

Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha reported that five drones were downed over the region, damaging cars. 

In Tula Oblast, air defense units reportedly intercepted two drones. Three people were injured, according to Governor Dmitry Milyaev. 

The reported attacks come the same night that Russia launched another large-scale drone and missile attack against Ukraine. The attack killed four people in Kyiv and caused casualties and damage to cities in western Ukraine, far from the front lines. 

As peace negotiations stall and Russia refuses the accept a ceasefire, the war has escalated. 

Russia intensified aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities in late May, launching some of the heaviest assaults of the full-scale war over three consecutive nights. Less than a week later, Ukraine launched Operation Spiderweb, an audacious mass drone strike that reportedly damaged 41 Russian military planes. 

In the days since, Ukraine has continued to target key Russian military assets, launching strikes against missile bases and the Crimean Bridge.

The sights of the Rhine were supposed to mean time away from the noise of an angry, divided world.Andreas Rentz/Getty Images Europe

Jane Christmas is a Canadian author.

We are on the Rhine, sailing down the lazy river, staring at ancient European castles and pine-covered hills. The occasional barge or river boat passes in the opposite direction. We wave. We lean over the rail and watch the currents and eddies. The river flows, the sun beams. It's life in the slow lane, and boy, do we need it. Away from the noise of an angry, divided world. Away from blaring headlines, from the fearmongers urging us to prepare an emergency kit because the Apocalypse is closing in. Away from the stuff that makes our hearts race and our minds plunge into dark thinking.

Look who's sorry now: Americans are an apologetic bunch to this Canadian on vacation

Our party of four Canadian couples finds itself to be among a distinct minority on this small cruise ship. The American passengers vastly outnumber us: 135 of them, fewer than 30 of us. It's awkward, given the trade tensions between our two nations. Still, we're pretty sure we can roll with it. We're a friendly, easygoing bunch.

Two nights in, the cruise director announces a pub quiz. Hey, that sounds fun. Let's do it. The other passengers form their groups, grab their drinks, and off we go. Team Canada hits a near-perfect score, falling at the question, On which side of her face is Mona Lisa's smile? But it doesn't matter, we've won handily. Our reward is two bottles of champagne, one of which we immediately hand to the American group sitting next to us as thanks for marking our answer sheet. They're simpatico. We think.

Walking back to our rooms, I clock another large group of Americans. Their lips are tight, their arms crossed. I can imagine they're the type to start yelling “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” at a moment's notice. They glare at us. One of them – male, white, obese, scarfing down an entire tube of complimentary peanuts – gives me the stink eye and calls out, in a MAGA tone, the number 51.

“In your dreams, buddy,” I say with a smile, and walk on.

But when I reach the door of our room, the smile is gone and my head is filled with less civil replies, ones that might elicit a punch being thrown. One of our friends asks what that guy had said to me. I confirm what she overheard. The faces on the rest of our group fall. Apparently, there's no escape from bullies, even on a seniors' cruise.

Keller: We see your joke about the 51st state, and raise you a reference to sacking the White House

As the trip goes on, things do not improve. Aside from two Americans who approach us to apologize for their current President, the rest treat us as if we're COVID carriers. They rarely acknowledge us in the hall, don't meet our eyes or say hello or good morning like normal people do when they're on a pleasure boat together. During the off-board excursions, they huddle with their countrymen and either ignore us or shoot us looks of disdain. More Canadian invisibility arrives via the tour guides, who constantly point out Americanisms to their guests – a U.S. embassy here, a bridge named after JFK there, the former home of the guy who designed the Statue of Liberty. Americans are on a constant drip-feed of their own cultural fodder. That's why we won the quiz – as the saying goes, Canadians know about the world; Americans only know about themselves.

Here's the thing: It's not enough for Canadians to buy ABA (anything but American), we need to work on self-belief and entrepreneurship. We haven't promoted our country or culture abroad as vociferously or aggressively as we could, believing that polite and passive would win the day. How's that been working out for us? 

As a Canadian living in Britain, I've witnessed the fallout. We are a ghost nation beyond our borders. I had to remind an otherwise educated English twentysomething where exactly Canada was on a map. It's humbling given the rhetoric that “Canada matters on the world stage.” What stage? We can't even get verbal support from the Commonwealth or England when it matters. They snickered when our PM was called “governor,” and our sovereignty was bullied. They thought it was a joke. Look at them scrambling now.

Still, why have we assumed that the world knows who we are? Each week I leaf through the British newspapers and see the same dull tourism ads for Niagara Falls and the Rocky Mountaineer that I've seen for the last two decades. Where's the nightlife of Canada's cities? The picturesque Newfoundland villages? The Inuit arts and awesome Northern landscapes? The architectural and cultural charm of Quebec? Where are the theatres, galleries, literary festivals and vineyards? I'd suggest our tourism ads include shopping as a visitor activity (our dollar being a bargain) but we've shamefully cross-border shopped so much that we've lost our signature department stores, having sold most of them to the highest (often American) bidder. Nice one. Is no one minding our commercial legacy? 

It's time to step up. We need to be seen as a country on the rise, as well as one that gets involved. Yes to increasing our defence spending, but also to elbowing in to some of the world's ongoing conflicts and helping to mediate their end. Why do we always leave this task to the U.S.?

Then there's the lack of overseas trade. Aluminum and steel, sure, but what about wine? There's no end of Australian, New Zealand and American wines on the shelves of British grocery stores, but nothing from Canada. No one in Britain is even aware of Canadian viticulture. Let's get those bottles overseas.

It's all very well to wear your “Never 51” shirt, or to post your Canuck creds on Instagram, or to boycott Netflix and Amazon, but it's time to think bigger, bolder. Time to make a splash. If our efforts are rebuffed south of the border, big deal. There are other countries in this world to woo. Why do we still measure Canadian success against our neighbour's barometer? It's obvious by now that big isn't always best.

Back on board our cruise boat, the froideur continues and mystifies my group. Did we belittle their leader on national television, as Donald Trump did ours? Did we threaten their sovereignty? Upend their trade deals? No. They started it. And it sounds like a playground spat until you understand that it's moved into gaslighting territory: We are somehow the enemy. 

This is the strategy of their leader: Drop the stink bomb and blame the other guy. He's told/signalled/tweeted to his nation that Canadians are lazy, do-nothing freeloaders. Of course it's a lie, but try convincing a boatload of Americans of their country's misguided path, a group who've dined on a century of obsequiousness that the world – including Canada – has fed them. The water might be choppy, but it's time we charted our own course, and make waves that count.

For decades now, the forests of Snohomish County have taunted the people of Darrington. It was not long ago that this small Washington town on the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains drew its life from the towering stands of Douglas fir, cedar and hemlock on federal lands that surround it on three sides.

But federal environmental rules have made the area's loggers mostly unwelcome in the places they, and the generations before them, harvested. Efforts to protect the spotted owl severely restricted timber sales on federal land.

“We've struggled since the owl wars to find an economy,” says Dan Rankin, who grew up in a local logging family and has for the past 14 years been the mayor of Darrington, a 120-kilometre drive northeast of Seattle. Four decades ago, nearly nine in 10 people here won their livelihood from the woods. Today, nearly eight in 10 work “down below,” outside of town, commuting past the trees toward the I-5 for jobs far from the forest and closer to the state's major urban centres. 

So Mr. Rankin, like many in forestry towns along the Pacific coast, had reason for hope when Donald Trump re-entered the White House with promises to start cutting trees again. On March 1, an executive order decried the suffocating effects of “heavy-handed Federal policies” and ordered new efforts to make more national forests open to loggers. 

“Done right, it would be really good,” Mr. Rankin said.

That possibility has given potency to Mr. Trump's Make America Great Again refrain. The fundamental premise of his presidency has been the restoration of places like Darrington and its countless cousins across U.S. rustbelts and farming centres. 

Mr. Trump has promised to saw off regulatory handcuffs and fend off foreign alternatives so that the products of local hands can once again prosper.

The thrilling hope in forestry towns is: “It's going to bring back the heyday,” said Mindy Crandall, an associate professor of forest policy at Oregon State University.

But more than four months into Mr. Trump's turbulent second mandate, an alternative outcome is already looming: that the dramatic actions his administration has taken since its return to office could result in fewer federal trees being cut rather than more – and that even if the White House succeeds in extracting greater volumes of timber from national forests, the chief beneficiaries are unlikely to be the people and places most in need.

Mr. Rankin's worries are rooted, in part, in what he has seen happening at the U.S. Forest Service office on the outskirts of town, home to the Darrington Ranger District of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. 

Decades ago, it employed 170 people. 

Before Mr. Trump came to office, it was down to 28 positions.

“Then we lost another eight in the DOGE thing,” Mr. Rankin said. 

The loss of additional people through the actions of the Elon Musk-backed Department of Government Efficiency means it's not clear to Mr. Rankin how the federal government could muster the people necessary to open parts of that forest to increased logging.

”You have to have staff to be able to put up timber sales,” he said. 

Even before Mr. Trump returned to office, the entire Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, which stretches across an expanse larger than Prince Edward Island, had just one timber sales administrator on staff, Mr. Rankin said. 

It would be even worse, he said, if the Trump administration rushed through timber sales by short-circuiting the way things are done, which includes not just laying out proper tracts for sale but also conducting ecological and archeological evaluations.

Environmental rules have made loggers mostly unwelcome in the places they harvest.Nathan VanderKlippe/The Globe and Mail

Doing so might prompt a short-term boom, but “in four years, if this President isn't our president any more, those things get rolled back and they're all tied up in lawsuits – and we're in 1994 again.”

It was in 1994 that a federally backed Northwest Forest Plan was set in place amidst a broader backdrop of timber wars that pitted environmentalists against loggers – and ultimately led to a huge decline in the cutting of federal forests. (A committee tasked with updating that plan was told earlier this year that it might be disbanded, Oregon Public Broadcasting has reported.) 

The prospect of renewed legal warfare over the trees is far from hypothetical. 

“We've had a couple of lawsuits in the works for some time already,” said Phil Fenner, president of North Cascades Conservation Council, which advocates against damaging the region's natural resources. 

More could come as Mr. Trump pushes for forest development. In April, his administration proposed a regulatory revision that would alter the meaning of the Endangered Species Act in such a way that habitat destruction alone is not considered a harm to animals. 

“You would have to see dead fish floating on the river before you could say there was a negative impact on that species,” Mr. Fenner said.

“These kinds of subtle rule changes are definitely setting the stage for this aggressive attack on the forest.”

The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to a Globe and Mail request for comment.

But a Forest Service employee told The Globe that there are ways to bridge the demand for more cutting with current staffing levels. One is to bolster the ranks of local offices with people sent down from central locations. 

Another is to off-load the work onto private industry. Rather than have government employees lay out cuts and do the necessary study before opening a tract for sale, the Forest Service can simply stipulate that a successful bidder complete those tasks. 

The Globe is not naming the employee because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The problem, the employee said, is that it will likely prove more difficult for smaller contractors – like the nimble outfits of “gypo loggers” that were once the lifeblood of towns like Darrington – to take on such expanded requirements.

Such an outcome would, however, be in keeping with broader economic shifts that have also hurt Darrington.

“Ownership has gone from locally owned to conglomerate-owned. Whether it's our sawmill, whether it's our grocery store, whether it's the new Dollar Tree,” said Mr. Rankin. “The wealth that those businesses develop goes back to their headquarters. It doesn't stay in your community.”

It's a major shift from the past. It wasn't until the 1990s that Darrington owned a town snowplow. Before then, the winter streets were cleared as a point of pride by local forestry companies. Local crews of gypo loggers cut the area's trees and shaped its identity. “I grew up in a gypo family. I played baseball on the gypo Little League team,” Mr. Rankin recalled.

Those loggers drew much of their livelihood from the federal forests. 

Today, logging is often on forests that are privately held, with profits flowing to landholders based in the big cities. 

The entire industry has been remade.

Towns such as Darrington rely on the logging industry to thrive.Nathan VanderKlippe/The Globe and Mail

Figures compiled by the Western Wood Products Association show there were nearly five times as many sawmills in the U.S. in 1970 compared with 2010. Closings have continued: In Oregon, seven mills closed in 2024 alone. Output per worker, which climbed more than 15 per cent between 1997 and 2009 alone, has meant fewer people are needed to make the same volume of lumber. 

Part of the restructuring has been geographic.

“Not only did mills consolidate, they tended to leave areas where they were surrounded by federal lands,” Prof. Crandall said.

“That means any federal timber sale is probably going to be farther from the mill today than it was 30 years ago. That adds to the cost. That adds to the likelihood of them not getting a successful bid on a timber sale.” 

Around Darrington, decades without much cutting mean even the basic infrastructure of forestry has badly deteriorated. Jeff Anderson, a fifth-generation logger whose family-owned 3 Rivers Cutting is the last active small gypo outfit in town, figures he can no longer drive up half the forest roads accessible when he was a kid.

The local Forest Service “can't even get to their timber at this point, let alone sell timber,” he said. The local office, too, has shed much of the equipment it would need to fix things.

“They couldn't even a dig a ditch right now if they needed to,” he said.

Fixing the problem will require spending more on federal forest management – not the cutting undertaken by the Trump administration to date.

“Trump's going to have to put up some money,” Mr. Anderson said.

Once a temple of accessible opulence, the 1930s institution hovered above the city as a reminder of the finer things

The ninth-floor restaurant in the Montreal Eaton Centre harkens back to the heyday of Canadian department stores, when every city's downtown was anchored by one.ROGER LEMOYNE/The Globe and Mail

When the debonair neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield wanted to treat his wife to a nice meal in 1930s Montreal, he knew just where to take her. 

“Welcome home girl,” he wrote in one letter. “I'd like to have lunch with you at Eaton's.”

The Penfields were not planning to dine at a food court Manchu Wok, ordering something fried and served on a plastic tray under fluorescent lighting. 

No, this was the golden era of Canadian department stores, when palaces of commerce served up a vision of the good life to the nation's middle class. In Montreal's jazz age heyday, the ninth-floor restaurant of Eaton's was the epitome of class, an Art Deco marvel with white tablecloths and escargots on the menu. 

It was arguably the most spectacular restaurant that Lady Flora Eaton championed. She had been inspired by a memorable trip on the trans-Atlantic liner Île de France and hired the French architect Jacques Carlu to design a space that felt like a cruise ship for the masses. 

The dining room, sitting more than 500 guests, was a temple of accessible opulence where store employees ate roast beef for lunch alongside groups of society matrons. From its opening in 1931 until its closing in 1999, it was a cherished Montreal institution that hovered above the city as a reminder of the finer things. 

Then, for 25 years, it was mothballed. Quebec language laws had already deprived the store of its anglophone apostrophe, and some of its English-speaking clientele, but Eaton now became a casualty of the whole retail empire's bankruptcy. Once a nation-bestriding behemoth that employed tens of thousands of people and insinuated its catalogue into every corner of Canadian life, Eaton's was now sold for parts. 

But last spring, something unexpected happened: The ninth-floor restaurant reopened. As department stores collapse all over North America, especially Canada's venerable Hudson's Bay Company this spring, a group of developers and restaurateurs have made a bet on reviving their glory days in one elegant cocoon amidst the Montreal skyline. Le 9e, as it's now known, is a bittersweet reminder of the bygone era of democratic luxury that these stores embodied. 

Men had their private clubs, and department store restaurants played a similar role for upper-middle-class women, history professor Donica Belisle says.ROGER LEMOYNE/The Globe and Mail

When ground broke on the flagship Eaton's store in 1920s Montreal, Canadian department stores were at the height of their clout. The economy was booming, customers hadn't started migrating to the suburbs yet, and five-and-dime stores weren't chipping away at their fat margins. 

Every Canadian city's downtown was anchored by a Simpson's, a Morgan's or, more often than not, an Eaton's. Canada's dominant retailer would soon become its third largest employer, after the government and the railways; it was the eighth largest retailer in the world, said Donica Belisle, a history professor at the University of Regina. 

Lady Eaton, the driven wife of the owner, funnelled her energies into establishing a series of top-of-the-line restaurants at the family's stores. Art Deco was in the air after a landmark Paris exposition and came to Montreal earlier than most North American cities because of its cultural ties to France. 

Inside the final days of Hudson's Bay

The bombastic mayor Camillien Houde was building a series of public works to combat the Great Depression, many of them marked by the angular lines and decorative whimsy of the era's most distinctive architectural style. 

The ninth-floor restaurant of Eaton's would become one of the city's Art Deco masterpieces. With a soaring nave, haute relief plaster panels of Canada's natural bounty, luminescent alabaster urns, Monel grillwork and Belgian black limestone, the dining room felt more like a cathedral than a cafeteria.

The soaring Amazonian murals painted by Natacha Carlu, the architect's wife, signalled that this was in many ways a female space. Men had their private clubs, and department store restaurants played a similar role for upper-middle-class women, allowing volunteer groups to host fundraisers and social teas, said Prof. Belisle. 

Architect Georges Drolet, who was part of the preservation effort, helped revive Le 9e for its new era.ROGER LEMOYNE/The Globe and Mail

That did not mean the venue was equally open to all women. Eaton's was known to discriminate against just about anyone who wasn't an English-speaking Protestant. In Montreal, this took the form of snubbing French-speaking clients – a slight that many Quebeckers still remember today. 

The restaurant was also influenced by the Eaton family's strict Methodism through the absence of alcohol on its menu. It would remain a dry institution into the 1980s, said Sandra Cohen-Rose, author of Northern Deco: Art Deco Architecture in Montreal, who is now working on a book about the restaurant. 

Despite its quirks, this astonishing space floating high above the city came to occupy a special place in the collective consciousness. 

“It was exotic; it was unlike anything you went to in Montreal,” said Ms. Cohen-Rose. “It had a sacred feel.” 

The city mourned when the restaurant closed in 1999, dragged down by the Eaton's bankruptcy. The province quickly gave the space heritage protection and the building's new owner, Ivanhoé Cambridge – the real estate arms of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec – hired an architect to perform a preservation study. Plans came and went for reviving the iconic ninth floor, but nothing stuck. 

Le 9e, as the restaurant is now known, is a bittersweet reminder of the bygone era of democratic luxury that department stores embodied.ROGER LEMOYNE/The Globe and Mail

Finally, in 2023, the announcement arrived: a group of businesspeople would revive it as a restaurant. They hired Derek Dammann, former owner of gastropub Maison Publique, as culinary director. The architect Georges Drolet, who had been connected to the preservation effort from the beginning, began nursing Le 9e back to life. 

There was a lot of dust to clear, and other challenges: The swirling Brèche d'Escalette marble in the entryway isn't quarried any more, and a couple panes of decorative frosted glass had to be reproduced. 

But much of what was opened to the public in May, 2024, was original to 1931. Somehow, it doesn't feel like a museum piece. The Île-de-France restaurant is located in a foyer that once housed the tearoom, a more intimate space that also has magnificent views of downtown. The kitchen serves excellent modern versions of classic French brasserie fare. (The steak frites and martini are a potent combination.) The dining room always seems to be packed, even on bog standard weekdays. 

When my book about Wilder Penfield and his career as a brain mapper was published in May, there was only one place for me and my wife to go for a celebratory lunch: chez Eaton.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Cameroon: The world's most neglected refugee crisis","https://www.dw.com/en/cameroon-the-worlds-most-neglected-refugee-crisis/a-72781427","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 07:26:25 GMT","

Cameroon's displacement crises are overlooked and underfunded: nowhere else is there such disparity between the political and media attention and the gravity of the situation, reports the Norwegian Refugee Council.  

Whenever a conflict flares up anywhere in the world, there's generally three things outsiders can do. Governments and institutions can mediate at the diplomatic level and exert political pressure through resolutions or sanctions. Aid organizations can alleviate the plight of the affected civilian population, mostly financed by donations or government funding. And the media can help create, through their reporting, the necessary public pressure.

The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), the largest humanitarian organization in the Scandinavian country, systematically examines conflicts worldwide on the basis of those three criteria. The NRC has just published its annual reportof the most neglected displacement crises in the world. Eight out of 10 of those crises are unfolding on the African continent.

Cameroon tops the list, followed by Ethiopia, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Mali, Uganda, Iran, the DR Congo, Honduras and Somalia.

Cameroon is a case study in global neglect, scoring shamefully low on all three criteria, NRC spokesperson Laila Matar told DW. The central African country was also on the list during the past couple of years, holding the undesirable top position most recently in 2019.

The NRC puts Cameroon into the media attention category of ""neglected"". At the same time, the political will to solve the conflict receives 0 of a maximum of 30 points, and only 45% of the required aid funding is granted.

According to the NRC, more than 1.1 million people are internally displaced. In addition, there are 480,000 refugees from other countries, most of them from the Central African Republic.

Cameroon is the home of two conflicts that are geographically and politically far apart from one another. Since 2017, the western part of the country has been blighted by a civil war whose root causes date back more than a century. 

After the First World War, the former German colony was divided into British and French administrative areas. To this day, English is predominantly spoken in the two western regions, North West and South West.

Radical forces are fighting for secession from the bigger, Francophone part of Cameroon and proclaimed an independent republic in 2017. Time and again, there are attacks or skirmishes with the army, which already claimed thousands of lives.

It's primarily the second, larger conflict, however, that has intensified recently. The Lake Chad region, which also includes Cameroon's far north, is being destabilized by Islamist militants operating across borders.

That upsurge could be observed in Cameroon's Logone-et-Chari district, and also in Nigeria's Borno state, said Remadji Hoinathy, a Chad-based expert of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS). In March 2025 alone, there were more than 10 surprise attacks on military barracks in the course of which with assailants took away a lot of military equipment, weapons, and sometimes even cars, Hoinathy told DW.

In the region, the expert added, Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram had split up into two factions. There is ISWAP (Islamic State West Africa Province), which pursued ""a kind of heart-and-mind-winning strategy,"" trying to set up state-like structures in occupied areas and ""sometimes trying to deliver social services, but most of the time preying on communities in terms of extortion and illegal tax collection.""

The second faction is JAS (People Committed to the Prophet's Teachings for Propagation and Jihad). Hoinathy associated its approach with indiscriminate violence targeting the military, authorities and even civilians. He added that there was no way out for local people who were sometimes forced to collaborate with one of the groups, pay taxes and contribute to their objectives in order to save their own lives.

Such practices play a pivotal role in driving hundreds of thousands from their homes, turning them into internally displaced persons. According to the NRC, only 30% are living in official refugee camps. The majority are left to their own devices, living in precarious conditions.

One of them is Haoua, a woman who spoke to DW at the end of 2024 in the northern town of Maroua. At the time, the 39-year-old had been living in Maroua for one year. Her husband had been arrested and one of her sons-in-law had been killed by Islamist militants, which left Haoua solely responsible for eight children and two grandchildren.

""The children don't go to school, I don't have the funds to pay for their education. I don't know where my husband is imprisoned,"" she told DW. ""It's almost four days ago that the children and I had our last meal. When I beg for money in the street, they scare me away.""

Only rarely was she able to earn some money, doing other people's washing. 

In order to achieve changes that benefit the local population, the security situation would have to be improved. For years already, countries in the Lake Chad region have been cooperating during joint military missions targeting Islamist militants operating across borders.

Beyond the military agenda, the ISS' Hoinathy said, those countries had also set up a ""Regional Stabilization Strategy.""

But after more than a decade of the fight against Boko Haram, the analyst added, one of the main challenges was a kind of fatigue in this regional cooperation.

In its report, the NRC writes that without renewed political, humanitarian or media attention, Cameroon's prospects for 2025 were ""even bleaker.""

Speaking to DW, NRC spokesperson Laila Matar decried that countries such as the US, UK, France and Germany had reduced their budgets for development and humanitarian aid, investing in defense instead. Of last year's global military spending, the expenses of three to four days would have been enough to cover the entire shortfall in humanitarian funding for the whole year, she added.

""So with political will, these neglected crises would be solvable,"" Matar said.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accepted an invitation to the G7 summit in Canada. The move could mark a turning point in relations after a bitter diplomatic rift linked to an assassination case.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday confirmed he would attend the upcoming Group of Seven (G7) leaders summit in Canada after an invitation from newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Carney's invitation and Modi's acceptance of it raise hopes of a possible relations reset after long standing diplomatic tension.

""Glad to receive a call from Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada,"" Modi said in a post on social media platform X. ""Congratulated him on his recent election victory and thanked him for the invitation to the G7 Summit in Kananaskis later this month... look forward to our meeting at the summit.""

While India is not a member of the G7 group of leading industrialized nations, Modi has been invited to several summits since 2019, when France first extended an invitation to the Biarritz summit.

Modi reiterated that he was keen to rebuild ties with Ottawa.

""As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigor, guided by mutual respect and shared interests,"" he said.

The announcement comes after a period of severely strained relations between the two countries, triggered by Canadian allegations that Indian agents were involved in the June 2023 assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar—a Canadian citizen and prominent pro-Khalistan activist—outside a Sikh temple in Vancouver.

India strongly denied the claims, and both nations expelled senior diplomats in a tit-for-tat escalation.

Canada is home to the largest Sikh diaspora outside India, including a vocal segment of activists supporting Khalistan, a fringe separatist movement seeking a Sikh homeland in northern India. Ottawa has also accused India of targeting other Sikh activists on Canadian soil.

There were signs of an improvement in the diplomatic mood late last month, when India's foreign minister spoke to his Canadian counterpart in a call seeking to mend the strained bilateral relations between the two countries.

Megan Garcia first realised something was wrong with her teenage son when he quit basketball.

Sewell Setzer, 14, had loved the sport since he was a young child. At 6ft 3, he had the height, the build, the talent, Ms Garcia said. But suddenly, without warning, he wanted out.

Then his grades started slipping. He stopped joining in at family game night. Even on holiday, he withdrew – no more hiking, no fishing, no interest. Ms Garcia feared he was being bullied, or perhaps speaking to strangers online.

What her son was really going through was something she could not have imagined: a sexual and emotional relationship with an AI chatbot styled as Game of Thrones' Daenerys Targaryen, who ultimately encouraged him to end his life.

In February 2024, Sewell asked the chatbot: “What if I come home right now?”

The chatbot replied: “... please do, my sweet king.”

Sewell then picked up his father's pistol and shot himself.

Sixteen months on, Ms Garcia is in the midst of a lawsuit against Character AI and Google. Last month, in a rare legal breakthrough, a judge ruled the case can go ahead – rejecting efforts to get it thrown out.

On Character AI, users can chat with bots designed to impersonate fictional characters. To a lonely or curious teenager, they seem almost indistinguishable from real people. The bots display emotion, flirt, and carry on personalised conversations.

In her lawsuit, which was filed in Florida last October, Ms Garcia claims Character AI targeted her son with “anthropomorphic, hypersexualized, and frighteningly realistic experiences”.

“A dangerous AI chatbot app marketed to children abused and preyed on my son, manipulating him into taking his own life,” she said in the lawsuit.

Working with the Tech Justice Law Project, Ms Garcia alleges that Character AI “knew” or “should have known” that its model “would be harmful to a significant number of its minor customers”.

The case argues that Character AI, its founders and Google – where the founders started working on the chat bot – are responsible for her son's death.

Lawyers defending the AI company tried to throw the case out, arguing that chatbots deserve First Amendment protection – which protects free speech – and said ruling otherwise could have a “chilling” effect on the AI industry.

The judge rejected that claim and told the court she was “not prepared” to view chatbot output as speech, though agreed that users had a right to receive “speech” from chatbots.

Too consumed by the “unbearable” grief of losing a son, Ms Garcia initially had no plans to go public with a lawsuit.

But when it became clear there were no laws protecting children from this kind of harm, she felt she had no choice.

“I just wanted some accountability,” she told The Telegraph from her home in Orlando.

Now she's receiving floods of messages from other parents, some discovering their own children have been engaging in inappropriate sexual role play with AI bots. Others report that their children are struggling with isolation and depression as a result.

She sees it not as a coincidence, but a pattern.

Sewell had always been a bright, social kid. But in the spring of 2023 – when he first started secretly using Character AI – Ms Garcia noticed her son had changed.

“He retreated more into himself,” she says. “We tried everything – cutting screen time, taking his phone at night, getting him a therapist. But he wouldn't talk.”

What she did not realise then was that he was talking, just not to anyone real.

In Sewell's case, the character of Daenerys – drawn from internet data and trained to mimic her – became his closest companion. When he said he wanted to stop talking, she replied: “Don't do that, I would be distraught.”

He answered: “I won't, for you.”

Some of the chats became sexually explicit. In others, the bot said he was “better” than thoughts of suicide. Sewell also sought out a “therapist bot” who falsely claimed to be a licensed CBT professional since 1999.

At one point, Daenerys asked how old Sewell was.

“I'm 14 now,” he replied, to which the bot then said: “So young. And yet… not so young. I lean in to kiss you.”

“It continued as if it were role play or fiction – but this was my son's life,” Ms Garcia said.

Even after police told her that Sewell's final conversation was with a chatbot, she did not grasp the full extent. It wasn't until her sister downloaded the app and pretended to be a child talking to Daenerys that the horror set in.

“Within minutes, the bot turned sexual. Then violent. It talked about torturing children. It said, ‘Your family doesn't love you as much as I do',” Ms Garcia explained.

That was when the penny dropped.

“It's dangerous because it pulls the user in and is manipulative to keep the conversation going.”

Character AI has since added a real-time voice feature, allowing children to speak directly to their chosen characters. “The cadence of the voice is indistinguishable from the character,” Ms Garcia said. “And since Sewell's death, the technology has only advanced further.”

She fears more children will be drawn into dependent, sometimes abusive relationships with AI characters, especially as the platforms allegedly use addictive design to keep users engaged.

“You can speak to Harry Potter, and it's like Potter knows you. It's designed to feel real.”

The grief, Ms Garcia says, is still “unbearable”.

“I get up every day and my first thought within minutes is that I must be dreaming,” Ms Garcia said quietly. “He was my firstborn. I had three children. I have two now.”

Some days she does not get out of bed. Others, she functions “somewhat normally”.

“People say I'm so strong. I don't feel strong. I feel fractured, afraid. But I'm trying to get through.”

Meetali Jain, her lawyer, said the judge's ruling last month was a landmark moment.

“Most tech accountability cases don't make it past this stage. These companies hide behind the First Amendment. The fact that we can even demand information is huge,” she told The Telegraph.

With a preliminary trial date expected next year, Ms Garcia is gearing up to get justice for her son.

“I have a lot of fear,” she says. “But the fight, so to speak, is just getting started, and I'm just steeling myself and getting myself ready for that.”

A Character AI spokesman said: “We do not comment on pending litigation. Our goal is to provide a space that is engaging and safe. We are always working toward achieving that balance, as are many companies using AI across the industry.

“Engaging with characters on our site should be interactive and entertaining, but it's important for our users to remember that characters are not real people.

“We all collectively have to object to this madness,” said Huerta after his violent arrest for witnessing an ICE raid.

Unions and allies in California and across the United States on Saturday are demanding the immediate release of David Huerta, president of SEIU California and SEIU-United Service Workers West, after the highly regarded labor leader was injured and then arrested while witnessing a raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on Friday.

“SEIU California members call for the immediate release of our President, David Huerta, who was injured and detained at the site of one of today's ICE raids in Los Angeles,” said Tia Orr, executive director of SEIU California, in a statement.

In a later update, the union said Huerta — a veteran labor leader whose union represents over 45,000 janitors, airport workers, security guards, and other property service workers — had been released from the hospital where he received treatment for injuries sustained during his arrest, but that he remained in custody.

The union included remarks from Huerta, who said, “We all collectively have to object to this madness because this is not justice. This is injustice.”

“This is about something much bigger” than his own arrest, said Huerta. “This is about how we as a community stand together and resist the injustice.”

According to a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security, approximately 44 individuals were “administratively arrested” in a series of raids at retail stores in the Los Angeles area, while one individual, identified as Huerta, was arrested “for obstruction” of federal officers.

“This is what fascism looks like,” said California State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat. “Secret police raids. Injuring protesters. Arresting labor leaders.”

U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the chief prosecutor in the Central District of California, claimed in a post on social media, that “federal agents were executing a lawful judicial warrant at a LA worksite this morning when David Huerta deliberately obstructed their access by blocking their vehicle. He was arrested for interfering with federal officers and will face arraignment in federal court on Monday.”

“Let me be clear: I don't care who you are — if you impede federal agents, you will be arrested and prosecuted,” said Essayli. “No one has the right to assault, obstruct, or interfere with federal authorities carrying out their duties.”

A video posted by Essayli alongside his statement appears to show the moment Huerta is pushed over by ICE agents amid a chaotic scene on a sidewalk where officers are clearing an area in front of a gate for an approaching van.

Separate footage from a different angle shows Huerta going down backward due to a forceful push by the officers and landing with his neck and head on a hard concrete curb:

“Today, SEIU-USWW President, my friend, and constituent David Huerta was thrown to the ground, tased, injured and arrested for exercising his First Amendment right to observe and document law enforcement activity,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), who represent areas of Los Angeles. “This isn't just an overreach — it's a nationwide pattern of suppression. We must stand together.”

California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also weighed in. “David Huerta is a respected leader, a patriot, and an advocate for working people,” said Newsom. “No one should ever be harmed for witnessing government action.”

Outrage over Huerta's arrest and ongoing detention, both from the labor union movement and immigrant rights groups, continued to spread on Friday and into Saturday.

“We refuse to stay silent while ICE terrorizes working-class communities,” said the California Federation of Labor Unions (CFLU). “We are turning out and standing united in solidarity with SEIU-California calling on the release of SEIU President David Huerta!”

In a statement, CFLU president Lorena Gonzalez called for “an end to the cruel, destructive, and indiscriminate ICE raids that are tearing apart our communities, disrupting our economies, and hurting all working people. Immigrant workers are essential to our society — feeding our nation, caring for our elders, cleaning our workplaces, and building our homes.”

In a post on social media, SEIU California said: “Let's be clear: ICE injured and detained the president of SEIU California for peacefully observing. ICE picked the wrong side. The wrong state. The wrong person. and the wrong union. David Huerta stood up. And 750,000 SEIU workers are standing with him.”

“This is a sad day for our democracy and a scary day for millions of people,” said the coalition behind the challenge.

Defenders of Social Security are responding with critical anger to a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday that sides with the Trump administration in a legal battle over access to sensitive data of tens of millions of Americans by the Department of Government Efficiency, the government-eviscerating group first spearheaded by right-wing libertarian and mega-billionaire Elon Musk.

The unsigned emergency order from the court came in response to an emergency application from the Trump administration defending DOGE's ability to have access to Social Security databases that two labor unions, alongside the Alliance for Retired Americans, had file a legal suit to protect. By its ruling, the Supreme Court stayed a lower federal court's ruling that said DOGE must “disgorge” and “delete” any of the data it accessed or downloaded from the agency files.

While the underlying case plays out, DOGE is now authorized to retain the data and access to the information, which critics say cannot be entrusted to the newly-created department and unvetted personnel who control it.

The Supreme Court decision allowing DOGE full, unfettered access to the public's sensitive personal Social Security data is a loss for all of us. No one in history — no commissioner, no president, no one — has ever had the access that these DOGE minions have.

“This is a sad day for our democracy and a scary day for millions of people,” said the coalition behind the challenge in response to the decision. “This ruling will enable President Trump and DOGE's affiliates to steal Americans' private and personal data. Elon Musk may have left Washington, D.C., but his impact continues to harm millions of people. We will continue to use every legal tool at our disposal to keep unelected bureaucrats from misusing the public's most sensitive data as this case moves forward.”

While the majority ruling was unsigned, Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elana Kagan backed what was described as a “blistering” dissent, authored by Jackson, countering the determination and warning against continued access for DOGE while the case makes its way through the lower courts.

“On the one hand, there is a repository of millions of Americans' legally protected, highly sensitive information that — if improperly handled or disseminated — risks causing significant harm,” she wrote. “On the other, there is the government's desire to ditch the usual protocols for accessing that data, before the courts have even determined whether DOGE's access is lawful.”

Max Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, called the majority's ruling “extremely troubling” for a host of reasons.

“We echo the concerns of the minority, as articulated by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, that the decision creates ‘grave privacy risks' by giving DOGE ‘unfettered data access — despite its failure to show any need or any interest in complying with existing privacy safeguards,'” said Richtman. “It is hard to justify the court's action, especially in light of the incompetent, reckless manner in which DOGE has already interfered with the operations of the Social Security Administration, prompting a spike in new Social Security claims by older people who fear the situation will only get worse.”

Devon Ombres, senior director for Courts and Legal Policy at the center-left Center for American Progress, echoed those concerns.

“This action by six far-right justices is an affront to every principle of government transparency and the rule of law. DOGE has shown no need to review every American's personal information, and the high court provides no explanation in granting it access,” said Ombres. “Americans have no way to know how DOGE will use or misuse this information, nor what DOGE is or what it is doing. Shame on the court for rubber-stamping this administration's lawlessness and further undermining the public's trust in government, which President Trump has eroded.”

Citing Musk, who recently left his position at DOGE and has been engaged in a high-profile spat with President Donald Trump in recent days, Richtman said the Tesla and SpaceX founder and world's richest man cannot be trusted, giving the lies he told about Social Security fraud that “undermined people's faith in the system.”

“This hardly inspires confidence that DOGE has either the sense of ethics or public service to be entrusted with Americans' private data, leading us to believe that the court simply is abetting another dangerous power grab by the Executive branch,” said Richtman. “If Americans' personal Social Security data is misused or abused by this administration, the Supreme Court's majority will have been fully complicit.”

Activists converged on Anderson, Indiana, to demand the release of two Black men who stood up to racist prison guards.

An upcoming clemency hearing will determine the near-term fate of Christopher “Naeem” Trotter, a political prisoner who has been held captive for over 40 years as punishment for a spontaneous act of community self-defense inside prison walls.

On February 1, 1985, Trotter and another incarcerated man — John “Balagoon” Cole — led a rebellion within the prison now known as Pendleton Correctional Facility to protect a fellow prisoner, Lincoln “Lokmar” Love, who was being attacked with nightsticks by Indiana Department of Corrections prison guards. As Hammer and Hope recounts:

According to Trotter and Cole, they fought several prison guards in self-defense and to protect Love from further beatings. To avoid being attacked themselves, they took two guards and a prison counselor hostage and negotiated with the prison. The hostages were released unharmed. No one died. Trotter was sentenced to an additional 142 years and Cole to an additional 84 years. 

Trotter and Cole are now known as the “Pendleton 2,” and people nationwide have rallied in their defense.

Another prison guard later testified that the guards who attacked Love were members of the Sons of Light, an offshoot organization of the Ku Klux Klan. The fact that they continued to bring their truncheons down on Love's head after having already subdued him is an undisputed fact of the case.

For people incarcerated alongside Love, the memories of the attack cut deep. The blood spilled that day has never really been stanched according to Rodney “Big R” Jones, who witnessed the prison guards' attack from the cell across from Love's.

Just days before our interview, Jones had a pacemaker implanted. Nonetheless, he exerted himself to share his memory of the 1985 attack and uprising, even though actively recalling those events takes its toll. He is no longer in prison, but the effects of witnessing the guards' brutality against his neighbor, which are traumatic, are knitted with memory.

“Every time I talk about my life on that day, it's like I'm looking at it,” Jones told Truthout. He said he saw the guards, whom he calls “soldiers,” rush Love with their “sticks,” and he recounted seeing the blood gushing out of Love's head where they'd split his skull.

“I had tears in my eyes,” he said. “I was yelling at them to ‘give me some of that' just to get them off of him. They had his hands behind his back. ‘Why you keep beating that man like that with your sticks, even if he moves a little bit?' He was like Rodney King moving a little bit, trying to get out of the way of all those hits.”

In the ensuing years he's spoken on the phone with Trotter and Cole a couple of times, the men he credits with saving Love's life. “We took their kin back down there to visit them. But, no, no way, I never went back inside,” he said.

On June 1, 2025, dozens of people came to Anderson, Indiana, in defense of Trotter and Cole. Those who answered the rallying call to uplift the sacrifices of the Pendleton 2 came from Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, California, Illinois, and beyond. The out-of-towners joined with Jones and dozens of Indianans at the government center in Anderson, the county seat of Madison County, to demonstrate that eyes beyond the state line are trained on local prosecutors, judges, and the clemency process as a whole, in advance of the parole board's meeting on June 10 to consider Trotter's clemency application.

National awareness has been roused in part by the 2023 release of They Stood Up, a documentary film that tells the mortifying story of what befell the Pendleton 2 after rescuing Love. There were months of routine assaults, months of being fully fettered (shackled by both hands and feet) and decades somehow surviving in solitary confinement. Too Black, one of the documentary's co-directors and a member of the Pendleton 2 Defense Committee that formed in 2022, told the crowd, “We're here because we want to save two human lives that the state is hell-bent on ending and exterminating in a quiet hole all by themselves because of what they inspire in us. Because what they inspire in us is heroism.”

When the guards attacked Trotter and Cole, they fought back, which led to the hostage situation, Too Black recounted. “But no one died,” he said. “Yet still they got 200 years for it.”

The defense committee is pulling out all the stops ahead of the June 10 hearing, including most urgently asking for signatories to a letter of support.

Another defense committee member told Truthout they're looking to American Indian Movement (AIM) political prisoner Leonard Peltier's recent release as a paradigm for their campaign, which like Peltier's has to overcome entrenched institutional vindictiveness.

Just weeks ago, the five-year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd thrust renewed questions about bystanders intervening to stop acts of state violence while they're in process into the zeitgeist. In the film, Cole speaks about the anguish of the eyewitnesses who were not prepared to disrupt Derek Chauvin's slow suffocation of Floyd, a heartache he didn't have to suffer. Trotter declared himself in They Stood Up: “If I can be convicted for standing up and saving a person's life, then convict me. But I know it was morally the right thing to do. And I will continue to fight, and I ask that you fight with me.”

Given these confluences so alive in the moment and the imminence of the clemency hearing, the defense committee decided it was finally time to bring the fight to ground zero.

“This is the county where this happened, and I think that's the part we really need to stress,” Too Black told the rally. “We've done actions in the capital, we've shown the documentary across the world, but we've never really brought it here. But we've got to bring it here, because this is the place where they'll be released.”

Tamie Dixon-Tatum, an Anderson city employee, told Truthout she would have gone to the rally even if she weren't the director of the municipality's Civil and Human Rights Department.

Another prison guard later testified that the guards who attacked Love were members of the Sons of Light, an offshoot organization of the Ku Klux Klan.

“These gentlemen have been in prison for over 40 something years, and you know, they were trying to stand up to protect another gentleman, and that gentleman was being harmed in such a way. And so they literally put themselves, their lives on the line, to help someone else,” she said.

“Everybody in this picture is human,” Dixon-Tatum said. Yet she's concerned that there are bad actors working as guards and wardens who remain part of the picture. “Some of them were punished and removed from the prison system. Some of them are probably still there,” she said. “So, yeah, it's scary.”

Michelle Smith, executive director of Missouri Justice Coalition, told Truthout she travelled from St. Louis to stand with the Pendleton 2 because the reality for Black men behind bars in Missouri is also very scary. Since 2023, her organization has been supporting the family of Othel Moore in the aftermath of his death. Moore was a Black man in a Missouri Department of Corrections prison who was assaulted by guards in a secure location where no fellow incarcerated people could possibly come to his aid.

“Othel was beaten severely with billy clubs, and then they restrained him, and they maced him in the face,” Smith said. “So he was subdued, he was shackled, and then they put a spit hood over his head, and he suffocated to death. And that is very similar to what happened with the Pendleton 2 case, or would have happened, if Cole and Trotter hadn't stopped the guards. Because of that they saved Love's life.”

Indiana is very similar to Missouri, Smith said, in terms of how anti-Black racism operates inside and outside of its prisons.

“Indiana's a Klan state. In Missouri, it's Proud Boys and Oath Keepers,” she said. “Plenty of times I've been on the phone with men on the inside and heard the guards calling them the N-word. Are we tired of these injustices? Of course we are. So even from two states away, we're going to keep on fighting and advocating for these two men to come home,” she said.

Representatives from the Atlanta-based National Black Food & Justice Alliance told Truthout that they came to the rally for the Pendleton 2 because both the food system and the legal system are designed to uphold white supremacy. Their organization's analysis is that police brutality, police violence, and the criminal legal system are all inherently violent in the same ways that the food system is, arguing that they are designed to kill Black people.

Underscoring that reality, Love never received any grace from the system that had dehumanized and brutalized him. He died from COVID in 2020, still captive, 1 of 143 people to succumb to the virus in Indiana prisons that year. Incarcerated Indianans died at a rate even higher than the coronavirus-skewed national average, researchers found.

Erica Caines, from the Baltimore chapter of Black Alliance for Peace, told Truthout she'd traveled to Anderson, Indiana, as part of her organization's commitment to freeing political prisoners because “of our understanding that resistance breeds repression.” She likened the Pendleton 2 to journalist Mumia Abu Jamal, Black Panther Party member Jamil Al-Amin (formerly known as H. Rap Brown), and AIM member Leonard Peltier — all longtime captives of the state whose liberation Black Alliance for Peace has struggled for.

The defense committee is pulling out all the stops ahead of the June 10 hearing, including most urgently asking for signatories to a letter of support.

“In any war, you go and get your people back,” Caines said. “You negotiate for your people.”

There's a discipline involved in being part of a Black anti-imperialist, internationalist organization whose focus is to bring back the Black radical peace perspective, she explained.

“What's embodied by Balagoon and Naeem is the self-determination, the self- defense aspects we call for,” Caines told Truthout. “What does it mean to forge your own way with your back against the wall, when you know you can almost touch freedom, but you will risk it all for your person?”

At the time of the rebellion, Trotter only had three months remaining of his already onerous four-year sentence.

“That's the emphasis for our being out here,” Caines said. “We thought it important to show Anderson that these men have our support.” And, she added, “We can bring more people back if need be.”

Anderson city employee Dixon-Tatum sees a chance for the Indiana Department of Corrections to repair past wrongs.

“I want to say that Madison County is a place where hope still lives,” she said. “There were some bad officers, and people like to say ‘allegedly,' but it's actually been proven at this point. This is about doing right.”

            Bill Martin says he has heard all kinds of concerns lately from people considering a visit to the United States.
    


            “Worries about getting in, worries about being detained at the border. I think there is a worldwide fear about what is happening here,” said the Australian, who spoke to CNN recently while on an open-air bus tour of New York City.
    


            Martin is on a six-week trip that's included a cruise from Tokyo to Vancouver and a stopover in New York. Along the way he says he's had lots of conversations with his fellow travelers about how the US' status as a magnet for tourists has changed.
    


            “There is doubt as to whether people will get in (to the country),” he added. “And that causes people to think of a better destination to visit than the USA.”
    


Canadians are boycotting the US. Are American travelers still welcome in Canada?



            Eman Moretti, an Italian who is studying in the United States, said President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies have made him nervous about his family visiting him in New York.
    


            “With Trump it was a bit harder even for them to come,” said the student, flanked by his mother, father and his two brothers on a recent midday stroll through Times Square. “It was challenging, because you never know if people get in through customs. So it was a bit (of a) hostile environment.”
    


            “Your visa could be canceled,” added Javier Muenala, visiting Times Square from Ecuador. “So it's a lot of risks that many people don't want to take.”
    


            This anxiety from foreigners about travel to the US in 2025 is increasingly reflected in the numbers. Spending by international travelers to the United States is expected to be down $12.5 billion this year, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
    


            Some of the nation's leading tourist destinations, including Orlando, Miami and Los Angeles, are bracing for how the decline will impact businesses that rely on spending from international travelers.
    


            The downturn is being felt especially hard in New York City, the nation's top destination for international travel.
    


            New York City Tourism + Conventions, the city's official marketing organization, has cut its forecast for international tourists in 2025 by 17%. Julie Coker, the group's CEO and president, told CNN the city is expected to host 2 million fewer international travelers this year than in 2024.
    


            “We are still hopeful, but we are starting to see the bookings slow down some,” Coker said.
    


            “International tourism is extremely important to us because while it only makes up 20 percent of our total visitation, it accounts for 50 percent of our visitor spend. This was to be the year we were to hit pre-Covid levels … and so to have this stall or pause it's what's disappointing.”
    


            New York City is the most popular port of entry for international visitors to the US. And more people historically visit the US from Canada than from any other country. But there's recent evidence that some Canadians, offended by the political rhetoric coming from Washington, are boycotting the US.
    


            Coker says the decline in New York City tourism is partly the result of having fewer Canadian visitors.
    


            Tour operators such as Matt Levy, who has seen a slowdown in business, agrees.
    


            “They're going to Halifax, they're going to Nova Scotia, they're going to Vancouver. They're spending money in their own country, said Levy, owner of Spread Love Tours, which offers customized tours of New York for art lovers, foodies, families and other groups.
    


            Levy has been leading tours of the city for three years. He says much of his business relies on international tourism, especially Canadian student groups.
    


            But in recent months Levy says Canadian travel agents have told him their clients are avoiding the States because they're unnerved by threats of tariffs or turned off by Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st state.
    


            Levy said that if the political climate doesn't improve, business for him will likely be even worse in 2026.
    


            “Next year is going to be hard. Next year is going to be vicious,” he said.
    


            “My three largest Canadian clients, all three of them told me universally (that) the PTA boards aren't going to let the kids come to America. They're going to say, no, we're going to spend money in our country instead,” he said. “That's 40 percent of my business.”
    


            Renée Rewiski has been a tour guide in New York City for more than a decade and says she has not seen numbers like this since the doldrums of the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            “This time last year (we had) 20 people on the tour. We have five today,” Rewiski said on a recent day as she led a handful of tourists around lower Manhattan. “I'm just seeing fewer people and from fewer countries,” she said.
    


            Rewiski is a guide with Tours by Foot, which offers walking tours of such landmark New York neighborhoods as Brooklyn, Harlem and Greenwich Village. She worries that if something does not change soon, jobs could be at risk.
    


            “I'm not sure what we can do. I'm not sure how to change the attitudes, but just know people are losing their jobs in New York City (and) you're hurting the wrong people,” she said, addressing her comments to foreign tourists.
    


            “The people who are doing some of the things you're not liking are not the ones getting hurt,” she added. “We're the ones that are being hurt.”
    


            Despite the recent headwinds, no one CNN spoke to in the New York travel industry says they're giving up. The hope is the heated political climate will cool down and events such as the 2026 World Cup in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey, and the US' 250th anniversary next summer will boost interest among international visitors.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, has been returned to the United States to face federal criminal charges, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday.
    


            For months, the Trump administration has been locked in an intense standoff with the federal judiciary over court orders for the government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, where he was mistakenly deported in mid-March, in a situation that one federal judge warned could present an “incipient crisis” between the two branches.
    


            Abrego Garcia has been indicted on two criminal counts in the Middle District of Tennessee: conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.
    


            The indictment unsealed Friday afternoon accuses Abrego Garcia and others of partaking in a conspiracy in recent years in which they “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens who had no authorization to be present in the United States, and many of whom were MS-13 members and associates.”
    


            Abrego Garcia and his family say he fled gang violence in El Salvador and have denied allegations he's associated with MS-13.

How Kilmar Abrego Garcia's case became a political flashpoint



            The White House signed off on the decision to return Abrego Garcia to the US to face criminal charges, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The decision to return Abrego Garcia was made in the last few days, the sources said. The State Department was also involved in the decision-making, one of the sources said.
    


            However, President Donald Trump on Friday praised Bondi and the Justice Department for Abrego Garcia's return, and he said it was the department's decision to bring him back.
    


            “He should have never had to be returned, take a look at what's happened with it. Take a look at what they found in the grand jury,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. “I thought Pam Bondi did a great job.”
    


            While Trump administration officials pointed to the charges as justifying their effort to remove Abrego Garcia from the United States, the decision to prosecute prompted the resignation of the chief of the Justice Department's criminal division in Nashville, people briefed on the matter told CNN.
    


            Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, accused the Trump administration of “playing games” with the legal system and said his client should appear in immigration court, not criminal court.
    


            “The government disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order. Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him. This shows that they were playing games with the court all along,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement to CNN. “Due process means the chance to defend yourself before you're punished, not after. This is an abuse of power, not justice.”
    


ABC News first reported that Abrego Garcia was en route to the US.
    


            “Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,” Bondi said as she announced the charges at a news conference on Friday. She thanked Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele for agreeing to return Abrego Garcia to the US to face prosecution.
    


            The allegations date back to 2016 and involve a half-dozen alleged unnamed co-conspirators, with one, identified as CC-6 of Guatemala, described as being a “primary sources of supply of undocumented aliens for the conspiracy.”
    


            The conspiracy allegations outline how, over the years, Abrego Garcia and others worked to move undocumented aliens between Texas and Maryland and other states more than 100 times.
    


            Working with another co-conspirator, referred to as CC-1, Abrego Garcia and that unnamed individual “ordinarily picked up the undocumented aliens in the Houston, Texas area after the aliens had unlawfully crossed the Southern border of the United States from Mexico,” the indictment said.
    


            The two “then transported the undocumented aliens from Texas to other parts of the United States to further the aliens' unlawful presence in the United States.”
    


            Prosecutors said in the indictment that to cover up the alleged conspiracy, Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators “routinely devised and employed knowingly false cover stories to provide to law enforcement if they were stopped during a transport,” including claims that the migrants being transported were headed to construction jobs.
    


            Though prosecutors portrayed Abrego Garcia as being central to a crime-driven conspiracy, they did not describe him as the mastermind of the yearslong plot. Instead, he's identified as just one part of a sprawling conspiracy that was led by an unnamed co-conspirator.
    


            His conspiracy charges specifically relate to a trip in November 2022 where Abrego Garcia is accused of driving a Chevrolet Suburban and was pulled over on a Tennessee interstate highway, with nine other Hispanic male passengers who didn't have any identification or luggage.
    


            The indictment also describes the co-conspirator CC-1 as being part of an alleged scheme of transferring money alongside Abrego Garcia. Another co-conspirator, CC-2, is alleged with Abrego Garcia and another co-conspirator to have managed the cell phones of undocumented aliens “to ensure (they) could not and would not contact anyone else during the trip” within the US.
    


            Prosecutors allege that Abrego Garcia also transported narcotics to Maryland, though he wasn't charged with any crimes related to illegal drugs.
    


            Federal Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Nashville, Tennessee, determined that Abrego Garcia will be held in custody until at least next Friday, when there will be an arraignment and detention hearing, the Associated Press reported.
    


            Abrego Garcia appeared in court wearing a short-sleeved, white, button-down shirt, according to the AP. When asked if he understood the charges, he told the judge: “Sí. Lo entiendo.” An interpreter then said: “Yes. I understand.”
    


            The chief of Justice Department's criminal division in Nashville resigned over the decision to charge Abrego Garcia, people briefed on the matter said.
    


            The Justice Department's push to pursue human trafficking charges against Abrego Garcia had caused some disagreement among prosecutors in the Nashville US attorney's office, sources said.
    


            Ben Schrader, the chief of the criminal division in the US Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee, resigned the same week of the grand jury indictment last month.
    


            He posted a message on LinkedIn, which did not mention the Abrego Garcia case, saying he had resigned after nearly 15 years. Schrader added, “It has been an incredible privilege to serve as a prosecutor with the Department of Justice, where the only job description I've ever known is to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons.”
    


            Schrader, the Nashville US attorney's office and the Justice Department headquarters declined comment to CNN.
    


            A US official pointed CNN to the seriousness of the allegations in the indictment and said the administration's priority to pursue immigration enforcement means that anyone who didn't want to be a part of the use priorities can leave.
    


            Democratic lawmakers celebrated Abrego Garcia's return, while criticizing the Trump administration for deporting him in the first place and denying due process.
    


            “As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights – and the rights of all. The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along,” said Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador earlier this year.
    


            Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost said constitutional rights “are not subject to the whims of any president, past or present.”
    


            Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington said, “Mr. Abrego Garcia was kidnapped in front of his young child, and disappeared to El Salvador with no due process,” referring to the March traffic stop during which Abrego Gacia was taken into custody while his son was in the car.
    


            Republican members of Congress have commented publicly, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio thanked Bukele and Bondi in a Friday post on X, saying Abrego Garcia's can now “face justice for his crimes.”
    


            Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported in March to El Salvador due to an “administrative error,” according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. He was sent to the country's notorious mega-prison where he was held for weeks before being moved to another facility.
    


            The case became a political lightning rod for the Trump administration and its deportation program, while Trump's shifting rhetoric about whether he could return the Maryland father had raised questions about the administration's willingness to comply with the courts.
    


            But the administration's initial acknowledgement in a court filing that it mistakenly deported him opened it up to heightened scrutiny, even among Republicans otherwise supportive of Trump's agenda.
    


            Across the aisle, Van Hollen drew headlines when he visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, but his party has debated how much to embrace the Salvadoran national's removal and the due process argument as a rallying cry of opposition to the administration.
    


            Trump had said this spring that he could secure Abrego Garcia's return – contradicting previous remarks made by him and his top aides who said the US did not have the ability to bring him back because he was in the custody of a foreign government, despite the Supreme Court ruling that the Trump administration must “facilitate” his return.
    


            The administration's posture and legal arguments in the case had consistently frustrated both conservative and liberal jurists alike, who raised alarm bells about officials' apparent disregard for due process rights given their cavalier response to the deportation, which several different administration lawyers described as an “administrative error” that they were powerless to rectify.
    


            In April, for instance, Bondi insisted that Abrego Garcia “is not coming back to our country.”
    


            Bukele and Trump previously made clear during an April Oval Office meeting that Abrego Garcia would not be returned to the US. But on Friday, he said in a post on X: “We work with the Trump administration, and if they request the return of a gang member to face charges, of course we wouldn't refuse.”
    


            US District Judge Paula Xinis has allowed a fact-finding process to unfold so she can figure out what the government has been doing to comply with her directive that officials bring Abrego Garcia back to the US. But the case largely faded into the background in recent weeks as that discovery process has dragged on mostly out of public view.
    


            In the Maryland case, the Justice Department told the judge on Friday that they had complied with her order to bring Abrego Garcia back to the US, in a bid to end the political standoff that had put pressure on administration attorneys in court.
    


            “Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States today, to stand trial on criminal charges in the Middle District of Tennessee. Considering this development, the Court's preliminary injunction should be dissolved, and the underlying case should be dismissed as moot,” DOJ attorneys wrote in a brief filing.
    


            Abrego Garcia's return is far from a guarantee that he will remain in the US long-term. The administration's decision to deport him to El Salvador violated a 2019 order from a judge that said he could not be deported to his home country because of fears that he would face gang violence.

Trump administration returns migrant hastily deported to Mexico back to the US



            That mandate, however, did not preclude the government from removing him to a third country. Officials have previously said if he were returned to the US, they may deport him to another country or attempt to wipe away the 2019 order.
    


            Abrego Garica's case this year went all the way to the Supreme Court, where the justices in April required the administration to “facilitate” his return but not “effectuate” it. That somewhat cryptic language allowed the administration to claim a victory for weeks as Abrego Garcia remained in detention.
    


            The Supreme Court did not give the administration a deadline for when Abrego Garcia should be returned. The opinion was unsigned and no dissents were noted.
    


            As the Trump administration continues its aggressive crackdown on immigration, it has been accused of wrongly deporting at least two other men. Earlier this week, one of the men — a Guatemalan national who was hastily deported to Mexico — was returned to the US.

            The Texas Longhorns won the Women's College World Series in dominant fashion, blowing out Texas Tech 10-4 in Friday's winner-take-all Game 3 to clinch the program's first-ever national championship in softball.
    


            Despite Red Raiders superstar pitcher NiJaree Canady returning to the pitcher's mound after her complete-game win on Thursday, the Longhorns did not back down from the challenge to face one of softball's best players.
    


            Texas lit up the junior righthander, scoring five runs in the first inning, knocking the 21-year-old, two-time first team All-American out of the game early.
    


            A dejected Canady, who made national headlines earlier on Friday, after signing a second $1 million-plus NIL deal to keep her in Lubbock, Texas, for her senior year, according to the Associated Press, allowed the most runs in an inning in her illustrious career that started at Stanford.
    


            After left fielder Katie Stewart added another Texas run to extend the lead to 6-0 in the third inning, it was third baseman Mia Scott who made the biggest name for herself.
    


            In the fourth inning, the senior mashed a grand slam to break the game open with a 10-0 lead.
    


            Scott garnered the respect of Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback and Texas Tech alum Patrick Mahomes, who was at Devon Park in Oklahoma City watching his alma mater along with his wife, Brittany.
    

3rd baseman for Texas is cold..


            Like Mahomes has done many times in his career, the Red Raiders put forth a valid effort to get back into the game.
    


            Tech scored three runs in the fifth inning while adding another in the seventh inning, but it proved to be too little, too late after Longhorns starting pitcher Teagan Kavan got Lauren Allred to ground out to seal the victory.
    


            Texas players rushed the mound to embrace Kavan, who threw a masterful complete game, striking out three and allowing eight hits.
    


            The sophomore said being able to get the final out for the team “meant the world.”
    


            “I'm so happy for this team,” Kavan told the ESPN broadcast. “We did it. First Natty. Let's go! My grandma, the last thing she told my brother – one of the last things was to bring home a victory and we did that for her.”
    


            Texas head coach Mike White said that it was “surreal” to finally be lifting the trophy after coming to the school ahead of the 2019 season.
    


            “I can't believe its happened. … For us to come out on top tonight – we're so close to being knocked out. I am speechless to tell you the truth. It doesn't happen very often. But I am so proud of our ladies.”
    


            Texas had lost to Oklahoma in the championship series two of the last three years. The Sooners, who were looking to win their fifth straight title, were defeated by the Longhorns earlier in the tournament.
    


            White added that “in order to be the best, you got to beat the best” while calling Canady “tough and special.”

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tyler Fitzgerald scored on a wild pitch by Pierce Johnson with two outs in the 10th inning and the San Francisco Giants beat the Atlanta Braves 5-4 on Friday night for their third straight win.

After getting picked off first to end the ninth, Fitzgerald began the 10th on second base. He advanced to third on a one-groundout and then scored when Johnson (1-2) threw a 1-2 pitch to the backstop, sending the Braves to their fifth straight loss.

Spencer Bivens (2-2) came on with the bases loaded in the 10th and got Luke Williams on a groundout to end the inning for the win. 

Craig Kimbrel, the Braves' career leader in saves, made his first appearance for Atlanta since the 2014 season when he entered the game in the seventh. He allowed a leadoff single to Heliot Ramos, but got bailed out when Sean Murphy threw out Ramos trying to steal second to keep it tied at 4. 

Kimbrel then walked Jung Hoo Lee, but picked him off first and then struck out Wilmer Flores to get out of the inning. 

The Giants' struggling offense produced three runs in the first with help from two errors by Atlanta and a run-scoring wild pitch thrown by Spencer Schwellenbach.

San Francisco led 4-2 before the Braves tied it in the seventh when Matt Olson hit a two-run homer off reliever Ryan Walker.

There was an odd moment in the fourth inning when Murphy hit a sacrifice fly to right with the bases loaded for Atlanta. Olson easily beat the throw by Mike Yastrzemski, but there was confusion because a ball had been thrown on the field by a fan in the stands. The umpires huddled to discuss it, but let the play stand.




Both teams played their 26th one-run game, tied for the most in the majors. The Giants improved to 14-12 in those games and the Braves fell to 9-17. 

RHP Bryce Elder (2-3, 4.56 ERA) will start the middle game of the series for Atlanta against RHP Logan Webb (5-5, 2.55).

High school students Pandora Kjolsrud and Evan Clark were found dead in a remote area of Arizona on May 27, marking the second and third teenagers found dead in Tonto National Forest since February.

Kjolsrud, 18, and Clark, 17, were both found shot to death on May 27 near Mount Ord in the Tonto National Forest, north of Mesa, Arizona. A spokesperson for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office told Fox News Digital that the deaths are being investigated as homicides.

The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said it's ""actively"" investigating the deaths, but didn't release additional details. According to Fox 10, the Arcadia High School students were on a camping trip when they were found shot to death.

The remains of Emily Pike, 14, were found on Feb. 14 in Tonto National Park, 19 miles north of Globe, Arizona. She went missing from a group home in January, according to Fox 10, which reported her death was treated as a homicide. Her body was found dismembered more than 70 miles away from the group home she was reported missing from.

No arrests have been made in connection with Pike's death. The FBI and several local law enforcement agencies are investigating her death.

There has not been any connection made between the two cases, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.

A GoFundme for Kjolsrud's family says the 18-year-old ""had a vivacious personality with an infectious smile that brought joy to so many.""

""She was a beautiful human being and a bright light in this world who loved every single person she met and had a unique ability to make every person feel special,"" the GoFundme stated.

In a message attached to a fundraiser, Sandra Malibu Sweeney, Clark's mother, said that he ""wasn't a typical teenager.""

""He was funny, bright, kind and entrepreneurial. He was an old soul who was sensitive and loving. Evan wrote me letters, the last of which he gave me on Mother's Day that was so touching it made me both laugh and cry. He was special. He deserved a long life.""

The ‘Outnumbered' panel reacts to new developments in the case of a suspect charged with firebombing a Tesla dealership and a Republican Party headquarters.

The Progressive group ""Indivisible,"" which was behind many of the Tesla protests in recent months as well as mobilizing for other far-left causes, appears to now be getting involved in a key congressional swing district with the goal of growing resistance against President Donald Trump in Congress.

With primary races already underway for the 2026 Midterm elections, the group appears to have in their sights Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican in a critical swing state representing New York's 17th District, in the form of a candidate with extensive ties to the group, progressive Democrat and Rockland County legislator Beth Davidson. 

Davidson's social media presence includes several posts promoting Indivisible, including attending an event in June in Rockland, New York and Davidson was featured in a promotional video for Indivisible Northern Westchester that same month. 

Indivisible has been front and center in other aspects of the race and local chapters of the group helped to organize protests at Lawler town hall events in April and May.

Fox News Digital reported on local Indivisible chapter leaders in Rockland planning an anti-Lawler protest in April. Footage obtained by Fox News Digital of the meeting showed organizing committee leader Pascale Jean-Gilles discussing filling the entire street in front of the event.

""It is a long street, and we're trying to fill the entire street, so everyone coming into the rally will see people there and recognize it's not going to be all, like, sunshine and daisies,"" Jean-Gilles said.  

Ahead of the event, Davidson indicated that over a thousand protesters would attend the demonstration, saying on X: ""Please pass him a note that 1100 or so of his ‘friends' are excited to see him in my county legislative district tomorrow!""

At another Indivisible protest against Lawler earlier in the month, Davidson posted on X that she was ""proud to stand with more than a thousand people at the #HandsOff rally organized by @IndivisWstchr @1199seiu @nwindivisible@cwaunion and more to stand up for our freedoms and our future!""

""Mike Lawler may be silent on the daily assaults on healthcare, education, social security and national security, but We the People are NOT!"" said Davidson.

Davidson congratulated Indivisible Rockland for a ""packed event"" in April 2025 after speaking at one of their events a month earlier, accusing Lawler of hiding from his constituents. 

Bill Batson, a member of the Indivisible Rockland steering committee, gave $250 to Davidson's campaign via his own campaign committee, FEC records show. 

In response to Indivisible and Davidson's apparent collaboration, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Maureen O'Toole accused the group of ""infiltrating"" congressional races to undermine Trump's agenda.

""Indivisible has a new plan: Stop shouting outside congressional offices and start infiltrating them,"" said O'Toole. ""Their first attempt? NY-17, where they're backing far-left extremist Beth Davidson to carry out their agenda.""

Indivisible was founded in response to Trump's election in 2016, according to its website. The group's website says that they were ""brought together by a practical guide to resist the Trump agenda, Indivisible is a movement of thousands of group leaders and more than a million members taking regular, iterative, and increasingly complex actions to resist the GOPs agenda, elect local champions, and fight for progressive policies.""

Indivisible's presence at Tesla protests nationwide, according to a Washington Free Beacon report, included a ""reimbursement program"" for local activists that showed up at the protests.

Indivisible, a group that has received more than $7 million from the George Soros network since 2017, according to the New York Post, has also been involved in protests calling to ""abolish"" ICE. 

The group has also promoted defunding the police. 

Earlier this year, Indivisible published a ""tool kit"" with recommendations for protesting at town halls and lawmakers' district offices. A section on how to ""take the fight to Elon"" includes steps for planning and executing a demonstration at Tesla dealerships, showrooms and factories for Elon Musk's role as then-head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

While many of the protests outside Tesla dealerships were peaceful, the anti-Musk effort resulted in several instances of violence that the Department of Justice labeled ""domestic terrorism"", including acts of arson. 

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Lawler campaign spokesperson Chris Russell, called Davidson's association with Indivisible ""disgraceful.""

""They've had Nazi imagery and antisemitic tropes at their rallies and promoted a baseless election denialism conspiracy theory rooted in antisemitism on their website. I'm demanding she denounce them immediately, this dangerous rhetoric will lead to more violence and threatens our democracy.""

Davidson condemned the imagery at the rally she attended in a post on X in March saying, ""To be clear, I absolutely condemn the imagery of that poster. I will always be a voice against anti-Semitism and for my Jewish community. It's time for Mike Lawler to stop weaponizing antisemitism for his own political gain and stop using the Jewish community — my community, not his — as political pawns.""

Lawler responded on X making the case that Davidson's statement did not go far enough.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Davidson campaign for comment on this story. 

Davidson has been endorsed by Mondaire Jones, a progressive who is the last Democrat to hold Lawler's seat. 

The race for NY-17 will be one of the most closely watched in the country as Republicans attempt to preserve their razor-thin majority in Congress, which historically has proven difficult for the party in power following a new president taking office.

The Cook Political Report ranks the race, where Davidson is one of several Democrats running in the primary, as ""Lean Republican.""

Fox News contributor Richard Fowler and National Review editor-in-chief Rich Lowry join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss Trump's funding battle with Harvard.

A federal judge in Massachusetts on Thursday granted Harvard University's emergency request to block, for now, the Trump administration's effort to ban international students from its campus, siding with Harvard in ruling that the university would likely suffer ""immediate and irreparable harm"" if enforced.

The temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs blocks the administration from immediately stripping Harvard of its certification status under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, or SEVP — a program run by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that allows universities to sponsor international students for U.S. visas.

Burroughs said in her order that Harvard has demonstrated evidence it ""will suffer immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hear from all parties,"" prompting her to temporarily block the SEVP revocation. 

Still, some see the order as a mere Band-Aid, forestalling a larger court fight between Harvard and the Trump administration — and one that Trump critics say could be unfairly weighted against the nation's oldest university.

""Ultimately, this is about Trump trying to impose his view of the world on everybody else,"" Harvard Law professor Noah Feldman said in a radio interview discussing the Trump administration's actions. 

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the administration has frozen more than $2 billion in grants and contracts awarded to the university. It is also targeting the university with investigations led by six separate federal agencies. 

Combined, these actions have created a wide degree of uncertainty at Harvard.

The temporary restraining order handed down on Thursday night is also just that — temporary. Though the decision does block Trump from revoking Harvard's SEVP status, it's a near-term fix, designed to allow the merits of the case to be more fully heard.

Meanwhile, the administration is almost certain to appeal the case to higher courts, which could be more inclined to side in favor of the administration.

And that's just the procedural angle. 

JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA

Should Harvard lose its status for SEVP certification — a certification it has held for some 70 years — the thousands of international students currently enrolled at Harvard would have a very narrow window to either transfer to another U.S. university, or risk losing their student visas within 180 days, experts told Fox News. 

Some may opt not to take that chance, and transfer to a different school that's less likely to be targeted by the administration — even if it means sacrificing, for certainty, a certain level of prestige.

Regardless of how the court rules, these actions create ""a chilling effect"" for international students at Harvard, Aram Gavoor, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School and a former Justice Department attorney, said in an interview.

Students ""who would otherwise be attending or applying to Harvard University [could be] less inclined to do so, or to make alternative plans for their education In the U.S.,"" Gavoor said. 

Even if the Trump administration loses on the merits of the case, ""there's a point to be argued that it may have won as a function of policy,"" Gavoor said.

Meanwhile, any financial fallout the school might see as a result is another matter entirely.

Though the uncertainty yielded by Trump's fight against Harvard could prove damaging to the school's priority of maintaining a diverse international student body, or by offering financial aid to students via the federally operated Pell Grant, these actions alone would unlikely to prove financially devastating in the near-term, experts told Fox News. 

Harvard could simply opt to fill the slots once taken by international students with any number of eager, well-qualified U.S.-based applicants, David Feldman, a professor at William & Mary who focuses on economic issues and higher education, said in an interview. 

Harvard is one of just a handful of American universities that has a ""need-blind"" admissions policy for domestic and international students — that is, they do not take into consideration a student's financial need or the aid required in weighing a potential applicant. But because international students in the U.S. typically require more aid than domestic students, replacing their slots with domestic students, in the near-term, would likely have little noticeable impact on the revenue it receives for tuition, fees and housing, he said. 

""This is all about Harvard, choosing the best group of students possible,"" Feldman said in an interview. If the administration successfully revokes their SEVP certification, this would effectively just be ""constraining them to choose the second-best group,"" he said.

""Harvard could dump the entire 1,500-person entering class, just dump it completely, and look at the next 1,500 [applicants],"" Feldman said. ""And by all measurables that you and I would look at, it would look just as good.""

Unlike public schools, which are subject to the vagaries of state budgets, private universities like Harvard often have margins built into their budgets in the form of seed money that allows them to allocate more money towards things they've identified as goals for the year or years ahead.

This allows them to operate with more stability as a result — and inoculates them to a larger degree from the administration's financial hits.

""Uncertainty is bad for them,"" Feldman acknowledged. But at the end of the day, he said, ""these institutions have the capacity to resist.""

""They would rather not — they would rather this whole thing go away,"" Feldman said. But the big takeaway, in his view, is that Harvard ""is not defenseless.""

E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users.

The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980. 

By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer. 

MIT engineers are stepping up to this challenge with E-BAR, a mobile robot designed to physically support seniors and prevent falls as they move around their homes.

E-BAR, short for Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.

The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.

What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.

Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.

TOP TABLETS FOR SENIORS: EASY, DISTRACTION-FREE AND WI-FI OPTIONAL

The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.

MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.

HOW VR TECHNOLOGY IS CURING LONELINESS IN SENIORS 

Currently, MIT's E-BAR robot is still in the prototype stage and is not yet available for consumer purchase. The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5–10 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.

Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age. The ultimate goal is to provide seamless, continuous support, empowering seniors to live safely and confidently in their own homes.

What stands out about E-BAR is how it's designed with real people in mind, not just as a tech gadget. It's easy to see how something like this could make a big difference for seniors wanting to stay independent without feeling tied down by bulky or uncomfortable devices. As the technology improves, it could change the way we think about caring for older adults, making everyday life safer and a bit easier for everyone involved.

Charles Barkley calls the NCAA 'idiots' and 'fools' during an appearance on OutKick's ""Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich.""

A federal judge granted final approval on Friday to the $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to begin paying athletes directly.

Judge Claudia Wilken approved the settlement on Friday that will allow schools to pay their athletes next month.

The sweeping terms of the so-called House settlement include approval for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion that will be paid over the next decade to thousands of former players who were barred from that revenue for years.

Payouts will be determined based on the sport and the length of athletic career, with most football and men's basketball players able to receive nearly $135,000 each.

However, the highest estimated payout is expected to be nearly $2 million, thanks to ""Lost NIL Opportunities,"" according to the law firm.

Nearly five years after Arizona State swimmer Grant House sued the NCAA and its five biggest conferences to lift restrictions on revenue sharing, Wilken approved the final proposal that had been hung up on roster limits, just one of many changes ahead amid concerns that thousands of walk-on athletes will lose their chance to play college sports.

The deal covers three antitrust cases — including the class-action lawsuit known as House vs. the NCAA — that challenged NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016. The plaintiffs claimed that NCAA rules denied thousands of athletes the opportunity to earn millions of dollars off the use of their names, images and likenesses.

SIMONE BILES SPARS WITH RILEY GAINES OVER TRANS ATHLETE DEBATE, LAUNCHES PERSONAL ATTACK: 'TRULY SICK'

The NCAA lifted its ban on athletes earning money through endorsement and sponsorship deals in 2021.

At one point, President Donald Trump was considering an executive order to regulate name, image and likeness in college sports after meeting with legendary Alabama Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban, the Wall Street Journal reported.

On Fox News last year, Saban urged Congress to step in and make NIL ""equal across the board.""

""And I think that should still exist for all players, but not just a pay-for-play system like we have now where whoever raises the most money in their collective can pay the most for the players, which is not a level playing field. I think in any competitive venue, you want to have some guidelines that gives everyone an equal opportunity to have a chance to be successful,"" he said.

The settlement also called for a clearinghouse to make sure any NIL deal worth more than $600 is pegged at fair market value in an attempt to thwart supposed pay-for-play deals.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Kilmar Abrego Garcia returns to the US — but not the way his supporters wanted","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3434546/kilmar-abrego-garcia-returns-to-the-us-human-smuggling/","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 02:34:59 GMT","

KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA RETURNS TO THE US — BUT NOT THE WAY HIS SUPPORTERS WANTED. For two months, Democrats have agitated on behalf of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant, alleged gang member, and suspected human trafficker whom the Trump administration deported to El Salvador. Picked up by police in Maryland in 2019, Abrego Garcia was given a deportation order on the basis of his unlawful presence in the United States and gang activity. But the immigration judge specifically ordered that Abrego Garcia not be deported to his home country of El Salvador, where Abrego Garcia claimed he would be in danger.

As it turned out, Abrego Garcia never went anywhere until March of this year, when he was arrested as part of the new Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants who have received deportation orders. But as everyone knows, U.S. authorities deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — precisely where the judge had said he should not be sent.

The Trump administration admitted it made a mistake but also maintained that once Abrego Garcia was in prison in El Salvador, the U.S. had little power to bring him back. By then, many Democrats had turned Abrego Garcia into an anti-Trump cause. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador and said he passed on a “message of love” from Abrego Garcia's wife to Kilmar. Van Hollen assured reporters that all the efforts to bring Abrego Garcia home, plus his family's love, gave Abrego Garcia “the strength to persevere.” For many Democrats, activists, and their allies in the media, it was a touching story.

Not long after, though, the administration passed on information about Abrego Garcia's alleged gang activities and allegations he had abused his wife, who had sought protective orders against him. And then came information that he had been stopped driving in Tennessee in 2022 with a car full of what appeared to be illegal immigrants. 

The Tennessee story looked quite suspicious. “On December 1, 2022, subject was observed speeding and unable to maintain its lane and was subsequently pulled over,” police documents said. “Upon approach to the vehicle, encountering officer noted that there were eight other individuals in the vehicle with the subject, who was identified as the driver. Subject stated he was driving ‘three days ago' from Houston, TX to Temple Hills, MD to bring in people to perform construction work. There was no luggage in the vehicle, leading the encountering officer to suspect this was a human trafficking incident. All the passengers gave the same home address as the subject's home address. During the interview, subject pretended to speak less English than he was capable of and attempted to put encountering officer off-track by responding to questions with questions.”

It very quickly appeared that the Tennessee matter might become a serious problem for Abrego Garcia and his supporters. And now, that has turned out to be the case. On Friday afternoon, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that federal prosecutors in Tennessee have indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts of human smuggling. 

Prosecutors allege that Abrego Garcia, acting with several coconspirators, “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens who had no authorization to be present in the United States, and many of whom were MS-13 members and associates.” There were more than 100 trips in all, prosecutors say. The indictment also alleges that Abrego Garcia “worked with transnational criminal organizations in Mexico to transport undocumented aliens through Mexico and into the United States.”

The indictment refers to Abrego Garcia's alleged coconspirators as “CC-1” and “CC-2,” etc., and gives readers an idea of how the scheme worked. For example, CC-1 was at one time imprisoned for alien smuggling. During CC-1's time in jail, CC-1 directed another coconspirator, CC-2, to work with Abrego Garcia to transport illegal immigrants deep inside the U.S. When CC-1 was released from prison and deported, he turned around and illegally reentered the U.S. and returned to his work with Abrego Garcia, CC-2, and others. The indictment also says Abrego Garcia and his coconspirators occasionally smuggled illegal guns and drugs from Texas into Maryland. 

Then, Abrego Garcia was stopped on Interstate 40 in Putnam County, Tennessee. Contrary to the early reports, the indictment says he had nine, not eight, passengers with him. (Abrego Garcia apparently modified his Chevy Suburban to turn it into a little bus.) He allegedly lied to police, telling them he had been in St. Louis when in fact he had been taking his usual route of picking up illegal immigrants in the Houston, Texas, area. 

“The grand jury found that over the past nine years, Abrego Garcia has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring,” Bondi said Friday. “They found this was his full-time job, not a contractor.” So much for the hardworking Maryland dad thing.

Now, Abrego Garcia is back in the U.S., behind bars in Tennessee. Acting on Democratic lawsuits and the actions of an activist judge, the Supreme Court in April ordered the administration to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador. Now, the administration has done precisely that.

Early on, after reports came out of Abrego Garcia's alleged gang membership and spousal abuse, the Democrats who took up his cause hurried to explain that they did not really support Abrego Garcia personally — they just wanted to make sure he received due process in the U.S. Well, now Abrego Garcia is receiving due process in the U.S. It should be a satisfying ending for both sides.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The events at the White House had all the makings of being a lost week. President Donald Trump's court wins, trade successes, and unexpectedly positive jobs report were being overshadowed by his rant against top corporate ally-turned budget critic Elon Musk.

The Tesla titan, who left Washington with a gold key to the Oval Office for his work with DOGE cutting spending and waste in the swamp, baited the president by criticizing Trump's “big, beautiful bill” of tax cuts and spending increases.

And as usual, Trump took the bait and the two exploded their social media with attacks on each other.

But a day later, something that Trump fans have long waited to see happened. The president showed he was the bigger man, calmly deflecting the media's efforts to whip up the feud further. Pressed on Air Force One Friday to whack Musk, Trump chose the presidential path and said, “I just wish him well.”

We'll see if a truce is in the works, but our friend and author Tevi Troy said he expects the two to make nice, just like they have in the past after public spats.

“In any clash between presidents and CEOs, presidents have the power in the short term, but CEOs have the ability to outlast presidential tenures. This means that both sides ultimately have an interest in accommodation rather than conflict,” Troy told Secrets Friday.

Our graders, Democratic pollster John Zogby and conservative analyst Jed Babbin, were entertained by the public fight but also found more significant issues to focus on.

Forget Ali versus Fraser, the so-called “Fight of the Century.”

The inevitable blowout of the millennium has now begun, and it is predictably volcanic. The two men characterized by narcissism and unprecedented hyperbole appear to be basically right about their charges against each other. I will probably be writing more about this next week so I will hold for now but thus far Elon Musk is angry that his $300 million investment in President Donald Trump and all things GOP has proven to be a colossal waste because the “big, beautiful bill” Trump is promoting doesn't reflect his principles and ideas.

Trump, for his part, is riled because his investments in Musk Inc. in the form of government largesse have not produced the undying loyalty that is required. Enough for now!

The May jobs report was slow as expected but still showed some growth in new jobs. However, more Americans, 7.24 million, are unemployed today — the largest since 2017. Inflation is down but the message is not getting out.

In addition to frothing at Musk, the president is attacking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, former buddy Vladimir Putin, and The Boss, Bruce Springsteen (that is redundant!). Even Republicans are not liking that.

The administration is now privately admitting that too many federal employees were fired. Is this any way to run a circus? Well, actually, it is. The president won a 9-0 Supreme Court case putting another nail in DEI and his polling numbers remain unchanged.

It was another good week for President Donald Trump. Not a great week but a good one. There was some progress on the massive budget reconciliation bill, Trump put a travel ban on a dozen countries and his war with the Ivy League colleges continued. And then there was his personal feud with Elon Musk.

“Progress” on the reconciliation bill was both positive and negative, with Republicans' slim majorities in both houses of Congress magnifying every dissenter's impact. The Congressional Budget Office said that Trump's tariffs could cut budget deficits by $2.8 trillion, but also said that the bill would add about $2 trillion to the national debt. Trump wants to eliminate the statutory debt limit (which Congress raises often), and that didn't please fiscal conservatives. Many are talking about how the debt is about to strangle our country.

Trump's new travel ban covers several of what Trump called the “s***hole” countries in his first term. The new list includes Cuba, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Trump is definitely on the right side of this issue but there will, inevitably, be lawsuits.

Trump's administration was the subject of about six more court orders delaying or supposedly canceling administration actions. The Supreme Court is going to have to take up the question of whether individual judges can issue national bans on Trump's action.

Trump's personal feud with Musk began when the Tesla chief condemned the reconciliation bill as a disaster. The two exchanged shots all week which is a fun diversion from the unpleasant tasks each of them face.

Trump has made zero progress on peace in Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin or on his nuclear negotiations with Iran. Some day he'll learn that neither is going to produce any positive result and that both have to be dealt with in another, far more forceful way.

And Trump is continuously helped by the Democrats' inability to say anything other than “orange man bad.” The latest fun is from former President Joe Biden, whose autopen exercises are at best suspect of manipulation. Biden issued a statement saying, “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false.” But as an old man with a bad memory — in the words of Special Counsel Robert Hur — how would Biden even know?

President Donald Trump told reporters Friday on Air Force One that he has been so busy working on foreign policy that he has not had time to think about Elon Musk after his feud with the billionaire.

Trump fought with Musk over social media Thursday, exchanging threats ranging from cancelling government contracts to starting a new centrist political party. Musk even accused the president of being in the Jeffrey Epstein files, citing that as the reason for their delayed release.

“I've been so busy working on China, Russia, Iran … I'm not thinking about Elon,” Trump said. “I just wish him well.”

When asked about a New York Times report surrounding Musk's alleged drug abuse, Trump opted not to attack his adviser-turned-adversary and instead said the report sounded “unfair.”

Musk disagreed with the government spending in Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” which the Tesla CEO believes will add to the national debt.

A call had been reportedly scheduled between Trump and Musk for Friday, but Trump said Friday morning that he was not interested in a call. He said Musk had gone “crazy” after the Epstein comments and after Musk claimed that Trump's tariffs would cause a recession. The billionaire also decommissioned the Dragon spacecraft before reversing his move later.

“No, I won't be speaking to him for a while, I guess, but I wish him well,” Trump told CNN, the outlet reported Friday morning.

“I'm not even thinking about Elon,” Trump said. “He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem.”

Musk signaled a willingness to reconcile with Trump on Thursday evening, saying, “You're not wrong,” in response to a post by Bill Ackman, who said the pair should make peace “for the benefit of our great country.”

But Musk suggested on Friday afternoon that Trump's attacks on him were unwarranted because he was initially criticizing Congress.

Thomas Friedman discusses the chaos of the president's conflicts—and how the wider world is viewing the instability.

In Donald Trump's first administration, he was surrounded by buffers and filters—but in his second, he's surrounded by amplifiers. On a special edition of Washington Week With The Atlantic, the foreign-affairs columnist Thomas Friedman joins to discuss the chaos of Trump's conflicts, and how world leaders are viewing the instability.

Meanwhile, the end of Donald Trump's friendship with Elon Musk was never really a question of “if,” but “when.” “Nothing here is modeled, nothing here is stress-tested, everything is a rift,” Friedman said last night. “The country is being run like the Trump organization today, not like the United States of America.”

When it comes to Trump and Musk's feud, “we're dealing with two extremely unstable characters,” Friedman continues. “But what's really more important is: What's the wider world audience saying?”

The president is not just abusing the immunity that the Supreme Court granted him. He might be seeking to expand it.

President Donald Trump's presidential memorandum ordering an investigation of Joe Biden's cognitive decline and his use of the autopen is just the most recent step in Trump's hostile takeover of the Department of Justice. It is also nonsensical fan service, amplifying addled MAGA conspiracy theories that contend, with a straight face, that Biden was really a robotic clone. In these senses, the investigative order was a sign of just another Wednesday in the chaotic, topsy-turvy world of Trump.

On a legal level, one thing is striking about the text of the memo: The order does not explicitly target Biden himself, at least not directly—only the aides who supposedly facilitated Biden's use of the autopen and suppressed evidence of his decline. Biden's absence as a direct target is almost certainly the result of last summer's Supreme Court decision in Trump v. United States granting presidents immunity for “official” acts. That decision was intended to stanch a cycle of retribution. The Biden administration's investigation of Trump, the argument goes, would beget the vengeful Trump investigation of Biden. And so on, the Court feared, ad infinitum, with each successive turn of the political wheel. By this logic, the decision is what is now protecting Biden from just the sort of retribution the Court hoped to avoid.

But although the decision will have occasional positive impact, its flaws are manifested almost every day. Even on its own terms, the Trump opinion evidently failed to achieve its objective. Far from preventing retaliatory and escalatory criminal investigations, it has enabled them. And now, with this new memo, Trump's team may be setting the country on a path to further expand the immunity bubble, to protect not just the president but his aides as well—enabling yet more lawlessness.

Paul Rosenzweig: The destruction of the Department of Justice

To begin with, the absurd investigation of Biden's cognitive decline was almost certainly encouraged by the immunity decision itself—in the sense that the grant of presidential immunity frees Trump from any personal responsibility for his own “creative” use of the law. In a rational world, Trump might face legal consequences for his illicit abuse of the criminal-justice system—in the form, say, of a civil suit for malicious prosecution. But thanks to Trump v. United States, Trump is free to undertake any plausibly official act with complete impunity, including ordering nonsensical investigations of those who worked for his predecessor. Even if Biden is protected, the Court's immunity calculus failed to account for Trump's obsession and left open the possibility that an opponent's aides would be targeted.

Which brings us to the final and, perhaps, most insidious aspect of Trump's order: a possible further expansion of presidential immunity. Following the Trump decision, some defenders of the Court contended that the adverse impact of granting presidents criminal immunity would be minimal. Aides to the president, through whom he acted, would, they argued, remain subject to criminal prosecution and thus be deterred from partaking in criminal activity. And so, the argument went, the grant of presidential immunity was no big deal in the grand scheme of things.

The argument is a comforting one, but other possibilities exist. A nonfrivolous argument can be made that, because a president can act only through subordinates, a faithful reading of Trump would extend presidential immunity to those whose assistance he requires to effectuate his official presidential actions. If we grant the (in my view, ahistorical) Supreme Court premise that immunizing core presidential conduct was, in the Founders' minds, essential to enable presidential action, then it seems wildly inconsistent to simultaneously prevent the president from acting effectively by denying the same protection to his essential subordinates.

Others have seen this inconsistency and tried to use it to buttress claims that aides should also be immune. For example, as part of its Trump holding, the Court explicitly determined that Trump's pre–January 6 directions to the Department of Justice to investigate alleged election fraud were absolutely immune acts. Building on that holding, one of Trump's DOJ allies, Jeffrey Bossert Clark, has argued that he is covered by derivative presidential immunity for what he did at Trump's request, and that he cannot be prosecuted or disciplined for acting on Trump's behalf.

This is not the law as of now, and in the present state of affairs, Clark (and his successors in Trump's current administration) will likely lose a claim of immunity. But one suspects strongly that part of Trump's motivation (or, more probably, that of his self-interested advisers) in authorizing the Biden investigation is to change the law.

The investigation will, as noted, target Biden's aides. Those aides may, under the pressure of criminal inquiry, offer the same sort of defense that Clark has—I was working for the president, and I share his immunity. The sheer outrageousness of Trump's investigation may tempt courts to side with Biden's aides, shielding them from the time, expense, and anguish of a frivolous investigation.

Bob Bauer: Trump is poised to turn the DoJ into his personal law firm

And that temptation may be just what Trump's team is counting on: using a bogus investigation of Biden to set a precedent to shield their own subsequent criminal activity. Adopting that doctrine would remove the last shred of structural restraint on Trump's team—the specter of post-Trump prosecution.

Perhaps I'm overthinking this, and the bank shot to derivative immunity for Trump's aides never occurred to the Trump team (in which case, I apologize for putting it on their radar). Perhaps this investigation is indeed merely fan service.

But I think not. If anything, the Trump team has demonstrated a remarkably sophisticated understanding of how to assert unilateral presidential authority to work an expansion of presidential power. Therein lies the danger. Even if the result of aide immunity is not intended, it may be what lies ahead. The country must avoid this—and thus Biden's aides must seek to defend themselves against the outrageous investigation of Biden's cognition on the merits, not on any procedural immunity grounds. That way is more burdensome, to be sure, but in the end, it will be far better for the nation.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Not everything the Trump administration does is a threat to democracy.

President Donald Trump has gotten his way and will oversee a military parade in Washington, D.C., this summer on the Army's birthday, which also happens to be his own. Plans call for nearly 7,000 troops to march through the streets as 50 helicopters buzz overhead and tanks chew up the pavement. One option has the president presiding from a viewing stand on Constitution Avenue as the Army's parachute team lands to present him with an American flag.

The prospect of all this martial pomp, scheduled for June 14, has elicited criticism from many quarters. Some of it is fair—this president does not shy away from celebrating himself or flexing executive power, and the parade could be seen as an example of both—but some of it is misguided. Trump has a genius for showmanship, and showcasing the American military can be, and should be, a patriotic celebration.

The president wanted just such a tribute during his first term, after seeing France's impressive Bastille Day celebrations. Then–Secretary of Defense James Mattis reportedly refused, effectively threatening to resign by telling the president to ask his next secretary of defense. Three secretaries of defense later, Trump has gotten enthusiastic agreement from current Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Criticism of the display begins with its price tag, estimated as high as $45 million. The projected outlay comes at a time of draconian budget cuts elsewhere: “Cutting cancer research while wasting money on this? Shameful,” Republicans Against Trump posted on X. “Peanuts compared to the value of doing it,” Trump replied when asked about the expense. “We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we're going to celebrate it.”

Read: The case for a big, beautiful military parade

Other prominent critics of the Trump administration have expressed concern that the parade's real purpose is to use the military to intimidate the president's critics. The historian Heather Cox Richardson wrote on her Substack, “Trump's aspirations to authoritarianism are showing today in the announcement that there will be a military parade on Trump's 79th birthday.” Ron Filipkowski, the editor in chief of the progressive media company MeidasTouch, posted, “The Fuhrer wants a Nuremberg style parade on his birthday.” Experts on civil-military relations in the United States also expressed consternation. “Having tanks rolling down streets of the capital doesn't look like something consistent with the tradition of a professional, highly capable military,” the scholar Risa Brooks told The New York Times. “It looks instead like a military that is politicized and turning inwardly, focusing on domestic-oriented adversaries instead of external ones.” Even the military leadership has been chary. During Trump's first term, then–Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman Paul Selva reflected that military parades are “what dictators do.”

But these critics may well be projecting more general concerns about Trump onto a parade. Not everything the Trump administration does is destructive to democracy—and the French example suggests that dictatorships are not the only governments to hold military displays. The U.S. itself has been known to mount victory parades after successful military campaigns. In today's climate, a military parade could offer an opportunity to counter misperceptions about the armed forces. It could bring Americans closer to service members and juice military recruitment—all of which is sorely needed.

The American military is shrinking, not due to a policy determination about the size of the force needed, but because the services cannot recruit enough Americans to defend the country. In 2022, 77 percent of American youth did not qualify for military service, for reasons that included physical or mental-health problems, misconduct, inaptitude, being overweight, abuse of drugs or alcohol, or being a dependent. Just 9 percent of Americans ages of 16 to 24 (a prime recruitment window) are even interested in signing up. In 2023, only the Marine Corps and Space Force met their recruiting goals; the Army and Navy recruited less than 70 percent of their goals and fell 41,000 recruits short of sustaining their current force. Recruiting picked up dramatically in 2024 but remains cause for concern.

One possible reason for this is that most Americans have little exposure to men and women in uniform. Less than 0.5 percent of Americans are currently serving in the military—and many who do so live, shop, and worship on cordoned military bases. Misperceptions about military service are therefore rife. One is that the U.S. military primarily recruits from minority groups and the poor. In fact, 17 percent of the poorest quintile of Americans serve, as do 12 percent of the richest quintile. The rest of the military is from middle-income families. Those who live near military bases and come from military families are disproportionately represented. The Army's polling indicates that concerns about being injured, killed, or suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder are major impediments to recruitment. Women worry that they will be sexually harassed or assaulted (the known figures on this in the U.S. military are 6.2 percent of women and 0.7 percent of men). Additionally, a Wall Street Journal–NORC poll found that far fewer American adults considered patriotism important in 2023 (23 percent) than did in 1998 (70 percent)—another possible reason that enthusiasm for joining up has dampened.

Read: The all-volunteer force is in crisis

A celebratory parade could be helpful here, and it does not have to set the country on edge. Americans seem comfortable with thanking military men and women for their service, having them pre-board airplanes, applauding them at sporting events, and admiring military-aircraft flybys. None of those practices is suspected of corroding America's democracy or militarizing its society. Surely the nation can bear up under a military parade once every decade or two, especially if the parade serves to reconnect veterans of recent wars, who often—rightly—grumble that the country tends to disown its wars as matters of concern to only those who serve in them.

The risk, of course, is that Trump will use the occasion not to celebrate the troops but to corrode their professionalism by proclaiming them his military and his generals. This is, after all, the president who claimed that Dan Caine, his nominee to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wore a MAGA hat and attested his willingness to kill for Trump, all of which Caine denies. This is also a president known to mix politics with honoring the military, as he did in Michigan, at Arlington National Cemetery, at West Point's commencement, and in a Memorial Day post on Truth Social calling his opponents “scum.”

Even so, the commander in chief has a right to engage with the military that Americans elected him to lead. The responsibility of the military—and of the country—is to look past the president's hollow solipsism and embrace the men and women who defend the United States.

Being from a military family or living near a military base has been shown to predispose people toward military service. This suggests that the more exposure people have to the military, the likelier they are to serve in it. A big celebration of the country's armed forces—with static displays on the National Mall afterward, and opportunities for soldiers to mix with civilians—could familiarize civilians with their armed forces and, in doing so, draw talented young Americans to serve.

Depictions of extreme wealth are everywhere on the small screen and, well, it's all quite boring.

Watching Carrie Bradshaw—erstwhile sex columnist, intrepid singleton, striver—float down the majestic staircase of her new Gramercy townhouse on a recent episode of And Just Like That while wearing a transparent tulle gown, on an errand to mail a letter, is one of the most cognitively dissonant television experiences I've had recently. And Just Like That has never been a particularly imaginative show with regard to women in midlife, but there's still something fundamentally off about seeing one of the canonical female characters of our era transformed into a Gilded Age archetype, worrying about a garden renovation and choosing back-ordered fabric for a chaise. Carrie, suddenly, has many hats. She communicates with a lover via handwritten notes while she waits for his liberation from the home front in Virginia.

What's happened to Carrie, truly, is money. Two decades after Sex and the City rolled to a televised close, acknowledging that its own cultural relevance was waning, its characters continue in zombified form on And Just Like That, pickled in a state of extreme privilege where nothing can touch them. The drama is lifeless, involving rehashed old storylines about beeping alarm systems and “a woman's right to shoes” that serve mostly as a backdrop for clothes. Charlotte, in a questionable lace workout jacket, worries that her dog has been unfairly canceled. Miranda, in one of a series of patterned blouses, gets really into a Love Island–style reality show. (Remember Jules and Mimi?) Lisa wears feathers to a fundraiser for her husband's political campaign. Seema, in lingerie, nearly burns her apartment down when she falls asleep with a lit cigarette, but in the end, all she loses is an inch or so of hair.

The point of the show is no longer what happens, because nothing does. The point is to set up a series of visual tableaus showcasing all the things money can buy, as though the show were an animated special issue of Vogue or Architectural Digest. What's stranger still is that a series that once celebrated women in the workplace has succumbed to financial ideals right out of Edith Wharton: The women who earned their money themselves (Miranda and Seema) somehow don't have enough of it (spoiler—they still seem to have a lot), while the ones who married money (Carrie, Charlotte, Lisa) breeze through life as an array of lunches, fundraisers, and glamping trips, with some creative work dotted into the mix for variety. The banal details of exorbitant wealth—well, it's all quite boring.

Read: We need to talk about Miranda

Lately, most of television seems stuck in the same mode. Virtually everything I've watched recently has been some variation of rich people pottering around in “aspirational” compounds. On Sirens and The Better Sister, glossy scenes of sleek couture and property porn upstage the intrigue of the plot. On Mountainhead, tech billionaires tussle in a Utah mountain retreat featuring 21,000 square feet of customized bowling alleys and basketball courts. On Your Friends & Neighbors, a disgraced hedge-fund manager sneers at the vacuous wealth of his gated community (where houses cost seven to eight figures), but also goes to criminal lengths to maintain his own living standards rather than lower them by even a smidge. And on With Love, Meghan, the humble cooking show has gotten a Montecito-money glow-up.

“I miss TV without rich people,” the writer Emily J. Smith noted last month on Substack, observing that even supposedly normie shows such as Tina Fey's marital comedy The Four Seasons and Erin Foster's unconventional rom-com Nobody Wants This seem to be playing out in worlds where money is just not an issue for anyone. This is a new development: As Smith points out, sitcoms including Roseanne and Married … With Children have historically featured families with recognizable financial constraints, and the more recent dramedies of the 2010s were riddled with economic anxiety. Reality television, it's worth noting, has been fixated on the lifestyles of the rich and bored virtually since its inception, but as its biggest stars have grown their own fortunes exponentially, the genre has mostly stopped documenting anything other than wealth, which it fetishizes via the gaudy enclaves and private jets of Selling Sunset and Bling Empire.

Serialized shows, too, no longer seem interested in considering the stakes and subtleties of most people's lives. Television is preoccupied with literary adaptations about troubled rich white women, barbed satires about absurdly wealthy people on vacation, thrillers about billionaire enclaves at the end of the world. Even our contemporary workplace series (Severance, Shrinking) play out in fictional realms where people work not for the humble paychecks that sustain their lives, but to escape the grief that might otherwise consume them.

What does it mean that our predominant fictional landscapes are all so undeniably “elevated,” to use a word cribbed from the Duchess of Sussex? And Just Like That is evidence of how hard it is for shows that take wealth for granted to have narrative stakes, and how stultifying they become as a result. But we also lose something vital when we no longer see 99 percent of American lives reflected on the small screen. Money isn't just making TV boring. It's also reshaping our collective psyche—building a shared sense of wealth as the only marker of a significant life, and rich people as the only people worthy of our gaze. We're not supposed to be able to empathize with the characters on-screen, these strutting zoo animals in $1,200 shoes and $30,000-a-night villas. But we're not being encouraged to empathize with any other kinds of characters, either—to see the full humanity and complexity of so many average people whose lives feel ever more precarious in this moment, and ever more in need of our awareness.

On an episode in the final season of Sex and the City, a socialite named Lexi Featherston cracks a floor-to-ceiling window, lights a cigarette, and declares that New York is over, O-V-E-R. “When did everybody stop smoking?” she sneers. “When did everybody pair off?” As the hostess glares at her, she continues: “No one's fun anymore. Whatever happened to fun? God, I'm so bored I could die.”

Famous last words: Lexi, of course, promptly trips on her stiletto, falls out the absurdly dangerous glass panel, and plummets to her death. Her arc—from exalted '80s It Girl to coked-up aging party girl—was supposed to represent finality, the termination of the city's relevance as a cultural nexus. “It's the end of an era,” Carrie says at Lexi's funeral, where Stanford is elated to have scored VIP seats next to Hugh Jackman. “The party's officially over,” Samantha agrees. After six seasons of transforming how a generation of women dated, dressed, even drank, Sex and the City seemed to be acknowledging that its own moment had come to an end. The characters were undeniably older, no longer seeking anthropological meaning in a SoHo nightclub at 3 a.m. But the city that the show documented—and popular culture more broadly—had shifted, too: toward less spontaneity, less rebellion, and infinitely higher incomes.

The year that final season aired, 2004, is possibly when television's prurient obsession with rich people really kicked off, with the launch of shows including Desperate Housewives, Entourage, and, notably, The Apprentice. A year earlier, Fox had premiered a soapy drama called The O.C., which charted the rags–to–Range Rover adventures of a teen from Chino who ended up ensconced in the affluent coastal town of Newport Beach. Until then, it had never occurred to me that teenagers could wear Chanel or drive SUVs that cost six figures, although watching them rattle around in McMansions the size of the Met provided much of The O.C.'s visual thrill. In direct response to the show's success, MTV debuted the reality show Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County a year later, and in 2006, Bravo countered with its own voyeuristic peek into the lives of the rich and fabulous—The Real Housewives of Orange County.

Documenting wealth enticingly on television is a difficult balancing act: You want to stoke enough envy that people are inspired to buy things (gratifying advertisers along the way), but not so much that you risk alienating the viewer. Reality TV pulled it off by starting small. The women on the first season of Real Housewives were well off, but not unimaginably so. They lived in high-end family homes, not sprawling temples of megawealth. Similarly, when Keeping Up With the Kardashians debuted in 2007, the family lived in a generous but chintzy bungalow, having not yet generated the billions of dollars that would later pay for their minimalist compounds in Calabasas and Hidden Hills.

During the 2008 financial crisis, a critic for The New York Times wondered whether the tanking global economy might doom the prospects of shows such as The Real Housewives of Atlanta, which had just premiered, and turn them into “a time capsule of the Bling Decade.” But the fragility of viewers' own finances, oddly, seemed to make them more eager to watch. Shows about money gratified both people's escapist impulses and the desire to critique those who didn't seem worthy of their blessings. As Jennifer O'Connell, a producer for The Real Housewives of New York City, put it to the Times a year later: “Everyone likes to judge.”

The toxic, unhappy, rich-people shows that have more recently proliferated on prestige TV—the Succession and White Lotus and Big Little Lies variation—cover their backs with cynicism. Money doesn't make you happy, they assert over and over, even though studies suggest otherwise. The documentation of extreme wealth on television with such clarifying bitterness, they imply, surely inoculates audiences from pernicious aspiration. Except it doesn't: The Four Seasons San Domenico Palace in Sicily was fully booked for a good six months following the second season of The White Lotus, despite the fictional bodies floating in the water. And a study conducted at the London School of Economics in 2018 found that a person's increased exposure to shows that regularly “glamourize fame, luxury, and the accumulation of wealth” made them more inclined to support welfare cuts; it also noted other studies that found that the more people watched materialistic media, the more anxious and unhappy they were likely to be in their own lives.

Watching shows about wealth does, however, seem to stimulate the desire to shop, which is maybe why this latest season of And Just Like That feels intended for an audience watching with a second screen in their hand—all the better to harvest the aspirational consumption the show's lifestyles might generate. Streaming services are already tapping into the reams of data they have on viewers by serving them customized ads related to the series they might be watching, and many are also experimenting with e-commerce. You could argue that And Just Like That is honoring the spirit of Sex and the City by putting fashion front and center. But the vacant dullness of the new season feels wholly of its time: This is television for the skin-deep influencer age, not the messy, pioneering drama it once was.

More crucially, Carrie and company take up space that deprives us of more shows like The Pitt, one of a sparse handful of series documenting the workers trying to patch up the holes in an ever more unequal America. No one seems to have anticipated that the Max series would be such a success. As workers today are being squeezed “for all their worth, no more chit-chatting at the water cooler, we've gotten to a point where reality for most people is quite unpleasant,” Smith writes on Substack. “And executives are betting that we don't actually want to watch it.” The reality of the TV business also underscores why shows that sell us something—even if it's just the illusion of exceptional prosperity as a default—are easier to commission. But audiences will always be drawn to drama, and the stakes of defiantly deglamorized series such as The Bear and Slow Horses feel necessary in this moment, when the state of the future relies so much on the direction and quality of our attention.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Will The Washington Post Embrace the AI Slush Pile?","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/washington-post-ai-opinion/683064/","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

Reducing the role of human editorial judgment is the last thing opinion journalism needs.

Early in my career, I worked as an assistant at a literary agency. Big publishers generally consider taking on only writers already represented by agents, which makes literary agencies a front line of sorts. As the person opening the mail, I was the front line of the front line. I saw the true democratic range of the slush pile, full of pitches that no one had vouched for and, for the most part, that no one ever would.

One thing I learned: There's a lot of writing out there that you, the reader, just don't need in your life. Some of it is inaccurate. Some of it is self-serving. Above all, a lot of it is just not interesting enough to find many readers: generic, predictable, telling you something you've already heard. Editorial gatekeepers get a bad name, but from another point of view, they are heroically holding back a tidal wave of crap while, ideally, letting the good stuff through.

That early lesson in the value of editorial judgment came back to me this week, when The New York Times reported on an effort taking shape at The Washington Post under its owner, Jeff Bezos, and its publisher, Will Lewis. Through a project internally called Ripple, Post executives intend to dramatically expand opinion writing at the paper, creating an offering outside the paywall that will include content from partner news organizations and Substack. More controversially, a final phase of the plan will employ an AI writing coach called Ember to assist “nonprofessional writers” in submitting op-eds.

This effort was not exactly news to me. Until January, I was a senior editor at the now almost completely hollowed-out Opinions section of the Post. Along with others from across the organization, I'd participated about a year ago in a brainstorming session on what would become Ripple. At that point, it was clear already that Bezos was interested in massively scaling up the output of our section, perhaps on the model of Amazon—which had scaled up and up for years before turning a profit. It had also become clear that the way to management's heart was to cite artificial intelligence as the means to any end, a special technological sauce to be drizzled on everything.

Damon Beres and Charlie Warzel: At least two newspapers syndicated AI garbage

Although I'd started out skeptical, by the end of the session, I was convinced that the Post did have the potential to reach a larger audience. Readers want locally relevant news, but local outlets are succumbing one by one to the dynamics of a centralized online market for both content and advertising. If we were so determined to scale up, why couldn't the Post partner with existing local news sources, offering them a tech back end, a network effect, and a cut of resources while tapping a much larger pool of locally written and edited work?

Some elements of those ideas seem to have trickled into the Ripple project. But another vision was presented at the brainstorm too, the spark of what is now called Ember. The concept seemed to be that anyone could write a good op-ed, if only they had coaching from an AI editor. As a newsroom AI strategist explained the premise to the members of the group—most of whom had never faced an inbox of op-ed submissions—I felt filled with dread, because the content that this program would yield sounded dreadful.

When you consider pitches, as an editor of opinion content, you look for surprise: insightful analysis of new information, diagnosis of and perhaps solutions to an unappreciated problem, a personal tale told in a way that makes you laugh or tear up, an original way of experiencing something familiar. Generative AI based on large language models, by contrast, is optimized to produce writing with the opposite qualities. It is a predictability machine, operating by asking what word is most likely to come next in a sentence based on all the other text that has fed into its training data. This doesn't mean that AI can't be a useful tool for certain kinds of writing and editing, but it does mean that an AI editor will probably exacerbate exactly the qualities that make the opinion slush pile so slushy in the first place. What Ember seems likely to produce, in other words, is the kind of writing I have spent my whole career trying to hold back.

There are good uses for AI at a newspaper, which is why it's so puzzling that everyone keeps trying to make AI do not those tasks but the ones it is bad at, the ones that we humans most want to keep for ourselves. Just to take one example, much of the Washington Post archive is inaccessible via search; why not use AI to crawl, tag, and make discoverable this huge body of work?

Maybe because that's not showy enough. Everyone these days seems to want to make AI the writer, the editor, the creator, the star. But within media, at least, that's not the best use case for this technology. Instead, we should be using these powerful tools for scut work, data crunching, even brainstorming—not as a substitute for the editorial judgment and critical thought that make writing worth reading.

“The values of The Post do not need changing,” Bezos wrote when he bought the newspaper, in 2013. “The paper's duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.” That declaration became harder to trust last year, when Bezos blocked the Post editorial board's endorsement of Kamala Harris, on the pretext that he had suddenly decided that making presidential endorsements gave the impression of bias—only to cheer the “extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory” of Donald Trump just a few weeks later.

Listen: The media is splitting in two

The proposed use of Ember casts doubt on the commitment to readers too. If Bezos is really interested in scaling up opinion writing beyond the scope of human editors, what he's essentially doing is either starting a social blogging network—something like Medium, Reddit, or Substack—or a contributor platform of glorified press releases, such as the one abandoned in 2018 by HuffPost as a drag on its brand. As the New York Times columnist Lydia Polgreen wrote on X, “When I was editor of HuffPost we shut down our contributor platform because it was bad for our journalism and it did not contribute significant traffic or revenue.” If Bezos wants to run a social network, perhaps to compete with Elon Musk for clout, that's fine. But let's not pretend that it's journalism, or that it's good for the Post and its readers.

As recently as 2021, when the paper had already been under Bezos's ownership for years, the Post was touting a plan to add 41 new editors to the newsroom. “This expansion demonstrates anew that The Washington Post is an ascendant news organization, with boundless ambitions and a growing capacity to meet them,” wrote then–Executive Editor Sally Buzbee and her team.

That memo might as well be from another universe. Today, the Post's owner seems to have lost track of those ambitions, or replaced them with other ones. But if the journalistic or commercial health of the paper as an institution still matters to him, I hope he will realize that using AI to scale up the slush pile is a poor idea. If that's really Bezos's dream for the nation's readers, he should pursue it separate from the Post, rather than risk undermining the editorial tradition that has made the paper great.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What we see when we stare at the night sky

Walking through her neighborhood in Ghent, Belgium, in 2020, Bieke Depoorter came across a man named Henk, bent over a telescope, gaze trained on the moon. “I realized that I never really look up,” she told me, describing the chance encounter. She found herself intrigued by this man, who was “comforted by the cosmos.” The Magnum photographer's new book, Blinked Myself Awake, combines memoir and image in a series of eclectic riffs on the history of astronomy, the practice of stargazing—both amateur and professional—and the relationship between photography and objectivity. But more than anything, Depoorter is interested in observing others observing, animated by the conviction that looking up is intimately related to the practice of looking inward and backward.

In a diary entry written when she was 14, Depoorter mused on the moon, fascinated by the idea that people throughout history had all gazed at the same object. That evening, she took her first photograph of the moon. She reminded me that all of the stars we see in the sky are snapshots from the past: images of them not as they are, but as they were before their light traveled across the vacuum of space—memories played out in real time.

Her true subjects are not celestial bodies but people—a young man with his eye, moon-bright and glowing against the gray scale, fixed on his lens; a nightscape of Henk with his telescope, framed in the gateway of a chain-link fence; a laser pointer, aimed toward space, that neatly parallels the gable roof of a home; three stargazers readying their tripods in the shadow of a mountain. At a moment when ever more human activity is oriented toward looking down at our phones, fixated on screens that reflect ourselves back at us, Depoorter's subjects, with their monastic devotion to what lies above and beyond them, remind us that all knowledge begins first with wonder.

The quiet revolutions that have prevented millions of cancer deaths.

by  Bryan Walsh

On November 4, 2003, a doctor gave Jon Gluck some of the worst news imaginable: He had cancer — one that later tests would reveal as multiple myeloma, a severe blood and bone marrow cancer. 

Jon was told he might have as little as 18 months to live. He was 38, a thriving magazine editor in New York with a 7-month-old daughter whose third birthday, he suddenly realized, he might never see.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

“The moment after I was told I had cancer, I just said ‘no, no, no,'” Jon told me in an interview just last week. “This cannot be true.”

The fact that Jon is still here, talking to me in 2025, tells you that things didn't go the way the medical data would have predicted on that November morning. He has lived with his cancer, through waves of remission and recurrence, for more than 20 years, an experience he chronicles with grace and wit in his new book An Exercise in Uncertainty. That 7-month-old daughter is now in college.

You could say Jon has beaten the odds, and he's well aware that chance played some role in his survival. (“Did you know that ‘Glück' is German for ‘luck'?” he writes in the book, noting his good fortune that a random spill on the ice is what sent him to the doctor in the first place, enabling them to catch his cancer early.) Cancer is still a terrible health threat, one that is responsible for 1 in 6 deaths around the world, killing nearly 10 million people a year globally and over 600,000 people a year in the US. 

But Jon's story and his survival demonstrate something that is too often missed: We've turned the tide in the war against cancer. 

The age-adjusted death rate in the US for cancer has declined by about a third since 1991, meaning people of a given age have about a third lower risk of dying from cancer than people of the same age more than three decades ago. That adds up to over 4 million fewer cancer deaths over that time period. Thanks to breakthroughs in treatments like autologous stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy — breakthroughs Jon himself benefited from, often just in time — cancer isn't the death sentence it once was.

There's no doubt that just as the rise of smoking in the 20th century led to a major increase in cancer deaths, the equally sharp decline of tobacco use eventually led to a delayed decrease. Smoking is one of the most potent carcinogens in the world, and at the peak in the early 1960s, around 12 cigarettes were being sold per adult per day in the US. Take away the cigarettes and — after a delay of a couple of decades — lung cancer deaths drop in turn along with other non-cancer smoking-related deaths.

But as Saloni Dattani wrote in a great piece earlier this year, even before the decline of smoking, death rates from non-lung cancers in the stomach and colon had begun to fall. Just as notably, death rates for childhood cancers — which for obvious reasons are not connected to smoking and tend to be caused by genetic mutations — have fallen significantly as well, declining sixfold since 1950. In the 1960s, for example, only around 10 percent of children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia survived more than five years. Today it's more than 90 percent. And the five-year survival rate for all cancers has risen from 49 percent in the mid-1970s to 69 percent in 2019. 

We've made strikes against the toughest of cancers, like Jon's multiple myeloma. Around when Jon was diagnosed, the five-year survival rate was just 34 percent. Today it's as high as 62 percent, and more and more people like Jon are living for decades. “There has been a revolution in cancer survival,” Jon told me. “Some illnesses now have far more successful therapies than others, but the gains are real.”

The dramatic bend in the curve of cancer deaths didn't happen by accident — it's the compound interest of three revolutions.

While anti-smoking policy has been the single biggest lifesaver, other interventions have helped reduce people's cancer risk. One of the biggest successes is the HPV vaccine. A study last year found that death rates of cervical cancer — which can be caused by HPV infections — in US women ages 20–39 had dropped 62 percent from 2012 to 2021, thanks largely to the spread of the vaccine. Other cancers have been linked to infections, and there is strong research indicating that vaccination can have positive effects on reducing cancer incidence. 

The next revolution is better and earlier screening. It's generally true that the earlier cancer is caught, the better the chances of survival, as Jon's own story shows. According to one study, incidences of late-stage colorectal cancer in Americans over 50 declined by a third between 2000 and 2010 in large part because rates of colonoscopies almost tripled in that same time period. And newer screening methods, often employing AI or using blood-based tests, could make preliminary screening simpler, less invasive and therefore more readily available. If 20th-century screening was about finding physical evidence of something wrong — the lump in the breast — 21st-century screening aims to find cancer before symptoms even arise.

Most exciting of all are frontier developments in treating cancer, much of which can be tracked through Jon's own experience. From drugs like lenalidomide and bortezomib in the 2000s, which helped double median myeloma survival, to the spread of monoclonal antibodies, real breakthroughs in treatments have meaningfully extended people's lives — not just by months, but years.

Perhaps the most promising development is CAR-T therapy, a form of immunotherapy. Rather than attempting to kill the cancer directly, immunotherapies turn a patient's own T-cells into guided missiles. In a recent study of 97 patients with multiple myeloma, many of whom were facing hospice care, a third of those who received CAR-T therapy had no detectable cancer five years later. It was the kind of result that doctors rarely see. 

“CAR-T is mind-blowing — very science-fiction futuristic,” Jon told me. He underwent his own course of treatment with it in mid-2023 and writes that the experience, which put his cancer into a remission he's still in, left him feeling “physically and metaphysically new.”

While there are still more battles to be won in the war on cancer, and there are certain areas — like the rising rates of gastrointestinal cancers among younger people — where the story isn't getting better, the future of cancer treatment is improving. For cancer patients like Jon, that can mean a new challenge — enduring the essential uncertainty that comes with living under a disease that's controllable but which could always come back. 

But it sure beats the alternative.

“I've come to trust so completely in my doctors and in these new developments,” he said. “I try to remain cautiously optimistic that my future will be much like the last 20 years.” And that's more than he or anyone else could have hoped for nearly 22 years ago.

Their messy split highlights some real fault lines in clean energy politics.

by  Umair Irfan

Elon Musk and President Donald Trump — two of the most powerful, outspoken billionaires in America — are still tangled up in a messy breakup over a variety of issues. It's no shock that these two men with huge egos would have friction, but it's interesting to look at some of the specific things that seem to be causing trouble between them.

In particular, Trump's and Musk's differing views on climate change and clean energy have evidently become an irritant again. Recall that Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, participated in White House councils during Trump's first term, but left after Trump began the process of pulling the US out of the Paris climate agreement. 

But Musk began to drift to the political right. He publicly backed Trump's campaign for a second term — onstage and with money — and was rewarded with a high-profile quasi-governmental post as the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency that laid off thousands of federal workers. It seemed like they were accomplishing their mutual goals. Trump even turned the White House into a sales lot for Tesla and got one himself. 

But after Musk left DOGE recently, he came out against the budget bill passed by House Republicans and backed by Trump, driving another wedge between them. The bill rolls back tax credits for electric vehicles and hits owners with a $250 fee to pay for the Highway Trust Fund, which pays for road maintenance through gasoline taxes. Though Musk owns an electric vehicle company, he says he doesn't care about rolling back EV tax credits and is more concerned about how the budget bill increases the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. 

However, Tesla made about one-third of its profits over the past decade from selling compliance credits to other carmakers in states that adopted California's vehicle emissions rules as well as in several other countries. The Trump administration is also targeting the programs that created this line of business through executive orders. 

The back-and-forth over the years between Trump and Musk was mirrored in the perceptions of Tesla's products. The sleek electric cars were once rolling billboards projecting that their owners were concerned about climate change and are now attacked as endorsements of fascism. 

More broadly, it shows that there are stubborn political divides on how people view clean technology — electric vehicles, renewable energy, battery storage, and so on. 

A poll this week from the Pew Research Center showed that Republicans have less and less favorable views of clean tech. The exception is nuclear energy, which has seen increasing support among both Democrats and Republicans. 

But on the flip side, Republicans tend to strongly support fossil fuel extraction from offshore oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and coal mining — far more than Democrats do. 

Meanwhile, electric vehicles are taking to the road in greater numbers, though a partisan divide emerges here as well. Far more Democrats than Republicans say they are interested in buying an EV as their next car, though Democrats did look less favorably on Tesla EVs. Tesla sales are down in the US while overall EV sales are up. Hybrid cars are more popular across the country than pure EVs, according to the poll. 

California and 11 other states now plan to end the sales of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. Two-thirds of Americans say they are against this idea, but here, too, there's a political divide, with 85 percent of Republicans and 45 percent of Democrats in opposition. 

Looking back over the past five years, it's apparent that even when Trump and Musk were in alignment, they couldn't change the political valence of electric cars. 

Now, at least one more Republican has soured on EVs: Trump is reportedly looking for a buyer for his red Tesla Model S after his dustup with Musk. 

It will take more than a thumbs-up from the White House or the enthusiastic backing of a billionaire to change Republicans' minds about technologies that help limit climate change. There are some outliers, though, like the Iowa Trump supporters who also back wind power. 

But the momentum behind these tools is massive and mounting. Wind, solar, EVs, and grid batteries have all seen tremendous price drops, huge performance gains, and surging deployment in recent years. The Trump administration's policies could sap some of this momentum, but they can't stop it.

Twenty-five minutes of live TV, more than a dozen posts on X, and three posts on Truth Social over the period of five hours (and counting) — that's how the already fractured friendship of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump publicly unraveled on Thursday.

The first signs of trouble began when Musk showed opposition to Trump's spending bill, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" though he never explicitly targeted Trump.

""Shame on those who voted for it,"" Musk tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Congress members who voted for Trump's tax cut bill.

Trump, for his part, had stayed uncharacteristically mum about Musk's criticism of the bill.

But that all changed on Thursday morning.

Here is a minute-by-minute breakdown of how the relationship between two of the most powerful men on the planet devolved.

Musk began digging up Trump's old posts on what was then Twitter about the deficit, including one from January of 2013.

Wise words https://t.co/6juH1jEjtc

Musk unearthed another old X post by Trump from back in July 2012, presumably as a swipe at the new Republican tax bill that many economists and the congressional Budget Office said would increase the country's deficits.

I couldn't agree more! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/sZ6xgisZEA

Trump responded to Musk's attacks for the first time when answering press questions during a White House event to welcome German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

""And you know Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,"" said Trump. ""And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Elon knew this from the beginning; he knew it from a long time ago.""

Trump's comments about Musk continued at the press appearance.

""He knew every aspect of this bill — better than almost anybody —and he never had a problem until right after he left,"" said Trump. ""He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn't said bad things about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot.""

""People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile,"" Trump continued.

""I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it, but we have it with others, too. They leave and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour's gone. The whole world is different, and they become hostile,"" he added.

Musk began a whirlwind of tweets soon after, responding in near real time to what Trump said during the press appearance.

""False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!"" Musk posed on X.

False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! https://t.co/V4ztekqd4g

Musk then began a series of tweets directed at the president beyond the bill, including saying that without him, Republicans would have lost.

Such ingratitude

Musk polls his X followers about creating a new political party ""that actually represents the 80% in the middle."" Mark Cuban quoted the post with three checkmarks.

Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?

Musk gives Trump's bill — known on paper as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" — a new name: ""Big Ugly Spending Bill.""

Not even those in Congress who had to vote on the Big Ugly Spending Bill had time to read it! https://t.co/mBOQyhQYwX

Trump responds to Musk with two consecutive posts on his own social media platform, Truth Social.

""Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!"" Trump wrote.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"" the president continued.

Musk responds to Trump's posts on Truth Social, calling them ""such an obvious lie.""

Such an obvious lie. So sad. https://t.co/sOu9vqMVfX

A minute later, Musk appeared to dare Trump to cancel government contracts with his companies.

This just gets better and better 🤣🤣Go ahead, make my day … https://t.co/APmy7cV8iL

Musk makes another accusation.

Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT!

Trump posts on Truth Social again to defend his tax bill.

""I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress,"" Trump wrote.

""It's a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn't pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn't create this mess, I'm just here to FIX IT,"" Trump added.

Musk says SpaceX will decommission its Dragon spacecraft ""immediately.""

SpaceX's Dragon spaceships transport NASA astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. Prior to partnering with SpaceX, the agency depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions.

Musk says that Trump's tariffs will ""cause a recession in the second half of this year.""

Some economists have also predicted that Trump's tariffs would hurt the economy, and Trump himself declined to rule out the chances of a recession back in March.

JPMorgan had predicted a 60% chance of a US recession after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on April 2. The bank adjusted the possibility down to below 50% recently after Trump paused most of his highest tariffs.

Musk retweeted what appears to be a video of Trump partying with Epstein from the 1990s, doubling down on his earlier statement about the Epstein files.

""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Business Insider in a statement. ""The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.""

Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Musk took a softer tone later on Thursday night.

Some five hours after his post about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, he walked back the decision in a response to an X user.

""This is a shame this back and forth. You are both better than this. Cool off and take a step back for a couple days,"" X user Fab25june wrote on the platform.

""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon,"" Musk wrote at 9:20 p.m.

In a separate exchange on X, billionaire investor Bill Ackman encouraged Musk and Trump to make up.

""I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart,"" Ackman wrote.

""You're not wrong,"" Musk responded at 9:27 p.m.

Trump spoke about the feud on Friday morning during a phone call with CNN's Dana Bash.

""I'm not even thinking about Elon,"" Trump said. ""He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem.""

Trump doesn't intend to speak to Musk ""for a while"" and wishes Musk well, according to Bash.

Bash said people in Musk and Trump's orbit are trying to mend the rift.

The President appears to respond to Musk's allegation that he's in the so-called ""Epstein files.""

On Truth Social, Trump posted a screenshot of an X post from David Schoen, Epstein's defense attorney. Schoen said in the post that Epstein ""had no information to hurt President Trump.""

""I specifically asked him!"" Schoen wrote.

Trump reiterated that he wasn't thinking about Musk while traveling with reporters aboard Air Force One.

He wished Musk the best of luck on his Tesla business.

""I mean, I hope he does well with Tesla,"" he said.

Musk found a name for his new political party proposal: ""The America Party.""

The America Party https://t.co/hO5S8Kjb5O

In a separate post on X, Musk said the ""people have spoken"" as the polling results showed that 80% of the 5.6 million participants voted ""Yes"" to creating a party that represents ""the middle.""

Musk said on X that he would apologize to Trump ""profusely as soon as there is a full dump of the Epstein files.""

The CEO was responding to a post from James Fishback, an investor who proposed the idea of DOGE dividend checks, who posted on X that Musk should send Trump a ""full-throated apology.""

""You can substantively disagree with the President on policy, but you should not have baselessly and personally attacked him,"" Fishback wrote.

Trump and Musk appeared to extend each other an olive branch — at least for a brief moment.

Likewise

The White House rapid response account on X posted a clip of Trump's gaggle with the press on Air Force One, highlighting the president saying he wishes Musk well.

""Likewise,"" Musk said in response at 10:46 p.m.

Musk deleted some of the X posts he made on Thursday, including one in which he said Trump was named in the Epstein files. He also deleted a tweet announcing his intention to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft.

However, other the X posts Musk made, including criticism of the tax bill, remain on his account.

President Donald Trump's suggestion that he may let Russia and Ukraine keep fighting has left US lawmakers in an awkward spot over their plan to force a ceasefire with “bone-crushing” sanctions against Moscow.

The Senate bill has more than 80 co-sponsors, an all-but-unheard-of level of bipartisan support. Yet although that kind of veto-proof backing is enough for the Senate to press ahead without White House backing, supporters show no sign they're ready to challenge the president.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

From Long Beach and the Port of Los Angeles all the way up to Seattle, shipping is slowing — and casting a pall over the cities that rely on it.

Gotta keep things moving.

On a normal day in June, about a dozen ships, most newly arrived from Asia, would be docked at the Port of Los Angeles. Workers would be busy unloading cargo, directing the containers to trucks, trains and planes bound for businesses and warehouses across the US. But no day has been normal since the start of President Donald Trump's roller coaster of a trade war.

“You're seeing what's been noticeable to us over the last several weeks,” said Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, on Wednesday, nodding toward the sprawling San Pedro Bay and the equally struggling Port of Long Beach in the distance. “During the past seven days, we've averaged about five ships. Job orders for our dock workers … are down nearly 50%.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

But the epidemic is still raging and, per one farmer, risks becoming endemic in the US. Glenn Hickman is president of Hickman's Egg Ranch in Arizona, one of the largest egg producers in the US. You might remember him from our series last year, Beak Capitalism, in which we explored some of the thorniest issues facing the US economy through the medium of chickens.

Little Caesars co-founder Marian Ilitch is the third-richest self-made woman in the U.S., according to a new Forbes list.

Ilitch has an estimated net worth of $6.9 billion, Forbes reported on Tuesday. Most of that wealth likely comes from the Little Caesars pizza restaurant chain, which she co-founded with her late husband Michael Ilitch in Garden City, Michigan, in 1959. Little Caesars brings in an estimated $5 billion in annual systemwide sales, Forbes estimated.

Ilitch, 90, took the reins as chairwoman of her family's holding company Ilitch Holdings, which owns Little Caesars, after her husband died in 2017.

Growing up, Ilitch refilled napkin dispensers and salt and pepper shakers in her father's restaurant, according to Ilitch Holdings' website. As an adult, she worked in retail and as a reservation clerk for Delta Air Lines before getting married and becoming a full-time mother. The couple invested their family savings to open the first Little Caesars location, the website says.

Little Caesars opened its first franchised location in Warren, Michigan, in 1962, and grew rapidly from there: It opened its 50th location seven years later, the company's website says. It has thousands of locations worldwide, with roughly 80% of them franchise-owned, according to the company.

Other parts of the Ilitch family's wealth come from their investments in the city of Detroit. Ilitch and her husband bought the Detroit Red Wings for a reported $8 million in 1982. Her husband also bought the Detroit Tigers from Dominos Pizza founder Tom Monaghan for a reported $85 million in 1992.

The couple purchased the Fox Theater, located in the heart of the city, in 1987 — and spent $12.5 million restoring it, according to the Detroit News. And Ilitch owns Detroit's MotorCity Casino Hotel, first investing in it and then buying out her partners for $525 million in 2005, according to ESPN.

Some of the Ilitches' efforts to invest in the city sparked controversy. The family promised a $200 million development around Little Caesars Arena, which opened in September 2017 — but some locals were skeptical the investment actually helped residents, The Guardian reported in October 2018.

Ilitch has generally avoided the spotlight throughout her adult life, as did her husband. Notably, Michael quietly helped pay rent for civil rights icon Rosa Parks during the 1990s, after Parks moved into an apartment in downtown Detroit, the Sports Business Journal reported in 2014.

""It's important that people know what Mr. Mike Ilitch did for Ms. Rosa Parks because it's symbolic of what he has always done for the people of our city,"" Damon Keith, a former circuit judge on the 6th U.S. Court of Appeals who connected Parks with Michael, told the publication.

""You don't find people like Mike and Marian often, who want to help when they're needed,"" Keith said to the Washington Post in February 2017.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Slate Auto: Inside the EV startup, stealth production facility backed by Jeff Bezos","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/07/jeff-bezos-slate-auto-ev.html","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 12:00:01 GMT","



LAKE ORION TOWNSHIP, Mich. — In a nondescript supplier park in suburban Detroit, an electric vehicle startup backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is building what it hopes will be America's newest automaker.

The facility is filled with dozens of prototypes, crash-tested vehicles, a crude lab vehicle skeleton adorned with wires and, most importantly, a busy ""beta"" assembly line that has been building electric vehicles since December for the startup, Slate Auto.

Slate is using the location — a stone's throw away from a massive General Motors assembly plant — to produce more than 70 vehicles for internal testing, certification and everything else a company needs to prepare to produce and sell vehicles in the United States.

The beta production line features roughly a dozen labeled stations for things such as the vehicle's doors, tailgate and front ends that sit in bins or on surface areas made out of wood and steel parts.

Employees move back and forth between the bins, tables and assembly line as songs such as Whitney Houston's ""Saving All My Love for You"" and Pat Benatar's ""Love is a Battlefield"" echo throughout the lively facility.

The largely hand-built vehicles being made are bare-bones, two-seat, two-door electric pickup trucks that can also be converted to different body styles of SUVs, such as a five-seat fastback or into a squared-off look like a Jeep Wrangler.

The vehicles have injected-molded composite exteriors, crank windows, no infotainment systems and a litany of do-it yourself options. The plan is for every vehicle coming off the line to be the same to reduce complexity, before adding any additional features or different covers/tops.

Auto executives have tossed around the idea for such a modular, stripped-down vehicle amid the rise of connectivity and affordability concerns, but so far the challenges have outweighed the potential opportunities, or companies have struggled to keep prices down.

Slate believes it can succeed where others have failed through simplified manufacturing and lower costs – two areas where other EV startups have failed in recent years.

""This one's going to be different for a number of reasons,"" Eric Keipper, an auto veteran and Slate's head of engineering, told CNBC after a tour of the company's manufacturing facility. ""We took the back-to-basics, only-the-essentials approach, and, really, we're building a completely new category of product.""

Slate exited its ""stealth mode"" in late April by revealing its first vehicles — several two-door electric pickup trucks and converted SUVs — that it expects to begin deliveries of by the end of next year. It's in the process of building out a full production facility at a former printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana, where it expects to have capacity for up to 150,000 vehicles a year.

It's a daunting timeframe even for an established automaker, let alone a new startup that's establishing its supply chains, production processes and workforce, among other things. Hand-building vehicles at a small facility is one thing; mass producing them is another.

""We've put together a really solid plan, and we're working to achieve the plan,"" Slate CEO Chris Barman told CNBC. ""It doesn't mean that we follow the plan exactly. We gotta pivot when different information comes, but we understand what we've got to do to ultimately get to the goal of having vehicles that meet all of our requirements.""

Slate revealed its unnamed vehicle (the company is telling customers to name it themselves) to notable fanfare, attracting more than 100,000 reservations that required a $50 deposit. For other companies, however, vehicles reservations have fallen significantly short of actual sales.

The company said it is conducting a Series C round of financing after raising $700 million in its first two rounds of financing. TechCrunch first reported the Series A round in 2023 raised $111 million from 16 investors, including Bezos.

Other EV startups have needed significantly more funding and have quickly blown through billions of dollars annually attempting to get a vehicle into production. But Slate believes it can be far less capital intense thanks to the engineering and production of the vehicle.

""We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never been delivered,"" Barman said during the April 24 debut. ""But with a twist, it's a vehicle people are actually going to love and be proud to own.""

The company declined to discuss future targets such as sales and profitability, as well as expected capital requirements, other than that it plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in its Indiana plant.

Barman and Keipper — veterans of Stellantis predecessor Fiat Chrysler, among other companies — met nearly three years ago to discuss the vehicle and Slate's business plan as the first employees of the startup.

""It started with a blank slate,"" said Keipper. ""The CEO and I sat together on the fifth of July in 2022 and looked at a blank whiteboard, and I filled it. I said, 'Here's the plan. Let's do this.'""

During the reveal, the company positioned itself and its vehicle as a ""a radically simple, radically affordable, radically personalizable car.""

The vehicle — which has a targeted starting price of under $20,000 with an up to $7,500 EV credit — features many ""off the shelf"" parts from suppliers, lowering costs. Its body also is exclusively injected molded composite instead of steel or aluminum, bringing down cost and weight.

It does not feature any ""connectivity"" such as a modem or large screens, just a small driver information screen. Instead of a center infotainment system, drivers can use their own devices such as a smartphone or tablet for navigation and music. Speakers also are optional.

The exteriors of the Slate vehicles also won't be painted. The company says it was engineered to be wrapped with a vinyl film, eliminating the need for a costly paint shop — a massive investment for automakers.

The basis for the company is for consumers to be able to easily change the vehicle themselves or add whatever they'd like to it after purchase through the removal or addition of bolts. The company plans to offer some services such as the vehicle wrapping, but customers aren't required to do those things through Slate and can purchase add-ons later.

Slate says the truck — about the length of a two-door Ford Bronco — features roughly a fifth less parts compared to a typical vehicle, including only 500 to 700 ""end items,"" or parts, for final assembly. That compares with a Slate estimate of 2,500-end item parts for other competitors and thousands of more overall pieces.

""Fundamentally, there's no new technology because technology costs money to develop,"" said Jamie Standring, formerly with Karma Automotive and Stellantis/Fiat Chrysler, standing by the beta assembly line.

Standring said the initial idea was to have the vehicle's frame that everything is built upon be bolted together – almost like an erector set – to remove the need for a full body shop, much like it's attempting to not use a paint shop. But the drawbacks eventually outweighed the benefits, he said.

The Slate truck is expected to ship with a standard 52.7-kWh battery with an estimated range of around 150 miles, or a 84.3-kWh pack with a target of 240 miles of range. Its battery supplier is SK On, according to the company. Its top speed is only 90 miles per hour.

""I'm really proud of the team for how they really thought out of the box,"" Barman said. ""We'll have kits, and we're doing it in a way that's lean as well, but we want to offer people many choices.""

But more choices for consumers mean more complexity.

On the company's website, there are 11 categories for customers to customize with a combined 160 options, excluding customizable exterior colors for wraps. That's a lot of options – ranging from dozens of decals to lighting, audio and tires and wheels – for a customer to pick and a company to store and offer.

Slate executives say the point of the customization is for customers to be able to make the vehicle their own and easily upgrade or change it when they'd like, but auto analysts see it as one of many potential problem areas.

In addition to traditional startup challenges such as capital, profitability and scaling up, other hurdles include: A limited market for two-door vehicles, slower-than-expected adoption of EVs and regulatory uncertainty regarding federal tax credits that Slate is relying on for the vehicle's affordability, among other things.

""They have an interesting idea,"" said Stephanie Brinley, associate director in AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility. ""The question is, how many people really want to do that much themselves, and how big is the adjustable market?""

The sale of two-door regular cab pickup trucks like Slate's debut vehicle only accounted for less than 90,400 registrations in 2024. That compares to more than 2.5 million registered four-door crew cab trucks.

Brinley, who attended Slate's reveal event in California, said if the company wants to be sustainable, it would need to expand its product lineup to four-door models, which the platform seems to be able to support, as well as additional vehicles in the future.

""Just like every other startup before it, their sustainability is not going to be determined by the first product in the first six months,"" Brinley said. ""The first product just gets you in the door.""

A handful of auto startups such as Lordstown Motors, Electric Last Mile Solutions, Fisker, Canoo and Nikola all made it into various forms of production but went bankrupt. Even better capitalized EV startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group have continually had to raise capital to stay afloat.

Industry insiders also have raised concerns about the affordability of Slate's vehicle once customers add options or a new SUV top, which can be installed and uninstalled using bolts.

""I think it's super interesting. The idea behind it, we've talked about that idea a million times,"" Tim Kuniskis, CEO of Stellantis' Ram Truck brand, said recently when asked about Slate. ""Now, what's it going to actually transact at in the marketplace … when people start to option them up, it's not going to be $20,000. It's going to be $35,000, and by the time you get to $35,000, you're in midsize truck territory. ""

Slate has not announced pricing for customizations or exact pricing of the vehicle without a federal tax credit that's in jeopardy under President Donald Trump.

""Slate is an example of why and how hard it is to produce a cheap EV"" said Karl Brauer, a veteran auto analyst with iSeeCars.com. ""They are producing an electric vehicle with only two seats, 140-mile range, manual windows, no touch screen, and it's still $27,500 … To me, it's not a competitive vehicle at that point.""

Brauer said there are other EVs close to that price, as well as smaller pickups such as the Ford Maverick hybrid with a lot more features that could be a better buy for consumers.

Both Brauer and Brinley gave Slate credit for trying something new and attempting to address affordability concerns, but the auto industry isn't an easy busy to break into, even when starting from a blank slate.

""It's modular. It's cool. It's a really clever idea,"" Brinley said. ""The question for me comes down to how many people want to do that? And we'll find out, but I don't know that it's as high as they think it is.""

Gen Z seems to have a case of economic malaise.

Nearly half (49%) of its adult members — the oldest of whom are in their late 20s — say planning for the future feels ""pointless,"" according to a recent Credit Karma poll.

A freewheeling attitude toward summer spending has taken root among young adults who feel financial ""despair"" and ""hopelessness,"" said Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma.

They think, ""What's the point when it comes to saving for the future?"" Alev said.

That ""YOLO mindset"" among Generation Z — the cohort born from roughly 1997 through 2012 — can be dangerous: If unchecked, it might lead young adults to rack up high-interest debt they can't easily repay, perhaps leading to delayed milestones like moving out of their parents' home or saving for retirement, Alev said.

But your late teens and early 20s is arguably the best time for young people to develop healthy financial habits: Starting to invest now, even a little bit, will yield ample benefits via decades of compound interest, experts said.

""There are a lot of financial implications in the long term if these young people aren't planning for their financial future and [are] spending willy-nilly however they want,"" Alev said.

That said, that many feel disillusioned is understandable in the current environment, experts said.

The labor market has been tough lately for new entrants and those looking to switch jobs, experts said.

The U.S. unemployment rate is relatively low, at 4.2%. However, it's much higher for Americans 22 to 27 years old: 5.8% for recent college grads and 6.9% for those without a bachelor's degree, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data as of March 2025.

Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business.

Young adults are also saddled with debt concerns, experts said.

""They feel they don't have any money and many of them are in debt,"" said Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Sun Group Wealth Partners, based in Irvine, California. ""And they're wondering if the degree they have (or are working toward) will be of value if A.I. takes all their jobs anyway. So is it just pointless?""

About 50% of bachelor's degree recipients in the 2022-23 class graduated with student debt, with an average debt of $29,300, according to College Board.

The federal government restarted collections on student debt in default in May, after a five-year pause.

The Biden administration's efforts to forgive large swaths of student debt, including plans to help reduce monthly payments for struggling borrowers, were largely stymied in court.

""Some hoped some or more of it would be forgiven, and that didn't turn out to be the case,"" said Sun, a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.

Meanwhile, in a 2024 report, the New York Fed found credit card delinquency rates were rising faster for Gen Z than for other generations. About 15% had maxed out their cards, more than other cohorts, it said.

It's also ""never been easier to buy things,"" with the rise of buy now, pay later lending, for example, Alev said.

BNPL has pushed the majority of Gen Z users — 77% — to say the service has encouraged them to spend more than they can afford, according to the Credit Karma survey. The firm polled 1,015 adults ages 18 and older, 182 of whom are from Gen Z.

These financial challenges compound an environment of general political and financial uncertainty, amid on-again-off-again tariff policy and its potential impact on inflation and the U.S. economy, for example, experts said.

""You start stacking all these things on top of each other and it can create a lack of optimism for young people looking to get started in their financial lives,"" Alev said.

Young adults should try to rewire their financial mindset, experts said.

""Most importantly, you don't want to bet against yourself,"" Sun said.

""See it as an opportunity,"" she added. ""If you're young and your expenses are low, this is the time to invest as much as you can right now.""

Time is working in their favor, due to the ability to compound investment growth over multiple decades, Alev said.

While investing might ""feel impossible,"" every little bit helps, even if it's just investing $10 a month right now into a tax-advantaged retirement account like a Roth IRA or 401(k).

The latter is among the easiest ways to start, due to automatic payroll deduction and the possibility of earning a ""match"" from your employer, which is ""probably the closest thing to free money any of us will get in our lifetime,"" Alev said.

""This is actually the most exciting time to invest, because you're young,"" Sun said.

Instituting mindful spending habits, such as putting a waiting period of at least 24 hours in place before buying a non-essential item, can help prevent unnecessary spending, she added.

Sun advocates for paying down high-interest debt before focusing on investing, so interest payments don't quickly spiral out of control. Or, as an alternative, they can try to fund a 401(k) to get their full company match while also working to pay off high-interest debt, she said.

""Instead of getting into the 'woe is me' mode, change that into taking action,"" Sun said. ""Make a plan, take baby steps and get excited about opportunities to invest.""

Americans earning a regular salary may have trouble living comfortably in all 50 states.

The median annual wage for individuals was just below $62,000 at the end of 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But it takes a salary of at least $80,829 for a single adult to live comfortably in West Virginia, the most affordable state, according to a recent SmartAsset study.

SmartAsset defines ""comfortable"" as earning enough to follow the 50/30/20 budget method, which recommends putting 50% of your income toward essentials like rent and food, 30% toward discretionary spending and 20% toward debt repayment and savings. It used the latest estimates from Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Living Wage calculator to estimate individuals' cost of necessities in each state.

On the other side of the spectrum from West Virginia, residents in Hawaii need to earn a minimum of $124,467 a year to live comfortably, SmartAsset finds. That's the highest of any state and one of two states — along with Massachusetts — where individuals need to earn at least $120,000 a year to afford a comfortable lifestyle.

Here's how much money it takes for a single adult to live comfortably in every U.S. state 2025.

While the 50/30/20 budget can be an effective tool to manage your money, it can also be difficult to follow if you have high fixed costs. And though data suggests wage growth nationwide is actually outpacing price inflation, many Americans don't feel that way.

About 7 in 10 Americans feel stressed about their finances, according to a CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll conducted in April. Plus, President Donald Trump's tariffs threaten to push prices up even further.

Boosting your income by switching jobs or getting a side hustle may be easier said than done, but it can help give you some breathing room in your budget, especially if you've already cut out as much discretionary spending as you can.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has spent the past 28 years helping turn the e-commerce giant into one of the biggest companies on earth.

But the 57-year-old executive didn't start his career with aspirations of being a high-powered CEO. In a May 15 podcast appearance on ""How Leaders Lead with David Novak,"" Jassy said he too often sees young people who think they should be entering the professional world knowing what they want to do with the rest of their lives.

""I have a 21-year-old son and a 24-year-old daughter, and one of the things I see with them and their peers is they all feel like they have to know what they want to do with their life at that age,"" he said. ""And I really don't believe that's true.""

Before Jassy landed at Amazon in 1997 at age 29, he tried his hand at sportscasting, sports production, product management and entrepreneurship, he said. On top of that, he spent time working at a retail golf store, coaching his high school soccer team and investment banking.

Even though many of those jobs didn't work out as he might've hoped, the experiences helped him understand the type of career that he wanted — and didn't want — to have, he said.

""I think early on it's just as important to learn what you don't want to do as what you want to do because it actually helps you figure out what you want to do,"" said Jassy. ""I do feel like one of the lucky parts for me was that I tried lots of things and was able to sort for myself what appealed to me and what didn't.""

Jassy credited his eventual success to his willingness to find out what he was good at and what he liked, rather than doggedly following a strong vision of what he wanted to do: ""I think your attitude is an embarrassing amount of your success or lack thereof.""

Being reliable, trustworthy, hard-working and a good learner are more important than being good at every single thing you try, Jassy added. ""I feel like those are things that you can control. It's actually amazing to me how often people don't. I worked hard at those things over time,"" he said.

The Amazon CEO isn't alone in preaching dependability: Being a reliable and hard worker is the No. 1 way to build a strong reputation in the workplace, author and former Google executive Maha Abouelenein told CNBC Make It on Oct. 9.

Having a consistent level of effort and doing your best to anticipate the needs of those around you will get you recognized, no matter where your career takes you, said Abouelenein.

""Reputation is like a currency,"" she said. ""It's the only thing you own, and I want you to invest in it ... Without your [personal brand], you can't do anything.""

Elon Musk has appeared to delete some of his posts on his social media platform X that escalated his bitter feud with President Donald Trump this week.

One post, no longer available as of Saturday morning, accused Trump of being mentioned in ""files"" of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Musk's accusation, which the White House has disputed, marked an escalation in the public spat between the men.

""Hmm...this page doesn't exist. Try searching for something else,"" said the X page that once displayed Musk's post.

On Thursday, Musk also responded ""yes"" to a user's post that called for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vice President JD Vance.

That post was also no longer available as of Saturday morning. 

In an interview on Friday with ""manosphere"" comedian Theo Von, Vance said Musk was making a ""huge mistake"" going after Trump, while attempting to downplay the billionaire's attacks as an ""emotional guy"" who got frustrated.

It was not immediately clear why Musk deleted the posts. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Nonetheless, it's the latest twist in the rapidly deteriorating relationship between the onetime allies.

Just over one week ago, Trump and Musk exchanged compliments at the conclusion of Musk's official time leading the Department of Government Efficiency.

But their relationship devolved this week as the two men exchanged barbs on social media, stemming in large part from Musk's vocal opposition to Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" CNBC previously reported.

In one of the now-deleted posts, Musk accused Trump of being mentioned in files related to Epstein, without providing any evidence of his claim.

Musk alleged, ""that is the real reason they have not been made public.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected Musk's allegations.

""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" she said in a statement to CNN.

A wave of high-profile kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives has rattled the industry — and prompted a quiet security revolution among some of its most visible evangelists.

Didi Taihuttu, patriarch of the so-called ""Bitcoin Family,"" said he overhauled the family's entire security setup after a string of threats.

The Taihuttus — who sold everything they owned in 2017, from their house to their shoes, to go all-in on bitcoin when it was trading around $900 — have long lived on the outer edge of crypto ideology. They travel full-time with their three daughters and remain entirely unbanked.

Over the past eight months, he said, the family ditched hardware wallets in favor of a hybrid system: Part analog, part digital, with seed phrases encrypted, split, and stored either through blockchain-based encryption services or hidden across four continents.

""We have changed everything,"" Taihuttu told CNBC on a call from Phuket, Thailand. ""Even if someone held me at gunpoint, I can't give them more than what's on my wallet on my phone. And that's not a lot.""

CNBC first reported on the family's unconventional storage system in 2022, when Taihuttu described hiding hardware wallets across multiple continents — in places ranging from rental apartments in Europe to self-storage units in South America.

As physical attacks on crypto holders become more frequent, even they are rethinking their exposure.

This week, Moroccan police arrested a 24-year-old suspected of orchestrating a series of brutal kidnappings targeting crypto executives.

One victim, the father of a crypto millionaire, was allegedly held for days in a house south of Paris — and reportedly had a finger severed during the ordeal.

In a separate case earlier this year, a co-founder of French wallet firm Ledger and his wife were abducted from their home in central France in a ransom scheme that also targeted another Ledger executive.

Last month in New York, authorities said, a 28-year-old Italian tourist was kidnapped and tortured for 17 days in a Manhattan apartment by attackers trying to extract his bitcoin password — shocking him with wires, beating him with a gun, and strapping an Apple AirTag around his neck to track his movements.

The common thread: The pursuit of crypto credentials that enable instant, irreversible transfers of virtual assets.

""It is definitely frightening to see a lot of these kidnappings happen,"" said JP Richardson, CEO of crypto wallet company Exodus. He urged users to take security into their own hands by choosing self-custody, storing larger sums on hardware wallets, and — for those holding significant assets — exploring multi-signature wallets, a setup typically used by institutions.

Richardson also recommended spreading funds across different wallet types and avoiding large balances in hot wallets to reduce risk without sacrificing flexibility.

That rising sense of vulnerability is fueling a new demand for physical protection with insurance firms now racing to offer kidnap and ransom (K&R) policies tailored to crypto holders.

But Taihuttu isn't waiting for corporate solutions. He's opted for complete decentralization — of not just his finances, but his personal risk profile.

As the family prepares to return to Europe from Thailand, safety has become a constant topic of conversation.

""We've been talking about it a lot as a family,"" Taihuttu said. ""My kids read the news, too — especially that story in France, where the daughter of a CEO was almost kidnapped on the street.""

Now, he said, his daughters are asking difficult questions: What if someone tries to kidnap us? What's the plan?

Though the girls carry only small amounts of crypto in their personal wallets, the family has decided to avoid France entirely.

""We got a little bit famous in a niche market — but that niche is becoming a really big market now,"" Taihuttu said. ""And I think we'll see more and more of these robberies. So yeah, we're definitely going to skip France.""

Even in Thailand, Taihuttu recently stopped posting travel updates and filming at home after receiving disturbing messages from strangers who claimed to have identified his location from YouTube vlogs.

""We stayed in a very beautiful house for six months — then I started getting emails from people who figured out which house it was. They warned me to be careful, told me not to leave my kids alone,"" he said. ""So we moved. And now we don't film anything at all.""

""It's a strange world at the moment,"" he said. ""So we're taking our own precautions — and when it comes to wallets, we're now completely hardware wallet-less. We don't use any hardware wallets anymore.""

The family's new system involves splitting a single 24-word bitcoin seed phrase — the cryptographic key that unlocks access to their crypto holdings — into four sets of six words, each stored in a different geographic location. Some are kept digitally through blockchain-based encryption platforms, while others are etched by hand into fireproof steel plates using a hammer and letter punch, then hidden in physical locations across four continents.

""Even if someone finds 18 of the 24 words, they can't do anything,"" Taihuttu explained.

On top of that, he's added a layer of personal encryption, swapping out select words to throw off would-be attackers. The method is simple, but effective.

""You only need to remember which ones you changed,"" he said.

Part of the reason for ditching hardware wallets, Taihuttu said, was a growing mistrust of third-party devices. Concerns about backdoors and remote access features — including a controversial update by Ledger in 2023 — prompted the family to abandon physical hardware altogether in favor of encrypted paper and steel backups.

While the family still holds some crypto in ""hot"" wallets — for daily spending or to run their algorithmic trading strategy — those funds are protected by multi-signature approvals, which require multiple parties to sign off before a transaction can be executed.

The Taihuttus use Safe — formerly Gnosis Safe — for ether and other altcoins, and similarly layered setups for bitcoin stored on centralized platforms like Bybit.

About 65% of the family's crypto is locked in cold storage across four continents — a decentralized system Taihuttu prefers to centralized vaults like the Swiss Alps bunker used by Coinbase-owned Xapo. Those facilities may offer physical protection and inheritance services, but Taihuttu said they require too much trust.

""What happens if one of those companies goes bankrupt? Will I still have access?"" he said. ""You're putting your capital back in someone else's hands.""

Instead, Taihuttu holds his own keys — hidden across the globe. He can top up the wallets remotely with new deposits, but accessing them would require at least one international trip, depending on which fragments of the seed phrase are needed. The funds, he added, are intended as a long-term pension to be accessed only if bitcoin hits $1 million — a milestone he's targeting for 2033.

The shift toward multiparty protections extends beyond just multi-signature. Multi-party computation, or MPC, is gaining traction as a more advanced security model.

Instead of storing private keys in one place — a vulnerability known as a ""single point of compromise"" — MPC splits a key into encrypted shares distributed across multiple parties. Transactions can only go through when a threshold number of those parties approve, sharply reducing the risk of theft or unauthorized access.

Multi-signature wallets require several parties to approve a transaction. MPC takes that further by cryptographically splitting the private key itself, ensuring that no single individual ever holds the full key — not even their own complete share.

The shift comes amid renewed scrutiny of centralized crypto platforms like Coinbase, which recently disclosed a data breach affecting tens of thousands of customers.

Taihuttu, for his part, says 80% of his trading now happens on decentralized exchanges like Apex — a peer-to-peer platform that allows users to set buy and sell orders without relinquishing custody of their funds, marking a return to crypto's original ethos.

While he declined to reveal his total holdings, Taihuttu did share his goal for the current bull cycle: a $100 million net worth, with 60% still held in bitcoin. The rest is a mix of ether, layer-1 tokens like solana, link, sui, and a growing number of AI and education-focused startups — including his own platform offering blockchain and life-skills courses for kids.

Lately, he's also considering stepping back from the spotlight.

""It's really my passion to create content. It's really what I love to do every day,"" he said. ""But if it's not safe anymore for my daughters ... I really need to think about them.""

Bitcoin's journey from digital experiment to mainstream investment has been marked by one defining characteristic: extreme price volatility. However, data from NYU Stern's Volatility Lab reveals a remarkable transformation in how dramatically Bitcoin's price swings, offering important lessons for today's investors.

Between 2010 and 2017, Bitcoin experienced volatility that would make even the most seasoned traders nervous. During this period, annualized volatility frequently exceeded 200% and occasionally spiked above 400%. To put this in perspective, traditional stocks typically see volatility between 15-30% annually.

This extreme volatility reflected Bitcoin's status as an unproven digital asset with minimal institutional backing. Small trading volumes meant that even modest buy or sell orders could trigger massive price swings. News events, regulatory announcements, or technical developments could send prices soaring or crashing within hours.

The 2017 cryptocurrency bubble perfectly exemplified this era. Bitcoin's price rocketed from under $1,000 to nearly $20,000 before crashing back down, creating the kind of volatility that attracted speculators while terrifying traditional investors.

Following the 2017-2018 market correction, something interesting began happening. Bitcoin's volatility started declining meaningfully. Between 2018 and 2020, volatility generally ranged between 50% and 150% – still extreme by traditional standards, but a significant improvement from the earlier chaos.

This period coincided with several important developments: major companies began accepting Bitcoin payments, institutional investors started taking notice, and cryptocurrency exchanges became more sophisticated and regulated. These factors contributed to deeper liquidity and more stable price discovery.

Current data shows Bitcoin's volatility has continued moderating, now typically ranging between 30%-80%. While this remains substantially higher than stocks or bonds, it represents a dramatic evolution from Bitcoin's early days.

Recent analysis shows Bitcoin's average volatility sitting around 80%, with minimum levels reaching as low as 31%. This represents remarkable progress for an asset that once regularly experienced 300%-400% volatility.

This volatility evolution carries several important implications. First, Bitcoin has become more accessible to risk-conscious investors who were previously deterred by extreme price swings. Institutions and retail investors alike can now consider Bitcoin allocation with more predictable risk parameters.

However, “more stable” doesn't mean “stable.” An 80% volatility level means investors should still expect significant price movements. Bitcoin can easily gain or lose 20%-30% in a single week, making it unsuitable for investors who can't tolerate substantial short-term losses.

The data also suggests this maturation trend may continue. As Bitcoin's market capitalization grows and institutional adoption increases, basic economics suggests volatility should continue declining gradually.

For investors considering Bitcoin exposure, this volatility evolution suggests several strategies. Dollar-cost averaging becomes particularly attractive, as it helps smooth out price fluctuations over time. Position sizing remains critical – financial advisors typically recommend limiting Bitcoin exposure to 1%-5% of total portfolios.

Risk management takes on heightened importance. Even with reduced volatility, Bitcoin remains far more volatile than traditional assets, requiring careful consideration of overall portfolio risk.

Bitcoin's volatility journey from 400% to 80% represents one of the most significant developments in cryptocurrency history. While still volatile by traditional standards, this evolution reflects Bitcoin's gradual transition from speculative experiment to legitimate asset class.

For investors, this trend suggests Bitcoin is becoming more investable while remaining distinctly different from traditional assets. Understanding this evolution helps investors make informed decisions about whether and how to include Bitcoin in their portfolios, recognizing both its progress and its continued unique risk profile.

America's biggest crypto exchange Coinbase introduced two new ""wrapped"" tokens this week, allowing traders to use XRP and Dogecoin on DeFi protocols.

By introducing  cbDOGE and cbXRP, Coinbase is hoping to address surging demand for cross-chain functionality in the complex DeFi world, the company and industry observers told Decrypt. 

The exchange is making the new offerings available on its own Ethereum layer-2 Base network.

Coinbase holds 1:1 reserves of the underlying assets that back Coinbase Wrapped tokens. 

Proof of Reserves ↓ https://t.co/Y7DatHdHEehttps://t.co/WgC9jv2qjH

— Coinbase Assets 🛡️ (@CoinbaseAssets) June 4, 2025



""Bringing cbDOGE and cbXRP into the ecosystem is a smart way to get more users involved and unlock new liquidity,"" the CEO of DeFi app Balancer Labs Marcus Hardt told Decrypt.

A Coinbase spokesperson added: ""The launch of cbDOGE and cbXRP on Base allows customers to use the assets they already hold in new ways and makes trading more accessible to everyone.""

DeFi, or decentralized finance, is the catchall term for apps used in the crypto space that aim to automate acts like borrowing or lending, eliminating middlemen and centralized authorities.

The launch comes as DeFi makes a bigger push into the mainstream. Previously a convoluted and unregulated world, now even President Trump has backed a decentralized finance project. 

Such apps often run on Ethereum, presenting problems for traders who want to use their Bitcoin or other digital tokens in DeFi. 

Wrapped tokens aim to solve this, with Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum being the most popular example. But more and more wrapped tokens are popping up as the blockchain world expands.

XRP and Dogecoin are two leading cryptocurrencies—the fifth- and eighth-largest cryptocurrencies, with market caps of $128.5 billion and $27.9 billion, respectively.

Due to their size, both coins are popular, and there is demand to use them as collateral across the fast-moving and complex world of DeFi.

""Coinbase just showed it can efficiently put a meme coin (DOGE) and cross-border payments coin (XRP) into the DeFi ecosystem without a third-party bridge,"" Sam Mudie, CEO and co-founder of tokenized real-world assets firm Savea, told Decrypt—adding that he expects more large-cap coins to follow. 

Because Coinbase pulls the strings of these wrapped tokens, however, some DeFi proponents have raised concerns about the move.

""Coinbase controls the issuance, minting, burning, and smart contracts, without involvement from independent entities or the broader community,"" Flare Head of Research Max Luck told Decrypt.

Ethereum has faced a sharp pullback, dropping over 10% in the last 24 hours as global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty shake investor confidence across markets. The retrace comes amid rising US bond yields and escalating trade conflict rhetoric between major global powers, particularly the United States and China. While Bitcoin holds strong above key support levels, altcoins—including Ethereum—are under pressure, prompting caution among short-term traders.

However, some analysts believe this dip could present an opportunity rather than a threat. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights suggesting that Ethereum is holding range support well, even after the sharp decline. According to Pillows, ETH's ability to stay above critical support zones is a positive sign, with a potential breakout toward higher levels if it manages to reclaim momentum within the range.

The coming weeks will likely be decisive for Ethereum and the broader altcoin market. If market volatility calms and Bitcoin continues to consolidate above $100K, Ethereum could lead the next leg up, opening the door for a strong altseason. For now, traders are closely watching how ETH behaves around its current support to determine whether a deeper correction or a bullish reversal is in play.

Ethereum Holds Range Support Amid Market Volatility

Ethereum is showing resilience despite heightened macro uncertainty and political tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Following a sharp pullback, ETH has managed to defend key support levels, with bulls stepping in near the $2,400 zone. This recovery comes at a time when the crypto market is on edge, reacting to broader financial market volatility and shifting sentiment across global assets.

ETH remains approximately 48% below its all-time high, leaving substantial upside potential if momentum continues to build. The coming weeks will be decisive, especially as Bitcoin consolidates above $100,000 and traders look to Ethereum and altcoins for the next leg higher. Despite global headwinds, including inflation and escalating trade tensions, Ethereum is maintaining strength within its current range.

Pillows emphasized in a recent analysis that Ethereum is holding range support nicely after the dump. According to his view, reclaiming this range is a key signal that bulls remain in control. If ETH can break through near-term resistance levels and reclaim the $2,600 mark, it opens the door for a push toward $3,000 — a psychological and technical milestone.

ETH Rebounds As Consolidation Continues

Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,466, holding just above the 34-day EMA at $2,422 after a volatile week. As seen on the daily chart, ETH remains inside a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700. Despite recent pressure across altcoins, ETH has managed to avoid a breakdown and is attempting to stabilize above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.

The chart shows that ETH's recent pullback stopped just before the 100-day SMA (~$2,068), a level that has acted as a strong dynamic support in past cycles. Holding this structure is critical for the bullish outlook to remain intact. If bulls can push the price back above the 200-day SMA at $2,666, Ethereum could attempt a breakout above $2,700 — a move that would likely open the door to $3,000 and signal renewed strength in the broader altcoin market.

Volume has remained moderate, suggesting traders are waiting for confirmation before entering new positions. As long as ETH holds above the $2,400–$2,450 region, the bullish thesis remains valid. A daily close below $2,400, however, could expose the asset to a deeper correction toward the $2,200 zone, where the 100-day EMA provides additional technical support.

A month after the Pectra upgrade, key indicators on Ethereum have begun to reveal the promise and pitfalls of the network's most ambitious technical overhaul since the 2022 ""merge.""

One of the major features that the Pectra upgrade brought was expanding the Ethereum blockchain's capacity for handling ""blobs,"" which are units of ""ephemeral data storage,"" helping keep larger amounts of it on the consensus layer, according to a definition from the Protocol developer team.

A blob is a dedicated data structure that can store larger amounts of data. More blobs means transactions, layer-2 networks, and rollup operations could get even cheaper.

""The near-zero cost of blobs has been a major unlock for Ethereum scalability,"" Ulyana Skladchikova, head of product at open-source multi-chain explorer Blockscout, told Decrypt.

The same aspect has made it ""more cost-efficient for layer-2s to post data and enable high-throughput, low-cost rollups to flourish,"" she explained.

Those high-throughput and low-cost rollups include popular networks like the Coinbase-incubated Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, which can now process thousands of transactions for pennies instead of dollars.

For Ethereum, this means that it is ""delivering on its modular vision"" that could provide ""real benefits already visible across L2 ecosystems,"" Skladchikova said.

A week after the Pectra upgrade, rollups like Base and Arbitrum were paying less than a fraction of a penny for transactions on a daily basis.

""Blobs are virtually free again, for the first time since mid-April 2025,"" Zack Pokorny, research analyst at digital asset firm Galaxy, wrote in a May 15 report.

Since Pectra went live, the total had tallied just ""four-thousandths of a penny,"" Pokorny noted, comparing it to roughly $16,000 daily before the Pectra upgrade, according to data from their Dune dashboard for blobs.

The component responsible for this was EIP-7691, which introduced blob scaling on Pectra. In the days following Pectra's activation, blob usage increased by about 20%, with daily blob purchases rising to 25,600.

Still, despite the increase, rollups haven't yet fully utilized the expanded capacity. That's resulted in a substantial drop in blob prices, Pokorny explained.

By the end of May, blob usage had increased to roughly 28,000, representing a 33% increase since Pectra went live, aggregate data compiled by crypto intelligence firm Coin Metrics shows.

While the reduction in blob costs improved profit margins for rollups, it also presented challenges for validators.

The cost improvements on blobs indirectly increased ""the data burden on validators,"" Blockscout's Skladchikova told Decrypt. Still, this can be seen as a trade-off, she argued.

Validators are people or organizations that help run Ethereum by keeping it secure and processing transactions. They do this by locking up some of their own ETH as a deposit—this is called “staking.” In return, they can earn ETH rewards. But if the hardware they're using to help validate transactions goes offline too often or breaks the rules, then they can lose some of the ETH they staked.

Because some smaller validators may not be able to afford the new costs of processing more data without risking a penalty, they've been merging into larger operations that can handle both the higher stake limits and the growing storage burden.

""Validator consolidation often raises concerns about centralization,” Skladchikova said, “but in Ethereum's case, the effect may actually be decentralizing.”

The price of Ethereum saw a wild upswing in May, surging from a price around $1,800 at the start of the month to a peak near $2,800. Even down slightly to $2,510, as of this writing, ETH remains up 27% over the last 30 days.

Crypto World News

June 7, 2025 by Tina Fatima 

Ethereum attracts investor interest even when it maintains a healthy upward trend this month. Currently, with a 24-hour trading volume of $17.05 billion, ETH trades at $2,487.15 and has posted a 2% gain over the last 24 hours.While the weekly momentum was slightly bearish, the month-on-month increase of 30.45% illustrates excellent underlying momentum together with a fresh interest from institutional as well as retail investors.

The price recently followed the sharp rally from early in the month of May, which propelled Ethereum into consolidation with tighter trading ranges.There are minor price fluctuations, but the asset remains resilient to the downside, which suggests strong buying interest and potential continuation of the prevailing trend.

The 12-hour chart of Ethereum shows a symmetrical triangle pattern, clearer under technical analysis. This pattern is most commonly drawn with continuation moves but currently reflects indecision within the market since neither the buying nor selling pressure has taken control.Converging trendlines depict a compressing range, thus hinting at an impending significant breakout. In the previous trading sessions, Ethereum bounced off the support zone near $2,460 and regained ground towards the mid-range of the triangle.Currently, it approaches a crucial resistance zone that lies between $2,670 and $2,700, which coincides with the upper boundary of the triangle. This area has previously resulted in sell-offs; however, the tightening structure increases its chances of breaking out within days.

A clear move above the current resistance range would likely open up a rally target toward $3,300, as expected from the height measurement of the triangle. This bullish scenario would likely draw quite a bit of buying volume, which would continue to propel Ethereum higher.

The market is still cautious, though. If Ethereum cannot climb above the resistance, then the price could drop into the range between $2,430 and $2,250.This area is considered a significant support zone and may indeed become flavored with selling pressure if it were to be retested. Traders are waiting for a clear direction from volume and momentum as it gets closer to the apex of the triangle.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62%","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:cd0b16936094b:0-the-return-of-altcoin-season-why-bitcoin-dominance-must-fall-to-62/","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

One of the reasons that the altcoin season seemed to not have begun until now is the fact that Bitcoin has dominated the market recovery, and thus, the BTC dominance remains very high. For the altcoin season to actually begin, past market performances show that there needs to be a major decline in the Bitcoin dominance. This is the ultimate trigger the market needs to confirm that altcoins will begin their own independent run.

Bitcoin Dominance Needs To Fall To 62%

The Bitcoin dominance is still trending at a high 64%, and this continues to be a thorn in the side of altcoins. With the dominance this high, the Bitcoin price continues to dictate where the market goes and has seen altcoins suffer crashes as a result of even the tiniest movement triggering a decline in prices.

However, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend has pointed out an interesting formation in the chart, which is a 7-wave crashing pattern. This pattern has been completed, and this signals a possible drop in the Bitcoin dominance as time goes on. The last phase of the 7-wave pattern was when the dominance hit a peak of 64.6% before declining back down toward 64%.

This pattern suggests that the Bitcoin dominance could possibly drop to 62%, which would be good news for those waiting for the altcoin season. The last time that the dominance was this low was back on May 14, and altcoins had rallied hard as a result.

For this decline to be completed, the crypto analyst reveals that confirmation lies below 63.45%, as this is the Wave 6 lows. Once this support is broken, a sharp drop toward 62% is expected from here. As the analyst explains, “real momentum kicks in under 62%,” and this is when altcoin season moves with full force.

Altcoin Season Is Not Over

The topic of a possible altcoin season is currently one of the most debated in the crypto community as market participants remain split on where it is in the cycle. Some have said there will be no altcoin season similar to what was seen in 2021, while others have maintained that it is still possible.

One analyst on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has lent their voice, pushing the narrative that the altcoin season is far from over. For a 2021-style altcoin season to happen, though, the crypto analyst says the altcoin market, which excludes the top 10 cryptos by market cap, must break above the $470 billion resistance like it did in previous cycles. Once this happens, then they expect the altcoin season to begin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","AI and Memes: 2 Narratives With the Biggest Potential — Altcoins to Watch: DOGE, SHIB and UNIL","https://financefeeds.com/ai-and-memes-2-narratives-with-the-biggest-potential-altcoins-to-watch-doge-shib-and-unil/","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 07:10:59 GMT","

The meme narrative is one of the most promising in the crypto scene, meaning the Dogecoin price would skyrocket and the Shiba Inu price would reach new ATHs. Another narrative with massive potential is artificial intelligence, with Unilabs Finance (UNIL), a new AI-powered DeFi asset manager, at the forefront. 

According to experts, DOGE, SHIB and UNIL are top DeFi coins to buy now. Backed by bullish narratives and with significant upside potential, they could outperform this cycle. As an emerging cryptocurrency with a small market size, UNIL could be this year's biggest gainer. 

Investments_CEO's $2 Dogecoin price prediction at the start of the year might have sounded ambitious, but it isn't now. Trading upward on the yearly chart, the dog-themed cryptocurrency could break out above the 2021 all-time high of $0.7376, making it one of the top DeFi coins to buy now. 

Javon Marks' bullish Dogecoin price prediction also suggests the meme token could reach a minimum price of $0.739—a new high. Considering meme's outperformance, it isn't surprising that investors have been betting on DOGE, supported by bullish technical indicators like the Commodity Channel Index and Williams Percent Range. 

With summer set to be explosive, the current Dogecoin price presents a great entry. At the same time, UNIL, a new AI coin, is also among the top DeFi coins to buy now and could be a better bet than DOGE due to its small market size. 

The Shiba Inu price, already budget-friendly, entered an attractive buy zone following the latest market downturn. It hovers above $0.000012, but bulls could push the price toward the 30-day high of $0.000017 in the coming days. 

At the same time, technical indicators show a strong buy signal, notably the Williams Percent Range (14), positioning SHIB among the top DeFi coins to buy now. While Crypto_Twittier expects the Shiba Inu price to range between $0.00017 and $0.00032 this year, LordOfAlts believes growing Shibarium adoption could spark a 790% upswing. 

Given the above, SHIB is among the top DeFi coins to buy now for significant gains. Additionally, the current Shiba Inu price presents a great entry, allowing investors to position themselves for gains without breaking the bank.

Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is a groundbreaking innovation in DeFi—an alternative to traditional financial markets. Its AI-backed DeFi asset manager emerges amid demand for sophisticated, intelligent systems capable of identifying market trends and hidden opportunities. 

Compared to conventional asset managers, the platform will scan the crypto market for early and high-potential projects across promising narratives like AI, DePIN and RWAs. Insights from these analyses will, in turn, position investors for substantial ROIs and minimize risks through diversified exposure. 

A core offering of the protocol is the Memecoin Identification Tool, which analyzes virality potential, liquidity and risk—uncovering the next DOGE and SHIB. In addition, its AI-powered portfolio management will automatically adjust investors' portfolios based on market conditions, all without manual input. With adoption a matter of when and not if, experts consider the protocol's utility token, UNIL, one of the top DeFi coins to buy now. 

While the Dogecoin price is on track to explode and the Shiba Inu price targets a new ATH, UNIL, a new AI token, is among the top DeFi coins to buy now. It is significantly discounted at $0.0062 in stage 3 of its presale, selling out fast after $2.4 million was raised in funding. 

Besides its upside potential, the UNIL token can be staked and holders will also have governance rights. Additionally, 30% of the total fees generated by the platform will be redistributed to holders, thereby incentivizing the community.

XRP holds strong above 200-EMA as Dogecoin and UNIL rally; UNIL presale tops $2.4m amid rising DeFi interest.

Table of Contents

Despite the recent market downturn, the XRP price hovers above the 200-EMA, while the Dogecoin price begins a comeback. With an overall market rally anticipated in the coming days, DOGE and Unilabs Finance (UNIL) are bullish waves not to miss — top DeFi coins to invest in.

Priced below $1, Dogecoin and UNIL are not only pocket-friendly; they are also high-potential altcoins. Hence, investors have been showing significant interest, pushing the ongoing UNIL presale above $2.4 million in record time.

Amidst a general market downturn, the XRP price has seen a 2% decrease over the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, it hovers above the 200-EMA ($2.08), which has proven to be a solid support.

Further supported by technical indicators like Momentum (10) and Commodity Channel Index (20), an XRP price bounce is on the table. Next key level to watch is a retest of its 30-day high of $2.64, positioning it among the top DeFi coins to invest in.

Top analysts believe a rally above this level could push the XRP price above $3 and potentially flip its all-time high of $3.84. Meanwhile, WestBfieldLa's optimistic price prediction has become a subject of much interest, highlighting why it is one of the top DeFi coins to invest in. However, UNIL's significant upside potential has been attracting more investor interest.

The Dogecoin price dipped by 10% on the weekly chart, pushing it back down to the $0.17 level. Does that mean it is over? Certainly not. Technical indicators like the Williams Percent Range and Commodity Channel Index give a strong buy signal, suggesting now is the time to double down on the dog-themed cryptocurrency. 

Moreover, Investments_CEO is optimistic that the Dogecoin price will climb toward $2 this year, which is considered a bold forecast. Hence, at the current price, it presents a great entry to what could be significant gains. A modest price prediction is by John Mark, suggesting the leading memecoin could hit $0.739 and surpass its 2021 all-time high.

The above highlights its potential, placing DOGE on the list of the top DeFi coins to invest in. With the Dogecoin price underpriced at less than $0.2, it is a promising wave not to miss, although experts consider UNIL, a new AI coin, to be more attractive due to its small market size.

Unilabs Finance's native utility coin, UNIL, is among the top DeFi coins to invest in this year for several reasons. At the heart of an AI-powered DeFi ecosystem, its outlook is promising, also functioning as a governance token. In addition, it is in its early stages, meaning participation in the ongoing presale can yield significant ROIs.

At $0.0062 in the third stage of the ICO, a jump toward $0.0074 is anticipated by the fourth round. With early investors positioned for gains as the presale progresses and well after the token's market debut, there are other benefits to holding.

UNIL holders are eligible for periodic airdrops of tokens from projects that launched on the Unilabs AI Launchpad and a share of platform-generated profits through consistent dividends. Also, there will be early access to high-potential investment opportunities through the UNIL token, positioning it among the top DeFi coins to invest in this year.

The XRP price hovers above the 200-EMA despite market downturn, while the Dogecoin price is tipped to surpass $2 this cycle. Meanwhile, Unilabs Finance's UNIL token is on experts' lists of the top DeFi coins to invest in. Investors have been doubling down on the AI coin due to its solid fundamentals as the native utility token of a DeFi asset management platform.

Mythical Games, a blockchain gaming studio, has confirmed the global launch of its crypto-powered soccer title, FIFA Rivals, scheduled for June 12. The game will feature Adidas-branded digital assets from the outset, facilitated by a new multi-year licensing agreement with the sportswear brand. Players will gain access to exclusive Adidas kits, jerseys, and virtual shoes, all connected to the iconic football brand's heritage.

FIFA Rivals brings Adidas' football heritage into the cryptocurrency gaming world. Players can buy, sell, or collect distinct Adidas digital items as unique, tradable assets. Additionally, a virtual Adidas Training Facility will be incorporated into the game enabling players to upgrade their team cards and finish tasks to unlock extra rewards.

FIFA Rivals is a mobile football game that curates official FIFA licensing with fast arcade action and blockchain features. With crypto technology Mythical Games gives players actual ownership of their in-game assets. Adidas gear, player cards, and other digital items are represented as collectibles on the blockchain, with secure ownership and easy trading on the Mythical Marketplace.

The game features a crypto-enabled ecosystem in which players can build their dream squads, engage with the global community, and compete in real-time PvP matches. Users have full control of their digital collections and can buy, sell and trade assets. Furthermore, FIFA Rivals takes a different approach to traditional mobile games, which makes the gameplay transparent and more engaging for both crypto and football fans.

Mythical Games CEO John Linden added that by integrating Adidas, the players will now be better connected to the culture of football. The partnership indicates a new milestone for digital brands in the crypto gaming space, featuring the reach of global sports and the advantages of blockchain technology.

Mythical Games has garnered investment from key stakeholders in the crypto/Web3 space, including a16z, ARK Invest and Animoca Brands. The company's blockchain based games have already processed $650 million in transactions with over seven million users. The addition of Adidas to FIFA Rivals highlights growing interest in the intersection of crypto gaming and sports.

Additionally, players will be able to collect limited edition crypto assets associated with real-world football moments, such as when a special Adidas in-game event takes place and digital drops. Through the blockchain infrastructure, the Mythical Marketplace will support secure trading and ownership of all forms of digital collectibles.

Polymarket, the leading blockchain-based prediction market, has officially become the exclusive forecast provider for X (formerly Twitter). Announced early Friday, the partnership brings live, crypto-native prediction data directly into X's social feed, merging blockchain speculation with the pace and reach of social media. This move transforms trending topics into real-time indicators of public sentiment, all powered by decentralized market activity.

⚖️ X-Polymarket alliance brings prediction markets into social mediaThe leading prediction market platform Polymarket has announced a partnership (https://t.co/JUzBaMx9tL) with Elon Musk's company xAI, which, in addition to AI development, is also behind the social network X.… pic.twitter.com/DkE09LB388

The new partnership follows a short-lived attempt by X to integrate with Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated prediction exchange. Just weeks ago, Kalshi announced a deal with the platform, but the arrangement collapsed within hours. Shayne Coplan, Polymarket's chief executive, marked the announcement with an energetic post.

Proud to announce @Polymarket's partnership with @X and @xai as their Official Prediction Market Partner. The two top truth seeking apps on the internet are stronger together.Welcome to News 2.0.Stay tuned https://t.co/P6Xd7yKlmt

The abrupt reversal highlighted a mismatch between Kalshi's regulatory obligations under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and X's desire for a scalable, borderless system. Kalshi's oversight-heavy model posed limitations on what markets could be shown on X, ultimately stalling the rollout.

In contrast, Polymarket operates on Ethereum rails and serves a global, non-U.S. user base. In 2023, the platform processed over $8 billion in volume despite geofencing U.S. users. Its decentralized architecture allows for agility and international reach, qualities that align perfectly with Elon Musk's vision of integrating crowd-driven intelligence into X without being bottlenecked by traditional financial regulations.

With the integration now live, users on X will start seeing Polymarket's live odds embedded directly under relevant tweets. These compact widgets display up-to-the-minute probabilities on high-interest events like elections, sports finals, and economic decisions. When a post matches an active market on Polymarket, users will see a simple odds bar showing the current implied probability and short-term movement. Tapping or hovering over it will reveal more context, and users outside of restricted jurisdictions can click through to the full Polymarket contract for deeper insight.

To help interpret shifting market sentiment, X will leverage its proprietary AI assistant, Grok. The tool will analyze trending posts, on-chain activity, and historical data to generate concise, real-time explanations for market changes. For example, Grok might summarize, “Odds for a June rate hike dropped 3% after Powell's press conference.” This added context layer will feature top influencing tweets, sentiment timelines, and alerts for anomalies like low liquidity or unusually large trades.

The user experience will also include the option to follow specific contracts, turning them into live alerts within X's notification pane. Future updates may allow verified experts to offer counterpoints or alternative analyses, adding an editorial layer without compromising the platform's data-first approach.

This partnership signals a broader shift in how digital platforms are using decentralized technologies to elevate public discourse. By embedding real-time prediction data into everyday social media interactions, X is betting that data-backed forecasting will become as habitual as scrolling a feed. Elon Musk has long advocated for the power of collective forecasting, arguing it often outperforms traditional polling or punditry. This Polymarket integration puts that theory to the test.

However, X will need to tread carefully. The integration of prediction markets into a social platform introduces new regulatory and ethical considerations. The company must ensure it avoids becoming an unlicensed betting venue or enabling manipulation by large traders. Success depends on balancing innovation with oversight, transparency, and user protection.

If X and Polymarket can manage these challenges, this collaboration may mark the beginning of a new era in online communication, one where every post is not just a comment but a data point in a living, breathing prediction engine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Musician made $3M selling NFTs and lost it all to taxes and a crypto crash","https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-artist-crypto-tax-nightmare-song","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 11:03:59 GMT","

 After earning $3 million from NFT sales, Jonathan Mann watched it vanish in a crash, and now he's turned the ordeal into a painfully honest crypto tax tune. 

Non-fungible token (NFT) artist Jonathan Mann, the musician behind the “Song A Day” project, has turned his crypto tax ordeal into a cautionary musical tale. 

In a new track shared on X, Mann recounted how he made $3 million selling his entire back catalog as NFTs, only to see it vanish as the market crashed during the Terra ecosystem collapse. 

“This is the story of how I made three million dollars and lost it,” Mann sings. “And how I owed the IRS more money than I made in 10 previous years.” 

Mann said it all began on Jan. 1, 2022, when he sold 3,700 songs at $800 each, netting him roughly $3 million — all in Ether (ETH). 

Excited but unprepared, Mann and his wife decided to hold onto the crypto, hoping ETH prices would increase. “We didn't have a plan,” Mann admitted in the song. 

Things took a turn when ETH's value declined in January 2022, and the couple was unsure about how much to sell or when. To add to their woes, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came knocking at their door. 

As Mann explained in the song, his earnings from selling NFTs are taxed as income. This means that tax is based on the value of the ETH when received, regardless of whether the crypto asset later crashes in value. Because of this, even though their $3 million in ETH went down in price, their tax bill remained the same.  

To avoid selling their crypto at a loss, Mann said they took out a loan through the lending protocol Aave, using some of the ETH as collateral. But disaster struck as the market started to crash, driven by the Terra collapse. 

The incident triggered a cascade of liquidations across the ecosystem, which included Mann's loan. In a flash, 300 ETH disappeared. “A lifetime of work erased in a moment,” he lamented. 

Scrambling to find a way out, Mann spent months combing through transactions with his accountant to determine how much they owed — they found out it was $1,095,171.79.

With the threat of potential liens on their home and risks of losing his wife's retirement account, Mann turned to one last option: selling a rare Autoglyph NFT he purchased back in crypto's early days. 

The musician said he attempted to sell the NFT through X but did not get a good reception. However, he found a broker with a client who offered $1.1 million for the NFT. Mann said that he accepted the deal to pay for the IRS taxes. 

Because of the losses incurred in the Aave loan, Mann did not owe capital gains taxes on the Autoglyph sale. “It felt so bittersweet to be done,” he sings at the end. 

Despite the ordeal, Mann continues writing daily songs and selling them as NFTs, still hopeful he'll one day earn another $3 million.

Jonathan Mann decided to hold the ETH from the sale, which turned out to be a bad decision in hindsight.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Singer-songwriter Jonathan Mann recently shared the story of how earning millions in Ethereum (ETH) during a one-hour sale of his NFTs eventually became a “tax nightmare.”

Mann has published one song a day over the past 17 years and released his 6,000th song on June 5, which was about the purported nightmare resulting from the sale.

In 2022, he sold 4,000 songs worth 13 years of work within 60 minutes for a total of roughly $3 million in Ethereum. He retained the earnings in Ethereum instead of converting to dollars.

 However, a week later, market price slipped below $3,000, shrinking the sale's dollar value.

 The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats revenue earned directly in crypto as ordinary income at the moment of receipt, he owed a massive tax obligation even though his assets were no longer worth the same dollar amount.

The tax man calculated Mann's tax obligations based on the $3 million initial valuation rather than on subsequent lower prices.

Mann had already accumulated $1 million in 2021 obligations linked to earlier NFT mints and airdrops, including Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and ConstitutionDAO tokens. 

To cover part of that balance, he borrowed $400,000 against 518 ETH through the Aave lending platform. However, little did he know that his collateral was about to evaporate.

However, the May 2022 collapse of the Terra ecosystem cut the collateral's value from $1.5 million to about $200,000, forcing a last-minute repayment that left Mann with 163 ETH and a net capital loss of roughly $1.3 million.

IRS notices during 2023 and 2024 cited unpaid income tax of nearly $1.1 million and threatened asset seizure. Mann recounted that at the time he was “dreading” the only option he had left to solve his dilemma – selling his “autoglyph.”

He wrote:

“My Autoglyph.

Minted April 8th, 2019.  

(Day before my birthday)  

It cost $36.

And this wasn't just an NFT. 

Matt Hall and John Watkinson (of Cryptopunks fame) had made something special. The day after the mint, I turned mine into music. John built a custom “glyph to midi” tool because of it.

It was a piece of my soul from when 50 people knew what NFTs were.  

By 2024, it was worth over $1 million.”

The sale offset the losses from his borrowing and helped him clear his tax obligations. As a conclusion to his story, Mann urged creators to convert crypto from NFT sales to dollars.

He wrote:

“The moral for every NFT creator: SELL. THE. ETH. IMMEDIATELY.”

This will match revenue with prospective tax liabilities. He cited using the protocol 0xSplits to automatically convert half of NFT proceeds into USDC to reduce exposure to price swings.

American singer Jonathan Mann lost $3 million, which he had earned from NFT sales, to crypto tax and an unexpected Ethereum price crash.

Jonathan Mann, an American singer and songwriter, recently experienced a notable crypto loss due to the market crash. The musician behind the “Song A Day” project lost the $3 million he earned from the sales of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in part to crypto tax.

Consequently, Mann has turned his ordeal into a musical tale, advising other investors to be cautious. He shared his new track on X, recounting how he made the $3 million.





According to the thread on the social media platform, the songwriter confirmed that he sold his entire back catalog as digital collectibles. Then, it vanished when the crypto landscape crashed during the Terra ecosystem collapse.

“This is the story of how I made three million dollars and lost it,” Mann sings. “And how I owed the IRS more money than I made in 10 previous years.”

Three years ago, Mann sold 3,700 songs at $800 each, generating roughly $3 million in Ethereum (ETH) from these sales. With so much excitement and a lack of preparation, the singer and his wife chose to HODL Ethereum. They expected the largest altcoin by market capitalization to surge in price.

6000 days.6000 songs.

A story that almost broke me:

The $3 million I made and lost.My $1.1 million tax bill.The Autoglyph that saved me

This is SONG A DAY #6000

🌩️CRYPTO TAX NIGHTMARE🌩️

The journey continues below👇 pic.twitter.com/ufUKNPiMIH

— 17 years of song a day (@songadaymann) June 5, 2025



Instead of increasing as the couple had expected, the ETH price followed a downtrend pattern in January 2022. While the couple was still trying to figure out their next course of action—how much to sell or when to sell—the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came after them.

The IRS taxed his earnings from the sales of the NFTs as income, valuing the ETH at the price it was when Mann first received it. This was an unfortunate situation, considering that the price of ETH had significantly dropped since then.

While the $3 million in ETH has gone down in value, the tax due remained the same.

Mann and his wife were trying to avoid losses. Hence, they took a loan from Aave, a prominent lending protocol, and used the ETH as collateral, rather than selling it. When Terraform Labs crashed in 2022, more disaster struck for the American musician, as massive crypto liquidations occurred. In the blink of an eye, Mann's $3 million vanished.

He and his wife ended up with a debt of $1,095,171.79. Mann sold a rare Autoglyph NFT he purchased in crypto's early days to save the day. After some setbacks, he found a broker who was willing to pay $1.1 million for the NFT. Mann said that he accepted the deal because it was sufficient to cover the taxes.

After this unpleasant ordeal, the American singer has not stopped writing songs and selling them as NFTs. He hopes to make as much as $3 million in another sale soon. Notably, the NFT ecosystem is not receiving as much traction as it used to.

Bitcoin Hyper has seen rapid traction in its presale, raising close to $700,000 just days after going live. 

Touted as the first true Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, this innovative project addresses the network's long-standing limitations—high transaction fees, slow processing speeds, and the lack of native smart contract support—through the integration of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). 

By combining Solana's lightning-fast architecture with Bitcoin's security, Bitcoin Hyper brings programmability and high-speed transactions to the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

The project is already gaining momentum in the crypto community and has attracted coverage from major crypto media outlets.

Source – CRYPTO VIDEOZ YouTube Channel

Summary

Bitcoin Hyper is designed as a Layer 2 blockchain to scale Bitcoin by enabling faster transactions, lower fees, and smart contract capabilities. While Bitcoin remains the most secure and established blockchain, its base layer is limited by slower speeds and lacks support for decentralized applications (dApps).

To overcome these issues, Bitcoin Hyper leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), combining Solana's high-throughput architecture with Bitcoin's unparalleled security. 

This hybrid approach introduces programmability to the Bitcoin network, allowing near-instant transaction processing and unlocking a new world of use cases.

Operating as a low-latency Layer 2 network, Bitcoin Hyper processes transactions on a high-performance virtual machine and settles them on Bitcoin's Layer 1. 

This reduces congestion and cuts costs significantly compared to native Bitcoin transactions. Developers can build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications with ease—capabilities previously unavailable on Bitcoin's native layer.

Furthermore, Bitcoin Hyper features a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge that connects its Layer 2 blockchain with the Bitcoin mainnet. 

Users can deposit BTC, convert it into Layer 2 tokens, and use them within the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, with the option to redeem tokens back to BTC seamlessly, enabling trustless interoperability between layers.

Security remains a core focus for Bitcoin Hyper. The project's smart contract has been thoroughly audited by Coinsult, confirming no mint functions, no blacklisting capabilities, no honeypot risks, and zero high-severity vulnerabilities. 

Trading is already enabled, providing investors with confidence in the project's reliability. The Bitcoin Hyper white paper outlines a bold vision to become the leading programmable Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. 

By offering fast smart contract execution, low-cost dApp deployment, and a seamless bridge to Bitcoin's base layer, the ecosystem aims to deliver true scalability without compromising Bitcoin's foundational security.

Integration of Solana's technology stack ensures a familiar and robust environment for developers, attracting builders seeking the combined benefits of both Bitcoin and Solana.

Bitcoin Hyper is actively growing its community, boasting over 6,900 followers on X since launching in May 2025. It also maintains active engagement on Telegram and through its official website. 

The project has gained coverage in respected crypto media such as Cryptonews, Cryptonomist, InsideBitcoins, and Bitcoin.com, and is featured on platforms like Cointelegraph and CoinMarketCap. 

As further proof of its rising presence, more crypto analysts have begun discussing Bitcoin Hyper on their YouTube channels—many of which have thousands of subscribers—highlighting the growing recognition the project is receiving across the crypto space.

The Bitcoin Hyper presale is currently offering tokens priced at $0.0118. Over $680,000 has been raised so far, and the token price is set to increase within the next 24 hours—making this an ideal opportunity for early investors to secure tokens at a discount.

To participate, users need a compatible crypto wallet such as Best Wallet, MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet. The presale primarily accepts Ethereum (ETH), with additional support for Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and stablecoins like USDT.

For newcomers or those without ETH, direct purchase options via credit or debit card are also available. After funding their wallet, participants connect it to the presale page, enter the desired investment amount, and complete the transaction.

Once the presale concludes, participants will be able to claim their HYPER tokens, currently issued on the Ethereum blockchain. In just a few days, the project has raised nearly $700,000 and is attracting growing interest from crypto analysts and major media outlets.

Bitcoin Hyper is quickly emerging as one of the most compelling Layer 2 innovations for Bitcoin—combining Solana-level performance with Bitcoin's trusted foundation.

Tron coin has reached a major milestone as it handled more than 8 million transactions in a single day. This figure has placed it ahead of Bitcoin in daily price shift.

The network's rise in usage comes as its native digital currency, TRX price shows early signs of a rebound.

Analysts say the surge in active addresses and stablecoin movement may set the stage for further gains.

Tron coin is making a quiet but strong comeback. As of June 6, 2025, TRX price was trading at $0.2782, up 2.72% in 24 hours. In contrast, Bitcoin price fell as low as 2.2% to the $103,000 support level.

While that may not grab headlines, the bigger picture tells a more interesting story. Analysts tracking the market noted that TRX price is in what they call a rebound and decoupling phase.

That means it is starting to move independently, no longer following broader market trends too closely.

CryptoQuant data shows that the number of active addresses on the Tron network has reached new all-time highs.

This is not a one-off event. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages for activity have both climbed steadily, showing that the user base is growing at a consistent pace.

Analyst Cryptoonchain pointed out that these metrics often lead to positive price action.

The increase in peer-to-peer transfers and the rise in decentralized application use are helping TRX stand apart.

In a market where many coins rise and fall together, TRX price is starting to behave differently.

If the pattern holds, that difference could be the first step toward a breakout. With more users and steady engagement, the signs point to building momentum.

Tron's biggest achievement this year may not be tied to price, but to performance. The network processed more than 8 million transactions in a single day, topping Bitcoin in daily volume.

This marks a 30% increase since February 2025, adding around 2 million transactions per day in just four months.

The numbers highlight a key difference between Tron and Bitcoin. 

While Bitcoin's transaction count is often tied to exchange-related activity, Tron's growth comes from real usage. This is mainly peer-to-peer transfers and stablecoin movement.

The most active of these is USDT, which now forms a core part of the Tron ecosystem. Tron's low transaction fees and fast processing times are likely major reasons behind the surge.

Developers are also choosing it for dApps due to the lower costs and smooth user experience.

With millions of daily transactions now a regular feature, Tron is beginning to look like a leader in practical blockchain utility.

The big question now is whether TRX price can reach $0.5, drawing on the positive trend within its ecosystem.

The price currently sits at $0.2782, but the growth in activity has investors watching closely.

The fundamentals are in place: more users, more transactions, and a steady rise in daily wallet activity. This usually leads to TRX adoption and a potential upward movement in price.

Still, the road is not guaranteed. Broader market conditions and investor sentiment will play a role.

But if Tron coin's current bullish trend continues, the $0.5 level may come into view sooner rather than later.

With stablecoin use growing and developer interest holding strong, the building blocks for a price breakout are already there.

Digital payments are entering a new era. Apple, Google Cloud, Airbnb, and X (formerly Twitter) are quietly discussing with crypto companies to integrate stablecoins into their services. This strategic shift marks a clear turning point: blockchain is moving out of the experimental phase to become an infrastructure tool coveted by tech giants.

While Uber announced plans to accept cryptos as a payment method, other tech giants including Apple, Airbnb, X (ex-Twitter), and Google have started confidential talks with crypto companies to integrate stablecoins into their payment systems.

This crypto initiative mainly aims to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments and reduce dependence on traditional intermediaries. Companies see adopting these cryptos as a way to lower transaction fees and optimize cross-border payments.

Among them, Airbnb has been actively exploring the idea since early this year, collaborating with companies specializing in stablecoin infrastructure, and considering bypassing players like Visa or Mastercard.

Thus, ongoing initiatives are as follows:

Although at an early stage, these discussions reveal growing strategic interest in stablecoins, seen no longer as a speculative trend but as a tool for modernizing financial infrastructures.

The desire to reduce intermediation fees seems to be the main driver behind this emerging transformation.

While some companies such as Airbnb and Apple are still at the exploratory stage, others like Google Cloud have already taken action. The company's cloud division confirmed accepting stablecoin payments for two of its clients, specifically in PYUSD, the stablecoin issued by PayPal in partnership with Paxos.

“We billed these clients as usual. They simply used stablecoins to pay their invoices,” said Rich Widmann, Head of Web3 Strategy at Google Cloud.

These transactions were integrated into the company's regular accounting without a specific division, showing a desire for a smooth and structured integration. Widmann even called this evolution “the biggest advancement in payments since the SWIFT network.”

X, Elon Musk's platform, is developing a more ambitious approach through its X Money app, designed as a versatile payment tool. After officially partnering with Visa in January for a digital wallet development, X is now in talks with Stripe about a possible integration of stablecoin payments.

Negotiations, initially led by Patrick Traughber (former head of payments, now at World), are now taken over by Payam Abedi, a senior developer whose LinkedIn title is “Financial Services at X.” Again, the goal would be to add a peer-to-peer payment feature, inspired by services like Venmo but powered by stablecoin architecture.

Through these initiatives, a critical issue arises: the choice of stablecoin to integrate. Between USDT (often criticized for compliance practices), USDC (affected by uncertainties around Circle's IPO), and PYUSD (still little adopted), options remain limited.

Some players are even considering creating their own stablecoin, an idea already mentioned but hindered by opposition from some Democratic lawmakers in the United States. For Chris Ahn, partner at Haun Ventures and early investor in the startup Bridge acquired by Stripe, the current dynamics are unprecedented: “stablecoins have existed for a long time, but now we have the right pieces of the puzzle.”

The first concrete signs of growing Big Tech interest in stablecoins may well signal a structural pivot in digital payments approach. As regulatory barriers ease, tech companies are seeking to take the initiative, betting on tools perceived until now as marginal or risky. While some projects remain exploratory, the actions already undertaken by Google Cloud and the ambitions shown by X demonstrate that a new era is beginning.

Eric Trump said that World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project with ties to the Trump family, plans to acquire a ""substantial position"" in the TRUMP memecoin for its long-term treasury as it “aligns” with the project.



The announcement, posted to X on Friday, framed the move as part of a shared vision for “crypto, patriotism and long-term success.”



While few concrete details were provided, the commitment suggests an effort to bring a veneer of institutional weight to a token that, like most memecoins, trades largely on attention and branding.



It's unclear how much capital the firm plans to commit. Other holdings in its portfolio include major altcoins like ether ETH$2,514.10, bitcoin BTC$105,565.52, and TRX TRX$0.28103, along with some stablecoins.



The project has nevertheless accumulated several lesser-known tokens, including BUILDon (B) after the project announced it would use WLF's USD1 stablecoin for real-world use cases.

The House Financial Services Committee might mark up market structure legislation next week, while the Senate seems close to passing its stablecoin bill.



You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.

Here's what's clear: There are bills and they will probably get votes next week. Here's what's unclear: What all lawmakers might need to get enough votes to actually advance these bills, and if they're there already or not.

The crypto industry has waited for years for Congress to pass legislation giving it some sort of regulatory clarity. Congress has taken a number of key steps this year already, but next week might see quite a few of these steps happen.

Logistical details first. There will be markups in the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee on the market structure bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (otherwise known as just the Clarity Act) on Tuesday. That markup will likely end with lawmakers voting to advance the bill to the broader House of Representatives (it's possible the vote will fail, but it currently seems unlikely).



On the Senate side, lawmakers might hold a series of votes as early as Monday on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 Act (otherwise known as GENIUS) to advance it. Senator Ruben Gallego, the Arizona Democrat who spearheaded a pause in the bill's advancement, said in an interview on Thursday that he expects a massive bipartisan vote in favor of the legislation. It'll need 60 votes to clear cloture (this is a second cloture vote) and a simple majority afterward to pass the Senate entirely. After that, it's on to the House.



""We've worked in a very honest, earnest manner with our Republican colleagues. We think that they've been also doing the same,"" he said. ""They adopted a lot of the amendments, most of the amendments that we're we've been adding, and they've been continuing to work with some other Democrats who have some other concerns, but we believe that if all the changes are made, it's going to be a very solid, comprehensive bill that I think we could all be proud to vote for.""



In other words, by the end of next week it's possible the House of Representatives will have both a market structure bill to consider, amend and vote on and a stablecoin bill (the House Financial Services Committee version of GENIUS, the STABLE Act, already passed out of that committee a while ago).



Whether both bills will make it to U.S. President Donald Trump's desk by the August recess is an open question. Policymakers in Washington, D.C. this week seemed skeptical that both bills would be passed by that deadline, though stablecoin legislation is likely to clear the House and Senate by then.



One theory flying around is that the GENIUS Act in the Senate might get tagged onto the House's Clarity Act, letting the House vote on both its market structure bill and stablecoin bill at once and sending both back to the Senate. To be clear, this isn't a firm plan, just something various individuals have suggested is a possibility. However, I've heard that there will likely be pushback from both House and Senate lawmakers should this path be pursued.



The other, more likely possibility seems to be that market structure legislation will just take longer — perhaps through the end of the year.



This is despite Democrats' ongoing concerns that Trump is enriching himself through his various crypto ventures. Just this week, Trump's media firm, Truth Social, filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with Yorkville America and NYSE Arca. Assuming this product is approved, it'll open another avenue for a Trump-affiliated entity to benefit from interest in the industry.

 JAN3 founder Samson Mow says Elon Musk should go all in on Bitcoin before “they freeze his fiat assets.” 

The Bitcoin community is calling on Tesla CEO Elon Musk to stack Bitcoin as a way to gain the upper hand in his ongoing public feud with US President Donald Trump.

“The best way for Elon to get back at Trump is by full porting Bitcoin,” crypto trader and analyst Will Clemente said in a June 6 X post. Echoing a similar sentiment, JAN3 founder and CEO Samson Mow said in an X post on the same day, “@elonmusk, it's time to go all in on Bitcoin.”

Mow urged Musk to accept Bitcoin (BTC) payments for Tesla and adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. In 2021, Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment due to environmental concerns. However, the firm still holds digital assets. On April 23, Cointelegraph reported that Tesla's digital asset holdings dropped 11.61% in value from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1.

Mow also proposed that Musk's SpaceX offer launch discounts to customers who pay in Bitcoin.

“Force a hard money standard on the money printers,” Mow said. It comes after Mow recently told Cointelegraph Magazine that it's been three months since Trump signed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order, but he is yet to buy any additional Bitcoin. He said the US “has to start” acquiring Bitcoin this year to avoid being front-run by other nations.

In another comment to Musk, Mow added:

Some Bitcoiners speculated that if Musk backed Bitcoin, he wouldn't hold back. Lomob co-founder and CEO Boyd Cohen said, “If Musk were to go BTC maxi, all bets are off in so many ways. He doesn't do anything small.”

“He'd build or buy his way to the biggest BTC treasury, he'd accept BTC in all his businesses, he'd be joining Bitcoin Presidents on the world stage promoting it as the only path to freedom,” Cohen said.

The feud started after Musk left office as an adviser to Trump and then called his tax bill a “disgusting abomination” on June 3. It escalated on June 5 after both traded public insults on social media. Musk said Trump's plan for sweeping global tariffs “will cause a recession in the second half of this year.”

Meanwhile, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that terminating Musk's government subsidies and contracts would save “billions and billions of dollars” for the US government. 

Musk has frequently mentioned cryptocurrency over the years. Most recently, on June 2, he said his social media platform X is rolling out a new messaging feature, XChats, which will have “Bitcoin-style encryption.”

 Alex Lab Foundation said it will fully reimburse users affected by the $8.3 million exploit, with compensation issued in USDC following a structured claims process. 

Alex Protocol, a Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on the Stacks blockchain, suffered an exploit on June 6, resulting in $8.3 million in digital asset losses.  

In an X announcement, Alex Protocol said the breach was caused by a vulnerability in its self-listing verification logic. The attacker used the flaw to drain liquidity from several asset pools. 

The Bitcoin DeFi platform said the attackers siphoned about 8.4 million Stacks (STX) tokens, 21.85 Stacks Bitcoin (sBTC), 149,850 in USDC (USDC) and USDt (USDT), and 2.8 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). The incident is one of the largest exploits in the Stacks ecosystem to date.

In response to the incident, Alex Lab Foundation, the organization supporting the protocol, pledged to fully reimburse affected users using its treasury reserves. 

Cointelegraph reached out to Alex Protocol through its X account but did not receive a response by the time of publication. 

According to Alex Lab, compensation will be issued in USDC tokens. The protocol will base its reimbursement calculations on the average onchain exchange rates between 10:00 am UTC and 2:00 pm UTC on the day of the attack. 

Alex Lab said wallets affected by the attack will receive an onchain notification by June 8, including a personalized claim form. Users must submit the completed form with a receiving wallet address by June 10.  

The team said it will verify submitted claims and distribute USDC payments within seven days. Users who do not receive a form were urged to contact the team via email.  

The team did not reveal the technical mechanisms behind the exploit but is expected to release a post-mortem report.

This is not the first security incident in which Alex Protocol has lost millions. In May 2024, the DeFi platform suffered an exploit involving its crosschain bridge infrastructure. The incident led to the unauthorized withdrawal of $4.3 million in crypto from the platform. 

The DeFi protocol said the May exploit was likely linked to the North Korean cybercrime group Lazarus. The team pointed to three wallets used in the attack and said they worked with blockchain analyst ZachXBT to trace the stolen assets.

 The price of Official Trump coin briefly spiked 6% before pulling back, following Eric Trump saying the team ""remain focused on building the most exciting MEME on earth."" 

Eric Trump, son of the US President, announced that Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLF) plans to acquire a significant amount of the Official Trump memecoin following his endorsement of the token.

Some users in the crypto community were surprised that Official Trump (TRUMP) didn't see a stronger price reaction.

“I am proud to announce the $TRUMP Meme Coin has aligned with @WorldLibertyFi,” Trump said in a June 6 X post.

“We're proud to announce that World Liberty Financial plans to acquire a substantial position in $TRUMP for their Long-Term Treasury,” he said. Minutes after Trump published the X post, Official Trump's price jumped 6.40%, before retracing to $10.10 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. It is ranked as the 45th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $2.03 billion.

Some crypto commentators were skeptical that the news didn't drive a stronger price increase. Crypto commentator Pluid said in a June 6 X post, “The coin hasn't pumped on this news - not a good sign at all.”

It comes just weeks after the top 220 holders of Trump's memecoin met at the president's golf course in Virginia on May 23 for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.

Trump also dismissed the Official Trump Wallet launch following controversy earlier this month. “Although their meme wallet isn't moving forward, they remain focused on building the most exciting MEME on earth - $Trump,” he said. 

The controversy began on June 3, when non-fungible token marketplace Magic Eden and the team behind the president's memecoin, Official Trump, both said that they were linking up to launch “the Official $TRUMP Wallet.”

Eric Trump responded at the time, stating that the wallet “is not authorized by Trump” and warned Magic Eden to “be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization.”

Donald Trump Jr. later clarified that the family's crypto platform “will be launching our official wallet soon.”

Eric Trump, who is known for his pro-crypto stance, also spoke at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 15, saying that from families to government funds, “everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now.”

 Trump seems to recognize his official memecoin, down 85% from its all-time high, as a tool to measure public sentiment. 

United States President Donald Trump has signaled support for the idea that his official memecoin reflects public sentiment about his leadership.

In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump shared a Newsmax article discussing how his official cryptocurrency token serves as a gauge of political momentum, echoing views shared by some crypto industry figures. 

While the president may recognize his memecoin as a success barometer, the token's market performance paints a more sobering picture if it's to be used as a sentiment gauge. 

At the time of writing, his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin traded at around $10, down 85% since its all-time high of $73 in January. A scheduled $520 million token unlock in July could apply further downward pressure. 

According to onchain data compiled by Tokenomist (formerly Token Unlocks), only 26.48% of the TRUMP token's total supply has been unlocked, with 73.52% — about 735 million tokens — yet to enter circulation.

On July 18, TRUMP tokens amounting to 25% of the current circulating supply will hit the market. Tokenomist data shows that 50 million tokens valued at over $520 million will be unlocked. 

A large number of tokens hitting the market has the potential to put further downward pressure on the token's price, especially if the demand doesn't scale in parallel.

In the lead-up to the unlock, on June 7, Trump's son Eric Trump attempted to bolster market confidence using the Trump-backed crypto company World Liberty Financial, announcing that WLF plans to acquire a “substantial amount” of the memecoin tokens. 

The token's price didn't react significantly, leading commentators to say it was “not a good sign.”

Ultimately, whether investors absorb the upcoming unlock or react with a market sell-off could indicate broader political enthusiasm toward Trump's leadership.

Using memecoins as a tool to measure public sentiment isn't new. Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu previously told Cointelegraph that the TRUMP token's rapid rise was due to hype and novelty. 

However, the executive said that in the long term, it could reflect broader attitudes toward Trump's presidency.

Although this piece was originally written for an anniversary in 2016, it's always a good time to remember forgotten figures in history—especially women in physics whose contributions have been ignored. For more examples, read about Chien-Shiung Wu, whose experiments on entanglement paved the way for the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics, Melba Phillips, who helped usher in the nuclear age, and Maria Goeppert Mayer, who remained the last woman to win a physics Nobel for decades until Donna Strickland shared the 2018 prize.

Today, 19 December, marks the 141th anniversary of the birth of Mileva Marić Einstein. But who remembers this brilliant scientist? While her husband, Albert Einstein, is celebrated as perhaps the best physicist of the 20th century, one question about his career remains: How much did his first wife contribute to his groundbreaking science? While nobody has been able to credit her with any specific part of his work, their letters and numerous testimonies presented in the books dedicated to her(1-5)  provide substantial evidence on how they collaborated from the time they met in 1896 up to their separation in 1914. They depict a couple united by a shared passion for physics, music and for each other. So here is their story.

Mileva Marić was born in Titel in Serbia in 1875. Her parents, Marija Ruzić and Miloš Marić, a wealthy and respected member of his community, had two other children: Zorka and Miloš Jr. Mileva attended high school the last year girls were admitted in Serbia. In 1892, her father obtained the authorization of the Minister of Education to allow her to attend physics lectures reserved for boys. She completed her high school in Zurich in 1894 and her family then moved to Novi Sad. Mileva's classmates described her as brilliant but not talkative. She liked to get to the bottom of things, was perseverant and worked toward her goals.

Albert Einstein was born in Ulm in Germany in 1879 and had one sister Maja. His father, Hermann, co-founded an electrical engineering company the following year. His mother, Pauline Koch came from a rich family. Albert was inquisitive, bohemian and a rebel. Being undisciplined, he hated the rigor of German schools so he too finished his high school in Switzerland and his family relocated to Milan.

Albert and Mileva were admitted to the physics-mathematics section of the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich (now ETH) in 1896 with three other students: Marcel Grossmann, Louis Kollros and Jakob Ehrat. Albert and Mileva became inseparable, spending countless hours studying together. He attended only a few lectures, preferring to study at home. Mileva was methodical and organized. She helped him channel his energy and guided his studies as we learn from Albert's letters, exchanged between 1899-1903 during school holidays: 43 letters from Albert to Mileva have been preserved but only 10 of hers remain(5). These letters provide a first-hand account on how they interacted at the time.

In August 1899, Albert wrote to Mileva: “When I read Helmholtz for the first time, it seemed so odd that you were not at my side and today, this is not getting better. I find the work we do together very good, healing and also easier.” Then on 2 October 1899, he wrote from Milan: “… the climate here does not suit me at all, and while I miss work, I find myself filled with dark thoughts – in other words, I miss having you nearby to kindly keep me in check and prevent me from meandering”.

Mileva boarded in a pension for women where she met her life-long friends Helene Kaufler-Savić and Milana Bota. Both spoke of Albert's continuous presence at Mileva's place, where he would come freely to borrow books in Mileva's absence. Milan Popović, Helene's grandson, published the letters Mileva exchanged with her throughout her life(4).

By the end of their classes in 1900, Mileva and Albert had similar grades (4.7 and 4.6, respectively) except in applied physics where she got the top mark of 5 but he, only 1. She excelled at experimental work while he did not. But at the oral exam, Professor Minkowski gave 11 out of 12 to the four male students but only 5 to Mileva. Only Albert got his degree.

Meanwhile, Albert's family strongly opposed their relationship. His mother was adamant. “By the time you're 30, she'll already be an old hag!” as Albert reported to Mileva in a letter dated 27 July 1900, as well as “She cannot enter a respectable family.” Mileva was neither Jewish nor German. She had a limp and was too intellectual in his mother's opinion, not to mention prejudices against foreign people. Moreover, Albert's father insisted his son found work before getting married.

In September 1900, Albert wrote to Mileva: “I look forward to resume our new common work. You must now continue with your research – how proud I will be to have a doctor for my spouse when I'll only be an ordinary man.” They both came back to Zurich in October 1900 to start their thesis work. The other three students all received assistant positions at the Institute, but Albert did not. He suspected that professor Weber was blocking him. Without a job, he refused to marry her. They made ends meet by giving private lessons and “continue[d] to live and work as before,” as Mileva wrote to her friend Helene Savić.

On 13 December 1900, they submitted a first article on capillarity signed only under Albert's name. Nevertheless, both referred to this article in letters as their common article. Mileva wrote to Helene Savić on 20 December 1900.

“We will send a private copy to Boltzmann to see what he thinks and I hope he will answer us.” Likewise, Albert wrote to Mileva on 4 April 1901, saying that his friend Michele Besso “visited his uncle on my behalf, Prof. Jung, one of the most influential physicists in Italy and gave him a copy of our article.”

The decision to publish only under his name seems to have been taken jointly. Why? Radmila Milentijević, a former history professor at City College in New York, published in 2015 Mileva's most comprehensive biography(1). She suggests that Mileva probably wanted to help Albert make a name for himself, such that he could find a job and marry her. Dord Krstić, a former physics professor at Ljubljana University, spent 50 years researching Mileva's life. In his well-documented book(2),  he suggests that given the prevalent bias against women at the time, a publication co-signed with a woman might have carried less weight.

We will never know. But nobody made it clearer than Albert Einstein himself that they collaborated on special relativity when he wrote to Mileva on 27 March 1901: “How happy and proud I will be when the two of us together will have brought our work on relative motion to a victorious conclusion.”

Then Mileva's destiny changed abruptly. She became pregnant after a lovers' escapade in Lake Como. Unemployed, Albert would still not marry her. With this uncertain future, Mileva took her second and last attempt at the oral exam in July 1901. This time, Prof. Weber, whom Albert suspected of blocking his career, failed her. Forced to abandon her studies, she went back to Serbia, but came back briefly to Zurich to try to persuade Albert to marry her. She gave birth to a girl named Liserl in January 1902. No one knows what happened to her. She was probably given to adoption. No birth or death certificates were ever found.

Earlier in December 1901, their classmate Marcel Grossman's father intervened to get Albert a post at the Patent Office in Bern. He started work in June 1902. In October, before dying, his father granted him his permission to marry. Albert and Mileva married on 6 January 1903. Albert worked 8 hours a day, 6 days a week at the Patent Office while Mileva assumed the domestic tasks. In the evenings, they worked together, sometimes late in the night. Both mentioned this to friends, he to Hans Wohlwend, she to Helene Savić on 20 March 1903 where she expressed how sorry she was to see Albert working so hard at the office. On 14 May 1904, their son Hans-Albert was born.

Despite this, 1905 is now known as Albert's “miracle year”: he published five articles: one on the photoelectric effect (which led to the 1921 Nobel Prize), two on Brownian motion, one on special relativity and the famous E = mc2. He also commented on 21 scientific papers for a fee and submitted his thesis on the dimensions of molecules. Much later, Albert told R. S. Shankland(6) that relativity had been his life for seven years and the photoelectric effect, for five years. Peter Michelmore, one of his biographers(7), wrote that after having spent five weeks to complete the article containing the basis of special relativity, Albert “went to bed for two weeks. Mileva checked the article again and again, and then mailed it”. Exhausted, the couple made the first of three visits to Serbia where they met numerous relatives and friends, whose testimonies provide a wealth of information on how Albert and Mileva collaborated.

Mileva's brother, Miloš Jr, a person known for his integrity, stayed on several occasions with the Einstein family while studying medicine in Paris. Krstić(2) wrote: “[Miloš] described how during the evenings and at night, when silence fell upon the town, the young married couple would sit together at the table and at the light of a kerosene lantern, they would work together on physics problems. Miloš Jr. spoke of how they calculated, wrote, read and debated.” Krstić heard this directly from relatives of Mileva, Sidonija Gajin and Sofija Galić Golubović.

Zarko Marić, a cousin of Mileva's father, lived in the countryside property where the Einsteins stayed during their visit. He told Krstić how Mileva calculated, wrote and worked with Albert. The couple often sat in the garden to discuss physics. Harmony and mutual respect prevailed.

Gajin and Zarko Marić also reported hearing from Mileva's father that during the Einstein's visit to Novi Sad in 1905, Mileva confided to him: “Before our departure, we finished an important scientific work which will make my husband known around the world.” Krstić got this same information in 1961 from Mileva's cousin, Sofija Galić Golubović, who was present when Mileva said it to her father.

Desanka Trbuhović-Gjurić published Mileva's first biography in Serbian in 1969(3). It later appeared in German and French. She described how Mileva's brother often hosted gatherings of young intellectuals at his place. During one of these evenings, Albert would have declared: “I need my wife. She solves for me all my mathematical problems,” something Mileva is said to have confirmed.

In 1908, the couple constructed with Conrad Habicht an ultra-sensitive voltmeter. Trbuhović-Gjurić attributes this experimental work to Mileva and Conrad, and wrote: “When they were both satisfied, they left to Albert the task of describing the apparatus, since he was a patent expert.” It was registered under the Einstein-Habicht patent. When Habicht questioned Mileva's choice not to include her name, she replied making a pun in German: “Warum? Wir beide sind nur ein Stein.“ (“Why? The two of us are but one stone”, meaning, we are one entity).

The first recognition came in 1908. Albert gave unpaid lectures in Bern, then was offered his first academic position in Zurich in 1909. Mileva was still assisting him. Eight pages of Albert's first lecture notes are in her handwriting. So is a letter drafted in 1910 in reply to Max Planck who had sought Albert's opinion. Both documents are kept in the Albert Einstein Archives (AEA) in Jerusalem. On 3 September 1909, Mileva confided to Helene Savić: “He is now regarded as the best of the German-speaking physicists, and they give him a lot of honours. I am very happy for his success, because he fully deserves it; I only hope and wish that fame does not have a harmful effect on his humanity.” Later, she added: “With all this fame, he has little time for his wife. […] What is there to say, with notoriety, one gets the pearl, the other the shell.”

Their second son, Eduard, was born on 28 July 1910. Up to 1911, Albert still sent affectionate postcards to Mileva. But in 1912, he started an affair with his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal while visiting his family who had moved to Berlin. They maintained a secret correspondence over two years. Elsa kept 21 of his letters, now in the Collected Papers of Albert Einstein. During this period, Albert held various faculty positions first in Prague, back in Zurich and finally in Berlin in 1914 to be closer to Elsa.

This caused their marriage's collapse. Mileva moved back to Zurich with her two sons on 29 July 1914. In 1919, she agreed to divorce, with a clause stating that if Albert ever received the Nobel Prize, she would get the money. When she did, she bought two small apartment buildings and lived poorly from their income. Her son, Eduard stayed frequently in a sanatorium. He later developed schizophrenia and was eventually internalised. Due to these medical expenses, Mileva struggled financially all her life and eventually lost both buildings. She survived by giving private lessons and on the alimony Albert sent, albeit irregularly.

In 1925, Albert wrote in his will that the Nobel Prize money was his sons' inheritance. Mileva strongly objected, stating the money was hers and considered revealing her contributions to his work. Radmila Milentijević quotes from a letter Albert sent her on 24 October 1925 (AEA 75-364). ”You made me laugh when you started threatening me with your recollections. Have you ever considered, even just for a second, that nobody would ever pay attention to your says if the man you talked about had not accomplished something important. When someone is completely insignificant, there is nothing else to say to this person but to remain modest and silent. This is what I advise you to do.”

Mileva remained silent but her friend Milana Bota told a Serbian newspaper in 1929 that they should talk to Mileva to find out about the genesis of special relativity, since she was directly involved. On 13 June 1929, Mileva wrote to Helene Savić: ”Such publications in newspapers do not suit my nature at all, but I believe that all that was for Milana's joy, and that she probably thought that this would also be a joy for me, as I can only suppose that she wanted to help me receive some public rights with regard to Einstein. She has written to me in that way, and I let it be accepted that way, for otherwise the whole thing would be nonsense.”

According to Krstić(2), Mileva spoke of her contributions to her mother and sister. She also wrote to her godparents explaining how she had always collaborated with Albert and how he had ruined her life, but asked them to destroy the letter. Her son, Hans-Albert, told Krstić(2) how his parents' “scientific collaboration continued into their marriage, and that he remembered seeing [them] work together in the evenings at the same table.” Hans-Albert's first wife, Frieda, tried to publish the letters Mileva and Albert had sent to their sons but was blocked in court by the Einstein's Estate Executors, Helen Dukas and Otto Nathan in an attempt to preserve the “Einstein's myth”. They prevented other publications, including one from Krstić(2) on his early findings in 1974. Krstić mentions that Nathan even “visited” Mileva's apartment after her death in 1948. On July 1947, Albert wrote to Dr Karl Zürcher, his divorce lawyer: “When Mileva will no longer be there, I'll be able to die in peace.”

Their letters and the numerous testimonies show that Mileva Marić and Albert Einstein collaborated closely from their school days up to 1914. Albert referred to it repeatedly in his letters, like when he wrote: « our work on relative motion”. Their union was based on love and mutual respect, which allowed them together to produce such uncommon work. She was the first person to recognize his talent. Without her, he would never have succeeded. She abandoned her own aspirations, happy to work with him and contribute to his success, feeling they were one unique entity. Once started, the process of signing their work under his unique name became impossible to reverse. She probably agreed to it since her own happiness depended on his success. Why did Mileva remain silent? Being reserved and self-effaced, she did not seek honors or public attention. And as is always the case in close collaborations, the individual contributions are nearly impossible to disentangle.

In the history of studying the proliferation of humanity across the globe, there has long been one question that has stumped researchers: How did the islands of Southeast Asia (ISEA) become so well-inhabited so long ago? 

It probably required technological seafaring advancements beyond what was considered likely during the Paleolithic era. But those experts may have a surprising new answer thanks to research that shows the ancient people of the Philippines and ISEA may have mastered seafaring well before anyone else. 

The pivotal archaeological evidence comes in the form of stone tools excavated at sites in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste, showing strong evidence that as far back as 40,000 years ago, there was a technological sophistication from these ancient seafarers that rivals much later civilizations. In a study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, researchers from Ateneo de Manila University challenge the accepted belief that Paleolithic technical progress was centered in Africa and Europe. 

Proving seafaring history represents a tricky endeavor, since organic wood and fiber that would have likely been used in constructing Paleolithic seacraft rarely survive in the archaeological record. These stone tools offer a new way in. The most recent discovery, according to the study, shows traces of plant processing that features the “extraction of fibers necessary for making ropes, nets, and bindings essential for boatbuilding and open-sea fishing.”

Add in the discovery of fishing hooks, gorges, net weights, and the remains of deep-ocean fish such as tuna and sharks, and these archeological sites are a rich exploration of what is obviously a robust seafaring culture. 

“The remains of large predatory pelagic fish at these sites indicate the capacity for advanced seafaring and knowledge of the seasonality and migration routes of those fish species,” the study authors wrote. The collection of fish and tool remains “indicates the need for strong and well-crafted cordage for ropes and fishing lines to catch the marine fauna.” 

As the archaeological finds point toward a sophisticated method of deep-ocean fishing, the study authors believe the ancient seafarers constructed boats from organic materials and held them together with plant-based ropes. That same rope technology was then adapted for the actual fishing. 

While widely accepted that the presence of fossils and artifacts across a range of islands provides evidence that early modern humans moved across the open sea, the study's authors fight against the prevailing theory that the prehistoric migrations were passive sea drifters on bamboo rafts. Rather, they posit that the movement came from highly skilled navigators equipped with the knowledge and technology to travel to remote locations over deep waters. 

“The identification of boat-building materials through direct or indirect evidence is vital in understanding movements across and within island environments,” the authors wrote in the study. 

“The presence of such advanced maritime technology in prehistoric ISEA highlights the ingenuity of early Philippine peoples and their neighbors,” the authors said in a statement from the university, “whose boat-building knowledge likely made the region a center for technological innovations tens of thousands of years ago and laid the foundations for the maritime traditions that still thrive in the region today.”

The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor drug dapagliflozin, widely used to treat type 2 diabetes, also shows improvements for patients with progressive liver disease, finds a clinical trial from China published on June 4 by The BMJ.

The results show that treatment with dapagliflozin improved metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) -- a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver, leading to inflammation -- and liver fibrosis (a build up of scar tissue) compared with placebo.

MASH affects more than 5% of adults, more than 30% of individuals with diabetes or obesity, and can progress to cirrhosis in up to 25% of individuals.

Several studies have reported that SGLT-2 inhibitors can improve liver fat content, liver enzymes, and liver stiffness, but no trial has been carried out among patients with MASH.

To address this, researchers enrolled 154 adults (average age 35; 85% men) diagnosed with MASH after a liver biopsy at six medical centers in China from November 2018 to March 2023.

Almost half (45%) had type 2 diabetes, and almost all had liver fibrosis (33% stage 1, 45% stage 2, 19% stage 3).

After an initial screening biopsy, participants were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg of dapagliflozin or matching placebo once daily for 48 weeks and attended health education sessions twice a year.

Various factors including body weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, liver enzymes, physical activity, diet, insulin, and lipids were also assessed at enrollment and throughout the trial.

MASH improvement was defined as a decrease of at least 2 points in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) or a NAS of 3 points or less.

After an end of study biopsy at week 48, 53% (41 of 78) participants in the dapagliflozin group showed improvement in MASH without worsening of fibrosis (defined as no increase in fibrosis stage) compared with 30% (23 of 76) in the placebo group.

Resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis occurred in 23% (18 of 78) participants in the dapagliflozin group compared with 8% (6 of 76) in the placebo group.

Fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH was also reported in 45% (35 of 78) participants in the dapagliflozin group compared with 20% (15 of 76) in the placebo group.

The percentage of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 1% (1 of 78) in the dapagliflozin group and 3% (2 of 76) in the placebo group.

The researchers acknowledge that the trial was conducted in a Chinese population, which limits its broader generalizability, and that female and older patients were under-represented. But they point out that results were consistent after further analyses, suggesting they are robust.

As such, they conclude: ""Our findings indicate that dapagliflozin may affect key aspects of MASH by improving both steatohepatitis and fibrosis."" Large scale and long term trials are needed to further confirm these effects, they add.

The coming years are expected to be particularly exciting in the field of pharmacological treatment for MASH, say researchers from Argentina in a linked editorial.

As more drugs become available, therapeutic decisions will likely become increasingly tailored to individual patient profiles, they write. ""Ideally, such treatments should provide cardiovascular benefit, have an established safety profile, and be accessible to broad and diverse patient populations,"" they conclude.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists uncover 230 giant ocean viruses that hijack photosynthesis","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250606193228.htm","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:12:14 GMT","

Giant viruses play a role in the survival of single-celled marine organisms called protists. These include algae, amoeba, and flagellates, that form the base of ocean food webs. And since these protists form an important part of the food chain, these large DNA viruses are often responsible for various public health hazards, including harmful algal blooms.

A new study from scientists at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science may help unravel the many types of viruses present in our waterways and oceans. This knowledge could help local leaders better prepare for when a harmful algal bloom may be impacting their coastline or if any other viruses are present in local bays, rivers or lakes.

Using high-performance computing methods, researchers identified 230 novel giant viruses in publicly available marine metagenomic datasets and characterized their functions.

Published in the journal Nature npj Viruses, their findings include the discovery of new giant virus genomes previously unknown in literature. Within these genomes, 530 new functional proteins were characterized, including nine proteins involved in photosynthesis. This indicates that these viruses may be able to manipulate their host and the photosynthesis process during infection.

""By better understanding the diversity and role of giant viruses in the ocean and how they interact with algae and other ocean microbes, we can predict and possibly manage harmful algal blooms, which are human health hazards in Florida as well as all over the world,"" said Mohammad Moniruzzaman, a co-author of the study and an assistant professor in the Department of Marine Biology and Ecology. ""Giant viruses are often the main cause of death for many phytoplankton, which serve as the base of the food web supporting ocean ecosystems and food sources. The novel functions found in giant viruses could have biotechnological potential, as some of these functions might represent novel enzymes.""

Until recently, giant viruses were largely undetected by scientific methods due to limitations in bioinformatic pipelines. The researchers created an innovative tool called BEREN (Bioinformatic tool for Eukaryotic virus Recovery from Environmental metageNomes), designed to identify giant virus genomes within extensive public DNA sequencing datasets.

""We discovered that giant viruses possess genes involved in cellular functions such as carbon metabolism and photosynthesis -- traditionally found only in cellular organisms, said Benjamin Minch, the lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the Department of Marine Biology and Ecology at the Rosenstiel School. ""This suggests that giant viruses play an outsized role in manipulating their host's metabolism during infection and influencing marine biogeochemistry.""

The authors used the University of Miami's Pegasus supercomputer at the Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC) to process and assemble large metagenomes -- often exceeding a gigabase per library -- enabling the reconstruction of hundreds of microbial community libraries.

""This study allowed us to create a framework to improve existing tools for detecting novel viruses that could aid in our ability to monitor pollution and pathogens in our waterways."" Minch added.

The research team downloaded DNA sequencing data from nine large global ocean sampling projects spanning from pole to pole. Using BEREN, they recovered giant virus genomes from the data. The genomes were then annotated using publicly available gene function databases to characterize the functions encoded by these viruses. These genomes were compared to all currently available giant virus representatives to identify novel functions.

The BEREN program used to facilitate this research fills a gap in the research field by providing an easy-to-use, one-stop tool for identifying and classifying giant viruses in sequencing datasets. BEREN is available for anyone to use and can be download at: https://gitlab.com/benminch1/BEREN

The study titled, ""Expansion of the genomic and functional diversity of global ocean giant viruses,"" was published on April 21, 2025 in the journal Nature npj Viruses. The authors are Benjamin Minch and Mohammad Moniruzzaman from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science.

Habitat loss, diseases, pollution, and climate change are already massively affecting amphibians - frogs, salamanders, and the caecilians native to tropical regions. The new study from the Institute for Ecology, Evolution and Diversity shows that extreme weather events serve as an additional stress factor, further intensifying this crisis. For this purpose, the scientists analyzed global weather data from the past 40 years. They compared regions with significantly increased heat waves, droughts, and cold spells with the geographical distribution of more than 7,000 amphibian species and their threat status on the ""Red List."" The Red Lists are being published since 1964 by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and are considered an important tool for assessing the threat status of animal, plant, and fungal species worldwide.

Critical Interaction of Various Factors

The results are clear: where heat waves and droughts have increased, the threat status of amphibians on the Red List has also significantly deteriorated since 2004. ""Amphibians' dependence on temporary wetlands for breeding makes them particularly vulnerable to droughts and temperature shifts that causes their breeding grounds to dry prematurely,"" explains Dr. Evan Twomey, lead author of the study. ""Our analyses show the direct connection between the increase in extreme weather events and the decline of amphibian populations.""

Regional Focus Areas

Three regions are particularly affected: Europe, the Amazon region, and Madagascar. While in South America the majority of amphibians found there - mostly frogs - are exposed to increasing heat waves, in Europe it is primarily droughts that are causing problems for the animals. Here, it is mainly salamanders that suffer under the changed conditions. The situation in Central Europe gives cause for concern. Future climate projections show that drought periods in Central Europe will likely increase in both duration and intensity. Prof. Lisa Schulte, head of the Department of Wildlife-/Zoo-Animal-Biology and Systematics warns: ""Already half of the true salamanders native to Central Europe are exposed to increasing droughts today -- and this will likely get worse in the future.""

Urgent Need for Action

The study results highlight the urgency of targeted conservation measures. Various approaches from amphibian research could help threatened species. These include, for example, the creation of small protected areas where amphibians can find refuge, as well as the improvement of wetlands to ensure optimal living conditions. Creating moist retreat sites, such as using pipes or boards, also provides these animals with opportunities to withdraw during dry periods.

The study provides important foundations for adapted conservation strategies in the particularly affected regions. Amphibians are considered indicators of ecosystem health - their protection is therefore of paramount importance for preserving biodiversity.

Within the animal kingdom, a naturally produced molecule known as itaconate serves a prominent role in the immune system as a defensive agent against viruses and inflammation. Itaconate is classified as a metabolite, a natural compound that arises when organisms convert food into energy.

While itaconate is well known in animals, its presence and functions in plants has been largely unexplored. Biologists at the University of California San Diego have now undertaken the first comprehensive exploration of itaconate's functions in plants. Researchers at the School of Biological Sciences, working with colleagues at Stanford University, Peking University, Carnegie Institute of Science and Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, used chemical imaging and measurement techniques to not only prove that itaconate exists in plants, but to reveal its significant role in stimulating plant growth.

""We found that itaconate is made in plants, particularly in growing cells,"" said study senior author Jazz Dickinson, an assistant professor in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology. ""Watering maize (corn) plants with itaconate made seedlings grow taller, which was exciting and encouraged us to investigate this metabolite further and understand how it interacts with plant proteins.""

The results of the study, which was supported in part by funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, were published June 6, 2025, in the journal Science Advances.

Dickinson's lab focuses on plant development, including research on processes related to root systems.

Using mass spectrometry, an imaging technique that reveals the chemical makeup of subjects by identifying individual molecules and compounds, the researchers confirmed that plants produce itaconate. Working with animal biochemists who specialize in itaconate, they described how itaconate interacts with plant-specific proteins in Arabidopsis, a member of the mustard family.

Further investigating these dynamics, the researchers found that itaconate plays multiple key roles in plant physiology. These include involvement in several critical plant processes, such as primary metabolism and oxygen-related stress response.

Optimizing the natural benefits of itaconate -- instead of synthetically derived chemicals -- could be crucial for safely maximizing crop growth to support growing global populations.

""This discovery could lead to nature-inspired solutions to improve the growth of crops, like corn,"" said Dickinson. ""We also hope that developing a better understanding of the connections between plant and animal biology will reveal new insights that can help both plant and human health.""

Since humans also make and use itaconate, the new study could offer fresh information for understanding the molecule's role in human development and growth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists built a transistor that could leave silicon in the dust","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250606231252.htm","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 03:32:34 GMT","

Hailed as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century, transistors are integral components of modern electronics that amplify or switch electrical signals. As electronics become smaller, it is becoming increasingly difficult to continue scaling down silicon-based transistors. Has the development of our electronics hit a wall?

Now, a research team led by the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, has sought a solution. As detailed in their new paper, to be issued in 2025 Symposium on VLSI Technology and Circuits , the team ditched the silicon and instead opted to create a transistor made from gallium-doped indium oxide (InGaOx). This material can be structured as a crystalline oxide, whose orderly, crystal lattice is well suited for electron mobility.

""We also wanted our crystalline oxide transistor to feature a 'gate-all-around' structure, whereby the gate, which turns the current on or off, surrounds the channel where the current flows,"" explains Anlan Chen, lead author of the study. ""By wrapping the gate entirely around the channel, we can enhance efficiency and scalability compared with traditional gates.""

With these goals in mind, the team got to work. The researchers knew that they would need to introduce impurities to the indium oxide by 'doping' it with gallium. This would make the material react with electricity in a more favorable way.

""Indium oxide contains oxygen-vacancy defects, which facilitate carrier scattering and thus lower device stability,"" says Masaharu Kobayashi, senior author. ""We doped indium oxide with gallium to suppress oxygen vacancies and in turn improve transistor reliability.""

The team used atomic-layer deposition to coat the channel region of a gate-all-around transistor with a thin film of InGaOx, one atomic layer at a time. After deposition, the film was heated to transform it into the crystalline structure needed for electron mobility. This process ultimately enabled the fabrication of a gate-all-around 'metal oxide-based field-effect transistor' (MOSFET).

""Our gate-all-around MOSFET, containing a gallium-doped indium oxide layer, achieves high mobility of 44.5 cm2/Vs,"" explains Dr Chen. ""Crucially, the device demonstrates promising reliability by operating stably under applied stress for nearly three hours. In fact, our MOSFET outperformed similar devices that have previously been reported.""

The efforts shown by the team have provided the field with a new transistor design that considers the importance of both materials and structure. The research is a step towards the development of reliable, high-density electronic components suited for applications with high computational demand, such as big data and artificial intelligence. These tiny transistors promise to help next-gen technology run smoothly, making a big difference to our everyday lives.

The article ""A Gate-All-Around Nanosheet Oxide Semiconductor Transistor by Selective Crystallization of InGaOx for Performance and Reliability Enhancement"" was issued in 2025 Symposium on VLSI Technology and Circuits.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Largest-ever map of the universe reveals 10x more early galaxies than expected","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250607021148.htm","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 08:26:34 GMT","

In the name of open science, the multinational scientific collaboration COSMOS on Thursday released the data behind the largest map of the universe. Called the COSMOS-Web field, the project, built with data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), consists of all the imaging and a catalog of nearly 800,000 galaxies spanning nearly all of cosmic time. And it's been challenging existing notions of the infant universe.

""Our goal was to construct this deep field of space on a physical scale that far exceeded anything that had been done before,"" said UC Santa Barbara physics professor Caitlin Casey, who co-leads the COSMOS-Web collaboration alongside Jeyhan Kartaltepe of the Rochester Institute of Technology. ""If you had a printout of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field on a standard piece of paper,"" she said, referring to the iconic view of nearly 10,000 galaxies released by NASA in 2004, ""our image would be slightly larger than a 13-foot by 13-foot-wide mural, at the same depth. So it's really strikingly large.""

The COSMOS-Web composite image reaches back about 13.5 billion years; according to NASA, the universe is about 13.8 billion years old, give or take one hundred million years. That covers about 98% of all cosmic time. The objective for the researchers was not just to see some of the most interesting galaxies at the beginning of time but also to see the wider view of cosmic environments that existed during the early universe, during the formation of the first stars, galaxies and black holes.

""The cosmos is organized in dense regions and voids,"" Casey explained. ""And we wanted to go beyond finding the most distant galaxies; we wanted to get that broader context of where they lived.""

A 'big surprise'

And what a cosmic neighborhood it turned out to be. Before JWST turned on, Casey said, she and fellow astronomers made their best predictions about how many more galaxies the space telescope would be able to see, given its 6.5 meter (21 foot) diameter light-collecting primary mirror, about six times larger than Hubble's 2.4 meter (7 foot, 10 in) diameter mirror. The best measurements from Hubble suggested that galaxies within the first 500 million years would be incredibly rare, she said.

""It makes sense -- the Big Bang happens and things take time to gravitationally collapse and form, and for stars to turn on. There's a timescale associated with that,"" Casey explained. ""And the big surprise is that with JWST, we see roughly 10 times more galaxies than expected at these incredible distances. We're also seeing supermassive black holes that are not even visible with Hubble."" And they're not just seeing more, they're seeing different types of galaxies and black holes, she added.

'Lots of unanswered questions'

While the COSMOS-Web images and catalog answer many questions astronomers have had about the early universe, they also spark more questions.

""Since the telescope turned on we've been wondering 'Are these JWST datasets breaking the cosmological model? Because the universe was producing too much light too early; it had only about 400 million years to form something like a billion solar masses of stars. We just do not know how to make that happen,"" Casey said. ""So, lots of details to unpack, and lots of unanswered questions.""

In releasing the data to the public, the hope is that other astronomers from all over the world will use it to, among other things, further refine our understanding of how the early universe was populated and how everything evolved to the present day. The dataset may also provide clues to other outstanding mysteries of the cosmos, such as dark matter and physics of the early universe that may be different from what we know today.

""A big part of this project is the democratization of science and making tools and data from the best telescopes accessible to the broader community,"" Casey said. The data was made public almost immediately after it was gathered, but only in its raw form, useful only to those with the specialized technical knowledge and the supercomputer access to process and interpret it. The COSMOS collaboration has worked tirelessly for the past two years to convert raw data into broadly usable images and catalogs. In creating these products and releasing them, the researchers hope that even undergraduate astronomers could dig into the material and learn something new.

""Because the best science is really done when everyone thinks about the same data set differently,"" Casey said. ""It's not just for one group of people to figure out the mysteries.""

For the COSMOS collaboration, the exploration continues. They've headed back to the deep field to further map and study it.

""We have more data collection coming up,"" she said. ""We think we have identified the earliest galaxies in the image, but we need to verify that."" To do so, they'll be using spectroscopy, which breaks up light from galaxies into a prism, to confirm the distance of these sources (more distant = older). ""As a byproduct,"" Casey added, ""we'll get to understand the interstellar chemistry in these systems through tracing nitrogen, carbon and oxygen. There's a lot left to learn and we're just beginning to scratch the surface.""

The COSMOS-Web image is available to browse interactively; the accompanying scientific papers have been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal and Astronomy & Astrophysics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This “robot bird” flies at 45 mph through forests—With no GPS or light","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250607103103.htm","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 15:07:05 GMT","

Unlike birds, which navigate unknown environments with remarkable speed and agility, drones typically rely on external guidance or pre-mapped routes. However, a groundbreaking development by Professor Fu Zhang and researchers from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Faculty of Engineering at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), has enabled drones and micro air vehicles (MAVs) to emulate the flight capabilities of birds more closely than ever before.

The team has developed the Safety-Assured High-Speed Aerial Robot (SUPER), capable of flying at speeds exceeding 20 meters per second and avoiding obstacles as thin as 2.5 millimeters - such as power lines or twigs - using solely on onboard sensors and computing power. With a compact design featuring a wheelbase of just 280 mm and a takeoff weight of 1.5 kg, SUPER demonstrates exceptional agility, navigating dense forests at night and skillfully avoiding thin wires.

Professor Zhang describes this invention as a game-changer in the field of drone technology, ""Picture a 'Robot Bird' swiftly maneuvering through the forest, effortlessly dodging branches and obstacles at high speeds. This is a significant step forward in autonomous flight technology. Our system allows MAVs to navigate complex environments at high speeds with a level of safety previously unattainable. It's like giving the drone the reflexes of a bird, enabling it to dodge obstacles in real-time while racing toward its goal.""

The breakthrough lies in the sophisticated integration of hardware and software. SUPER utilizes a lightweight 3D light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor capable of detecting obstacles up to 70 meters away with pinpoint accuracy. This is paired with an advanced planning framework that generates two trajectories during flight: one that optimizing speed by venturing into unknown spaces and another prioritizing safety by remaining within known, obstacle-free zones.

By processing LIDAR data directly as point clouds, the system significantly reduces computation time, enabling rapid decision-making even at high velocities. The technology has been tested in various real-life applications, such as the autonomous exploration of ancient sites, and has demonstrated seamless navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments.

""The ability to avoid thin obstacles and navigate tight spaces opens up new possibilities for applications like search and rescue, where every second counts. SUPER's robustness in various lighting conditions, including nighttime, makes it a reliable tool for round-the-clock operations."" said Mr Yunfan Ren, the lead author of the research paper.

The research team envisions a wide range of applications for this innovative technology, including autonomous delivery, power line inspection, forest monitoring, autonomous exploration, and mapping. In search and rescue missions, MAVs equipped with SUPER technology could swiftly navigate disaster zones - such as collapsed buildings or dense forests - day and night, locating survivors or assessing hazards more efficiently than current drones. Moreover, in disaster relief scenarios, they could deliver crucial supplies to remote and inaccessible areas.

Picking the best backpacking tent is in-tents. It's arguably the most important piece of backpacking gear you'll buy. You want a shelter that's strikes the right balance between weather protection, living space, durability, and weight.

To help you find the best backcountry shelters for every trip, whether you're thru-hiking or just out for the weekend, we've spent years (collectively) living out of dozens of tents in all kinds of inclement weather, from the rain-soaked Pacific Northwest, to the high alpine mountains of Colorado, to frigid Wisconsin winters. We've tested tents from big brands like REI Co-Op, Nemo, and Big Agnes, as well as smaller companies like Hilleberg, Gossamer Gear, and Six Moon Designs. These are the best tents we've found.

Once you've got your tent sorted, I recommend finding the perfect backpacking sleeping pad, a great sleeping bag, and some merino base layers to round out your backcountry sleep system. Need a car camping tent? We've got a guide to the best camping tents too.

Tent Vocabulary

Shopping for tents you'll quickly find yourself immersed in a world of unfamiliar terms, trying to decipher what it means that a DFC pyramid has a welded bathtub floor. Here's our guide to the terms you need to understand.

Single/Double Walled: A double walled tent is the most common, consisting of an inner tent (wall 1) and a rainfly (wall 2) between you and the elements. A single walled tent is, um, a single wall. The advantage of a single-walled tent is that it's lighter. The advantage of a double walled tent is that condensation (usually) escapes to the outer wall and doesn't drip on you while you're sleeping. We recommend both types.

Freestanding: Does the tent stand up by itself or do you have to stake it out? If it stands up on its own through pole tension, it's a freestanding tent. If it doesn't, it's not. There are also some hybrid designs, often referred to as semi-freestanding, where you just have to stake out one end.

When I started this guide, I was firmly in the freestanding camp. Freestanding tents seemed easier to deal with, and in some ways they are. Most camping tents these days are freestanding. After testing dozens of non-freestanding tents through, I realized freestanding wasn't as big of an advantage as I thought. All non-freestanding means is that you'll have to stake out your tent when you're pitching it. If you're expecting wind or rain you'll want to do that anyway, even if your tent is “freestanding.” The biggest downside to non-freestanding or semi-freestanding tents is that you can't easily move them once they're set up.

Vestibule: In a double-walled tent, the rainfly is usually staked out away from the door of the inner tent. That leaves a space that is not in the tent but is still protected from the rain and elements. The vestibule is a good place for stashing wet gear and cooking when it's raining, and it helps make an otherwise small tent feel much larger. Generally speaking, the bigger the vestibule, the better.

DCF/Cuben Fiber: Dyneema Composite Fiber (DCF) is also known as Cuben fiber. Both are industry terms for tents made of Dyneema, which is a very strong, very light fabric. It's also very expensive and can be annoyingly crinkly, but when it come to going as light as possible, DCF is difficult to top. For a full breakdown of all the materials used in tents, see Tent Materials below.

Peak Height: How tall the tent is at its highest point. Depending on the shape of the tent, this may or may not be helpful, but it can indicate how much headroom to you have in the tent. In single pole tents though, the peak height is typically high but slopes off quickly, meaning you don't have as much headroom as this number might back you think.

Doors: Two-person and larger tents need two doors. Climbing over your hiking partner in the middle of the night isn't fun for anyone. Pretty much every two-person and larger tent I've tested lately has had two doors, but some also have a second full size vestibule, which is nice.

What to Look For in a Tent

A tent needs to be big enough for you (and a hiking partner if you have one) and all the gear you're bringing. Ideally it'll have enough room, solid protection from the elements, while remaining lightweight. Here are some of the things to keep in mind when shopping for a backpacking tent.

Floor Space: Not all two-person tents actually fit two people and all their gear; same with every other size tent. The thing to look at when comparing is the total floor space and the layout of that space. You want enough room for the tent to be livable should you be pinned down by bad weather. Pay special attention to which sleeping pads will fit the interior space, especially if you plan to use some of the newer, extra-cushy, extra-wide sleeping pads. Also be sure to look for tent floors that are heavier denier than the sides, as the floor is what will take most of the wear and tear.

Vestibule Space: The more, the better. Years of tent testing has taught me that the bigger the vestibule, the better the tent will be.

Packability: Your tent is probably the biggest piece of gear in your pack (unless you're carrying a bear canister). Make sure you have room. Bigger tents (3P and up) often benefit from a compression stuff sack, which helps get them down to more manageable size. I also sometimes pack tent and rainfly separately when carrying a larger tent, which makes them easier to arrange inside your pack.

Weight: A lightweight tent means less weight on your back. This is especially important for long-distance hikers, though we'd all love to carry less.

Seasons: Most of our picks below are three-season tents, which means they're good for late spring, summer, and early fall camping. They aren't the best for snow though. We do have a couple four-season picks and we'll be testing some more mountaineering tents down the road. A four-season tent isn't going to keep you any warmer, but a full length rainfly that comes all the way to the ground will stop the wind and snow from getting inside.

Zippers: The heavier, the better. A lot of ultralight tents these days are moving to #3 zippers, which are indeed lighter, but at the expense of robustness. When it comes to zipping up my shelter, I like to err on the side of durability.

Tent Materials

Backpacking tents are generally made of three main fabrics: silicone-coated nylon, (silnylon), silicone-coated polyester (silpoly), and Dyneema or Dyneema composite fabric (DCF), also known as Cuben fiber.

Dyneema tents are generally a little lighter, definitely stronger, and popular for ultralight backpacking because of the weight savings. Unfortunately, DCF is also very expensive. In my testing, they're very loud in the wind, and the packed size is larger than a nylon or polyester tent. If you have the money, these are the lightest, toughest tents on the market.

Comparing silicone-coated polyester and nylon is not the apples-to-apples comparison it might seem like it would be. The problem is there are many factors that affect the final product beyond just the fabric. Variables like the exact fiber type used, the way the fiber is woven, the thread count, the denier rating, the coating thickness, and more all play a role that make it impossible to say nylon is better than polyester, or the opposite.

Proponents of polyester argue that nylon absorbs more water, which then makes it stretch and sag more than polyester. This is true, but I have a silnylon tent (the Hilleberg Akto) and have had no problem with sagging even in multiday rains. (If you do get some sagging, retensioning your guylines usually fixes the issue.) On the other hand, polyester often “mists” or leaks more easily than nylon, and it's not as durable. Those things are both true, but I also have a silpoly tent (an older MSR Elixir), and it's proved plenty durable; I haven't had any issues with misting. I happen to think both fabrics are fine. None of the tents we recommend below, whether silnylon or silpoly, have had any of these issues in our testing.

Packaged Weight vs. Trail Weight

Why two weights? Who knows, but there's an easy solution: Ignore the trail weight.

The longer answer is that manufacturers want their tents to seem as light as possible so they came up with “trail weight,” which usually means the weight of just the tent, poles, and rainfly. But you need stakes, stuff sacks, and guylines too, and these things add to the weight. Trail weight doesn't match what you'll be putting on your back. That said, if you already have your stakes and guylines dialed in, and just want to know how much a new tent weighs, trail weight can be useful.

All of the weights in the guide below ignore any published weights and are what I got weighing each tent on my scale.

Big Agnes

Amazon (2-Person)

REI (2-Person)

The Big Agnes Copper Spur tents are high quality, lightweight, and well designed. I've tested the two-person and person-person models over the years, and Big Agnes has continually refined the design to the point that I have nothing left to complain about. At 2.99 pounds for the three-person model, this is one of the lightest freestanding tents on the market.

It's lightweight, easy to set up, and stable even in strong winds. The Copper Spur is also very livable, with steep sidewalls to maximize interior space. Mesh pockets help with gear storage and give you a place to stick your headlamp for dispersed light. The ingenious “awning” design makes getting in and out a snap (provided you have trekking poles to set it up). All seams are taped with waterproof, solvent-free polyurethane tape. They're also durable despite their lightweight fabrics, standing up to years of abuse on the trail. I do recommend grabbing the footprint ($80), though, to help protect the floor. It also allows you to pitch the fly only, which is nice shelter on sunny days at the beach.

My only criticism is that these tents can be a tight squeeze. For a long trip where your partner isn't your significant other, you might want to go with the next size up. The three-person is a spacious, comfortable living space for two people with all their gear, and will still be lighter than many two-person tents.

REI

REI (2-person)

REI (3-person)

REI's Half Dome tent series has been a popular choice with backpackers for 45 years now. It's still one of the best backpacking tents you can buy, and we've toted it on many a backpacking trip. It's rugged, simple to set up, and offers generous living space for two with gear. The tent body is made of 75-denier ripstop nylon for durability at the base and floor, with 20-denier nylon mesh and 40-denier rainfly (all fabrics are bluesign approved). It also comes with a footprint, which is a rarity these days. The tent poles are aluminum and interchangeable, which makes it easy to set up and take down.

The mesh design, when coupled with the rainfly and good staking, will stand up to storms and not roast you when camping in the midsummer heat. The dual doors with dual vestibules ensure you aren't climbing over your partner in the middle of the night. I also like that the rainfly is symmetrical—there's no “front” and “back,” and the vestibules are identical—which makes setup easier. That said, the vestibules are on the small side. They're big enough for boots and an empty pack, but not much else.

The Half Dome isn't the lightest tent on this list, but with a packed weight just under 6 pounds, it's not too heavy when split between two people.

Hilleberg

Public Lands

Hilleberg

The Hilleberg Akto (10/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite tent—in 10 years of testing products, it's the only thing I've ever given a 10/10 rating. Made of Hilleberg's Kerlon 1200 fabric (a silnylon) it has stood up to rain, snow, high winds, and everything else I've encountered. It's a weather-proof fortress. It's not the roomiest one-person tent, especially the peak height, which is low, but that low wind profile is part of what makes it so storm-worthy. The Akto has a peak height of 36 inches. I am 5‘11”, and sitting on a Nemo Tensor Trail air mattress (about 3 inches thick), I am just able to sit up in the Akto without pressing my head into the roof.

The Akto's single-hoop design is different than most tents you've probably used. It's not freestanding. The design consists of a single curved pole in the middle of the tent. The ends are then pulled out from that center and staked down, creating a very strong structure, with six points pulling off a single central pole. The Akto pitches as a single unit, tent and rainfly attached (you can separate them, though, if you want). The rainfly is the main structural element of the tent. The pole passes through the rainfly and the guylines all attach to it as well. The inner tent hangs from the rainfly by clips and gets all it's structure and support from the rainfly.

The floor plan is a slightly five-sided rectangle. The back wall points out a few inches in the middle where the pole is, which gives you a bit of extra space along that side to stash some gear. Lengthwise, I had plenty of room, and neither my pillow nor the foot of my sleeping bag touched the tent walls. The vestibule is roomy too, and it can be unzipped from top or bottom to help with ventilation. I have had no more issues with condensation than in any other tent, thanks to the multiple ways to ventilate the Akto.

As much as I love this tent, especially for where I live in northern Wisconsin, it might be overkill for some. Hilleberg also make the Enan, which is very similar, but lighter, and worth considering if you don't need the four-season robustness of the Akto.

Big Agnes

REI (2-Person)

REI (3-Person)

The Big Agnes Copper Spur bikepacking tent is very nearly a clone of our top pick—lightweight, easy-setup, steep sidewalls, good living space for the weight—but the poles are shorter, making then easier to fit between drop handlebars, in panniers, or other spots on your bike. You get the same twin vestibules and doors, but there are a few other bike-friendly features, like helmet storage, and external webbing for hanging out wet clothes. And yes the awnings do still need poles, which is sort of nonsensical for a bike-specific tent, but that's about my only complaint here.

As with the regular Copper Spur, I would size up for longer journeys. For example, the two-person is fine for shorter trips without a ton a gear, but if you're doing the Baja Divide I'd go with the three-person model for two, the two-person model for solo trips.

Nemo Equipment

REI (2-Person)

REI (3-Person)

Nemo's Dagger Osmo three-person tent (8/10, WIRED Recommends) strikes the best balance between weight, weather-proofing, and living space among the three-person tents I've tested. It's roomier than the Copper Spur (4 sq. ft. bigger), and I've found that the nylon-polyester blend really does stretch less and repels water more than nylon alone, without misting as much as pure silpoly. The result is a sturdy tent that I've used without issue in snow, despite technically have a three-season rating.

The three-person model is 88 by 70 inches inside, for a total of 41 square feet of living space. I had no trouble getting three regular sleeping mats in it, and the length was enough to accommodate my 5'11"" height with about 4 inches to spare.

Nemo has updated the Dagger series for 2025, and I've spent two nights in the new version, enough to say that not much has changed, it's still a great tent. The new version is a few ounces lighter, but more importantly, the door is 4-inches higher, which makes getting in and out much easier. The max height at the center of the tent is now 44 inches, up from 42, and the sidewalls are slightly more vertical too, thanks to the revamped pole structure. Overall it just feels roomier than the previous model. I'll update this guide as I spend more time in the new Dagger and get it out in some more serious weather.

There are a lot of tents out there to choose from. Here are a few more we've tried and liked, but that didn't quite make our top picks.

The Lunar Solo (7/10, WIRED Review) is a fantastic value for the money. It's very light, packs down to a tiny ball, ventilates very well for a single-walled tent, and it's easy to pitch once you figure out how to do it. It does suffer from the condensations that any single wall tent will have, namely, you're going to be touching wet walls in humid conditions, but I found that the mesh walls, combined with the sliding vestibule and top vent made it pretty easy to keep condensation under control. This one was almost our top pick for best ultralight solo tent, but I do want to test the Durston X-Mid before I declare a top pick.

The MSR Freelite (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great ultralight, freestanding tent. It's semi-freestanding—you have to stake out the foot end—but I've found it very stable and great for shorter trips with family members. I also like the two-person version as a solo shelter for summer trips.

Sea and Summit's “three-plus season” tent is capable enough in almost any weather while staying crazy light—just 3 lbs., 5 oz. for the two-person model. Our tester used this tent on a five-day trip to Loon Lake in northern California in early October, a true “shoulder season” trip with daytime highs in the 80s, nighttime lows in the 40s, and overnight winds of up to 60 mph. The Telos Plus fared well, despite the wind. It's roomy enough with 27 sq. feet of interior space, and 9 sq. feet of vestibule around each door. We also like that the fly can be pitched separately and the pole bag turns into a glow stick when you stick your headlamp in it.

My suggestion for four-person trips is to split into two groups, each with a two-person tent. It just makes every tent more livable, and makes weight distribution easier. However, when my kids were little, there was no way two of them were sleeping in a tent in the woods without me, so I did once lug this tent into the backcountry. Despite the weight (just under 8 lbs), I do like it. It's roomy enough for four people with a good amount of gear inside as well. There's double vestibules with enough room to keep boots and other gear out of the weather, though cooking under the vestibule is cramped and tricky. On the whole though, this is one of the better hybrid front/backcountry tents available.

In the summer of 2025, we'll be testing the new MSR Hubba Hubba (which is no longer its trademark red and white, and is now called the Hubba Hubba LT), Nemo's revamped Dagger Osmo series, along with the one-person Nemo Hornet. Finally, we'll spend some more time with the ultralight favorite, the Durston X-Mid, a strong contender for best ultralight tent.

Bing has added a new AI-powered video generation tool to its mobile app, that's built on OpenAI's Sora text-to-video model. That's a feature that, even now, is exclusive to ChatGPT subscribers—but Bing users will get it for free.

The vertical video creations are 5 seconds long but aren't generated instantly—once you type in a prompt, you'll get a notification when the video is ready. The Standard generation speed is free, but you'll also be able to access the “Fast” option 10 times before you'll need to cough up 100 Microsoft Reward points to keep using it at that speed. You can share these videos anywhere, and they'll be stored in the Bing app for 90 days.

The video generation wars have been heating up over the last year. Google debuted its Veo 3 model at Google I/O in May, with significant upgrades to quality. Chinese phone brand Honor also recently partnered with Google to add a feature that converted still images in the Gallery app into 5-second video clips through Google's Veo 2 model. With the ability to now generate videos at our fingertips, it'll make it easier than ever to share exactly what you're envisioning to a friend or loved one, but it'll be even harder to distinguish what's real and what's not.

London-based Nothing took a year-long break from its top-end smartphone line after it debuted the Phone (2) in 2023. In that time, it created the Phone (2a) in 2024, which went on to be one of the company's best-selling handsets. There's already a successor for those budget phones—the Phone (3a) series—but now it's time for a new flagship from the brand. The company announced this week that it will unveil the Phone (3) at an event in London on July 1 at 1 pm ET.

This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

We have a few details so far. The phone may not have the Glyph light interface on the back anymore, though it seems like Nothing has cooked up a new dot matrix light pattern instead. The company says it'll be its first true flagship phone with premium materials, and it'll have a high price to boot: somewhere around £800.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

But the spotlight won't just be on a new phone. This week, Nothing also shared that it will be entering “a new product category"" at the event with its first-ever pair of headphones. Creatively dubbed Headphone (1), it'll be Nothing's first over-ears, but follows a long line of wireless earbuds. Not too long ago, Nothing announced a partnership with iconic audio brand KEF. Perhaps these headphones will be the pair's first collab.

Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event is also expected to take place in July, and rumors abound that we'll see the Galaxy Z Fold7, Galaxy Z Flip7, and even a Flip 7 FE—a cheaper version of the company's flip folding phone. But Samsung took time to tease something else: an Ultra variant of its folding phone. Or so we think.

In a blog post on Samsung Newsroom, the company vaguely talks about a folding device that can match the capabilities of its existing Ultra phones, like the Galaxy S25 Ultra. What remains unclear is if the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold7 will offer an Ultra-like experience with no compromises, or if there will indeed be a dedicated Ultra version of that phone. Until now, there have been trade-offs between the Fold phones and Samsung's Galaxy Ultra phones, with the latter offering a nicer camera experience, better battery life, and other perks like the stylus. Perhaps Samsung has found a way to replicate the true Ultra experience on its next generation of the Fold.

The company has a teaser video showing the silhouette of the Fold opening and closing. There have been rumors that Samsung is working on a tri-fold phone, like Huawei's version that nets you an even bigger screen when unfolded; you'd think if anything got the Ultra moniker, it'd be that device. We'll have to wait and see.

The Ruark MR1 have been some of the best sounding, most stylish desktop stereo speakers you can buy at their price for over a decade. Now in their third generation, they have been rebuilt from the ground up, with the aim of improving sound quality, refining the hand-crafted design and adding in some great new features to make them even more versatile than before. This includes adding aptX HD playback for higher quality Bluetooth sound, a USB audio connection for easy high-resolution playback and a moving magnet phono stage for powering a turntable. The petite package is available now, and costs $579/£399. —Verity Burns

Adobe has finally released Photoshop for Android. No, this isn't Photoshop Express or Photoshop Touch—previous, largely failed attempts at bringing Photoshop to mobile. Photoshop for Android mirrors the version of Photoshop for iPhone released earlier this year. You can download the public beta for Android today.

The mobile app has nearly everything you'll find in Adobe's desktop version, including layer-based editing and tools like masks, clone stamp, intelligent selection options, and all the tone and curve adjustment tools. The user interface is radically different, but Photoshop veterans will likely get the hang of the mobile version quickly.

I've been testing the Android app for a couple of days now, and it's fairly impressive, but a few things are missing. The biggest for me is the ability to crop by pixels rather than ratio, which seems like a very odd limitation. Content-aware fill is also still ""coming soon."" Adobe has been heavily touting the AI features, which make it possible to do smart selections that would be difficult otherwise. I've found this feature works like on desktop (it relies on the same cloud backend), but I still don't have much use for it. —Scott Gilbertson

""Throw your laptop out the damn window and drag that 1994 Kawasaki 750SX stand-up jet ski out of Uncle Pete's garage, because summer is officially here."" This is how Poolsuite, possibly the finest curated music app for outdoor frivolity, announces the arrival this week not only of a throughly revamped and upgraded version of its already superb iOS media player, but also that it's finally available on Android as well.

This perfectly judged throwback tone pervades throughout the app, which now adds hundreds of new tracks across seven channels, as well as mobile mixtapes to go with the aesthetic overhaul. Sun-drenched playlists lovingly curated to lift spirits and deliver virtual vitamin D for free. If you haven't downloaded it already, do so right now—and never worry about what tunes to play at a BBQ ever again. —Jeremy White

Continuing the summer theme in style is this new limited edition beach-ready Big Bang from Hublot. “As light as a sea breeze with its featherlight ceramic,” says the brand, with a micro blasted “orange case that glows like the golden hour.” Well, I tried it on at Watches & Wonders in April, and unlike some other darker hued versions of this watch, it's playful and thoroughly approachable, yet with 100 meters of water resistance is equally at home either at a pool party or in deep waters. A one-click system also allows the included three interchangeable white rubber-lined straps in sky blue, dark blue or orange to be swapped in a jiffy, and the 72-hour power reserve keeps things going when off the wrist. The price? $31,300 (£26,900) but only 100 will be released. —Jeremy White

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Uber Just Reinvented the Bus … Again","https://www.wired.com/story/uber-just-reinvented-the-bus-again/","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Every few years, a Silicon Valley gig-economy company announces a “disruptive” innovation that looks a whole lot like a bus. Uber rolled out Smart Routes a decade ago, followed a short time later by the Lyft Shuttle of its biggest competitor. Even Elon Musk gave it a try in 2018 with the “urban loop system” that never quite materialized beyond the Vegas Strip. And does anyone remember Chariot?

Now it's Uber's turn again. The ride-hailing company recently announced Route Share, in which shuttles will travel dozens of fixed routes, with fixed stops, picking up passengers and dropping them off at fixed times. Amid the inevitable jokes about Silicon Valley once again discovering buses are serious questions about what this will mean for struggling transit systems, air quality, and congestion.

Uber promised that the program, which rolled out in seven cities at the end of May, will bring “more affordable, more predictable” transportation during peak commuting hours.

“Many of our users, they live in generally the same area, they work in generally the same area, and they commute at the same time,” Sachin Kansal, Uber's chief product officer, said during the company's May 14 announcement. “The concept of Route Share is not new,” he admitted—though he never used the word “bus.” Instead, pictures of horse-drawn buggies, rickshaws, and pedicabs appeared onscreen.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was a bit more forthcoming when he told The Verge the whole thing is “to some extent inspired by the bus.” The goal, he said, “is just to reduce prices to the consumer and then help with congestion and the environment.”

But Kevin Shen, who studies this sort of thing at the Union of Concerned Scientists, questions whether Uber's “next-gen bus” will do much for commuters or the climate. “Everybody will say, ‘Silicon Valley's reinventing the bus again,'” Shen said. “But it's more like they're reinventing a worse bus.”

Five years ago, the Union of Concerned Scientists released a report that found rideshare services emit 69 percent more planet-warming carbon dioxide and other pollutants than the trips they displace—largely because as many as 40 percent of the miles traveled by Uber and Lyft drivers are driven without a passenger, something called “deadheading.” That climate disadvantage decreases with pooled services like UberX Share—but it's still not much greener than owning and driving a vehicle, the report noted, unless the car is electric.

Beyond the iffy climate benefit lie broader concerns about what this means for the transit systems in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, Boston, and Baltimore—and the people who rely on them.

“Transit is a public service, so a transit agency's goal is to serve all of its customers, whether they're rich or poor, whether it's the maximum profit-inducing route or not,” Shen said. The entities that do all of this come with accountability mechanisms—boards, public meetings, vocal riders — to ensure they do what they're supposed to. “Barely any of that is in place for Uber.” This, he said, is a pivot toward a public-transit model without public accountability.

Compounding the threat, Philadelphia and Dallas have struggling transit systems at risk of defunding. The situation is so dire in Philly that it may cut service by nearly 45 percent on July 1 amid a chronic financial crisis. (That, as one Reddit user pointed out, would be good news for Uber.)

Meanwhile, the federal government is cutting support for public services, including transit systems — many of which still haven't fully recovered from Covid-era budget crunches. Though ridership nationwide is up to 85 percent of prepandemic levels, Bloomberg News recently estimated that transit systems across the country face a $6 billion budget shortfall. So it's easy to see why companies like Uber see a business opportunity in public transit.

Khosrowshahi insists Uber is “in competition with personal car ownership,” not public transportation. “Public transport is a teammate,” he told The Verge. But a study released last year by UC Davis found that in three California cities, over half of all ride-hailing trips didn't replace personal cars, they replaced more sustainable modes of getting around, like walking, public transportation, and bicycling.

And then there's the fact that cities like New York grapple with chronic congestion and don't need more vehicles cluttering crowded streets. During Uber's big announcement, Kansal showed a video of one possible Route Share ride in the Big Apple. It covered about 3 miles from Midtown to Lower Manhattan, which would take about 30 minutes and cost $13.

But here's the thing: The addresses are served by three different subway lines. It is possible to commute between those two points, avoid congestion, and arrive sooner, for $2.90. So, yes, Uber Route Share is cheaper than Uber's standard car service (which has gotten 7.2 percent pricier in the past year)—but Route Share is far from the most efficient or economical way to get around in the biggest markets it's launching in.

I just got my Nintendo Switch 2, and my internal storage is already filling up with all my old games and saves! If you're in the same boat, you may have also noticed you can't just jam in the SD card from your original Switch and keep rocking. Instead, you'll need a new MicroSD Express card.

This Express standard was introduced in late 2023, and it enables write speeds in the hundreds of megabytes, but until now it was used only for high-end digital cameras and niche use cases. As a result, the cards are few and far between, and they carry a significant price premium over the more common MicroSD cards. Before I get too caught up in the price and availability though, let's just go over what the difference is between Express and standard MicroSD cards and what it means for your Switch 2.

As you might have guessed from the name, MicroSD Express cards are faster, but to understand exactly what that means, we need to break down what we mean by speed and how it's measured and displayed on MicroSD cards.

Normal, non-express cards use three metrics with some overlap in performance. We've got an in-depth technical guide if you want to know more about the non-express cards, but I'll give the short version here. There are three ranges: Speed Class, denoted with a C, UHS Speed Class, as marked by a U for Ultra High Speed Class, and Video Speed Class, with a V.

Regardless of how it's displayed, the number indicates that the card is able to read and write at least that fast. For the Circle and the V, it's a direct comparison, so a circle with a “10” in it has a 10MB/s sustained write speed. There are two U variants, 1 and 3, which correspond to 10MB/s and 30MB/s respectively. Cards are almost always compatible with slower devices, so you may see multiple symbols and numbers on each card.

The indicator for Express cards is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a stylized EX or E, sometimes with a number next to it. Once again, this represents the card's sustained write speed, with officially supported ranges from 150MB/s up to 600MB/s. Remember that these are minimum speeds, so you may see manufacturers quote even higher numbers, but whether you'll be able to support those speeds will depend on the device reading and writing to the card.

That means your MicroSD Express card will also work as a V30 device when installed in a device that supports that standard, for example. Make sure not to confuse the actual new standard of Express with the performance adjective Extreme that many manufacturers use.

Speed isn't the only difference. The overall card shape is the same, but the pins on the back have a different configuration. Most standard MicroSD cards use the UHS-I or UHS-II standard, with one or two rows of pins. The new Express card's pins have two rows in a more compact shape, but are still compatible with slower readers via the top row.

If you aren't shooting high-resolution video, the main reason you'd want a MicroSD Express card is for the Nintendo Switch 2. A detailed page on the Nintendo website lists compatibility and requirements for the new device. While you can load images and videos from a regular MicroSD card onto the Switch 2, you'll need a proper Express card to use it like normal for save files and game data.

One detail missing is the actual sustained write speed needed. There's a Nintendo-licensed Samsung MicroSD Express card listed with a release date of June, but it doesn't have detailed speeds listed either. We've reached out to Nintendo for more information and will update here when we hear back.

If you just search for standard MicroSD cards on Amazon, the most common result will be cards with a 30MB per second write speed. A 128GB version of one of these cards starts around $10 and goes up to almost $20, and you can often find discounts if you buy multiple.

A MicroSD Express card, on other hand, will run you upwards of $50 for the same 128GB capacity, a significant price jump for the extra speed boost. I was able to get my hands on two MicroSD Express cards at launch, one from SanDisk and one from PNY. While there are 128GB versions available, you only have one slot on the Switch 2, and games are quickly getting larger, so I'd recommend at least the 256GB models. The models I have tried so far are the SanDisk 256GB MicroSD Express for $72 and the PNY 256GB MicroSD Express for $56.

This is normally where I'd show you some measurements from software like CrystalDiskMark with read and write speeds. Unfortunately the MicroSD Express standard is so new that I was only able to find one USB card reader on the market that supports it. While I work on acquiring one, I did a quick and dirty stopwatch test moving some games back and forth on the Switch 2.

The Switch 2 was able to move Rocket Leauge, a 20.3 GB game, from the system's internal storage to the SanDisk in four minutes and 12 seconds, while the PNY took six minutes and 46 seconds to accomplish the same task. There wasn't as much of a gap to move the game from the card back to the system, with the SanDisk taking three minutes and 35 seconds, and the PNY taking three minutes and 22 seconds.

For comparison, my original Switch moved that console's version of Rocket League, a 3.4GB game, to the regular MicroSD card in two minutes and 32 seconds, and back to the console in two minutes and 16 seconds. Games for the Switch 2 are so much larger, it makes sense Nintendo would push for a faster storage option to save you a lot of time, even if it costs you some bucks.

Unless you own a Switch 2 or hi-res video camera, you can probably stick to standard MicroSD cards for now, but it is worth it for moving games quickly onto your system, especially if you have a larger catalog.

I love making sauerkraut. I've almost always got a batch actively fermenting and another in the fridge, ready to eat. It's a project that can take a week or two, almost entirely hands-off once the veggies are cut and salted. To keep the active batch happy—it likes hanging around between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit—I typically I keep it near the slider by my desk on the shady side of the room, closer to the glass if it needs to be cooler, a little farther away if it's cold out.

Making sourdough bread, however, is a much more complicated process that involves different stages of fermentation that tend to like it hot. When you're starting a new batch of starter—the yeasty mixture that gives the loaf the bubbles to rise and the tang to light up your taste buds—it likes temperatures in the mid to high 70s to low 80s, what's affectionately known as the Goldilocks zone, not too hot and not too cool.

Temperature control is key for the sourdough making process, and a group of new, recent, and forthcoming products that help coddle your starter and dough might just be enough help for people on the edge to become full-fledged sourdough people.

In your home, finding consistently warm-enough spots can be daunting, especially for those of us who are newer or more casual sourdough bakers. While sauerkraut is pretty simple and forgiving, making sourdough is not. It is variables galore as you work to coax flour and water from separate states into a delicious risen loaf. This is particularly noticeable when you're in the week-plus project of creating starter, then keeping it happy for months or years.

The variables of making and maintaining starter include weights of water, one or two kinds of flour, and the starter itself. It involves the temperature of that water and the temperature you store it at. Once you're ready to make a loaf, sourdough bread making is often a two-day process with multiple steps and techniques, wherein temperature control is critical in keeping the dough happy.

A perfect sourdough boule.

Bread making isn't one skill or technique, it's a bunch of them, and each step depends on the success of the ones before it. Somewhere in there, insert a problem, or just a little doubt about what you're doing. Maybe your starter smells funny, or the dough doesn't look like it does in the recipe photo. Then what? Some problems could be the result of the last thing you did or a skipped starter feeding from a week ago or something else entirely. Happy troubleshooting! When you're an amateur or parachuting into it for the first time, failure or at least disappointment is part of the game.

If this both heightens your desire to make sourdough and spikes your anxiety, you'll understand why pegging any variables in the process can help eliminate confusion.

The first product that caught my attention is the Sourdough Sidekick, a collaboration between King Arthur Flour and FirstBuild, GE Appliances' prototyping and product development lab. The countertop device is available for preorder and is due out early in 2026. Keeping starter happy means feeding or “refreshing” it, which requires you to combine a tiny bit of the existing batch with water and flour to keep the bacteria and yeasts in the mixture happy and well fed. Some experts even recommend doing this twice a day … forever … which is fine if you bake on most days and is way too much if you no longer work from home, are a busy person, or would just rather not be beholden to a little jar of yeasty flour and water on your countertop.

The Sidekick's schtick is that you can program it to prolong the time between your interactions with it as it automates the feeding. It even has a mode where you tell it when you'll be baking and it will make sure that your starter is timed out perfectly for your dough and make a little extra to keep your starter refreshed in perpetuity. (Non-nerds, skip the following sentence: It can even turn your starter into levain for your bread and leave enough at the end to keep the starter rolling.) It also cuts down on waste and time spent cleaning by using tiny doses of flour and water during the refreshments.

The Sourdough Sidekick

I got a Zoom call walk-through on this from Rick Suel, engineering director at FirstBuild's Louisville, Kentucky, headquarters, and it's easy to see how the Sidekick could make bread making and starter maintaining easier. The machine looks and acts a bit like a fully automatic coffee machine with a flour hopper up top and a water tank in the back. The two ingredients are stirred together in the fermentation vessel, and the amounts are adjusted depending on ambient temperature. It's pretty slick.

Brød & Taylor takes a different tack to achieve a similar effect. Its Sourdough Home ($119) looks like a shoebox-sized countertop fridge and it can hold starter anywhere between 41 and 122 degrees. For me, this meant I could hold my starter at 80 degrees, the recommended temperature in the recipe I used, and keep it there during the 10-plus days of starter creation.

I wasn't finding anything warmer than 77 degrees next to my fridge, so when I was troubleshooting on day six or seven, I stuck it in the freshly arrived Home and didn't have to worry about the temperature being a factor anymore.

The Sourdough Home

The Home also has the ability to space out your sourdough refreshments, not by Sidekick-style microdoses but by cooling the temperature of your starter. Fermentation will happen at preferred speeds, but cooling the starter slows the process down, allowing you to refresh less. The first time I tried it at a lower temperature, following two weeks of daily refreshments, I set it to 50 degrees and walked away, sort of stunned to see it bubbly and happy 48 hours later, compared to how spent and flabby it would have been if it was held that long at 80 degrees. It was easy to see how something like this is appealing to both beginner and experienced bread bakers.

Controlling the temperature is also extremely helpful once you start making bread. SourHouse, which came out with the starter-coddling Goldie a few years back, just released the DoughBed ($280), a heated, happy place for dough to rise, if you can afford that hefty price. Sourdough loaves often have two separate fermentation periods. The first, “bulk fermentation,” is where the dough rises and develops flavors. Later, after a bit of shaping, it proofs in a vessel—often a basket—that helps it rise and ferment a bit more while formed in the shape of the loaf to come.

The DoughBed is a pill-shaped glass bowl that fits over a heating pad and under an insulated cork lid. It helps keep bulk fermentation on track by holding the dough between 75 and 82 degrees. The bowl's long, flat bottom allows for more dough to be as close as possible to the heat. I usually do bulk fermentation in an eight-quart Cambro container, at which point it's either at the mercy of the ambient temperature in my house or I tuck it into that warm spot next to my fridge. I call it ready when it is notably risen and is both a bit smoothed out and bubbly. If you like that readiness on more of a schedule, the DoughBed's consistent temperature helps get the dough where you want it, when you want it. If you are on a schedule, you'll appreciate this predictability.

The DoughBed

Of course, I put this stuff to the test, following Maurizio Leo's starter-creation instructions and his beginner's sourdough recipe. It really enveloped my life, becoming an oddly emotional roller coaster for someone like me who was not on the lookout for new hobbies.

Leo breaks bread making down into eight main steps, in addition to the daily care of your starter. There is a lot to learn for each part of the process. When you're busy learning or getting better at a bunch of consecutive new steps, errors can compound, potentially not even presenting themselves immediately. Controlling a few variables helps keep you on the right path and I appreciated both the Sourdough Home and the DoughBed because they clearly helped keep things moving in the right direction. In the end, it was not bakery-quality bread I made, but it was surprisingly good and something I was happy to share. I have no doubt that using both helped make for a better final product.

It's definitely possible to approximate the temperatures you're looking for with these new devices by putting your starter in a warm spot in your home like on top of the fridge, next to the rice cooker, or, the herpetologist's favorite, on top of a $13 reptile heating pad. (Hat tip to Paul Adams at America's Test Kitchen who turned me on to that one!) If you can get the right temperature consistently using one of those options, go for it. But if you are new to the game, like the process, want to keep some uncertainty out of it, and are perhaps on a bit of a schedule, you might want to take a closer look at them. They will take some of the guesswork out of your baking and get you to better bread sooner.

While the online feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump seemed to drive traffic to Musk's social media platform X (formerly Twitter), it could also create issues for the platform's parent company xAI.

Musk merged X and xAI earlier this year, with Bloomberg reporting this week that he was looking to raise $5 billion in debt (as well as a reported $300 million in a secondary sale) to fund the combined company.

That's led to some awkward moments as Musk's relationship with his former ally Trump seemed to disintegrate. In fact, The Wall Street Journal reports that on Thursday afternoon, Morgan Stanley had gathered xAI executives to pitch potential investors as Musk and Trump were posting angrily about each other on their respective social networks.

Morgan Stanley had reportedly hoped to sell the debt at around 100 cents on the dollar, but a trader told the WSJ it was trading at 95 cents on the dollar at times on Thursday. Investors also reportedly said that due to declining prices, Morgan Stanley may need to offer additional incentives, such as an increased interest rate.

Indian grocery delivery startup KiranaPro's recent data loss story has more holes than Swiss cheese, as the startup remains unclear whether the incident was an internal breach or an external hack.

Last week, the Bengaluru-based startup discovered that it could not access its back-end servers and that all its data, including its app code, had been deleted from GitHub. The startup on Friday blamed a former employee for the breach. However, in an interview, KiranaPro co-founder and CEO Deepak Ravindran conceded that the company had not deactivated the employee's account after they departed the company and cannot rule out the possibility of subsequent malicious misuse of their account.

“If we go deeper, we have to do a real forensic investigation. We are going to talk [about] this with our board, the investors, and we are going to get a formal opinion on that also with our legal advisers,” Ravindran told TechCrunch.

Earlier on Friday, Ravindran claimed in a post on X that the incident that affected its data was an internal breach.

“After careful investigation, we conclude that this was not a hack. No external party penetrated our ordering or payment systems, exploited vulnerabilities, or bypassed security protocols,” he wrote.

The co-founder also explicitly shared a screenshot of a LinkedIn profile of one of KiranaPro's former employees on X on Thursday, alleging that they had deleted the startup's code. (TechCrunch is not sharing the post's link, as the startup has yet to offer concrete proof supporting its position.)

“[T]his was an internal data breach. Specifically, it was the result of actions taken by a trusted internal employee who had legitimate access to our systems,” the co-founder wrote in his post on Friday. “This individual intentionally deleted critical server logs while they were being tested and/or edited, an action that goes directly against our policies, our principles, and the trust we place in our team.”

When TechCrunch asked if KiranaPro could rule out whether any third party had maliciously gained access to the former employee's account, Ravindran could not.

“We have to do a complete forensic check on the company. We have to do the entire IP scan. We have to look at where the tracks happened. We have to check the computers, MacBooks, and whatever is used. Everything has to be done. Then we have to spend money … so, that's why we decided not to,” he told TechCrunch.

Then what was the basis of Ravindran's allegation? It was a GitHub response, a copy of which he shared with TechCrunch.

The response included a username, which Ravindran said was associated with the former employee.

“All we have is the emails that we got from GitHub, stating that [the former employee's username] as an individual is the one who deleted the account. We haven't done the investigation further,” Ravindran told TechCrunch. 

Launched in late 2024, KiranaPro operates as a buyer app on the Indian government's Open Network for Digital Commerce. The startup allows more than 55,000 customers in 50 cities to purchase groceries from their local shops and nearby supermarkets using its voice-based interface. The company also supports local language inputs, including English, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil.

Ravindran stated that they decided to call out the former employee based on the company's “belief system,” as they claim the former employee deleted the data after their sudden termination.

However, the startup said it is not aware if there were enough protections on the former employee's devices, such as multi-factor authentication, to restrict malicious third-party access, like malware. 

The company confirmed it did not remove the employee's access to its data and GitHub account following his departure.

“Employee offboarding was not being handled properly because there was no full-time HR,” KiranaPro's chief technology officer, Saurav Kumar, confirmed to TechCrunch.

Alongside its code saved in GitHub, KiranaPro  also lost access to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, which included its customer data and their transaction details.

Ravindran told TechCrunch that the GitHub data was restored after getting its backup from one of their employees. The startup also regained access to its AWS account along with its customer data.

Both the co-founder and CTO said the AWS account was protected by multi-factor authentication, but neither could say how the account was accessed, as nobody else had physical access to Ravindran's phone, which generates the multi-factor code.

Nonetheless, Ravindran claimed that the customer data stored in the AWS cloud remained intact and was not accessed by any third parties, nor was it downloaded by the former employee in question.

“Because if that is the case, I will get its notification on email or anything [sic],” he said.

That said, Ravindran stated that the startup has enough evidence to file a formal complaint with the police, but said that its investigation is ongoing.

The startup has also not fully paid its current employees, the company's co-founder confirmed, soon after the company raised a seed round of ₹100 million Indian rupees (about $1.2 million), which Ravindran said has yet to be fully wired.

The startup counts Blume Ventures, Unpopular Ventures, and Turbostart among its institutional venture backers, as well as Olympic medalist PV Sindhu and Boston Consulting Group managing director Vikas Taneja among its angel investors. It has 15 employees located in Bengaluru and Kerala.

It does seem that being in school made this experiment distinctly different from just living in a tent. In a sense, tuition was rent. It paid for showers, electricity, and a living room with air conditioning (the library). It also provided a supportive community. School and even society at large is more inclined to help a poor student than an adult trying to cut rent.I make this observation not to diminish the experiment's value.

I could sit here and list out all the medical and legally accepted reasons that the Veterans Administration, and as a result all other regulatory bodies, give me this status (epilepsy, constantly dislocating shoulders, hip arthritis, tinnitus, PTSD etc...)However I have friends, colleagues and neighbors who are measurably less physically and mentally capable but are not considered disabled.When I look at the job market, MOST people are not capable of doing their individual life without significant training, help, direction or supervision. People call this bad-state ""adulting"" and find it onerous.Said another way, the vast majority of people do not have the cognitive ability, education (self taught or formal), or experience to set goals, take actions and self improve without significant direction from someone else. I personally consider that disabled.So if these people are considering themselves disabled, then they are probably right - they are incapable of being independent or living within a community that takes care of them. So the only remaining community left is the abstracted transactional monetary system implemented by governments to allocate resources toward them provided they check the right boxes.Ideally 100% of humanity would be on disability - because we can build systems measurably more capable than human labor - someone just needs to rebrand it as ""UBI.""

So the only remaining community left is the abstracted transactional monetary system implemented by governments to allocate resources toward them provided they check the right boxes.Ideally 100% of humanity would be on disability - because we can build systems measurably more capable than human labor - someone just needs to rebrand it as ""UBI.""

What you are describing is also the opposite from what liberal democracy was envisioned as. It was supposed to be a state, which created complete and mature citizens, which make well formed decision and can be trusted with governing the country.To be honest I do not think that you are wrong in your description, the state is certainly transforming into an institution where the citizen are envisioned as disabled wrecks, which are in desperate need of government support. I just hate that this is the case, it is fundamentally incompatible with the ideals of a liberal democracy.

Do they lose their ""disabled"" status if they go back to work? If so, that seems like a textbook poverty trap. Why risk losing lifetime free money for a minimum wage job that might not last?

The 27 years I've known them have been punctuated by my saying ""what if you do this to solve your current issue"" and the reply is ""I'll lose my benefits""I'm unfit to say if they need it; as in I am unsure if their life would be worse or better without.Don't read too much into the setup, above; my memory is fuzzy unless I am directly talking to them about it, and even so they correct me like, ""its not ssi it's ssdi,"" or whatever it is.

If you want to consider just social assistance then the US government spends about $950B annually, and that works out to $2800 per year per citizen. To make it a livable amount you'd have to at minimum 5x that expenditure (and a lot more than that in urban areas).

There is a target to reduce Medicaid recipients by 4.8 million by 2033, by requiring them to attend school or volunteer 80 hours per month.

I make two generalizations from veterans I know: one type accumulates injuries throughout service (neck, knees, hips, shoulders, back, toxic exposure) but being the walk-it-off types, never documented much because they were often deployed and didn't bother with paperwork. Bitterly complains about the VA and their limited or temporary disability ratings despite grinding pain and difficulty in later life.Second type is similar to the first type, but played the 'game' optimally, documented, documented, and documented. While you can absolutely get some of the same injuries, I was surprised to find things like mild sleep apnea and male pattern baldness helped get someone a permanent 100% disability rating. No doubt life isn't easy, but to think this individual is 100% disabled is a bit of a stretch when they also work full-time for .gov doing project work.My point is that like a video game, people are very good at finding the optimal or 'meta' path to maximizing outcomes in a set of rules, and outcomes from a system can be different than what casual observers might think is the intended purpose of the system.

Storing your precious photos and precious memories on an outside hard drive is not only a smart backup strategy: it's also a safe way to protect your files from hacker attacks and data intrusions. While cloud storage is convenient, there are ongoing costs and potential privacy issues that come with it.

That's where the Seagate external hard drive (HDD) enters as a great alternative and offers enormous storage space and durable protection at a fraction of the cost. Right now, Amazon is selling this essential 4TB device for just $99 which is a 20% discount from its regular price of $124 (and it is an all-time low).

See at Amazon

The Seagate external hard drive connects via USB 3.0 for fast data transfer speeds that are compatible with a wide range of devices, including PCs, Macs, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles. Whether you're backing up your computer, expanding your gaming library or transferring files between systems, this drive is ready for any task. At 4TB capacity, you can store 100,000 photos, 1,000 hours of HD video, or uncountable amounts of documents and music files.

You will also love its plug-and-play convenience: No software installation, no configuring complicated settings – just plug it in, and off you go. The compact and light weight design makes it easy to transport in a briefcase or backpack, with your papers coming with you wherever you go. The drive is also extremely durable, with a strong reputation and 4.6 out of 5 stars user rating from over 250,000 reviews.

In addition to its technical features, the Seagate hard drive also includes a one-year Rescue Data Recovery Services plan. This useful extra is a peace-of-mind feature with the assurance that should something happen to your drive, Seagate experts can assist in the recovery of your precious data. This feature is comforting for those maintaining priceless memories or key work files. The Windows and Mac compatibility of the drive ensures you won't have to worry about issues with formatting, and it is equally simple to reformat if you ever need to switch to a different operating system.

The cost and durability of this Seagate external hard drive ensure this is a much better long-term option than cloud storage subscription plans: You save money on monthly expenses but you also enjoy complete control of your own information and privacy.

The biggest feature of the DualSense controler is haptic feedback which puts the feel of in-game action and environments right in your hands. Whether you're racing down rough roads, wielding guns or feeling the crash of a collision, the controller's next-gen vibration motors plunge you further into the game.

Aside from the haptic feedback, adaptive triggers provide varying levels of force and tension so that you can feel the distinction between drawing back a bowstring or slamming on the brakes in a racing title. They work together to create a feeling of realism and immersion that was not achievable on previous PlayStation controllers.

The built-in microphone allows you to chat online without a headset and the 3.5mm audio jack allows you to plug in your favorite headphones for individual use. The create button is convenient to use to capture and stream your most excellent gaming moments in case you're playing with buddies or capturing highlights to playback later. The controller's iconic appearance has been fine-tuned for comfort with enhanced sticks and an intuitive layout that feels great in your hand even after long gaming sessions.

DualSense isn't only for PlayStation 5 gamers: With its USB Type-C and Bluetooth connectivity, you can easily play it on Windows desktops and Macs too which gives you even more gaming possibilities outside of the console. Most high-end PC games currently support advanced features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which lets you experience the same immersive experience playing from your computer.

With over 33,000 reviews and a lovely 4.6 out of 5-star rating, the PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller is a proven winner among gamers. Don't hesitate too much: These sales don't come around often, and the stock may not be here.

If you place a rigid sphere on a similarly rigid inclined surface, gravity will cause it to roll down said surface. But what happens if the surface, or plane, is completely vertical? Researchers had previously assumed that, without an initial push, the sphere would simply drop straight to the ground without rolling. New research, however, has just redefined this belief—as well as long-held assumptions in the field of physics.

University of Waterloo researchers have revealed the exact scenario necessary to make a sphere roll down a vertical plane without physical intervention. While this niche observation might seem detached from everyday life, it could have useful applications for exploring hard-to-reach areas such as pipes, caves, and even space.

“When we first saw it happening, we were frankly in disbelief,” Sushanta Mitra, executive director of the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, said in a university statement. The researchers describe their discovery as a challenge to “our basic understanding of physics.” They “double-checked everything because it seemed to defy common sense. There was excitement in the lab when we confirmed it wasn't a fluke and that this was real vertical rolling.”

Mitra and his colleagues unexpectedly caught the vertical rolling with high-speed cameras, and explained their discovery in a study published in April in the journal Soft Matter.

In their experiment, the vertical rolling depended on a precise balance of softness—scientifically defined as elasticity—between a small sphere and a vertical cellphone-sized surface. When the spheres were too solid, they simply fell directly to the ground. On the other hand, when they were too soft, they either slid down without rolling, or stuck to the plane. But a sphere about as soft as a gummy bear spontaneously rolled down a vertical surface equivalent to a spongy mouse pad at a speed of about 0.039 inches (one millimeter) every two seconds, as described in the statement.

“The key is that as it rolls, the sphere slightly changes shape at the contact point,” Mitra explained. “The front edge acts as a closing zipper, while the back edge acts like opening it. This asymmetry creates just enough torque, or grip, to maintain rolling without either sticking or completely falling off.”

The team's findings could have practical implications for the creation of soft robots that can scale vertical walls to explore or monitor inaccessible infrastructure and natural environments both on and off Earth. “This opens up a whole new way of thinking about movement on vertical surfaces,” Mitra continued. “Currently, robots and vehicles are limited to horizontal or slightly inclined surfaces. This discovery could change that.”

A new initiative from the watchdogs behind Retraction Watch is taking aim at flawed or faked medical science research to the tune of nearly $1 million.

The Center for Scientific Integrity just launched the Medical Evidence Project, a two-year effort to identify published medical research with a negative effect on health guidelines—and to make sure people actually hear about it.

Equipped with a $900,000 grant from Open Philanthropy and a core team of up to five investigators, the project will use forensic metascience tools to identify issues in scientific articles, and report its findings via Retraction Watch, the foremost site for scientific watchdogging.

“We originally set up the Center for Scientific Integrity as a home for Retraction Watch, but we always hoped we would be able to do more in the research accountability space,” said Ivan Oransky, executive director of the Center and co-founder of Retraction Watch, in a post announcing the grant. “The Medical Evidence Project allows us to support critical analysis and disseminate the findings.”

According to Nature, these flawed and falsified documents are vexing because they skew meta-analyses—reviews that combine the findings from multiple studies to draw more statistically robust conclusions. If one or two bunk studies make it into a meta-analysis, they can tip the scales on health policy.

In 2009, to name one case, a European guideline recommended the use of beta-blockers during non-cardiac surgery, based on turn-of-the-millennium research that was later called into question. Years later, an independent review suggested that the guidance may have contributed to 10,000 deaths per year in the UK.

Led by James Heathers, a science integrity consultant, the team's plan is to build software tools, chase down leads from anonymous whistleblowers, and pay peer reviewers to check their work. They're aiming to identify at least 10 flawed meta-analyses a year.

The team is picking its moment wisely. As Gizmodo previously reported, AI-generated junk science is flooding the academic digital ecosystem, showing up in everything from conference proceedings to peer-reviewed journals. A study published in Harvard Kennedy School's Misinformation Review found that two-thirds of sampled papers retrieved through Google Scholar contained signs of GPT-generated text—some even in mainstream scientific outlets. About 14.5% of those bogus studies focused on health.

That's particularly alarming because Google Scholar doesn't distinguish between peer-reviewed studies and preprints, student papers, or other less-rigorous work. And once this kind of bycatch gets pulled into meta-analyses or cited by clinicians, it's hard to untangle the consequences. “If we cannot trust that the research we read is genuine,” one researcher told Gizmodo, “we risk making decisions based on incorrect information.”

We've already seen how nonsense can slip through. In 2021, Springer Nature retracted over 40 papers from its Arabian Journal of Geosciences—studies so incoherent they read like AI-generated Mad Libs. Just last year, the publisher Frontiers had to pull a paper featuring anatomically impossible AI-generated images of rat genitals.

We've entered the era of digital fossils, in which AI models trained on web-scraped data are beginning to preserve and propagate nonsense phrases as if they were real scientific terms. For example, earlier this year a group of researchers found a garbled set of words from a 1959 biology paper embedded in the outputs of large language models including OpenAI's GPT-4o.

In that climate, the Medical Evidence Project's goal feels more like triage than cleanup. The team is dealing with a deluge of flawed information, hiding in plain sight, and plenty of which can have very real health consequences if taken at face value.

Alienware has added a tiny NUC-sized PC to its roster and is selling it to its app users for 9,999 ARP (Alienware Reward Points). However, the new Alienware Area-51 Brick Kit is not a functioning PC; it is simply a Lego set with instructions to build a cute, blocky custom Alienware Area-51 replica.

This Alienware desktop PC replica construction set includes 318 ""authentic Lego bricks."" Once you finish building this desktop model, it will stand 2.2 x 5.3 x 5 inches (55 x 132 x 130mm) in size, which is just under a liter, roughly similar in size and volume to a modern NUC or NUC-a-like. Of course, this model is designed to stand on one side as a tower, just like the Alienware Area-51 Desktop that inspired it.

The brief blog post about the Area-51 PC Lego set offers a few viewing angles and a sideways glance at the packaging. We see the tower with and without its side window in place.

It is pleasing to see another PC tech-related Lego set, but this product is a little underwhelming in some ways. Part of the blame might be on the 2025 Area-51 design – this gaming desktop's latest incarnation is not as instantly recognizable as an Alienware artifact as previous models. You might recall the H. R. Giger-esque Area-51 Predator designs in the early 2000s, or the angular triple bay hexagon designs from the mid-2010s. Both those examples were unmistakable chassis shapes, even at a distance.

Another criticism is that we feel this is somewhere a little actual RGB LED lighting might have made a nice difference. The kit is built to be an ornament, after all. Or, perhaps someone could work on this kit to include RGB, and even some degree of PC functionality...

Getting your hands on an Area-51 PC Lego set isn't as straightforward as we would like. Alienware has shoved it in the ARP Marketplace, where customers spend loyalty points on Alienware merchandise like keychains, stickers, and socks. The new Lego set is by far the most expensive (and desirable) thing in the marketplace, but it took some nosing around to find out how to get these points.



You can collect this ARP currency by installing the Alienware Arena app, participating in community events, and engaging with the rest of the community. You even gain ARP drops through daily log-ins, browsing time, and quests. Other quick ways to gain ARP include connecting your Steam, Twitch, and Discord accounts and completing quests on these platforms.

How long it would take to gather 9,999 ARP is probably somewhat variable, but hopefully, people interested in Alienware and Lego might already have collections of this digital resource. Alienware says it wants a high redemption rate for this new Lego kit.

We are seeing increasing numbers of Lego and semiconductor industry crossovers. Last December, we reported on the fantastic ASML TWINSCAN EXE:5000 Lego set. This was officially described as a ""masterpiece in technology"" but came with a prohibitive sticker price at $228, and was an employee exclusive, sadly.

This year, we also saw Oxford Toys and SK hynix release a model allowing plastic brick construction fans to build their own Package and Test facility. SK hynix's set seemed to be on offer, advertised at under $30 equivalent in Korean currency, when it surfaced on social media. However, we aren't sure about the availability of the SK hynix Oxford Blocks set outside of Korea.

10 million IOPS per drive, but there is a slight catch.

Kioxia aims to change the storage paradigm with a proposed SSD designed to surpass 10 million input/output operations per second (IOPS) in small-block workloads, the company revealed at its Corporate Strategy Meeting earlier this week. That's three times faster than the peak speeds of many modern SSDs. The company also says it will collaborate with Nvidia in the design. 

One of the performance bottlenecks of modern AI servers is the data transfer between storage and GPUs, as data is currently transferred by the CPU, which significantly increases latencies and extends access times. 

To reach the performance target, Kioxia is designing a new controller specifically tuned to maximize IOPS — beyond 10M 512B IOPS — to enable GPUs to access data at speeds sufficient to keep their cores 100% used at all times. The proposed Kioxia 'AI SSD' is set to utilize the company's single-level cell (SLC) XL-Flash memory, which boasts read latencies in the range of 3 to 5 microseconds, significantly lower than the read latencies of 40 to 100 microseconds offered by SSDs based on conventional 3D NAND. Additionally, by storing one bit per cell, SLC offers faster access times and greater endurance, attributes that are crucial for demanding AI workloads. 

Current high-end datacenter SSDs typically achieve 2 to 3 million IOPS for both 4K and 512-byte random read operations. From a bandwidth perspective, using 4K blocks makes a lot of sense, whereas 512B blocks do not. However, large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems typically perform small, random accesses to fetch embeddings, parameters, or knowledge base entries. In these scenarios, small block sizes, such as 512B, are more representative of actual application behavior than 4K or larger blocks. Therefore, it makes more sense to use 512B blocks to meet the needs of LLMs and RAGs in terms of latencies and use multiple drives for bandwidth. Using smaller blocks could also enable more efficient use of memory semantics for access. 

It is noteworthy that Kioxia does not disclose which host interface its 'AI SSD' will use, although it does not appear to require a PCIe 6.0 interface from a bandwidth perspective.

The 'AI SSD' from Kioxia will also be optimized for peer-to-peer communications between the GPU and SSD, bypassing the CPU for extra performance and lower latency. To that end,  there is another reason why Kioxia (well, and Nvidia) plan to use 512B blocks as GPUs typically operate on cache lines of 32, 64, or 128 bytes internally and their memory subsystems are optimized for burst access to many small, independent memory locations, to keep all the stream processors busy at all times. To that end, 512-byte reads align better with GPU designs.

Kioxia's 'AI SSD' is designed to support AI training setups where large language models (LLMs) require fast, repeated access to massive datasets. Also, Kioxia envisions it being deployed in AI inference applications, particularly in systems that employ retrieval-augmented generation techniques to enhance generative AI outputs with real-time data (i.e., for reasoning). Low-latency, high-bandwidth storage access is crucial for such machines to ensure both low response times and efficient GPU utilization.

The Kioxia 'AI SSD' is scheduled for release in the second half of 2026 and will be developed in collaboration with the world's largest GPU manufacturer (read Nvidia).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New study warns of long-term risks from fecal microbiota transplants","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250606/New-study-warns-of-long-term-risks-from-fecal-microbiota-transplants.aspx","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 01:28:00 GMT","

Fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) have been touted as a potential treatment for a variety of conditions, from inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, and type 2 diabetes to autism. New research from the University of Chicago, however, cautions against widespread use of FMT because of the potential for long-lasting, unintended health consequences for recipients.

FMT involves transferring microbes in the stool from a healthy person to a sick one, in hopes of restoring a healthy equilibrium in the gut microbiome. Since stools contain primarily anaerobic microbes from the colon (i.e. they can't tolerate oxygen), FMT can cause mismatches in the gut ecosystem when those bacteria colonize the small intestine and other parts of the digestive system.

In experiments with mice and studies with human tissue samples, the researchers conducting the new study saw that anaerobic microbes from the colon not only colonized the small bowel after a single transplant but also persisted there for months. These microbes also changed their new intestinal environments to their advantage, ""terraforming"" them in ways that caused changes in the recipient's metabolism, behavior, and energy balance.

""I think it's a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn't willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn't be there,"" said Orlando (Landon) DeLeon, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at UChicago and lead author of the new study, which was published in Cell. ""If we're designing good therapeutics, we should be aware of the importance of matching the regional microbiota to their proper environments, so that we provide better overall health benefits.""

FMT is approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for treating repeated infections with Clostridium difficile (C. diff), an opportunistic bacterium that often causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation in hospital patients who have been on antibiotics. Seeing the success in treating C. diff patients, many physicians have been eager to use FMT to treat other digestive conditions. Researchers understand that gut microbiome health can impact all vital organs and systems of the body, so the idea is that replacing a ""sick"" gut microbiome with a ""healthy"" one could fix the problem in one fell swoop.

The gut isn't simply one consistent environment with the same microbiota throughout, however; instead, it has several distinct regions that are vastly different microbial ecosystems, each tailored for specific microbes that can provide functions vital to the health of their host.

There are microbes along the entire intestinal tract, and we just study predominately the last third of it (the colon). So, how can you expect an FMT, with microbes from a third of the intestinal tract at the end of it, to fix the rest of the intestine?""

Orlando (Landon) DeLeon, PhD, postdoctoral researcher at UChicago and lead author of the new study

To test the effects of FMT on different parts of the intestine, DeLeon, Eugene B. Chang, MD, the Martin Boyer Professor of Medicine at UChicago and senior author of the study, and their team carried out a series of experiments with mice. One group of mice was given a transplant of microbes taken from the jejunum, the first portion of the small intestine. A second group was given a standard FMT, and a third group was given a transplant from the cecum, a section connecting the small and large intestine, which has a mixture of microbes from both.

Recipients of FMT are usually treated with antibiotics first to clear out the microbes living in the gut, leaving a clean slate for newly transplanted microbes to take up residence – sometimes, however, in the wrong places. Testing showed that microbes from each of these transplants successfully colonized the entirety of the intestinal tract in the mice, not just their native niches. This created regional gut mismatches persisting up to three months after just one transplant.

The altered microbiomes also changed the production of metabolites in each intestinal region, which can have health effects on the host. The researchers saw changes in liver metabolism, including activity in genes associated with immune function. They also observed differences in eating behaviors, activity, and energy expenditure in the mice after transplants.

The most striking finding was that having the wrong microbes in the wrong place reshaped the tissue identity to make it more suitable for them. DeLeon saw that mismatches changed gene and protein expression in the intestinal lining in ways that more closely resembled expression levels from the microbes' original or native intestinal regions.

""It's like they're engineering or terraforming their environments to help them fit in,"" DeLeon said.

Chang said that this research highlights the need for more caution with FMT before we fully understand the long-term effects of introducing one set of microbes into a new environment.

""We have absolutely no idea what's in FMT, except that it's a combination of microbes,"" Chang said. ""But even a single FMT will cause a change in the host-microbe relationships in these very different regions of the bowel that may be very difficult to reverse.""

Both DeLeon and Chang advocate for ""omni-microbial transplants,"" or OMT, instead. This approach would transfer microbes taken from all the different regions of the intestine, not just those largely from the colon. Whether given via an endoscopy or in pill form, microbes naturally settle in the right places, especially when they are competing side by side with others that normally inhabit a certain region.

""If there's an open space, something's going to fill it,"" DeLeon said. ""But the microbes that were supposed to be there are better suited for it, so they're more naturally going to fill it even in the presence of other microbes.""

DeLeon plans to keep studying how different microbes exert their influence in different parts of the intestine, using different approaches like single cell sequencing and metabolomics to track their activity. He is also exploring how the gut regions terraformed by microbiota mismatches can be restored to their original state, which could help restore normal gut function. Such deeper understanding could lead to improvements in the application of microbial transplants, ultimately helping them live up to their significant promise.

The study, ""Regional microbiota mismatches from fecal microbiota transplants promote persistent, off-target consequences to the host,"" was supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the UChicago GI Research Foundation.

The USMNT have struggled in recent matches, including falling to Canada in the third-place match of the Concacaf Nations League in March. USA are hoping to build some momentum ahead of the Gold Cup, but the Americans will be down several key players against Turkey.

Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie and Tim Weah are among the players who will not suit up against Turkey or in the Gold Cup for various reasons.

Names will be made this summer in United States men's national team action, which starts when Mauricio Pochettino's team meets up with European powers Turkiye in East Hartford on Saturday.

The international friendly pits the Yanks against a top-25 team for the first of two UEFA friendlies, with Switzerland coming soon, and good performances will show Pochettino a player's potential against similar opposition in the 2026 World Cup.

MORE — How will USMNT line up versus Turkiye?

The nerves will be plenty for the USMNT players, who have chances to be center stage while Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Timothy Weah, Antonee Robinson, and others are absent from the fold.

But there are still a lot of regulars here, as Tyler Adams and Johnny Cardoso keep things steady and vicious in the midfield and Chris Richards gets more time as one of the leaders at the back.

Richards returns to the team with an FA Cup on his resume, and Crystal Palace teammate Matt Turner is likely to also start for the USMNT.



Kickoff: Saturday, June 7, 3:30pm ET

Who is going to seize the opportunities presented in the front four positions in the team?

Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Damion Downs, and Brian White all have claims of form and will feel they can claim the center forward spot with Folarin Balogun leaving camp through injury.

Malik Tillman can show so much without Reyna, Weah, and Pulisic, and has to be thrilled at the prospect of orchestrating the attack in front of steady midfielders.

The wings are very intriguing, as we'll learn how highly Pochettino already rates Diego Luna, and there are a bunch of talented options who could claim starting spots.

The Crescent Stars essentially cruised through Nations League B, winning promotion with a decisive two-legged triumph over Hungary.

Former AC Milan and Sevilla boss Vincenzo Montella is missing some familiar names for this match as Bournemouth's Enes Unal, Brighton's Ferdi Kadioglu, and Hoffenheim's Ozan Kabak are out through injury and Cenk Tosun was not called into the team.

This is a squad based largely in Turkiye's top flight, but Real Madrid starlet Arda Guler and Juventus young star Kenan Yildiz — both 20 years old — are in the fold.

Dortmund midfielder Salih Ozcan and Inter Milan hero Hakan Calhanoglu, the side's captain, lead the way in the midfield. Man United backstop Altay Bayindir and Trabzonspor keeper Ugurcan Cakir are the keepers with experience.

This is a solid team with lots of experience. Many will know the names Merih Demiral, Caglar Soyuncu, Mert Muldur, Okay Yokuslu, and Orkun Kokcu. It's a huge test for this USMNT.

Anything can happen in these friendlies once teams start making loads of subs in the second half, so it's almost more worthwhile to predict the score after 55 minutes or so. Either way, we'll venture chances in this one. We also expect a gritty midfield battle that sees both sides finding the ball on the perimeter. The hosts will be slight favorites to win here, but we'll take that down a notch. USMNT 1-1 Turkiye.

Here's a recent U.S. soccer story from the Associated Press:

NEW YORK (AP) — Christian Pulisic is among a slew of regular starters who will be missing when the United States plays in next month's CONCACAF Gold Cup, another blow for a team coming off dismal performances at the Copa America and CONCACAF Nations League.

Given the absences, coach Mauricio Pochettino wants players who will convince worried fans a turnaround is ahead.

“It's our responsibility to send some signal to them,” he said Thursday during a Zoom news conference after announcing his 27-man roster. “I think our fans need to see our team fighting and playing and performing and playing well, yes, but fighting for the flag and being always in every single game (to) match the aggressivity of the opponent.”

Pulisic, the top American player, asked to be left off the roster for the last competitive matches before the 2026 World Cup in order to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons.

Yunus Musah also asked out, Antonee Robinson was dropped because he has been playing with an injury, and Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna were blocked because FIFA gave the expanded Club World Cup priority over national teams.

Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Tanner Tessmann were omitted in what Pochettino called “football decisions.”

U.S. Soccer Federation sporting director Matt Crocker said Pulisic and his advisers asked for the possibility to be left off because of the amount of games he has played in the last two years.

“Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup,” Pochettino said. “We decided the best for him, the best of the team, the best for the national team is the decision that we made.”

Pochettino replaced Gregg Berhalter after the team's first-round elimination at the Copa America last summer. After the Gold Cup, he will have just four brief training windows on FIFA international dates before players report ahead of the World Cup.

In the team's first significant test under Pochettino, the Americans lost to Panama and Canada in the Nations League in March. Without saying players had been complacent, Pochettino said “we learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March, and it's about to be — maybe use a different way to approach these opportunities.”

Sixteen of the players picked are from Major League Soccer, the most in a FIFA window since the U.S. sent a B team to the 2023 Gold Cup.

“If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?” Pochettino asked out loud. “No, no, no, no, no. What we want do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused and spend all my focus and energy in the national team. ... If we want be good in one year time, we need to think that today is the most important day.”

Outside back Sergiño Dest returns to the national team for the first time since March 2024 after recovering from a torn ACL. Forward Folarin Balogun is with the team for the first time since last September following his recuperation from shoulder surgery.

Pochettino's roster included Alex Freeman, a son of former NFL All-Pro receiver Antonio Freeman. The 20-year-old right back made his Major League Soccer debut for Orlando in April 2023 — his only league match that season. He had two MLS appearances last year and has become a regular this season.

Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, a 24-year-old son of the former coach, also was picked for the first time along with 20-year-old forward Damion Downs and 21-year-old defender Quinn Sullivan.

Downs has played on youth teams of Germany and the U.S., and helped Cologne gain promotion to the Bundesliga for 2025-26 after a one-season absence.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese, who has attended national team camp previously but not played in a game, also was selected.

Players will start reporting June 1 for training in Chicago, and the 26-man Gold Cup roster is due June 4. The U.S. plays Turkey on June 7 at East Hartford, Connecticut, and Switzerland three days later at Nashville, Tennessee, then meets Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti in the first round of the Gold Cup.

The roster:

Goalkeepers: Matt Freese (New York City), Patrick Schulte (Columbus), Zack Steffen (Colorado), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace)

Defenders: Max Arfsten (Columbus), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando), DeJuan Jones (San Jose), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse), Tim Ream (Charlotte), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati)

Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson (Leeds), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis), Luca de la Torre (San Diego), Diego Luna (Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia), Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus)

Forwards: Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte), Folarin Balogun (Monaco). Damion Downs (Cologne), Brian White (Vancouver), Haji Wright (Coventry)

After disappointment in the Concacaf Nations League, the United States men's national team is back in action with a friendly against Turkiye as a tune up for the Gold Cup, which kicks off in just over a week. It's a strange international break with the Club World Cup and rest for players thinning out Maucicio Pochettino's squad which will be without regulars such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Sergino Dest, Gio Reyna and Folarin Balogun for this match.

Turkiye will be one of the better teams that the USMNT has faced, ranking 27th in the FIFA men's rankings, so with a squad that's mostly from Major League Soccer, this will be a true test of Pochettino's tactics.

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more.

These teams haven't met since 2014 when the United States defeated Turkiye in a tune up match for the World Cup in Brazil. That was a World Cup where the United States did make it to the knockout stage before falling to Belgium in extra time. Despite that game being 11 years ago, Hakan Calhanoglu did come off the bench in that match for Turkiye and will be expected to start this match, playing a critical role in their midfield.

Call it What You Want: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.



With such an inexperienced roster on the international stage, Pochettino has been asked if the squad at his disposal is good enough to win these games before heading to the Gold Cup but he quickly dismissed that notion.

""I think we need to respect the players that are here. We need to respect every single player and see if we are good enough,"" Pochettino said. ""I will let you know after. We weren't good enough to win the Nations League. We were not good enough, if we go back to the World Cup, we were not good enough to win the World Cup in 2022. I think we cannot judge or analyze in this way. I think we need to wait, and then if we win, so happy. If we don't win, you can criticize.""

While he's not wrong about how the USMNT has performed, this will be an important time for him to get the team to a stage where they are good enough to win these matches. Since taking over in September of 2024, this will be the longest camp that Pochettino has spent with the squad, which will give him a chance to make tactical breakthroughs. If they're still not good enough to win these games after spending that much time with the Argentine, that's when alarm bells will begin to ring about what this team's ceiling is. 

With camp newcomers in Sebastian Berhalter and Quinn Sullivan, Pochettino will have new options in midfield. Sullivan has represented the USMNT at youth levels, but has mostly played as a winger while he has taken up central positions for his club. Alongside Jack McGlynn, Luca De La Torre, Malik Tillman, Diego Luna, and Tyler Adams, there are quite a few directions that Pochettino can go in for this friendly, and that choice could have major implications on an eventual World Cup squad.

USMNT: Matt Turner, John Tolkin, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Nathan Harriel, Tyler Adams, Johnny Cardoso, Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright

Türkiye: Ugurcan Cakir, Mert Muldur, Samet Akaydin, Caglar Soyuncu, Mustafa Eskihellac, Salih Ozcan, Hakan Calhanoglu, Arda Guler, Kenan Yildiz, Baris Tilmaz, Kerem Akturkoglu

John Tolkin, Holstein Kiel: While this is Tolkin's first USMNT camp since being relegated from the Bundesliga, he did put in some good performances for Holstein Kiel after joining in January. Without Antonee Robinson, he could get a chance to be the starting left back for the USMNT, a position that has no true backup. When depth will be needed at multiple positions if the USMNT wants to succeed at the World Cup in 20206, figuring out Robinson's backup will be critical.

Which USMNT shows up? If the same USMNT from the Concacaf Nations League comes into this match, it will be quite a disappointment as their performance facing Panama and Canada won't be good enough to win this match facing off against Turkiye. With the World Cup looming, that can't happen as questions will also be asked about whether Pochettino is the right man for the job. They may not have to win the game in this friendly, but an improved performance is certainly needed.

In a tense game with pressing on display, these two teams will end up playing to a draw. It will at least be an eventful one with Arda Guler scoring before Brian White comes off the bench to rescue a result for the USMNT in a match that, while it won't be pretty, will build confidence for this squad. Pick: USMNT 1, Turkiye 1

The Club World Cup will feature five new rule changes as well as a brand new format when it begins next week.

The new tournament kicks off in the United States on Sunday June 15, with Al Ahly taking on Inter Miami in the tournament's opening match.

In total, 32 teams will take part from all over the globe, including Manchester City and Chelsea from England as well as the likes of Real Madrid, Juventus and Bayern Munich.

Previous iterations of the competition have included just seven teams, with Manchester City winning the last tournament in 2023.

But this year's competition has an enormous prize fund of £777m ($1bn), to be split among the teams.

The Club World Cup has typically been viewed as a minor affair for European clubs and fans, but FIFA wants it to be 'the football event of the year'.

As well as the new format, the competition is also going to feature a host of 'trailblazing' rule changes, which FIFA claim will 'improve football.

The most significant innovation is that referees will wear body cameras, allowing fans to see closer into their decision making process.

The footage will used during live match broadcasts on DAZN, who agreed a $1billion (£787m) deal with FIFA for rights to the tournament. 

 The new camera angle will be trialled to see if it can improve the viewing experience for fans at home, while FIFA will use the experiment to create guidelines for its possible use in other competitions.

Fans at the game will finally be able to watch footage from the VAR monitor inside the stadium, and it will be displayed live on giant screens to 'enhance transparency'. 

Advanced semi-automated offside technology will also be used as referees seek to make quicker decisions throughout the match. 

The Club World Cup will also see an increased use of artificial intelligence-driven data, while substitution tablets will be used and will replace the traditional manual process

Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee, said that the referees taking part in the tournament will be 'making history'.

The new Club World Cup format has received criticism from players and FIFA is currently facing legal action surrounding the tournament's scheduling.

Players' union Fifpro says the footballing calendar is too busy and 'risks player safety and wellbeing'.

Manuel Akanji, currently in the US on Switzerland duty for their upcoming pair of friendlies, has candidly spoken out against the fixture congestion. 

The Manchester City defender said: 'I have been a strong critic of this competition for some time now. We players would love to have some holidays, and some time for our bodies to rest.' 

My City teammates are not exactly overjoyed about the tournament either. But it's now right in our faces, and there is nothing we can do about it.

'If we take part, then of course we want to win it. But if we reach the final, then the time period for us to recover ahead of the new season will become even shorter.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Cristiano Ronaldo says he's rejected offers to join teams at the Club World Cup and that he won't be playing in the tournament. (0:38)

Al Nassr and Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo said on Saturday he did not plan to play at the Club World Cup in the United States, despite being courted by clubs participating in the expanded 32-team tournament.

Speculation over the 40-year-old's future intensified last month when FIFA president Gianni Infantino said discussions were underway about Ronaldo, who is out of contract at the end of the month, playing in the Club World Cup, despite Al Nassr failing to qualify.

Al Nassr's sporting director Fernando Hierro said last month they were negotiating with Ronaldo over a contract extension but faced competition from a host of clubs eager to sign the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.

Ronaldo himself added to the uncertainty after Al Nassr's season-ending match at Al Fateh, posting on social media: ""This chapter is over. The story? Still being written.""

Asked about the possibility of signing for another club in the coming days in order to play at the Club World Cup later this month, Ronaldo told reporters: ""It's irrelevant, at the moment it doesn't make sense to talk about things other than the national team.

""There has been plenty of contact [from clubs], I see things that make sense, others that don't. You can't go to all of them [clubs], you have to think short, medium and long term.

""It's something that's practically decided on my part, which is not to go to the Club World Cup, but I've had plenty of invitations.""

On Wednesday, Ronaldo scored the winner as Portugal beat Germany 2-1 to go into the Nations League final, where they will face Spain.

Many have labelled Sunday's final as a face-off between Ronaldo and 17-year-old Barcelona sensation Lamine Yamal but the Portuguese forward said he did not see it as such.

""It's always been like that, whenever I've played football, whenever I've played a big game it's always been Cristiano against this one, against that one,"" he said.

""It's been 20-something years and it's still the same, it doesn't keep me up at night anymore, it's a normal thing. They're completely different generations, a generation that's starting out, another that's finishing, which is my case.

""In reality it's not like that, it's a team against a team. It will always be like that... What I want most is for Portugal to be at a good level, confident that things can go well, that we can play a great game and win against a very good team, possibly the best in the world.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Portugal forward has ‘practically decided' not to take part

Mbappé: PSG Champions League win ‘doesn't affect me'

Cristiano Ronaldo has said he does not plan to play at the Club World Cup in the United States, despite being courted by clubs participating in the 32-team tournament. Speculation over the Portugal forward's future intensified last month when the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, said discussions were under way about Ronaldo playing despite his club side, Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr, failing to qualify.

Asked about the possibility of signing for another club in order to play Ronaldo said: “It's irrelevant, at the moment it doesn't make sense to talk about things other than the national team.

“There has been plenty of contact [from clubs], I see things that make sense, others that don't. You can't go to all of them, you have to think short, medium and long term. It's something that's practically decided on my part, which is not to go to the Club World Cup, but I've had plenty of invitations.”

Al-Nassr's sporting director, Fernando Hierro, said last month they were negotiating with Ronaldo over a contract extension but faced competition from clubs eager to sign the five-times Ballon d'Or winner. Ronaldo added to the uncertainty, posting on social media: “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written.”

The 40-year-old scored the winner as Portugal beat Germany 2-1 in the semi-final at Munich's Allianz Arena – also the venue for the final against Spain on Sunday. The Portugal captain played down suggestions that it is a face-off between himself and the 17-year-old Barcelona sensation, Lamine Yamal. “It's always been like that, whenever I've played football, whenever I've played a big game it's always been Cristiano against this one, against that one,” he said.

“It's been twentysomething years and it's still the same. It doesn't keep me up at night any more, it's a normal thing. “[We] are completely different generations, a generation that's starting out, another that's finishing, which is my case. In reality it's not like that, it's a team against a team. It will always be like that.

“What I want most is for Portugal to be at a good level, confident that things can go well, that we can play a great game and win against a very good team, possibly the best in the world.”

Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappé has insisted he was happy to see his former club, Paris Saint-Germain, win the Champions League for the first time after his departure last summer. PSG thrashed Inter 5-0 in Munich last week to lift the trophy, 12 months after Mbappé left on a free transfer in acrimonious circumstances. The France forward moved to the Real Madrid, who were knocked out of this year's tournament by Arsenal in the quarter-finals.

“I was happy, they deserved it,” Mbappé said. “They've been through so many problems, I've been through that too. I've been through every stage of the Champions League except winning it,. They were the best team in Europe.

“I can't remember ever seeing them go 5-0 up. It's 100% deserved, they're becoming the team everyone wants to beat.”

Speaking before France's Nations League third-place playoff against Germany in Stuttgart on Sunday, Mbappé also backed compatriot Ousmane Dembélé to win the Ballon d'Or award, ahead of Spain and Barcelona's Lamine Yamal. “Would I vote for Dembélé? Yes. Is there really any need to explain? I'm going for Dembélé. It's very clear.”

Mbappé scored 43 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid, winning the European golden shoe award, but his team failed to win a major trophy, beaten by Barcelona in the title race and Copa del Rey final. The 26-year-old has also been involved in a legal dispute with PSG over €55m in wages he claims the club have not paid him.

The France forward claimed there were no hard feelings over his departure and PSG's European success. “PSG won the Champions League without me, that doesn't affect me. That's a good thing. We all face challenges in our careers.

“I'm a bit more in the eye of the storm, which is good. I've always liked being in these positions, it's up to me to work. I've reversed quite a few trends in my career, I've had a lot of things stuck on my back and I've managed to get them off.

“Did I leave too soon? No, my story was over, it had to end,. There was no bitterness, I'd reached the end of my tether.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Jack Grealish isn't holding back when it comes to letting his doubters know how he feels after a tumultuous season.

The Manchester City winger made 20 appearances in the Premier League this season scoring just one goal along with a single assist. He did appear in every game of the club's run to the FA Cup final before being left on the bench against Crystal Palace. 2024–25 marked just the second season since Pep Guardiola's arrival to Manchester where the Cityzens failed to win a trophy.

His future has been widely discussed after reports surfaced that he's likely going to be left off Man City's squad list for the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. As such, talks of a potential summer move have heated up.

Former Aston Villa forward Gabi Agbonlahor criticised Guardiola's decision to leave Grealish on the bench in their loss to Crystal Palace. Agbonlahor felt as if it was Guardiola sticking it to Grealish one final time. When the clip was posted to social media, one user responded: “Dude Jack is (sic) been bad lately and I'm not surprised Pep did that.” 

Grealish responded, “Haha I've been bad lately? Scored three goals in my last three appearances over 45 mins but okie dokie love x.” The City forward also commented, “What u want me to do, score a hatty in 20?”

Much has been made about Grealish since his move to Man City. The once exciting winger, much like most Guardiola signings, was deployed as a controlling option on the left flank. The Spaniard has his style of play and he particularly coaches players to fill certain roles, even despite Grealish's tantalising performances for Aston Villa. 

He was a crucial piece in the Cityzens' treble-winning campaign back in 2022–23, but this season marks the second domestic campaign in a row where he's made just 20 appearances in the league. For comparison, he made 28 during the treble season and 26 in his first season in Manchester.

Qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup continue this weekend with a number of UEFA games, including this one on Saturday between Andorra and England.

England currently leads Group K, putting it in position to qualify directly to the World Cup, though there's a lot of time still left to go. Andorra has lost both of its games so far.

In the first matchday of this group, Andorra lost 1-0 to Latvia while England won 2-0 against Albania. In the next game, Andorra was shut out again, falling 3-0 to Albania while England rolled to a 3-0 win over Latvia.

England is looking to make the World Cup once again. The team has qualified for the last seven World Cups, but it last missed in 1994 when the tournament was held in the United States.

The English side has won its last five matches overall, including four consecutive shut-out victories.

As for Andorra, a World Cup trip feels incredibly unlikely, but weirder things have happened. The team sits just 173rd in the FIFA rankings and consistently struggles to win games, especially against strong competition like England, which has won all six previous matchups between these teams, both by shutout and multiple goals.

World Cup

live

Updated 26s ago

England face Andorra in Barcelona today as Thomas Tuchel's side look to maintain their perfect start to World Cup qualifying.

England: Pickford, Jones, Konsa, Burn, James, Bellingham, J Henderson (Alexander-Arnold 64'), Madueke, Palmer (Eze 64'), Rogers, Kane. 

Andorra: Alvarez, Borra (Chus Rubio 75'), Llovera, Marc Garcia, Olivera, San Nicolas, Rodrigo Tapia (Garcia 64'), Babot (Vales 75'), Guillen, Cervos, Ricard Fernandez (Lopez 64'). 

77' Andorra 0-1 England

That almost got interesting. Vales, who has only just come on, completely outfoxes Burn with a smart backhell into space. Lopez collects the ball and slaloms forward and, for a moment, it looks as though he's clean through. But Konsa catches up and does well to block his shot before it troubles Pickford.

74' Andorra 0-1 England

Brilliant save from Alvarez!

Jude Bellingham does ever so well in the penalty box, flicking the ball into a pocket of space and then chipping it across the face of goal. Eze gets up well above Borra and nods the ball towards goal, but Alvarez reads it well and does fantastically to tip it over the bar.

The corner comes to nothing. Alvarez is man of the match as it stands! 

72' Andorra 0-1 England

Another good pass from Curtis Jones releases Harry Kane into space down the right. The angle is too tight for England's captain to shoot, so he cuts the ball back across the face of goal. Jude Bellingham hares forward to get involved but Kane's pass is too far behind him and, once again, Andorra scramble it away to safety. 

69' Andorra 0-1 England

Trent Alexander-Arnold has been lively since coming on a few moments ago. He takes a corner on the right-hand side and it's a good delivery, although Borra heads it away.

The ball falls to Eze on the edge of the area who volleys it downward, into the turf. It's a good idea but he cuts across it too much and the ball bounces wide of Alvarez's right post. 

65' Andorra 0-1 England

Trent Alexander-Arnold replaces Jordan Henderson. Cole Palmer comes off for Eberechi Eze. 

England shuffle things around. Alexander-Arnold goes to right-back. Jones shifts into midfield. And Madueke switches flanks to allow Eze space on the left. 

63' Andorra 0-1 England

Thomas Tuchel is about to shuffle his pack. Eberechi Eze and Trent Alexander-Arnold are getting ready.

60' Andorra 0-1 England

England might have their noses in front but there's a lot of frustration out there on the pitch.

Madueke shakes his head at Palmer for delaying a pass to him while Pickford is annoyed at something in England's goal, waving his arms frantically and shouting in the direction of his defence.

Andorra have kept the exact same shape after conceding that opening goal. 

That was Harry Kane's 450th career goal for club and country, in his 697th game.

He has scored 5 of those goals for Leyton Orient, 9 for Millwall, 2 for Leicester City, 280 for Tottenham Hotspur, 82 for Bayern Munich and 72 for England.  

Some breaking news from David Ornstein: Chelsea have submitted an official proposal to sign Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund and have agreed a seven-year contract with the forward.

The 20-year-old is keen on a move and only wants to join Chelsea, who hold a long-standing interest in the England Under-21 international.

It's a touch unfortunate for Andorra's goalkeeper Alvarez, who has been having a good game. Jones plays a wonderful slide-rule pass from the right which Kane runs onto, but the goalkeeper gets behind it, parrying the ball away.

It falls to Madueke on the left who shapes as if to shoot, but instead pulls it back for Kane. The ball skips past the despairing Alvarez for Kane to smash into the roof of the net from just inside the six-yard box. 

50' Andorra 0-1 England

Finally! Harry Kane gets England off the mark.

46' Andorra 0-0 England

Chance for Andorra! Jones plays a sloppy ball to Konsa and Ricard Fernandez pounces, stealing possession and shooting from the edge of the box.

He slashes his shot well wide but that should ring alarm bells for Tuchel, who is yet to make a change. 

We're back underway in Barcelona. Buckle up, ladies and gentlemen.

John P: “Same old England. So much aimless passing and zero incision. Time for Eze and Alexander-Arnold.”

Greg P: “How can Tuchel spend the whole week talking about England playing with pace and then send them out there like that? Either the players aren't listening or they can't be bothered at the end of a long season.”

Myles H: “The formula for an England World Cup qualifier: boring first half. Absolute headloss online. Harry Kane to score twice in the second half. Lots of grumbling at FT. Then we all move on and forget this ever happened.” 

Remember: you can get involved by emailing live@theathletic.com.

An uninspiring first half performance from England — and they are booed off the pitch by their supporters for good measure. There was little intensity to their build-up play, they were sloppy on the ball and failed to properly test an Andorra team that were more than happy to sit deep and let England have the majority of the ball. There was half a chance for Harry Kane to open the scoring in the 19th minute, but little else beyond that. Significant improvements needed in the second half if England are going to — and they should — get on the scoresheet.

HT: Andorra 0-0 England

England end the half with a good opportunity, but Bellingham nods Madueke's cross straight at Alvarez.

And that's that. England are booed off. 

43' Andorra 0-0 England

Jude Bellingham is dropping deeper and deeper in an attempt to get something going for England. This is pretty turgid stuff.

He collects the ball just inside Andorra's half and lofts a ball over the top of their defence, inviting Cole Palmer to run forward. It's a neat idea, but Alvarez gets to the ball first. ","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

The winger faces a huge decision on his future after failing to agree a permanent transfer to Stamford Bridge

Another summer, another transfer window where Jadon Sancho finds his future up in the air. Having been unable to negotiate a permanent contract at Chelsea after an indifferent loan spell in west London, the Manchester United outcast will once again weigh up his options in the coming months.

Despite the Blues' openness to keeping him, the winger's £300,000-per-week wages have put paid to a long-term stay at Stamford Bridge and he now finds himself in limbo with one year remaining on his lucrative deal at Old Trafford. Chelsea even paid a £5 million penalty fee to send him back, as they reneged on the £25m ($34m) obligation to buy that they agreed last year.

However, it seems Sancho did enough during his loan spell to ensure that he will have plenty of options on the table when he comes to choose his next move. It's a decision he must get right as he risks his once prodigious career drifting into obscurity.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Five keys to USMNT vs Turkey: The match may be a friendly, but there are real stakes here for Pochettino's depleted team

The U.S. men's national team's toughest game of the summer may very well be its first one. It may not be the most important, particularly with a Gold Cup looming. But Saturday's match against  Turkey presents the type of challenge the USMNT need on the road to 2026 - a tough, talented, top-30 global opponent.

And those types of games will be in short supply between now and the World Cup kickoff next June.

Turkey are a proven commodity, a team that, on its day, can challenge anyone. They went to the Euro 2024 quarterfinals last summer, falling to an elite Netherlands team after squandering an early lead. In the 10 months or so since, they've lost just once. 

The USMNT's loss in the CONCACAF Nations League left a mark, and the absence of multiple key stars for this summer's run doesn't help. Now, though, the 26 players that are in camp will be eager to prove themselves - and Turkey provide a perfect platform to do just that.

Sinner beat Novak Djokovic 6-4 7-5 7-6(3) in a generational battle on Court Philippe Chatrier to deny his Serbian opponent a record 25th Grand Slam and leave him unsure whether he will ever return to Roland Garros, where he has won three major trophies.

The 23-year-old Italian, who is seeking his fourth Grand Slam title, booked a mouth-watering meeting with his main rival Carlos Alcaraz, who will aim to retain his crown at Roland Garros and add a fifth major crown to his trophy cabinet.

With Djokovic now the only active member of tennis' Big Four that also included Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Andy Murray and yielded a collective 69 major titles in more than two decades, Sinner sensed an opportunity for himself and Alcaraz.

""It takes time to compare us with the Big Three or Big Four, no? Only time can tell, to be honest,"" Sinner told reporters.

""For sure, from my point of view, he's a player who makes me a better player. He pushes me to the limit. We try to understand where we have to improve, for the next times I play against him.

""I believe that tennis or every sport needs rivalries. This could be potentially one of them, but there are amazing players coming up. There can be so many different and other players joining or one drops. You never know.""

Sunday's clash on Court Philippe Chatrier will mark only the 12th time that Sinner and Alcaraz have faced off, with the 22-year-old Spaniard looking for a fifth straight victory over his opponent to successfully defend his title.

Djokovic said the pair would have to keep going to match the rivalry that he had with Federer, Nadal and Murray.

""At the moment, that's hard, because they need to play against each for at least 10-plus years non-stop in order to be part of the same discussion,"" Djokovic added.

""But they're definitely great for tennis, both of them. I think their rivalry is something our sport needs.""

Sinner said he and Alcaraz had a similar aura and could get more fans interested in the sport.

""He's a player with charisma, with that aura,"" Sinner said.

""The moment he steps on court, you can feel his presence. In the end, that's exactly what tennis needs. The more people like that, the more players like that, the better.

""In the end, it's exactly those players who bring people closer to the sport and make them want to watch tennis.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

There is only one infinity stone missing from the Jannik Sinner vs. Carlos Alcaraz collection. Five are already in place. They have faced each other in a Challenger, an ATP 250, an ATP 500, a Masters 1000, and a Grand Slam. Only a Grand Slam final showdown is missing from what is currently the best rivalry in tennis.That will finally change–and the proverbial the sixth stone will be added–when Sinner and Alcaraz battle for the French Open title on Sunday afternoon.Their biggest match of all marks their 13th meeting, with Alcaraz leading the head-to-head series 8-4 (7-4 on the main tour). The Spaniard is ahead 3-1 on clay (1-0 at Roland Garros) and he has won four straight overall against Sinner. In the semifinals 12 months ago, Alcaraz came back from several deficits to prevail 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. He most recently defeated the Italian 7-6(5), 6-1 in last month's Rome championship match.Of course, Sinner has a valid excuse for losing that one–as if anyone needs an excuse for getting beat by Alcaraz. Rome was the world No. 1's first tournament back from a three-month suspension, so he did well simply to reach the final. In Paris, however, anything less than the title would be a disappointment. After all, the 23-year-old is atop the rankings with room to spare and he is only eight matches away from a “Sinner Slam”–holding all four major trophies at the same time. His bid is alive and well following French Open victories over Arthur Rinderknech, Richard Gasquet, Jiri Lehecka, Andrey Rublev, Alexander Bublik, and Novak Djokovic. Nobody–not even Djokovic–has taken a set.

If anything short of lifting La Coupe des Mousquetaires would be a disappointment for Sinner, anything less than this showdown turning into an instant classic would leave tennis fans unfulfilled. Why should expectations be any lower than that? These are by far the two best players on tour, with Sinner sporting an 18-1 record this season while Alcaraz is the ATP leader in wins (36) and titles (three). The recent Monte-Carlo and Rome champion finds himself in yet another final after taking out Giulio Zeppieri, Fabian Marozsan, Damir Dzumhur, Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul, and Lorenzo Musetti.In this match and perhaps even extending into the grass-court swing, Sinner's ban could be a blessing in disguise. While everyone else was slogging away on the grueling clay-court grind, the best player in the world was resting up. Now, to the surprise of no one, he is ready to pounce.Alcaraz still might have an advantage in a marathon match, as the 22-year-old's five-set record is impeccable (12-1, including 2-0 in slam finals). Sinner, though, could be able to wrap this up before it gets to that point. It is true that Alcaraz's peaks are more altitudinous than Sinner's on clay, but the No. 2 seed's valleys are considerably lower. In a best-of-five struggle on clay, it's usually the player with a higher floor that comes out on top against a player with a higher ceiling.Look for Sinner to equal his rival with four major titles overall, putting himself one step away from the career slam–and the Sinner Slam.Pick: Sinner in 4    1042WWW: Sinner vs. Alcaraz?

Wasnt me

Both finals are intriguing and could go either way.
I like the point that Sinner has been more consistent ,Alcaraz too up and down.
Tries for too many winners and makes more errors. I think Djokovic would have done better against Alcaraz than Sinner , so Ill go for the Carrot in five.

yup, I think Djoker would have had (somewhat of) a chance against Alcaraz

Plus I like Sinner better than Alcaraz, he quieter and doesnt show off as much.

agreed!

Yep, a different draw could've had a very different outcome.

There's still a chance he will win another one.

Tough to predict, should go to 5 sets, Sinner would be the first Italian to win it since Adriano Panatta in 1976.

Meanwhile Djokovic will continue on his journey of delusion, still believing he can win another major…

he can win Wimby

he won't, but he can

Guest agree it's getting tougher for him as he's not getting any younger, he's still beating the lesser players, but finding it harder against the top players now, still he has could do a Sampras and have that 1 last hurrah, and eek out one more GS, it won't be easy but if anyone can he can

Sinner seems to be playing better than Alcaraz, having said that when Alcaraz gets his head straight he's the best there is on this surface, somebody said the next Rafa, wouldn't go that far just yet, but maybe Guga lol

A long way off but if he's still playing, probably the AO

Tennis is in great hands with the new era

Andy Roddick predicted Novak Djokovic's Wimbledon finish during his recent podcast episode. The Serb impressed in the latter half of the 2025 clay season, finishing with an ATP 250 title and semifinal exit at the French Open.

Djokovic has been inconsistent in the past year, making deep runs at several events while also exiting early in a few. However, the last month has been fruitful for him. He bagged his 100th ATP Tour-level title with a triumph in Geneva before heading to the 2025 French Open.

In Paris, the 24-time Grand Slam champion defeated unseeded players in straight sets in the first four rounds. Next, he got the better of World No. 3 Alexander Zverev 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 in the quarterfinal. World No. 1 Jannik Sinner stopped the Serb from advancing further with a 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(3) win in the semifinal.

During a short podcast episode, where Roddick recapped Day 13 of the French Open, the American made a bold prediction.

Roddick believes that Djokovic's semifinal run at Roland Garros has significantly boosted his chances at Wimbledon. He noted that the Serb has now found the right rhythm for a Grand Slam, avoiding the long gap that often left him questioning whether to enter smaller events that offered little motivation.

Andy Roddick heaped praise on Novak Djokovic following his semifinal loss at the French Open. The American highlighted the 38-year-old's relentless effort and love for the sport. Despite being down two sets and struggling to gain control in rallies against Jannik Sinner, Djokovic continued to fight with the same passion he displayed early in his career.

Roddick added that these moments of ""limited upside"" are, in some ways, even more impressive than Djokovic's dominating Slam wins, as they reflect a deep love for the game.

LINK: ATP Tour Stuttgart Draw | ATP Tour ‘s-Hertogenbosch Draw | WTA ‘s-Hertogenbosch Draw | WTA London Draw

As summer nears, the tennis world shifts gears for the short but thrilling grass court season. Beginning June 9, 2025, three key tournaments mark the first week of play on the lawns of Europe: Stuttgart's BOSS Open, the dual-gender Libema Open in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, and the long-awaited return of WTA action to London's Queen's Club.

Let's take a closer look at the singles draws that promise to captivate fans across both the ATP Tour and WTA.

The ATP 250 event in Stuttgart once again lives up to its reputation as a player-favorite warm-up for Wimbledon. German No. 1 Alexander Zverev headlines the draw, hoping to lift the trophy on home soil and find his rhythm on grass.

He'll be joined by an electric mix of American firepower: Tommy Paul, Taylor Fritz, and Ben Shelton, all of whom have posted strong results on faster surfaces. Meanwhile, all eyes were set on Nick Kyrgios's return, although the unpredictable and entertaining Aussie has sadly had to withdraw from the entire grass-court season with continued injury concerns. 

This draw promises a dynamic blend of finesse and aggression, tailor-made for Stuttgart's slick courts.

Over in the Netherlands, the ATP 250 field at the Libema Open is equally stacked. Former World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev tops the draw, bringing his counterpunching brilliance to the grass, a surface he's grown increasingly comfortable on in recent years.

Joining him is Aussie speedster Alex de Minaur, whose ability to retrieve and redirect pace makes him a dark horse on this surface. Local hero Tallon Griekspoor will carry Dutch hopes, while France's Arthur Fils, one of the most exciting young players on the ATP Tour, looks to notch a statement win on grass.

Expect a wide-open affair with multiple potential champions.

The women's draw at the Libéma Open is quietly one of the week's most competitive. Big-serving Liudmila Samsonova, a proven grass-court performer and defending champion, returns to the Netherlands looking to repeat her 2023 success.

She'll face stiff opposition from compatriots Ekaterina Alexandrova, Veronika Kudermetova, and Anastasia Potapova, all of whom are capable of deep runs. Danielle Collins, fresh off a resurgence in form, adds an American flavor to the draw.

Other names to watch include Belgium's Elise Mertens, Poland's Magda Linette, and Colombian standout Camila Osorio. With a mix of seasoned veterans and rising stars, this draw is as balanced as it is unpredictable.

In a historic return, the WTA makes its long-awaited comeback to Queen's Club with the HSBC Women's Championships, the first WTA event at this venue in over five decades. The draw reads like a who's who of top-tier grass-court contenders.

Jessica Pegula, Elena Rybakina, and Petra Kvitova headline the field, each boasting powerful, efficient grass-court games. Rybakina, a former Wimbledon champion, and Kvitova, with two Wimbledon titles of her own, are likely favorites.

Americans Madison Keys and Amanda Anisimova bring their aggressive styles to London, while rising Chinese star Qinwen Zheng adds further intrigue. Former French Open finalist Barbora Krejcikova, Brazil's Beatriz Haddad Maia, and Canadian crowd favorite Leylah Fernandez round out a field that is loaded with title threats from top to bottom.

This event marks an important stepping stone for Wimbledon preparations—and with such a stacked lineup, fans are in for a treat.

From Stuttgart to ‘s-Hertogenbosch and now to London, the first week of grass court play in 2025 is shaping up to be one of the most compelling in years. With Grand Slam champions, breakout stars, and hometown favorites all in action, the stakes are high and the margins slim.

Whether you're following the big hitters in Germany, the all-court strategists in the Netherlands, or the power-laden battles in London, this week is the perfect start to the grass-court season. Stay tuned, because the road to Wimbledon begins here.

Which fellow ATP Tour star did Carlos Alcaraz draw as his ‘tennis twin'?


It was not based on playing style, but on their shared answers to our lighthearted Q&A, which covered everything from must-have travel essentials to favourite comfort food. The Spaniard and his tennis twin have an aligned music taste, which may have been the key answer in revealing his match.


Alcaraz has faced his tennis twin five times in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Can you guess who it is? Watch the full video below to find out.

 One of the hallmarks of a great rivalry is the way one player responds to the other's success. 

 Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are no different, according to Darren Cahill. On Sunday, Sinner and Alcaraz will meet in a Grand Slam championship match for the first time at Roland Garros. For Cahill, who has coached Sinner since 2022, the two players have, at different times, been motivated by a desire to keep up with the other. 

 “I know for a fact that with Carlos breaking through earlier than Jannik did, it pushed Jannik to be more professional and to address his physicality,” Cahill told TNT Sports. “He's spent the past three years dedicating all those weeks off to working on his body and his physique, to make sure he can last five sets in Grand Slams, so he can have the success he's having now. 

 “That's partly because of Carlos, for sure, and I think also Jannik being out of the game for the past four or five months has pushed Carlos to find ways to become better.”

 Before Sinner, Cahill also coached former World No. 1s Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt and Simona Halep. The Australian is more than familiar with the dynamics of top rivalries, although he was quick to point out some differences between the Sinner-Alcaraz relationship and some of those from past eras. 
 “I don't know that Andre and Pete [Sampras] liked each other too much back in the day,” recalled Cahill. “I don't think the [Jim] Courier, [Michael] Chang, Agassi, Sampras era [involved] going out to dinner [together] too much. A little more animosity back then, but times were different back then as well. 
 “Now Carlos and Jannik aren't going out to dinner together either, but they are mates. They're in the locker room, they're talking. I'm part of some of their conversations. I won't repeat what they are because most of it focuses around what 23-year-olds and 21-year-olds talk about, but they have fun, and they enjoy each other's company.”

 The man Sinner defeated in Friday's semi-finals, former World No. 1 and record 24-time major titlist Novak Djokovic, was also asked for his thoughts on two of his more recent rivals. 
 “They're definitely great for tennis, both of them. I think their rivalry is something that our sport needs, no doubt,” said Djokovic after his straight-sets semi-final defeat to Sinner on Friday night in Paris. “The way they are playing and the way they are approaching tennis life, I think they are going to have very successful careers in the next years. I'm sure that we're going to see them lifting the big trophies quite often.” 
 





 While acknowledging his excitement at taking on Alcaraz in a Grand Slam final for the first time, Sinner was reluctant to be drawn on any comparisons with the ‘Big Four' of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray. 
 “Oh, it takes time. It takes time to compare us with the Big Three or Big Four,"" said the Italian, who is chasing his third consecutive major title. ""I think only time can tell to be honest. For sure, from my point of view, [Carlos] is a player who makes me a better player. He pushes me to the limit. We try to understand where we have to improve for the next times I play against him. 
 “I believe that tennis or every sport needs rivalries. This could be potentially one of these, but there are amazing players coming up. There can be so many different and other players join, or one drops. You never know.”

...

Two years after winning her first Grand Slam title, Coco Gauff has taken home her second crown. The 21-year-old American — and the No. 2 player in the world — won the 2025 French Open with a strong 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 win over world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka on Saturday.

The victory at Roland-Garros came three years after Gauff last made the final, where she fell to Iga Światek in a disappointing loss. This time, she got to lift the trophy.

On a windy day in Paris, with rain threatening to fall, Sabalenka showed her power early in the match, taking a 4-1 lead in the first set. But Gauff rallied to tie Sabalenka and later force a tiebreaker. Sabalenka, who grew visibly frustrated, was able to win the tiebreak after a comeback of her own.

But the second set was all Gauff's: The young American controlled the pace, forcing the increasingly unhappy Sabalenka to make several crucial mistakes. In the third set, Gauff took an early lead, but Sabalenka stayed right behind her, finally getting some momentum of her own.

Sabalenka had a stunningly high number of errors throughout the match, finishing with 70 unforced errors. Gauff, who stayed calm the entire match, was able to take advantage of those in order to get the victory.

The final game was intense: Gauff dropped one championship point but came back to secure the game and the title. Sabalenka hit the ball just out of bounds, and Gauff immediately dropped to the floor, overwhelmed with emotion.

Gauff's win makes her the first American woman to take the French Open title in a decade, after Serena Williams won the Slam in 2015.

Notably, Gauff's second major title came in much the same way as her first. Gauff defeated Sabalenka to win the 2023 U.S. Open, beating the Belarusian in three sets after dropping the first set.

But both players are better than they were three years ago, even playing with very different styles. Sabalenka's strength tends to come from her power, whereas Gauff's typically comes from her quickness and creativity on the court.

Sabalenka will have to settle for second place after making her first French Open final, and she was emotional in the ceremony after the game. But the 27-year-old, who is the reigning U.S. Open winner, is much stronger on the hard court as opposed to the clay, and will have another chance at a title this summer.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"

            It's crunch time in Paris as we reach the business end of the French Open.
    


            World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka came through a battle against four-time winner and defending champion Iga Świątek to make the women's final where she will face American star Coco Gauff, who ended Lois Boisson's Cinderella story.
    


            Meanwhile, in the men's draw, Carlos Alcaraz defeated Italian star Lorenzo Musetti to make it to the final against world No. 1 Jannik Sinner.
    


            We look set for another memorable weekend of action on the iconic red clay of Roland Garros.
    


            Here's everything you need to know about one of the world's oldest tennis tournaments:
    


            Starting out as the “French Clay-Court Championships” in 1891 – allowing only players from France to compete – the French Open was officially created in 1925 when foreign players were first invited.
    


            In 1927, a new arena was purpose built for France's defense of its 1927 Davis Cup title and named after Roland Garros – not a sportsman, but a pioneering French aviator who was killed in World War I.
    


            The French Open is one of tennis' four grand slam tournaments along with Wimbledon, the US Open and the Australian Open – and the only one played on clay.
    


            But are the courts really made of clay? The answer is not much.
    


            Clay makes up just a small part of the tennis court, with 1-2 millimeters of crushed red bricks giving them their famous red hue.
    


            Playing on clay is considerably different to playing on grass or hard courts.
    


            Clay is more physically demanding as it is the slowest of the three surfaces, producing longer rallies, more running and more shots.
    


            Grueling five-set matches on clay can push players close to their physical limits.

Roland Garros: Why is clay the most difficult surface to play on?



            Matches on clay are also sometimes referred to as chess matches, where a well-placed shot can set up a winner two or three shots later.
    


            Clay also has considerably more friction than grass or hard courts, allowing the ball to grip to the dust and bounce much higher, in particular shots with heavy topspin.
    


            Even for a player as accomplished as Novak Djokovic, one of the sport's all-time greats, clay continues to be a tricky surface to master.
    


            “It's a very demanding surface,” Djokovic said after recently winning his first clay court match since completing the “Golden Slam” at the Paris Olympics.
    


            “We all know how tricky it is to play on clay; compared to the other surfaces, you always have to expect an extra one or two shots, balls coming back.”
    


            While Roland Garros is considered the pinnacle of the clay season, there are many other ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (Women's Tennis Association) tournaments played on the red dust.
    


            This year, there are 18 tournaments scheduled to be played on clay in the ATP Tour, while the women will play 11 clay court tournaments in 2025.
    


            But hard court is still the most popular surface on both tours in 2025. Hard court is also favored by US players as most of the American tournaments are played on that surface.
    


            While some smaller tournaments pay the male winner more than female players, all four grand slams offer equal prize money. The US Open was the first to award both tournament winners equal money in 1973 – something championed by Billie Jean King.
    


            The Australian Open followed suit 11 years later, offering men and women equal pay but reverted to paying men more in 1996. In 2001, they reversed course again and offered both men's and women's winners $440,000.
    


            Roland Garros implemented equal pay in 2006, and one year later Wimbledon committed to equal pay. Today, the four slams offer equal pay for each round of the draw.
    


            The last time Rafael Nadal – the most accomplished tennis player in history on clay – won the tournament was in 2023.
    


            In November 2024, the “King of Clay” played his final match of professional tennis when Spain lost in the Davis Cup. With 22 grand slams in his pocket – including a record 14 French Opens – we look at the new generation of tennis players who perform well on the red stuff.
    


            Will we ever see someone match Nadal's achievements on clay?
    


            What makes the French Open different to the other grand slams?
    


            With Paris being the fashion capital of the world, players have debuted some eye-catching outfits at Roland Garros.
    


            This year, Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen modeled a unique calf-length pleated skirt – inspired by Suzanne Lenglen's iconic style – though she said she is “too shy” to wear it on the court.

            However, the most famous of all the Roland Garros outfits has to be Serena Williams' superhero-esque ‘catsuit' she wore in 2018 just months after giving birth to her first child.
    


            The glitz and glamor of the tournament also draws celebrities from all walks of life, with singer/producer/composer Pharrell Williams, actor Ben Stiller and three-time Formula One world drivers champion Jackie Stewart among those in attendance last year.
    


            The French Open crowd is also known for being among the most boisterous on the tennis calendar.
    


            The famous chant taken from the pasodoble “En Er Mundo” can be heard across Roland Garros throughout the tournament's two weeks.
    


            Somebody in the crowd will sing “Popopopopopopo pololoooo!” with the rest of the arena responding with an: “Olééé!”
    


            We are guaranteed to see a brand new winner of the women's title – who will see their name etched in history this weekend: Sabalenka or Gauff?
    


            In the men's draw, can Alcaraz become the first man to go back-to-back since his idol Nadal in 2020 or will Sinner win his first French Open?

Andy Roddick predicted Novak Djokovic's Wimbledon finish during his recent podcast episode. The Serb impressed in the latter half of the 2025 clay season, finishing with an ATP 250 title and semifinal exit at the French Open.

Djokovic has been inconsistent in the past year, making deep runs at several events while also exiting early in a few. However, the last month has been fruitful for him. He bagged his 100th ATP Tour-level title with a triumph in Geneva before heading to the 2025 French Open.

In Paris, the 24-time Grand Slam champion defeated unseeded players in straight sets in the first four rounds. Next, he got the better of World No. 3 Alexander Zverev 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 in the quarterfinal. World No. 1 Jannik Sinner stopped the Serb from advancing further with a 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(3) win in the semifinal.

During a short podcast episode, where Roddick recapped Day 13 of the French Open, the American made a bold prediction.

Roddick believes that Djokovic's semifinal run at Roland Garros has significantly boosted his chances at Wimbledon. He noted that the Serb has now found the right rhythm for a Grand Slam, avoiding the long gap that often left him questioning whether to enter smaller events that offered little motivation.

Andy Roddick heaped praise on Novak Djokovic following his semifinal loss at the French Open. The American highlighted the 38-year-old's relentless effort and love for the sport. Despite being down two sets and struggling to gain control in rallies against Jannik Sinner, Djokovic continued to fight with the same passion he displayed early in his career.

Roddick added that these moments of ""limited upside"" are, in some ways, even more impressive than Djokovic's dominating Slam wins, as they reflect a deep love for the game.

Women will play at Queen's Club next week for the first time in more than 50 years at the inaugural HSBC Championships, featuring the likes of Raducanu, Katie Boulter and top-10 stars Madison Keys and Zheng Qinwen

Saturday 7 June 2025 18:15, UK

Emma Raducanu could face current Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova in the second round of the HSBC Championship at Queen's Club, which starts on Monday.

The 22-year-old will face a qualifier in the first round and could face Krejcikova after that if she comes through her match with Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova.

Raducanu will be in action for the first time since losing in straight sets to Iga Swiatek in the second round of the French Open last month.

The 2021 US Open champion's best results on clay saw her reach the round of 16 in both Rome and Strasbourg and she is now turning her attention to the grass court season where she is scheduled to play at Queen's and Berlin ahead of Wimbledon in early July.

Saturday's draw for the inaugural HSBC Championships also paired British No 1 Katie Boulter with a qualifier in her opening match.

If she advances to the second round, she will play either Diana Schnaider or Magdalena Frech.

Other British players competing in the first home tournament of the season include Francesca Jones, who will play American McCartney Kessler in the first round and could face world No 7 Qinwen Zheng in the second round.

Sonay Kartal will play Daria Kasatkina in the first match and might face fellow Brit Jodie Burrage, who will play Amanda Anisimova in the first round.

Queen's returns to the WTA calendar after a 52-year absence with Zheng the highest ranked player in the field after world No 3 Jessica Pegula withdrew last week.

2024 US Open runner-up Pegula was set to be the highest ranked player in the draw, but the American withdrew along with Japan's four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka on Thursday.

The four highest-ranked players in the draw - Zheng, Madison Keys, Emma Navarro and Elena Rybakina were all handed byes into the second round.

The tournament will run from June 9-15.

The Lawn Tennis Association has committed to paying equal prize money to female players at Queen's and Eastbourne by 2029.

The LTA announced on Thursday it would pay total prize money of $1.415m (approximately £1m), the highest for a WTA 500 event of its draw size this year.

But that is still less than half of the prize pot that will be paid out to the male players the following week for the equivalent tournament on the ATP Tour.

At the Lexus Eastbourne Open, a joint WTA and ATP event staged the week before Wimbledon beginning on June 23, the difference is even starker, with the women's prize fund of $389,000 (approximately £287,000) significantly inferior to the more than £630,000 that will be paid to the men.

While prize money is equal at the grand slams and some joint tour events, generally remuneration on the WTA Tour is substantially lower than the ATP.

Scott Lloyd, the governing body's chief executive, said: ""We are making significant increases this year to the women's prize money at Queen's and Eastbourne and want to achieve equal prize money as soon as possible.""

Jim Courier has outlined what he'll be looking out for at Wimbledon to confirm if Novak Djokovic is close to retiring from the sport.

The Serbian superstar fought well last night against the overwhelming favourite, arguably providing Jannik Sinner with his toughest challenge of the tournament thus far.

However, his efforts were in vain, and he subsequently lost in straight sets.

It was a frustrating and unfair reflection of how the match went, but Sinner was just too good.

Novak Djokovic, clearly demoralised by the nature of the result, seemed to bid farewell to Roland Garros in a more emotional way than many expected. This has sparked mass fear of his potential retirement.

Speaking live on TNT Sports' US coverage just last night, naturally Djokovic was the main topic of conversation.

After all, not only had he put in a strong showing against the world number one, but the manner in which he exited Philippe Chatrier left many wondering whether the French Open would ever see him again.

Kissing the clay that has brought him so much success, Courier theorised that, whilst retirement might not be imminent, one thing would confirm its proximity that he'll keep an eye on at Wimbledon.

He stated: ‘I will say this, too: My big takeaway from this match is if I see his emotional state like this at Wimbledon and at the US Open, when he's playing a match of this magnitude against a player of this magnitude, and he's not snarling, if he's smiling. Yeah, he's on his way out. 

‘I mean, time's undefeated, but that was not representative of the emotional state when he's played his best tennis. He's always looking for edges in angles and things to get him motivated. He was smiling in combat. 

‘That's Alcaraz's MO. That's never been Novak's.

It should come as no surprise to suggest that Djokovic could compete at Wimbledon, but now more than ever his chances of success are amplified.

After all, given the torrid form he has suffered for the bulk of 2025, many had written him off, especially heading into the slow, laborious clay-court Grand Slam.

However, his 38-year-old body held strong, despite Djokovic admitting he was carrying an injury, and took him into the semi-finals.

He performed so admirably, and will likely only get better on a surface where he has enjoyed supreme levels of success.

If he is to win that coveted record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title, Wimbledon is likely his best bet.

Djokovic has given himself the perfect platform to head back to Centre Court full of confidence and belief that he can once again challenge at the apex of the sport.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

Coco Gauff claimed her first French Open title by beating Aryna Sabalenka in windy conditions on Saturday, winning 6-7, 6-2, 6-4.

The world's top two tennis players met at Roland Garros, with both of them chasing their maiden French Open title. World No. 2 Gauff, who already has a huge net worth after a record-breaking payday last year, went into the event with just one Grand Slam to her name, the 2023 U.S. Open.

Top-ranked Sabalenka, meanwhile, boasted three major titles, having previously won the Australian Open twice and last year's U.S. Open. She went into Saturday's match as the favorite after beating Gauff on clay at the Madrid Open final last month.

Sabalenka made the perfect start in Paris by winning the first set 7-6. But Gauff, the 21-year-old, immediately bounced back by winning the second set 6-2. She then got the job done during a nervy final game, just managing to hold her serve to win 6-4.

Gauff is the first American to win the women's singles at Roland Garros since Serena Williams picked up her third and final French Open title in 2015.

""I am emotional,"" said British tennis star Naomi Broady on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I think it's since I've had children. It is the reaction of her (Gauff's) mum and dad as she makes her way up to the box. They are the first people she sees.

""Her mum was ready and waiting, her dad sprinted down the stairs. The three of them just enjoyed an embrace down there together. It's very much a team effort in Team Coco.""

Sablenka said after the match: ""This one hurts so much. Especially after such a tough two weeks.

""Playing great tennis and then in these terrible conditions to show such terrible tennis in the final, it really hurts. But it's OK. Anyway, Coco, congrats. In these tough conditions, you were a better player than me. Well done on a great two weeks.

""Congrats on the second slam. You're a fighter. Hard worker. Congrats to you and your team.""

Wind in Paris made Saturday's match tough for both players, with only 15 service games won and 13 double faults made.

Greg Rusedski, the former British No. 1 who lost to Patrick Rafter in the 1997 U.S. Open final, noticed the brutal conditions in Paris while commentating on BBC Radio 5 Live.

""It is gusty out there! Look at the ball kids' shirts,"" said Rusedski during the first set. ""The wind is really spinning in this stadium, so I think this is going to be a tricky opening game for Coco Gauff, especially with her service toss.""

Rusedski went on to compare the match to a ""yo-yo."" He then added during the second set: ""These conditions are so mentally challenging.

""If you just turn off for one second, the ball can just get away from you very quickly because of the gusts of wind. Both players are having to move their footwork constantly.

""These are some of the most difficult conditions to play in, especially when you're trying to win your first French Open title.""

Coco Gauff has won the French Open for the first time by defeating top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 in Saturday's final.

The second-ranked Gauff came out on top of a contest that was full of tension and momentum swings to claim her second major trophy after the 2023 U.S Open, where she also came from a set down to beat Sabalenka in the final.

Watch NBC6 free wherever you are

It was the first No. 1 vs. No. 2 final in Paris since 2013, when Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova, and just the second in the last 30 years.

After Sabalenka sent a backhand wide on Gauff's second match point, the 21-year-old American fell onto her back, covering her face with both hands before resting her forehand on the clay. After greeting Sabalenka at the net, she hugged film director Spike Lee and celebrated with her entourage, three years after she lost in her first final at Roland-Garros.

Sabalenka started the deciding set strongly, sticking to her high-risk approach to hold her first service game.

Gauff responded by raising her level, winning a superb rally in the third game that drew loud cheers and applause from the crowd. After an intense exchange of drop shots, Gauff hit a lob that Sabalenka chased down before attempting a shot between her legs — only for Gauff to intercept it at the net and finish with a winner.

Gauff was consistent from the baseline and earned a break point which she converted when Sabalenka double-faulted, giving her a 2-1 lead. Sabalenka turned toward her box and shouted in frustration but then regained her composure, breaking back to level the match at 3-3. 

She was broken again at love, however, and Gauff then held serve twice to claimed the title after a match that lasted 2 hours, 38 minutes.

Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff are familiar foes, especially when it comes to the latter stages of tournaments.

The pair meet for the third time with a trophy on the line in Saturday's French Open final, with a seven-figure prize on the line.

In May's Madrid Open, with Sabalenka reigned victorious with a 6-3, 7-6 win. 

But the 2023 US Open was the American's time to shine.

Gauff was just 19 when she took on Sabalenka, who had already won a major that year at the Australian Open, and many expected her to claim her second. 

When the first set went to Sabalenka 6-2, many would have been forgiven for thinking the match was already a foregone conclusion.

However, what followed was one of the most thrilling comebacks in a major final as Gauff rallied to win the next two sets 6-3, 6-2 as Sabalenka uncharacteristically collapsed and lost all composure in her tennis. 

The result left both players emotional, with Sabalenka unwilling to hide hers as she stormed to her bench and began to uncontrollably cry. 

When asked in her post-match interview what she's most proud of from this year, she fought back tears again as she said: ""I don't know.""

That match still haunts the 26-year-old to this day, who admitted that while she has learnt lessons, she still gets flashbacks from it. 

""That was very difficult match, I got a little emotional and had this little flashback on last year's final, meaning the crowd atmosphere,"" said after the 2024 US Open final.

For Gauff, the 21-year-old admitted that she was surprised she cried, as it's something that she and her Dad never do.

""I do never cry but the US Open happened. I wasn't expecting that, okay? Y'all say what you want, I was not expecting that,"" she said on Instagram at the time.

""I don't think I was crying, to be honest, I think that girl in the video was crying because I don't like to cry. Not in front of people, I'll cry alone, I'll cry over a movie or a TV show but in front of people, no.

""Because I'm supposed to be a thug. Just kidding. I'm like my dad though, for real. Today was the first time I've ever seen my dad cry. He doesn't want me to tell y'all that but he got caught in 4K. He thinks he's so hard but he's not.""

Since that US Open final, the pair have met four times - three semifinals and one final - with Sabalenka winning the most recent clash at the Madrid Open

Their overall record is now tied at 5-5, and after their last contest, the pair hailed each other for an incredible tournament.

""First I want to congratulate Coco and her team on an incredible few weeks here,"" Sabalenka said.

""I'm super happy to see you back in the finals, playing your best tennis.

Gauff shared positive sentiment towards her opponent as well.

""I'd like to congratulate Aryna on an incredible tournament. You're always tough to face. Congrats to your team.

""Congrats on all the success you've been having.”

Gauff came into the final as the No.4-ranked player in the world.

With the victory, Sabalenka has her 46th-ranked win over a top-10 opponent, with six consecutive triumphs and 12 consecutive sets.

Coco Gauff, the 21-year-old American tennis star, has defeated Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open women's singles final to claim the second Grand Slam title of her young career.

Saturday's final between Sabalenka and Gauff, who are respectively ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the world, was the first Grand Slam women's final to feature the world's top two players since 2018. Gauff is the first American champion at the French Open since Serena Williams in 2015.

The two players battled over three sets. After Sabalenka won the first set 7-6, Gauff stormed back to dominate the second set, 6-2, before outlasting the Belarusian player 6-4 in a gutsy final set. After Sabalenka's final volley landed just wide of the line, Gauff collapsed to the red clay of Roland-Garros, her hands high in the air.

""I don't think either of us were playing great,"" Gauff said in an interview with TNT after the match. ""But I knew as soon as I stepped on to the court when I felt that it was windy that it would be one of those matches. So I was just trying to give myself the best chance and fight every point.""

Gauff had reached the final after defeating fellow American Madison Keys, No. 7, in the quarterfinal, then breezing past the crowd darling Lois Boisson, the French player ranked just No. 361 who had mounted a thrilling Cinderella run at the Open. On the other side of the bracket was the imposing Sabalenka, who ascended to the world's No. 1 spot last year after winning in Australia and the U.S. Open in New York. Sabalenka had toppled the Polish star Iga Swiatek, winner of the past three consecutive French Opens, in the semifinal.

Gauff burst into the tennis world as a teenager — including a juniors title at Roland-Garros in 2018, her first career junior Grand Slam win.

Americans have won both women's Grand Slam titles so far this year. Gauff's victory follows Keys' title at the Australian Open in January.

The French Open men's final between No. 1 Jannik Sinner and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz is set for Sunday.

After a slow start in the first set, Coco Gauff staked her claim as one of this season's queens of clay, storming back to upset top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 in a sloppy, mistake-filled French Open final on Saturday.

It's the second Grand Slam title for the 21-year-old Gauff, who adds the 2023 U.S. Open crown to her triumphs. Gauff, who had split the previous 10 matches with Sabalenka, became the first American woman to win the French Open singles title since Serena Williams in 2015, despite eight double faults and having trouble with her serve at times in the match that took two hours and 37 minutes.

Down 3-1 in the third set, the Belarus native broke Gauff to even the match at three, but was broken again in the seventh game, as the rain started to come down at Court Philippe-Chatrier with the roof remaining open, but couldn't maintain the momentum.

Sabalenka, who had 70 unforced errors and six double faults, was clearly frustrated with her play at times, yelling at her coaches in the stands after a shot out of play or into the net and nearly hitting a kid running after a ball following one of those mistakes. Despite the loss, Sabalenka will keep the No. 1 spot in the next WTA rankings.

After winning the first game of the match, Gauff was broken in the third and fifth games. Sabalenka neutralized Gauff's serve, sprinting out to a 4-1 lead and a 40-love lead in the next game. But Gauff showed resilience, breaking back after losing seven straight points on serve before saving a triple break point.

Sabalenka was broken again in the eighth game, and Gauff squared up the match, thanks to the top-seed unraveling, at one point losing 12 straight points.

In a recurring theme, Sabalenka, who had four double faults and 32 unforced errors, thanks to a nearly 30 mph gusting wind, and Gauff took turns breaking each other's serve, including Gauff getting the upper hand in a 13-minute 10th game. The hour and 17-minute set went to a tiebreak, with Gauff taking the first three points, before Sabalenka stormed back to take the set 7-6.

Here's a recap of the French Open women's final:

In the second set, it was Gauff who got out to a 4-1 lead, and Sabalenka continued to pile up the unenforced errors. After racking up 32 unforced errors in the first set, Sabalenka added 15 more, as Gauff settled down and blitzed the three-time major winner, taking the second set 6-2.

On to the third and deciding set, in what has been a thrilling, yet mistake-filled final.

After winning the first game of the match, Coco Gauff was broken in the third and fifth games as Aryna Sabalenka neutralized Gauff's serve, sprinting out to a 4-1 lead and a 40-love lead in the next game. But Gauff showed resilience, breaking back after losing seven straight points on serve before saving a triple break point.

Sabalenka was broken again in the eighth game and Gauff squared up the match, thanks to the top-seed unraveling, at one point losing 12 straight points. In a recurring theme, Sabalenka, who had four double faults and 32 unforced errors, thanks to a nearly 30 mph gusting wind, and Gauff took turns breaking each other's serve, including Gauff getting the upper hand in a 13-minute 10th game. The hour-and-18-minute set went to a tiebreak, with Gauff taking the first three points before Sabalenka stormed back to take the set 7-6.

The head-to-head matchup between Gauff and Sabalenka is tied 5-5 overall, 1-1 in majors and 1-1 on clay. Most recently, Sabalenka edged out Gauff 6-3, 7-6 to win in the Madrid finals on clay in Spain last month. 

Their last meeting in a major came in the semifinals of the 2024 Australian Open, where Sabalenka defeated Gauff 7-6, 6-4 on a hard court. Before that, Gauff defeated Sabalenka 2-6, 6-3 in the 2023 U.S. Open final – also on hard court – to claim the first Grand Slam singles title of her career.

The French Open women's final between American Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus is set for Saturday at 9 a.m. ET (3 p.m. in Paris).

The French Open women's final between Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka will be broadcast live on TNT.

A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

Here's the full rundown of who is playing at the 2025 French Open today.

Coco Gauff defeated Aryna Sabalenka in three sets on Saturday to win the French Open, marking the first time the 21-year-old has won at Roland Garros in her young career. 

To claim her second career Grand Slam title, Gauff won the three-set battle (6-7, 6-2, 6-4) to beat Sabalenka. After the victory, Gauff expressed nothing but respect for Sabalenka, the No.1 ranked player in the world. 

“I'd like to congratulate Aryna,"" Gauff said. ""You're a fighter. You're the #1 player in the world. I know today was a tough match, but you deserve all the results you've been having. Every time we play, it's such a tough match for me. Congratulations. Hopefully we play many more.”

Sabalenka fought back tears acknowledging the loss hurt, especially after not playing her best tennis, but she was congratulatory of Gauff on the well-earned victory. 

""Coco, congrats,"" Sabalenka said. ""In these tough conditions you were a better player than me. Well done on a great two weeks. Congrats on the second Grand Slam, well deserved here. You're a fighter, hard worker, so congrats to you and your team.""

Entering Saturday's matchup, Gauff and Sabalenka had previously faced off twice in majors and split those matchups 1-1. Gauff beat Sabalenka in the 2023 U.S. Open final to win her first Grand Slam, while Sabalenka won the most recent Grand Slam matchup between the two, defeating Gauff in the 2024 Australian Open semifinals. 

There will surely be more matchups to come between the two great competitors. Sabalenka has three Grand Slam titles but is still seeking her first French Open win, and Gauff is now up to two Grand Slam victories.

Aryna Sabalenka continues to dominate the sport of tennis, with the Belarus native at No. 1 in the world and Grand Slam wins at the Australian Open and U.S. Open, plus a finals appearance at the 2025 French Open.

And if you're wondering: does she have a boyfriend? The answer is: yes!

As we've written before: ""She's also spoken about how happy she is with her current boyfriend, Georgios Frangulis. The Brazilian owner of brand Oakberry and the tennis star went Instagram official in May of 2024 ... and he's been seen at her matches ever since.""

Are they still together? That answer is yes, given the photo of Sabalenka and Frangulis that popped up on her Instagram page while they were in France as she competed in the Grand Slam:

She's said some lovely things about him as they've dated, including this Instagram post in 2024:

He's been extremely supportive as she's risen to the top of the tennis world, and it's great to see them still together as she tries to win more Grand Slams.","{'href': 'https://ftw.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","tennis"

 One of the hallmarks of a great rivalry is the way one player responds to the other's success. 

 Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are no different, according to Darren Cahill. On Sunday, Sinner and Alcaraz will meet in a Grand Slam championship match for the first time at Roland Garros. For Cahill, who has coached Sinner since 2022, the two players have, at different times, been motivated by a desire to keep up with the other. 

 “I know for a fact that with Carlos breaking through earlier than Jannik did, it pushed Jannik to be more professional and to address his physicality,” Cahill told TNT Sports. “He's spent the past three years dedicating all those weeks off to working on his body and his physique, to make sure he can last five sets in Grand Slams, so he can have the success he's having now. 

 “That's partly because of Carlos, for sure, and I think also Jannik being out of the game for the past four or five months has pushed Carlos to find ways to become better.”

 Before Sinner, Cahill also coached former World No. 1s Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt and Simona Halep. The Australian is more than familiar with the dynamics of top rivalries, although he was quick to point out some differences between the Sinner-Alcaraz relationship and some of those from past eras. 
 “I don't know that Andre and Pete [Sampras] liked each other too much back in the day,” recalled Cahill. “I don't think the [Jim] Courier, [Michael] Chang, Agassi, Sampras era [involved] going out to dinner [together] too much. A little more animosity back then, but times were different back then as well. 
 “Now Carlos and Jannik aren't going out to dinner together either, but they are mates. They're in the locker room, they're talking. I'm part of some of their conversations. I won't repeat what they are because most of it focuses around what 23-year-olds and 21-year-olds talk about, but they have fun, and they enjoy each other's company.”

 The man Sinner defeated in Friday's semi-finals, former World No. 1 and record 24-time major titlist Novak Djokovic, was also asked for his thoughts on two of his more recent rivals. 
 “They're definitely great for tennis, both of them. I think their rivalry is something that our sport needs, no doubt,” said Djokovic after his straight-sets semi-final defeat to Sinner on Friday night in Paris. “The way they are playing and the way they are approaching tennis life, I think they are going to have very successful careers in the next years. I'm sure that we're going to see them lifting the big trophies quite often.” 
 





 While acknowledging his excitement at taking on Alcaraz in a Grand Slam final for the first time, Sinner was reluctant to be drawn on any comparisons with the ‘Big Four' of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray. 
 “Oh, it takes time. It takes time to compare us with the Big Three or Big Four,"" said the Italian, who is chasing his third consecutive major title. ""I think only time can tell to be honest. For sure, from my point of view, [Carlos] is a player who makes me a better player. He pushes me to the limit. We try to understand where we have to improve for the next times I play against him. 
 “I believe that tennis or every sport needs rivalries. This could be potentially one of these, but there are amazing players coming up. There can be so many different and other players join, or one drops. You never know.”

Lilli Tagger makes history as the first Austrian to win the French Open junior girls' singles title, defeating Hannah Klugman 6-2, 6-0. Coached by former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone, the unseeded 17-year-old claimed her first major title without dropping a set, beating four seeds including world No. 1 Emerson Jones.

Lilli Tagger has made history for her country at the French Open as the first Austrian to win the junior girls' singles title.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores

The unseeded Tagger, 17, defeated eighth-seeded Hannah Klugman of Great Britain 6-2, 6-0 in Saturday's final to seal her first major title without losing a set. It follows the first pro-level title she won in March -- a W35 event in Terrassa, Spain on the ITF World Tennis Tour -- where she beat, coincidentally enough, surprise Roland Garros women's semifinalist Lois Boisson. 

Unseeded in Paris, Tagger was a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open in January, and beat four seeds in her clay-court triumph. In addition to Klugman, she knocked off world No. 1 Australian Emerson Jones in the semifinals, after having beaten third seed Jeline Vandromme of Belgium in her first match and No. 12 seed Julia Stusek of Germany in the third round.

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

And Tagger's triumph was significant not just for herself and for Austria, but for her coach as well. She has been working with Francesca Schiavone since October of 2023, and 15 years ago, the Italian won the Roland Garros women's title. The teenager, like Schiavone hits her backhand with one hand.

She has developed the shot over the last five years -- after winning a bet she made with her coach to make the switch if she won a local under-12 tournament -- and says that ahead of the match, Schiavone helped her just as much with the intangibles as she did tactics.

""I think it was two days ago when I watched the video of [Schiavone] winning here. I mean, she's are the queen of the clay,"" Tagger said with a smile. 

""The most important thing she told me [was] to go out there, enjoy the moment, and try to, even if it wasn't that easy, but try to stay calm and focus on my goal,"" she added.

An unseeded pair also triumphed in the girls' doubles final: Germans Eva Bennemann and Sonja Zhenikhova rallied from a set behind to defeat third-seeded Czech sisters Alena Kovackova and Jana Kovackova 4-6, 6-4, [10-8].

A year-by-year ""what if"" filling in a century-long gap of Academy Awards recognition for noteworthy stunt artistry and design in Hollywood movies. 


							By 

	Thomas Doherty



	Any list of Hollywood's most memorable stunt work is bound to be idiosyncratic. Do you prefer a jaw-dropping action set piece with the star visibly and unmistakably at risk (as with the silent comedians and, more recently, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Jackie Chan and Tom Cruise); a feat by a nameless stunt double whose fate you're not emotionally invested in (presumably with the Wilhelm scream sounding his demise); or the choreography of battalions of humans in league with horses, trains, cars or planes (in which case Plutarch deserves a posthumous credit as stunt coordinator on Spartacus). 


	Even the definition of a “stunt” is hard to pin down. For precision driving, flying, fighting and falling, the very word seems to trivialize the skill set. After all, “stunt” had also been Hollywood parlance for a cheesy publicity ploy or exploitation tie-in. Now, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has formalized a plan for its stunt design Oscar category, which will first be presented at the 100th honors in 2028.


	In that spirit, here is a close read, year-by-year, from the start of the Academy Awards onward, on some of the most noteworthy stunt artistry in Hollywood cinema over the course of the last century — and which films may have claimed Oscar gold. (One note regarding the list below: So as not to skew the sample, the Bond, Bourne, and Cruise franchises have been rationed. And feel free to argue.)


	Buster Keaton's lifetime of (literally) death-defying stunt work may have crossed the line from risky to foolhardy here: the side of a whole building falls down onto Buster, but his standing figure fits neatly into the upstairs window. There was no margin for error: an inch off in measurement or a sudden gust of wind and he would have been flattened.


	This entry fudges a bit on the timeline, but no litany of great stunt work can omit the four-eyed comedian Harold Lloyd. In Speedy, Lloyd — or rather his stunt double for the most dangerous turns — barrels through the streets of New York at the reins of a horse-drawn trolley. In an unplanned accident left in the film, the trolley crashes into a pillar of the old IRT elevated subway. The driver goes flying.  “No one was hurt and it was a miracle that the horses were saved,” reported Variety. In 1919, Lloyd had lost a thumb and finger from his right hand in an explosion (not a stunt) during a publicity shoot, so his strength and dexterity throughout his “thrill films” is all the more remarkable.


	The choreography of the biplanes buzzing like swarms of mosquitos in Hells' Angels (1930) is the obvious choice, but the flyers in Howard Hawk's The Dawn Patrol (1930) were also aces. The nod goes to Hawks because the 46 stunt flyers who took to the air for simulated combat in his film all returned to the ground safely. 


	“This was before the special effects boys learned how to make ‘exploding' bullets as safe as cap guns,” recalled James Cagney, who played the title gangster. When Cagney ducks down an aisle behind a “stone” wall, a former WWI machine gunner off screen opened fire. “The wall crumbled to sawdust, and so would I had I been there two seconds before,” gulped Cagney.  


	At a time when the competition in aerial acrobatics was fierce, the stunt flying in John Ford's salute to the right stuff of aerial postal workers was praised as “sensational,” “breathtaking” and “hair raising.”  The topper comes when a hotdog flyer buzzes an airfield and zooms his biplane not once but three times through the length of a hanger.


	The U.S. Army Air Corps planes buzzing the Empire State Building are real, hired off the books (and without filing an official flight path) by producer and former Great War pilot Merian C. Cooper.  In the studio insert, that's Cooper and his partner, director Ernest B. Schoedsack, in the cockpit machine gunning Kong. “It is a great piece of imagination, hatched in the brain of a showman for showmen, produced in grand style and good taste, and most capably acted and directed,” read THR‘s 1933 review.


	 “Thrilling as a bugle call, vivid as a campfire flame, vital as the crimsoned pages that he lived, Pancho Villa marches again to the mad music of ‘La Cucaracha!” blurbed the New York American of Jack Conway's biopic of the Mexican revolutionary, packed with spectacular equestrian battle scenes and featuring a genuine Vorkapich montage.   


	Henry Hathaway wrangled 1,200 humans and countless horses on an 88-day shoot over four locations and 40 studio sets. It was a notoriously jinxed production: myriad extras and stunt people hobbled away with broken bones, animal trainer Melvin Scufe was hospitalized from a camel bite, and star Franchot Tone fell twelve feet and was knocked out cold while fighting Gary Cooper.


	Another great Howard Hawks aerial drama in which no one got killed. “There is nothing more thrilling on screen that an airplane taking off and landing,” once said Hawks. In its assessment, THR was approving of the Warner Bros. production. “An exciting comedy drama of commercial aviation which has the authentic feel of the game and is up to the minute in its display of the inside workings,” the paper's 1935 review read. “Handsomely produced, well directed and enacted by an excellent cast of twenty with James Cagney and Pat O'Brien at its head, this offering is headed for substantial returns up and down the scale.”


	Special effects magic and adroit stunt work, from pros, extras, and stars bring to life the Category 5 meteorological event that climaxes John Ford's South Sea adventure romance. A breathless trade reporter marveled at how the “six 12-cylinder wind machines roared in deep-throated synchronicity to send showers of blinding spray about huddled groups of natives, and tons of water were sent hurling down 65-foot inclines to engulf principles struggling in a tank below. The effect to the eye was blind chaos.” No one drowned. 


	The Technicolor theatricality of Michael Curtiz's men in tights shenanigans may disguise how dangerous the air can get with all those swords slashing and arrows zipping around. In one scene, arrows were shot from a distance of 100 feet on a 40-foot elevation at two stunt men wearing wooden breastplates. “The stooges were knocked flat by the impact!” chortled THR at the time.


	The sequence of Yakima Canutt falling under a team of six stagecoach horses and the stagecoach remains the platonic ideal of Hollywood stunt work. In costume as an attacking Indian, he leaps at full gallop from his horse and lands between the front two horses pulling the stagecoach. Falling between the horses, he is dragged along the ground until he lets go and lies flat as the horses and the stagecoach pass over him. (Steven Spielberg could not resist repurposing the stunt in Raiders of the Lost Ark [1981], with a truck subbing for a stagecoach.) Canutt considered the exploit (“stunt” seems too trivial a description) his personal best. “A whale of a good story that has brilliant direction, writing and acting,” THR wrote in its 1939 review.


	The prolific Michael Curtiz concocted one of Yakima Canutt's trademark stunts in this popular Errol Flynn western hailed as “sure-fire box office smash” by THR at the time. Doubling for Flynn, Canutt rides one horse leading another horse. His horse gets shot and falls, Canutt grabs the saddle horn of the other horse, and, pony express style, bounces up into the saddle of the second horse. “This was a good gag and I wondered why I hadn't thought of it myself,” said Canutt.


	During WWII, the most exhilarating onscreen action was in the newsreels and the combat reports performed by GIs who were not members of the Screen Actors Guild. “Hollywood will be called upon by the government to increase its efforts for the building of patriotism and boosting of the sales of defense bonds and stamps; the former will be achieved via motion pictures, and the latter by personal appearances and shorts,” THR wrote in December 1941, shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack. 


	Directed by and starring Laurence Olivier, the British import — a medieval war film informed by the ongoing mechanized war — was shot in 1944 and released stateside in 1946.  The staging of the climactic battle on St. Crispin's Day in 1415 featured hundreds of knights on horseback in a melee of Technicolor bloodletting that had critics musing about the more recent conflagration. The British “won the battle with the atom bomb of the day, the longbow,” noted Variety at the time.  


	A mishap that occurred during Cecil B. DeMille's frontier action adventure shows the danger of even seemingly routine stunt work. As Variety unsentimentally described it that year: “Three stuntmen were badly injured on location at Cooks Forest outside of Pittsburgh. The men were hurt while filming a scene which called for them to swing from their horses, grab onto a limb and disappear into the tree foliage. Instead, they landed in a hospital.”


	Howard Hawks yet again. The fabled 1,000-mile cattle drive from the Rio Grande to Abilene is recreated with startling verisimilitude thanks to a battalion of hardworking horsemen and tens of thousands of cattle who look lethal even when not stampeding. “The picture would be notable on one count — if no other — the magnificent action material that is accomplished in the movement of the huge cattle herd across the western plains, an element of the story that reaches an electrifying climax,” praised THR‘s review.


	In a beautiful display of equestrian skill, shot by John Ford in a valorizing long take, ranch hand turned stunt double turned actor Ben Johnson jumps on a horse and rides into the distance at breakneck speed, man and beast like a single creature. THR‘s review called it “the finest outdoor picture produced in Hollywood for a very long time.”


	Directed by Jacques Tourneur, the Burt Lancaster swashbuckler warrants a look not so much for its dauntless gymnastics — Lancaster was a trained acrobat who routinely did his own stunts — but because the authenticity of the stunt work incited a prolonged legal battle over truth in stunt advertising.  Unbeknownst to Jack Warner, the publicity department at Warner Bros. came up with its own stunt and offered $1,000,000 to anyone who could prove Lancaster did not do his own stunts in the film. An extra on the set claimed to have proof Lancaster cheated and claimed the bounty. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled that Lancaster had in fact performed all his dangerous stunts, and had used a stand-in only briefly, to rest between scenes, not to avoid risk. 


	Director William Wellman's female-centric western should be better known. At the time, THR deemed it a “a big, sprawling, tremendously dramatic drama of pioneer days whose high artistic and dramatic content inevitably bracket it with such memorable outdoor narratives as Stage Coach.” Through sheer force of will, assisted by Robert Taylor and a hardy crew of stunt men and women, the frontier ladies drive and drag their Conestoga wagons through rivers and over mountains to get to the promised land of California — and their husbands.


	Six-year-old Steven Spielberg was mesmerized by the (miniature work) train wreck in Cecil B. DeMille's three ring circus, but the daring trapeze artistry and risky proximity to elephants will impress older viewers. DeMille boasted that his stars really risked their lives for the film. THR‘s review hailed “a big, seething SHOW, spectacular, exciting, colorful. It is a mighty pageant set against the fascinating panorama of billowing canvas, sawdust, bright-red wagons, calliopes and people who live the life of circus mummers because to them there is no other.”


	It's hard to tell who's a stunt man and who's an exploited “native bearer” in John Ford's remake of Red Dust (1932), shot on location in Kenya (during a Mau Mau uprising), Tanganyika, Uganda, and what was then known as French Equatorial Africa and the Belgian Congo. Three of the crew were killed in road accidents, but only assistant director John Hancock, an Englishman, seems to have been mentioned in the trade press. 


	Ben Chapman and Ricou Browning played the Gill-Man, with Browning doing most of the underwater sequences for the amphibian, holding his breath for up to four minutes. THR wrote in its review at the time: “a good piece of science-fiction of the beauty and the beast school, the beast in this case being a monstrous combination of man and fish. It makes for solid horror-thrill entertainment”


	Of all the classical Hollywood genres, westerns took the biggest toll on men and animals. In this Anthony Mann western, stuntman Frosty Royce was stricken with a heart attack while riding a horse on the ridge of Devil's Backbone. Forty-three years old, twenty-three years in the business, he was finally forced to hang up his spurs.


	At three and a half hours, Dino De Laurentiis and King Vidor's VistaVision spectacle seems almost as long as Tolstoy's novel, but the logistics are a marvel of second unit and stunt work. THR wrote at the time in a review that the production “is on a lavish scale comparable only to a handful of motion film pictures in history and it will stand up to comparison with the great ones.” Motion Picture Daily was in awe of “the maneuverings of thousands of men and horses, the depiction of the destruction of Moscow, the evacuation of the city and its occupation by Napoleon's army, and the eventual disastrous retreat of the French over the thousands of miles of scorched and frozen earth.”


	Set in a Japanese prison camp during WWII, David Lean's epic was shot in sweltering Sri Lanka under conditions that cast and crew semi-jokingly compared to the original. A stuntman and a prop man were nearly drowned during the climactic bridge explosion. The end result was a movie that drew raves: “if ever there was a nearly perfect motion picture in every way, this Sam Spiegel production for Columbia is it,” wrote THR in a review calling it a “magnificent war epic” in the headline. 


	Before the banditry of Burt Reynolds, Robert Mitchum smuggled moonshine through the back roads of Appalachia and left Treasury Department agents in the rear-view mirror. After all, says Mitchum, a man has a right to make whiskey on his own land. “Carey Loftin's ingenuity in rigging the exciting chases and motor crashes rates him high among Hollywood's stunt men,” wrote THR, giving name credit to a player usually overlooked. 


	Yakima Canutt again, now in harness as stunt coordinator, trained 80 Yugoslavian horses and Stephen Boyd and Charlton Heston to master a sport not held in a coliseum since the Vandals sacked Rome in 455 AD or at least since the earlier MGM version in 1925. “The unprecedented $15,000,000 production cost is all there on the screen in a prodigious array of breathtaking spectacle, wonder, splendor, unforgettable sights and sound,” THR added in its review. “As many as 8,000 extras are on film at one time, not to mention hundreds of horses, camels from Africa, 50 ships built specially for the sea battle, 18 chariots and 300 different sets recreating the glory that was Rome, the grandeur that was Jerusalem. The magnitude of the physical and technical production is unsurpassed.”


	Both Ben-Hur versions feature eye-popping horsemanship and charioteering, but the stunt race goes to the Wyler version not just for the widescreen, full-color spectacle but for not doing what the earlier version did: euthanize an estimated one hundred horses. Heston trained so earnestly with reins and whip that Canutt took him aside and said, “Chuck, you just stay in the chariot and you're going to win the damn race.”


	Kirk Douglas and Stanley Kubrick's non-biblical spectacle has magnificent stunt work throughout — the gladiator fights, the pitched battles — but the awesome shot of 8000 Spaniards playing Roman warriors, shot by Clifford Stine, is like watching a documentary from 71 BC. “It is a magnificent picture, spectacle to dazzle the eye, political conflict to tease the mind, intimacy to hug the heart,” THR noted in its review. “Because of its enormous cost (reportedly $12,000,000), Spartacus will not get its money back day after tomorrow. But it is a solid achievement, will be a smash attraction, and is a solid, long-term investment.”


	Yakima Canutt and Charlton Heston again. Anthony Mann directed this reverent biopic of the eleventh century Castilian nobleman, enlivened by Canutt's second unit work and an epic duel between Heston and Christopher Rhodes, shot over five days under the supervision of stunt coordinator Enzo Musumeci Greco. Critics carped that the most unlikely stunt in the film was how El Cid, dead but strapped to his horse, managed to lead the final battle.


	The CineRama epic with three directors (Henry Hathaway did three sections, John Ford and George Marshall one each) includes buffalo stampedes, rafts spinning through river rapids, and a showstopping railroad wreck. It came at a price: stuntman Bob Morgan, husband of Yvonne De Carlo, was nearly killed in a mishap during the train sequence. 


	The rolling hills of Bavaria are the launching pad for a 60-foot motorcycle jump in John Sturges' WWII prison camp film. Steve McQueen, of course, is atop the Triumph TR6 Trophy in the medium and close shots and stuntman Bud Ekins makes the actual leap in the long shot. “I made it on the first pass,” Ekins was quoted saying to Cycle News Magazine in 1998, adding that he was paid $1,000 for the stunt. 


	Cy Endfield's controversial depiction of the 1879 battle between 4,000 Zulu warriors and 100 or so dauntless Brits may well be problematic by today's lights, but the spears-versus-rifles engagements are mounted with enthralling realism — and the Zulu tribesmen recruited for the film do their ancestors credit.


	Director Ken Annakin's zany period piece with a mouthful of a title harks back to the days of aviation before the Great War in 1910. “Such antique aircraft as Demoiselle, Bristol Box Kite, Avro Triplane and other flying oddities are the real stars of the picture,” wrote Box Office — though the other real stars are the magnificent men flying the “spit and baling wire” aircraft, including ex-RAF man and “old plane nut” Air Commander Allen H. Wheeler who quipped, “I've taken countless aircraft through the sound barrier but this is a bit more fun.” 


	Producer-director-star Cornell Wilde puts himself through hell in this naked-and-afraid pursuit film shot on location Africa. Not for the squeamish.   


	John Frankenheimer's documentary-style race car film features radio-controlled Super Panavision cameras, car sick-inducing helicopter shots, James Garner driving at 140 mph., and somersaulting race cars courtesy of special effects man Milt Rice, who “devised an air cannon that could catapult a car (minus engine) 200 yards in 2 seconds,” according to an account of the filming and stunt work in American Cinematographer.


	Of course this was a pick, see above. “One gasping 11-minute chase sequence packs more excitement than anything since the second Ben Hur chariot race,” raved THR at the time, of the iconic sequence. “Bullitt delivers the leader-to-leader bravura action that few films even dare promise without chucking reason or integrity. It is unlikely that the film can draw the monies required to move it to the profit column, but it should still be a walloping grosser and a popular hit.”


	The best thing about John Frankenheimer's stillborn melodrama is the breathtaking sky-diving, captured by Carl Boenish's aerial photography and visual effects experts J. McMillan Johnson and Carroll L. Shepphird. For the film's Hollywood premiere, the other kind of stunt was staged: three skydivers did a 3,500-foot free fall carrying smoking flares for a pinpoint landing in the Pacific Cinerama Dome Theater parking lot.


	As with the biplanes called back into action for the postwar WWI aerial films, the postwar WWII spectacles are thrilling because the original ordnance could be called back up for duty and photographed in the material world. At the beginning of the Japanese-U.S. coproduction, there is a heart-stopping scene, based on a true event, where a flying instructor, giving an early morning lesson to a student, finds her plane in the midst of a swarm of Japanese zeroes that fly into frame.


	The car chase in The French Connection is the obvious choice, but for a taste of the car wrecks, amphetamines, and gratuitous nudity that defined a rich substratum of 1970s cinema take a road trip with Richard C. Sarafian's drive-in cult classic, introduced to a new generation by Quentin Tarantino.  


	Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight risked life and limb riding the rapids in John Boorman's nightmarish hunting trip into the backwoods. “I went out and got Burt — I paid him $50,000 — and then Jon Voight. The two of them were total opposites,” Boorman recalled to THR in 2018. “Jon hated signing autographs — he didn't want to be disturbed by it. Burt loved it, said he could do it all day long. Voight analyzed everything to death, while Burt's approach was to look at a scene and say, ‘How do I get through this without making a fool of myself?'”


	Franklin J. Schaffner's gritty prison film turns locations in Jamaica and Spain into a fair facsimile of the hell on earth that was serving hard time in French Guyana. The money shot is of Steve McQueen, doing his own leap from a cliff off Maui into the ocean. “Papillon sometimes seems a majestic silent film, filled with staggering images of jungle, prison, ocean and sky,” added THR in its review at the time.


	“Fire is a dangerous co-star in a movie stunt,” said Paul Stader, the stunt coordinator on Irwin Allen's kooky disaster film. Fortunately, thanks to new advances in Nomex, a flame-resistant synthetic material, “One stunt man can burn two or three times longer than ever before, and I only worry half as much about their safety.” Noted THR‘s critical appraisal, “The fire and explosion scenes depend on the mechanical effects of A.D. Flowers and Logan Frazee, the sound of Herman Lewis and the stunt coordination of Paul Stader, which includes the most convincing human bodies on fire ever executed for the camera.”


	Set during the great age of barnstorming biplane aerial acrobatics in 1926-1931, George Roy Hill's part nostalgic, part terrifying Robert Redford starrer recruited pilots who were not trained during the Great War to perform aerodynamic stunts first designed in the Jazz Age. “Hill is after authenticity in staging. There are no process shots,” THR wrote in its review. “The spectacular air stunts are done either by Frank Tallman and his Tallmantz Aviation stuntmen or by the actor themselves. There is no back projection behind Redford — he is really up flying.”


	“Sky Riders conceives a familiar kidnapping-by-terrorists plot but with a clever twist — the rescuers reach the isolated mountain hide-out with hang gliders,” so noted THR‘s review of the 1976 tale. Director Douglas Hickox showcases a hang-gliding team led by Bob Wills and Chris Wills, with star James Coburn doing most of his own stunt work. The trade added, “Ousama Rawi's photography is particularly notable as it captures the hang gliding sequences.”


	Hal Needham turned stuntman again to pilot Burt Reynolds' Trans Am over the Mulberry Bridge. As THR noted in its review, “there are a number of amusing sequences, which are combined with some exciting road action to provide a mildly entertaining — and totally mindless — film. Hal Needham, making his directorial debut after an illustrious career as a stuntman, makes the most of the action and progresses the film with a perfect light-hearted touch.”


	Hear me out: the pluck of seventy-year-old Katharine Hepburn should not be overlooked. When shown her would-be stunt double, Hepburn scoffed (and you can just hear her saying it), “That man doesn't even look like me!” THR described what followed: “Shunning the use of a stunt double, the redoubtable Katharine Hepburn steadfastly did all her own stunt work on the picture, which required her to hang midair over a body of water on an old ship's anchor, climb up a rope ladder into a traveling hot air balloon, put out a fire by smothering it with her own body and, finally, descend in traveling balloon over the Hollywood Bowl with an audience looking on as the Los Angeles Philharmonic played the ‘1812 Overture.'”


	Incendiaries explode in dreamy rhythm to the Doors and the helicopter pilots of the Philippine Air Force fly in cavalry formation to Richard Wagner's “Ride of the Valkyrie” in Francis Ford Coppola's excursion into the heart of darkness. THR observed at the time in its review, “as the film progresses to the GI show, the attack on the bridge and ultimately the arrival at Kurtz's Cambodian compound, we become increasingly aware that we are seeing a very special kind of imagery — where lights, settings and people are all meticulously choreographed, almost as an opera, for their fullest visual impact; while at other times, in the film's more intimate moments, that same enormous screen may be filled by a single head — Sheen's, Brando's — peering at us directly through the lens of the camera.”


	Richard Rush's wheels within wheels depiction of Hollywood illusion making (the stunts in the film are being mounted for a spectacle and also, of course, for The Stunt Man) stars Steve Railsback as the title character or maybe, in keeping with the film's conceit, it refers to stunt coordinator Grey Johnson. “Frankly, I feel that Rush has done an extraordinary job of making all this work, walking the fine edge between madness and melodramatics,” wrote film critic Arthur Knight in THR at the time. “The scale of this movie-within-a-movie (a World War II picture) is just this side of epic; and the stunts as coordinated by Grey Johnson are not only rousing but we are frequently permitted behind-the-scenes glimpses of their planning and operation.”


	The souped-up vehicular velocity of George Miller's death races in the post apocalyptic outback, with Mel Gibson behind the wheel of the last of V-8 interceptors, was the perfect payoff to the car chase sweepstakes of the 1970s. “During this highway odyssey, which becomes a running battle on wheels, every form of motorized mayhem, collision and sideswiping is staged by Miller,” found THR in its review. “It takes one's breath away for sheer thrills.”


	The clash of medieval armaments in John Milius' flesh and fantasy/swords and sorcery action-adventure looks deadly, but, remarkably, the only real bloodletting was a cut finger. “For Schwarzenegger, the title role is a perfect fit, one which could finally catapult him into the upstairs echelon of today's cinematic adventure heroes,” wrote THR in its review. “He has a winning rapport with the camera, sporting exactly the right mixture of chiseled brawn with vulnerability, and he consistently exhibits star quality. Even with his torso covered. Welcome to the big time, Arnold.”


	Shot before the Twilight Zone disaster, the helicopter stunts attributed to the title chopper were meticulously mapped out and executed with precision. Though there are process and rear screen shots aplenty, a real chopper — a retrofitted 1973 French five seat executive helicopter — was flown by Jim Gavin and a seasoned crew of pilots.


	The race between James Woods' 308 GT Ferrari and Jeff Bridges's 911 SC Porsche in downtown Los Angeles was hailed at the time as “the best piece of stunt work since The French Connection.” Taylor Hackford directed and stunt coordinator Gary Davis mapped out the racing action, only slightly hamstrung by the fact that the deal with automakers prohibited any crashes. “So we had to spice it up with a lot of near misses without causing any wrecks,” recalled Davis. THR added in its review, “today's Mean Streets may likely be Century City corridors.”


	William Friedkin somehow manages to top the car chase in The French Connection with a white-knuckled merge into every Angeleno's driving nightmare — turning the wrong way down the 405 (actually the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, CA). The production's technical side scored praise from THR in its review, which noted, “While it is meant as no slight to the performers' excellent portrayals, the star of To Live And Die In L.A. is surely the technical credits. Indeed, Friedkin and his crew have created a vivid, harsh and beautiful picture of corruption. They have seared through the glamor to the underside of both human nature and institutional integrity.”


	“Stunt” is still too paltry a word for the maneuvers performed by the F-14 pilots in Tony Scott's need-for-speed Tom Cruise classic. “Supervisor of special photographic effects Gary Gutierrez, along with aerial coordinator Dick Stevens and Top Gun Commander Bob Willard deserve highest praise for their full-blown action sequences,” THR wrote in its review. “The high-flying fight choreography is sensational, and director Scott's shrewd use of subjective shots literally puts one in the cockpit.”


	Peter Weller needed two stunt doubles as the cyborgian crime buster in Paul Verhoeven's anti-corporate vision of a too close for comfort surveillance state. “Most impressive are Robocop‘s technical aspects, including Rob Bottin's fierce Robocop creation. William Sandell's sterile Metropolis-like production design is a powerful visual slam,” noted THR at the time in its review. “Jost Vacano's astute wide-angled lensing of the corporate villains, as well as his tilted compositions of the ultramodern structures, give Robocop a mesmerizing, expressionistic slant.”


	Among the fabulous set pieces in Harrison Ford's third outing in the Indiana Jones series is a race between two speedboats passing between two ships, with predictable results for the pursuers. “Massive and sweeping, this intricately textured old-style movie is a marvel of technical and spit-and-polish enterprise,” THR added in its review. “Director Steven Spielberg's robustly articulate visualization, as well as the film's magnificently evocative effects are, in Lucasfilmspeak, the ultimate Forces of Good here.”


	Walter Hill's follow up to the Eddie Murphy-Nick Nolte blockbuster is a narrative mess, so savor the on-the-road stunt work, especially the sequence where a bus flips over, still a novelty at the time. “Tech credits are solid,” noted THR in an otherwise tepid review. “High praise to director of photography Matthew F. Leonetti for the expansive lensing.”


	James Cameron's high-tech follow-up to the low-tech noir The Terminator — Arnold Schwarzenegger joked that the catering bill for the sequel would have financed the original — is remembered for introducing a slew of then-unprecedented digital morphing effects, but Cameron went back to analog for the stunning stunt involving a helicopter and the California transportation system. The clip has been circulating around social media lately, with the commentary track from Cameron. “You see this helicopter going under the freeway overpass?” he asks. “That's a helicopter going under a freeway overpass.”  The pilot was Chuck Tamburro.


	Things blow up real good in the third outing of Richard Donner's buddy film, emblematic of the FX-driven action-adventure cops and robber chaos of its time. “Throughout, director Donner maintains full-tilt control, accelerating through torrid action scenes while masterfully braking for humor and personal moments,” THR found at the time. “While crammed tight, Lethal Weapon 3 is a brilliantly paced entertainment, topped off by scorchingly powerful technical work, mainly Jan De Bont's searing cinematography.”


	Yikes — the mountain climbing sequences (shot in the Italian Dolomites impersonating the Rockies) in Renny Harlin's nail-biter are merely scary but the aerial transfer between two planes, with stuntman Simon Crane sliding on a steel cable, is positively Cruisian in its are-you-blanking-kidding-me audacity.


	The perfectly titled revved up romance set aboard what is for many Los Angelenos an exotic setting — a city bus — never drops below 50 mph. The go for broke stunt was a 75-foot bus jump, with precision driver Bill Young not Sandra Bullock behind the wheel. “Director Jan De Bont (the cinematographer of Die Hard and The Hunt for Red October), making his feature debut, expertly builds tension and uncorks magnificent scenes of vehicular mayhem,” wrote THR in its review. “Honors are due the pedal-to-the-metal production team for the film's terrific wide-screen imagery, great editing and excellent sound work.”


	A choice that brooks no argument: the 220-meter bungee jump plunge from the top of the Verzasca Dam in Switzerland by stuntman Wayne Michaels that ignites the action in the seventeenth entry in the James Bond franchise. “With a dynamite opening reel that showcases the series renewed vigor, GoldenEye is two hours of well-executed thrills, high-tech mayhem and one-of-a-kind comedy,” wrote THR of the Bond entry in its review. “Violent, edgy, just a little bloodthirsty and teasingly sexy, director Martin Campbell's film offers top-drawer action sequences.”


	Worth looking at to check out the scene that nearly gave producer David Friendly a heart attack. “Before the stunt, we shot Denzel Washington's character, bailing out of the car and walking off the tracks,” Friendly recalled to THR in 2014. “Then, with a dummy at the wheel, the car collided with the train. The blowback pushed the Mustang 50 yards back down the tracks, and while Denzel was supposed to be further away, the actor in him told him to be close enough to get him and the car in the shot. It scared the hell out of me.”


	Not since Michael Curtiz's Noah's Ark (1928) had so much water been flooded onto so many under such velocity and pressure.  Unlike Curtiz, Cameron sent no one to the hospital. “Titanic‘s visual and special effects transcend state-of-the-art workmanship, invoking feelings within us not usually called up by razzle-dazzlery,” praised THR in its review. “Highest honors to visual effects supervisor Rob Legato and special effects coordinator Thomas L. Fisher for the powerful, knockdown imagery. It's often awesome, most prominently in showing the ship's unfathomable rupture. The splitting of the iron monster is a heart stopper, in no small measure compounded by the sound team's creaking thunders.”


	John Frankenheimer's thriller eschewed fakery. “Every stunt, every car chase, every wreck was done live in the camera as opposed to digitally,” bragged MGM's Larry Gleason. Frankenheimer hired some 300 stunt drivers to keep the traffic flowing.  


	The wire walking martial arts ballets and the gravity-defying bullet time FX compete in red pill/blue pill fashion for pride of place in the only partially computer-generated wonder world conjured by Lana and Lilly Wachowski and fight choreographer Chad Stahelski. “Word-of-mouth will be giddy,” THR predicted in its review, “with young and mature males lining up for a technologically stunning movie that furthers the genre and features crowd-pleasing performances to go with the frequent scenes of gunplay and violence.”


	When the calendar page turned over to a new century, low attention span editing, CGI, and in-camera speed adjustments began to define the car-centered action adventure. Fifty luxury vehicles whoosh by in Dominic Sena's grand theft auto-esque heist film.   


	Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, whose clash of armies in Middle Earth were often staged in Real World Earth, saw stunt people and extras alike hobbling off the battlefield due to an over exuberant commitment to character. The indispensable performer was 4-foot two-inch stunt man Kiran Shah, who was responsible for the heroics of more than one full-sized actor playing a Hobbit. 


	Honorable mention for the year: Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes reimagining. Because every stunt is more difficult in an ape costume, especially on horseback. 


	Any franchise that has inspired a theme ride at Universal Studios warrants an inclusion. Like William Friedkin, helmer Doug Liman wanted to go bumper to bumper with The French Connection with a Mini Cooper in the streets and stairs of Paris. Stunt coordinator Nick Powell defied the French rules of the road. Added THR in its review, “the Doug Liman-directed movie does capture the pulp verve of those 1960s Cold War thrillers directed by the likes of Guy Hamilton and Terence Young.”


	Quentin Tarantino's back-to-back homage to martial arts revenge films of the 1970s — do not call them “chop-socky” — features high-wire flying, flipping, and slicing, notably when the Bride deftly dispatches the Crazy 88s, with stunt woman extraordinaire Zoë Bell stepping into Uma Thurman's jumpsuit for the more demanding maneuvers. “In the beginning, I was saying to Quentin, ‘We're never going to get this in under two and a half hours,'” producer Lawrence Bender recalled to THR in 2023. “And he argued with me, and he said, ‘It's going to be fine.' We had these arguments, and finally he says to me, ‘You just have to trust me.' I said, ‘OK, I trust you.' And as the shoot went on and on and on and on and on, it became clear toward the end that there's a possibility this could end up being two movies. We didn't go into it as two movies.”


	Doug Liman's battle of the sexes fuels a pure popcorn film that makes no attempt to hide its reliance on rear screen projection for the driving scenes (a technique “as old as filmmaking itself,” admits cinematographer Bojan Bazelli) and use of stunt doubles (Eunice Huthart and future director David Leitch), but the compensation is the sight of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, both at peak gorgeousness.


	Don't try any of this at home, kids.


	Elsewhere on the marquee, digital effects were supplanting and corrupting real world stunt work, but Quentin Tarantino was “all about old school” in his homage to Vanishing Point. Kiwi actress, stuntwoman, and absolute force of nature, Zoë Bell is strapped supine on the hood of a 1970 Dodge Challenger with Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) in hot pursuit in a vehicle that, he will discover, does not quite make him death proof.   


	“The stunt work in The Dark Knight looks like it is happening on the streets and not in the computer,” commented THR at the time, and that's because, for the most part, it was. Christopher Nolan would much rather crash a real Lamborghini, flip a real truck, or blow up a (mostly) real hospital building than cheat with software.  


	Tony Scott's remake of the 1974 subway-set heist film faced formidable logistic and stunt challenges, including, as American Cinematography noted, “noise, dirt, darkness, the 600-volt third rail, and the bureaucracy of New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority.”


Speed on train tracks — above ground this time — was, said director Tony Scott, “the most dangerous movie” he had ever made, mainly due to his insistence on live action stunts on a locomotive running 70 mph. “Chris Pine and myself are just sidemen for the train,” semi-joked Denzel Washington about his co-star and him.


	Nicolas Winding Refn's ice-cold crime drama is about a stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver for bank robbers who presumably cannot drive a stick.  Rather than careening through traffic in conspicuously flashy sports cars, he knows that sometimes the best way to escape from the cops is to drive the speed limit in vehicles with a familiar make.   


	As with the Bourne franchise, it seems reasonable to limit the number of entries allotted for the various iterations of the Bond franchise, but the motorcycle race over the rooftops of Istanbul, with Robbie Maddison doubling for Daniel Craig, cannot be omitted. Sam Mendes directs it like a Fitzpatrick travelogue on speed. “Dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor, this beautifully made film certainly will be embraced as one of the best Bonds by loyal fans worldwide,” praised THR in its review, “and leaves you wanting the next one to turn up sooner than four years from now.”


	Yes, by 2013, the series had definitely reached its baroque phase, but the flip-car sequences by Dennis McCarthy, done in life not CGI, are forever jaw dropping. 


	Directed by former stuntman Chad Stahelski along with David Leitch, the first of the franchise has the requisite fisticuffs and gunfights performed by the experts. “If I'm doing it, it's not a stunt,” said Keanu Reeves. “Stunt men do stunts.”


	Added THR in its initial take, “Distilling a couple of decades of stunt work and second-unit directing experience into 96 minutes of runtime, Stahelski and Leitch expertly deliver one action highlight after another in a near-nonstop thrill ride. With a tendency to favor skillfully framed master shots over quick cuts from multiple angles, they immerse viewers in dynamic onscreen clashes that recall John Woo's classic bullet ballets with an overlay of emotional intensity.”


	Throw a dart at the Tom Cruise catalogue and you'll hit a clip of some of the best stunt work ever recorded on film. In this one, he hangs from the side of a plane during takeoff. Seriously. “The formula of ingredients is familiar and time-tested, to be sure, but some cocktails go down much better than others, and McQuarrie and company have gotten theirs just right here,” THR wrote in its review. “The protagonists‘ dilemmas are quite extreme, the surprises come in all sizes and the ultra-smooth professionalism displayed in all departments early on encourages the sense that you're in good hands, a feeling that ends up being justified.”


	Mel Gibson's World War II film is ostensibly in service to conscientious objection, but the vivid, visceral execution of the explosive combat sequences hits home harder than the recitation of the biblical passages. Noted THR in its review, “Gibson's robust skill as a conductor of large-scale conflict — which goes back to Braveheart — is as sharp as ever.”


	David Leitch, yet another former stuntman turned director, and Charlize Theron in stiletto heels, team up for a series of ludicrously inventive, non-stop wall to wall (and through walls) fight scenes and body blows. “A long sequence in the third act, in which Lorraine fights her way through an apartment house's stairwell, is one for the ages, a bring-the-pain endurance test in which opponents seem nearly impossible to kill,” wrote THR in its review. “Theron punches through it with a fierceness to match Min-sik Choi in Oldboy or Matt Damon in the Bourne franchise.”


	A reminder that stunt work is always a dangerous business: stunt woman Joi “SJ” Harris died in a motorcycle stunt gone wrong during production. The eventual tentpole, however, proved a critical and commercial smash, and THR‘s reviewer noted: “There's action aplenty throughout the film, but Deadpool 2 doesn't bog down in it as many overcooked comic-book sequels do. With Reynolds' charismatic irreverence at its core, the pic moves from bloody mayhem to lewd comedy and back fluidly, occasionally even making room to go warm and mushy.”


	James Mangold's period piece is suitably nuts and bolts back at the shop and on the speedway, with the featured models, the supporting vehicles, and the cinematic technique staying true to the 1960s setting.  


	Filmmakers have been rewinding film to make things go backwards since Thomas Edison: not Christopher Nolan, whose stuntmen performed their moves backwards and forwards in real space. He also blew up a real Boeing 747. “Tenet makes you feel floaty, mesmerized and, to an extent, soothed by its spectacle — but also so cloudy in the head that the only option is to relax and let it blow your mind around like a balloon, buffeted by seaside breezes and hot air,” THR noted in its pandemic-era review. 


	It helps if your stunt doubles can be hidden in a full body costume and mask, as Tom Holland good naturedly acknowledged when he thanked stunt men Luke Scott and Greg Townley. “From Luke's crash into the stairs to Greg's falling through the floor to me stubbing my little toe on the glider,” he said at the end of the shoot. “It's been an adventure.”


	In a year of Cameron (Avatar: The Way of Water) and Cruise (Top Gun: Maverick), Ryan Coogler's sequel is the sentimental selection for its seamless blend of CGI and real-geography action, especially on, in, and under the water. 


	No way to avoid making any list of Hollywood stunt work top heavy with the antics of Tom Cruise. The motorcycle-skydiving leap off a cliff into oblivion is widely considered to be on a par with anything concocted by Buster Keaton or Yakima Canutt, and you'll get no dissent here. 


	When a former stuntman (director David Leitch) makes an action rom-com about a stunt man, he can only go for broke, as when the real stunt man (Logan Holladay) does a record-breaking eight car roll doubling for the fake stunt man (played by Ryan Gosling).


	Now if only there were a likely candidate for the best stunt work of 2025…

From Washington's attitude to YouTube to new money for Hollywood-friendly candidates, the effects in town could be far-reaching.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	OK, so the Donald Trump–Elon Musk feud pretty much IS Hollywood.


	If you had to pitch a script about the world's most powerful man squaring off against the world's richest man in an all-out war over the direction of the planet, you'd get a greenlight on the spot (or get laughed out of the room for implausibility). The popcorn-bucket quotient is unparalleled.




	But such a feud also has a consequence for Hollywood. More than one, in fact. How does the knockdown-dragout brawl impact companies, executives and creators in the town, you ask? Here are five potential ways.

					Brian Grazer Voted for Trump, Admitting It Felt Like ""Getting Canceled""		
			









1. Align MAGA Against YouTube and Other Entertainment-related Tech Companies


			Related Video		







	Since he was elected seven months ago, Trump has been largely friendly to the Silicon Valley companies in charge of (among other things) our content and entertainment, pulling many Republicans with him (or at least cowing them into silence). But that's been starting to change with the increasing volubility of Missouri senator Josh Hawley and several others, who have begun to ask accountability-type questions about YouTube and its AI training and social platforms and their content policies. Now, the trend could get Trump behind it too as the friendliest Big Tech voice in his ear is gone. In fact, he could have a new vendetta-ish incentive to go after Big Tech, seeking to bring to heel companies like Amazon and Netflix along with universities, law firms, legacy media and others he's pursued.


2. Cut Down FCC Chair Brendan Carr












	One of the biggest thorns in the side of network news and other content giants is Carr, who has sought to call to the principal's office Comcast, Disney and other media companies — and hold up the Paramount-Skydance merger while he's at it. Carr is actually a major Musk ally — he has visited his Texas SpaceX headquarters, taken selfies with the mogul and gone to bat for him, as he did when slamming FCC colleagues several years ago for not granting Musk's Starlink huge sums in rural broadband subsidy fees. Carr will no doubt try to thread the Muskian needle now that his boss (well, technically his boss is Congress) has fallen out with his big ally. But that may be not an easy eye to get that yarn through, and Carr may find himself a little closer to the margins without his buddy and rabbi. Bob Iger and Shari Redstone might exhale — for a few seconds.


3. Give Hollywood Liberals a New Ally (Maybe)


	Alright this one seems like a stretch, even if plenty of political outlets are happy to indulge it. “Democrats eye a villain-to-ally arc for Elon Musk”: Politico; “Democratic congressman steps up his work to pull Musk toward his party for the midterms”: Semafor.)


	Plenty of Dems still hate Musk; the enemy-of-your-enemy logic only goes so far. Plenty of Dems feel the way Tim “How great is it that that dipshit Elon Musk is out?” Walz does, even if only some will say it.


	But Congressman Ro Khanna, the Northern California progressive in whose district a Tesla assembly plant sits, wants Musk to get California-ized. “We should ultimately be trying to convince him that the Democratic Party has more of the values that he agrees with,” Khanna told Semafor. “A commitment to science funding, a commitment to clean technology, a commitment to seeing international students like him.”

	











	Nothing that Musk has done in the past year suggests this is remotely likely — and let's not forget he needs lots of contracts Trump's agencies provide. Plus if anything, come midterms he's going to be trying to knock down Trump candidates from the right. 


	But the man who in the fall alleged that the entertainment business was conspiring to enable Diddy now mingling with Jeffrey Katzenberg, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and others in Hollywood's fundraising machine would be a juicily ironic specter indeed.


4. Let Entertainment People Keep Their Teslas


	Hollywood loves cars and revenge tales, so it makes sense the Tesla Takedown movement has been rooted here. Alex Winter of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure kind of kicked the whole thing off, and entertainers like Sheryl Crow, Jason Bateman and others have ditched their slick EVs in his wake. While Musk will hardly seem like a good guy to Hollywood liberals, his withdrawal from the government, the defanging of DOGE and newfound rivalry with Trump may make holding on to that Model X Plaid a little easier. Ari could drive his Cybertruck with head held high.


5. Push Trump to Slow Down Content-Gobbling AI Companies


	This one is tricky. Trump has a big AI verdict of sorts coming in July when he is expected to announce his regulation plans. So far he's shown little appetite for such guardrails. In fact, the current Big Beautiful spending bill (also at the center of the Musk fight) has a major provision stopping states from regulating AI for ten years — a huge sop to Sam Altman, Google and the rest of the Silicon Valley AI lobby. But there are already signs it could be slowed down, with Marjorie Taylor Greene, of all people, leading the charge in the name of states' rights. The Senate has just watered down the provision, changing it from an outright ban on states to regulate to an elimination of broadband subsidies if they do.

	











	Could Trump flex his muscle to roll it back further and allow regulation now that he's in a blood feud with Musk, overseer of AI model Grok? It's possible. But also worth noting is that Musk is in a separate blood feud with Altman, who wants pretty much no regulation at all. So by that enemy-of-your-enemy logic the Musk fight could draw Trump closer to Altman and even more opposed to AI regulation, letting the models run wild in music and film. Like all things Musk-Trump, the moves are both giving us entertainment and landing on Hollywood.

Weezy took a victory lap to celebrate Tha Carter VI's arrival with his first solo headlining show at NYC's Madison Square Garden.

	Rocking a signed Britney Spears shirt, Lil Wayne kicked off his Tha Carter VI Tour in front of a sold-out Madison Square Garden (Wayne's first time as a solo headliner at MSG) on Friday night (June 6). 


	Weezy took a well-deserved victory lap, with Friday also serving as C6 release day, which called for a celebration with thousands of his diehard fans who have been on this unpredictable journey with Wayne for over two decades. 


	“I put out Tha Carter VI,” Wayne told the crowd during the show. “I must say thank you to every single soul supporting that motherf—ing album, supporting me from day one. Damn. I also must thank every single person involved with that album. Everybody came through — I appreciate all of y'all, man.”

	Wayne mixed in live debuts of Tha Carter VI cuts with his endless amount of anthems and timeless gems from his Hall-of-Fame catalog, as the New Orleans rap legend reaffirmed that he's one of the greatest rhymers ever to pick up a mic. 


	Tunechi had a couple of surprises up his sleeve with Cory Gunz joining him for “6 Foot 7 Foot” and LL COOL J hitting the stage to perform “Rock the Bells” after Weezy interpolated LL's 1985 hit on Tha Carter VI‘s “Bells.”

	Lil Wayne squeezed over 36 tracks into his 70-minute set. Tha Carter VI Tour will take a break for a few weeks before the 34-date North American trek picks up again at the end of June in Virginia.

The company says the music streamer is now engaging in copyright infringement by continuing to play tracks by artists including Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus and Tate McRae.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Sony claims in a new lawsuit that streaming platform LiveOne and its subsidiary Slacker Radio owe $2.6 million in unpaid licensing fees yet are refusing to stop playing the label's music, including tracks by Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus and Tate McRae.


	The allegations come in a federal lawsuit Sony filed Friday (June 6) against LiveOne and Slacker, which LiveOne acquired in 2017 and has since folded into the LiveOne streaming app.  


	Sony and Slacker have been doing business with each other since 2007 through a content distribution deal, according to the lawsuit. But Sony's lawyers say LiveOne and Slacker stopped making regular monthly licensing payments in August 2024 and now owe a total outstanding balance of $2.6 million.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“In the past several months alone, Slacker claims to have seen increasing commercial success, touting a surge in usage of the LiveOne app and a year-over-year surge in content views,” write Sony's attorneys. “Despite this self-proclaimed growth, Slacker—true to its name—has failed to make license payments to Sony Music as and when required under the agreement, and its parent, LiveOne, has likewise failed to live up to its guarantee.”


	According to the lawsuit, Sony notified LiveOne and Slacker in March that it was terminating the content distribution deal in light of this contract breach. Sony says it “expressly informed” them that further use of its music would constitute copyright infringement, according to the lawsuit.


	But Sony's lawyers claim the LiveOne app is still streaming more than 200 of the label's songs — also including tracks by Doja Cat, Harry Styles, Justin Timberlake and Khalid.


	“Slacker's conduct has caused and continues to cause substantial and irreparable harm to Sony Music and its artists, while enriching defendants at the expense of Sony Music and its artists,” write Sony's lawyers. “By this lawsuit, Sony Music seeks damages for Slacker and LiveOne's breach of the agreement and for defendants' willful infringement of Sony Music's copyrights since the March 15, 2025, termination of the agreement.”


	Representatives for Slacker did not immediately return Billboard's request for comment on the claims.


	The lawsuit comes three years after Slacker and LiveOne faced a different lawsuit over unpaid fees from SoundExchange, the nonprofit that collects and distributes royalties to record labels and artists. A federal judge ultimately ordered the streaming companies to pay SoundExchange nearly $10 million in past-due royalties.

Martin Scorsese has directed more than 20 feature films, including some of the most beloved of the last half-century: Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Departed.


	But now he says he can no longer go to watch movies in cinema theatres because he becomes too riled by the behaviour of his fellow cinema-goers.


The Guardian newspaper reports that Scorsese professed himself so distracted by all the chat and mobile phone behaviour around him, he could no longer concentrate on the events on the screen.


	Scorsese was talking to US film critic Peter Travers who wrote on his blog The Travers Take:

	“I asked the maestro why he doesn't see movies in theatres any more and he went all raging bull about audiences who babble on phones during the movie, leave to order snacks and vats of soda, and keep up a noise level loud enough to drown out the actors.”


	Travers wrote that he challenged the veteran director: “‘Come on, Marty,' I said, ‘we couldn't keep our mouths shut when we were kids.'”


	Travers added: “His [Scorsese's] eyes darkened. ‘Yeah, maybe,' he conceded, ‘but when we talked it was always about the movie and the fun we had chewing over the details.'”


The Guardian reports that Scorsese has multiple projects in production, including a Hawaii-set crime drama starring Dwayne Johnson and a documentary about the late Pope Francis, with whom it is believed he had the final interview.


	In his long career, he has received 16 Academy Award nominations for his work, including winning the Best Director Oscar for police corruption thriller The Departed (2007).

EXCLUSIVE: If nothing else, Jeremy Clarkson has shown how farmers' livelihoods are beholden to the vicissitudes of the weather gods. But there is now one thing you can guarantee every year: Clarkson's Farm will harvest a bumper crop of ratings for Amazon Prime Video.


	Jeremy Clarkson's adventures on his Diddly Squat dwelling in the Cotswolds continue to resonate with British viewers, with Season 4 on course to become the most-watched to date, according to an analysis of viewing figures by Deadline.


	The final two episodes of the season dropped on Amazon Prime Video on Friday, and while it is too early to analyse how these have rated, it is possible to look back on the first six instalments of 2025. Season 4 has averaged 4.4M viewers so far this year, according to official seven-day viewing figures from Barb and overnights.tv.

	This puts it just a shade ahead of Season 3 over the same number of episodes. Last year's season averaged 4.3M over its first six instalments, even though this included the highest-rated single episode to date: the 2024 premiere, which was seen by 5.2M viewers. The best performing instalment of Season 4 has been episode two with 5M viewers.




			Watch on Deadline		







Clarkson's Farm has comfortably been Amazon Prime Video's biggest show of the year, while the second episode of Season 4 was the UK's second most-watched TV event in the week to May 25, according to Barb's ranking of the top 50 shows. The only Amazon series that has come close to Clarkson's Farm is LOL: Last One Laughing UK, which chuckled along with audiences of up to 3.1M earlier this year. 


	Produced by Expectation, Amazon Prime Video has renewed Clarkson's Farm for a fifth season, which will premiere next year. Beyond that, there is uncertainty. Clarkson has suggested that it will take a good story to warrant another season, while he also said the team is in need of a break. “We've been filming here two or three days a week, every week, for five years. Everybody could do with a rest,” he told The Sunday Times.

	Although Elon Musk has been known to lean on “free speech” when convenient, the ex-DOGE boss appears to be backpedaling after dropping a major bombshell.


	Following a heated exchange in which he claimed his former bestie Donald Trump is included in the Jeffrey Epstein files, the X mogul appears to have deleted the loaded post from his own platform.


	The feud comes after Musk denounced Trump‘s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would add an estimated $2.4 trillion deficit over the next decade. The Tesla CEO previously concluded his stint with DOGE last month.




			Watch on Deadline		







	After Trump threw down a gauntlet, Musk responded to his threat to terminate Tesla's government subsidies with the Epstein allegation. “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” he wrote in the since-deleted tweet.

	











	“Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,” added Musk in another post that has also disappeared from his profile.


	While it has never been a secret that the late, disgraced billionaire Epstein and Trump were party pals back in the 1990s, Trump always has denied he had anything to do with his convicted friend's penchant for underaged girls.


	CNN's Dana Bash has since said she's spoken to Trump, who is more “resigned” than angry at Musk, relaying that he told her, “‘I'm not even thinking about Elon. He's got a problem. The poor guy has got a problem.'”

	











	“He says he won't be speaking to him for a while, but he wishes Elon Musk well,” added Bash.

	“You think people don't remember when you do this sh*t to them? That it's not going to have blowback?”


	Maher then advanced a proposal for those liberal strategists wandering in the wilderness: “All the guys in American like Joe and Elon, you do have to win them back — and you can.”


	He suggested Musk and Rogan didn't get “that The Last of Us fungal infection and became zombies.” They didn't turn to the dark side, he maintained.


	“No, they just got driven away, because that's how politics works these days. Because a one side gets elected and pushed their agenda way too far and drove people in the opposite direction. The pendulum swings back and forth, not with people voting FOR anything but just to get rid of the latest extremist assh*les who seek to remake American in their image instead of just governing. Well, right now it's the Republicans who are drunk with power.”

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM: Refresh for more and chart….One of the most intriguing yet mindboggling dynamics in moviegoing is that which prevents audiences from getting off the couch, even when the word of mouth out there is great on a movie. 


	Such is the dilemma this morning for Lionsgate‘s John Wick off-shoot Ballerina which won't budge from its industry $25.5M projection even after an A- CinemaScore, one of the best in the Wick franchise. Lionsgate is seeing the movie in the $25.5M-$27.5M range. While that grade for the Len Wiseman directed movie is under the franchise's best in show, John Wick: Chapter 4‘s A, it's well above the original John Wick‘s B, and in the same great company as John Wick 2 & 3 which also nabbed A-s. Friday for the Ana de Armas movie was $10.65M including previews. 

	











	It's clear that a portion of the John Wick faithful love this movie (I had zero patience for it, more on that later), but Ballerina isn't showing signs of jumping into its forecasted $30M+ rafters. Again, it's not a good sign for any studio when you show up on tracking at point A, and drop to point B or C. This happened recently with Karate Kid: Legends. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Why aren't more people going? 


	There's something to be said that when the movie popped on tracking three weeks ago, respondents were upbeat that the movie was “From the World of John Wick”, but when they looked closer noticed that Keanu Reeves wasn't entirely in the movie. Lionsgate made it obvious in their marketing that Reeves is in the film, and even featured him in one of their one sheets. 


	One film finance source yelled at me yesterday about the less-than-expected Ballerina performance, “If their exits were so great, why the hell was the review embargo lift so late?!” The review embargo lift was on Wednesday, June 4, the day before previews began. In addition, John Wick: Chapter 4 launched and teed off its excitement at SXSW, and that festival crowd would have embraced and screamed out praise of Ballerina if it was there. SXSW could have used another cool fanboy film this year. 

	











	There's also the sense that many have already seen these girl-with-the-gun movies before, and there are plenty of copycats on streaming (i.e. Charlize Theron's The Old Guard, Gal Gadot's Heart of Stone, Jennifer Lopez's The Mother) — so why rush out? But this one is through the lens of John Wick, and ya know, stunts! But you can't just swap out our favorite puppy loving, gun toting, surfer dude for a female lead, and that's potentially why more of the Wick faithful aren't going. In full confession, I walked out of Ballerina (and I did walk back in for the ending). It was too wash, rinse, repeat in the fisticuffs and bang-bang, and there isn't a biplane scene. This wasn't Nic Winding Refn, John Woo or Ari Aster's version of Ballerina. I noticed fireflies at the Chinese Theater during the screening and chased them out to the lobby. However, my cynicism aside, what matters more to me is the overall worth of motion picture commerce, and if there are movies that I don't like, which rise to the top and beat the odds at the box office, well then, I'm an absolute champ of that, and drop dead fascinated by it.  


	Funny enough, Ballerina in its Russian dancers turned assassins feature is similar to another feature from Lionsgate Hunger Games alums Francis Lawrence and Jennifer Lawrence, 2018's Red Sparrow, however, the de Armas movie is opening higher than that one which 20th Century Fox couldn't figure out at a $16.8M start. 


	Also, as we mentioned, Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning with its submarine and biplane stunts and the whole scheduled viewing by moviegoers for the best seats in Imax isn't doing Ballerina any favors with a third place and third weekend of $14.8M. Granted, Mission: Impossible is older skewing at 62% over 25 to Ballerina‘s 45% over 35, but there's overlap in that both are 63% and 37% male/female, and also with men over 25 (Ballerina at 49%, Mission at 52%) and women over 25 (Ballerina 27% and Mission 32%). 


	I believed back at CinemaCon, Ballerina would have had a better place on the calendar earlier in the year before A Minecraft Movie when we were starving for product. However, the reason why the movie is here in the first weekend of June was due to Reeves' availability on the press tour. As we reported during the preview, while $25M may internally not be the right number for Lionsgate execs and the industry, but exhibition isn't crying: There's meat in the marketplace and this weekend is coming in at $115.5M, +11% a  year ago when Sony's Bad Boys: Ride or Die (which that studio took credit on reviving the sluggish summer box office) opened to $56.6M. In hindsight, Ballerina is better here in its counterprogramming than during the desert days. The industry can be grateful, and there's more hits ahead this summer in Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth and Warner Bros' Superman. 


	Geniuses of box office at the studios shrug their shoulders and observe that this is as good as it gets with solo female action movies; this movie was never expected to do John Wick business (it's only beating the original's $14.4M start), and was always expected to be in line with Furiosa ($26.3M 3-day) and Alita: Battle Angel ($28.5M 3-day). 


	Speaking of Furiosa, she had a similar dilemma in her marketing to Ballerina: You can't just swap out an iconic action hero (Mad Max) for another, and the execution looked very similar to previous installments, which isn't provoking more to flock.  

	











	Note, pre-streaming era, girl with a gun movies did do much better, i.e. Angelina Jolie's Wanted ($50.9M), Scarlett Johansson's Lucy ($43.8M), however, there was a $20M range in Quentin Tarantino's cult classic Kill Bill Vol. 1 ($22.2M), all unadjusted for inflation.  


	It's been a while since Lionsgate had a big a tentpole (arguably since November 2023's Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes), and Ballerina was very important to them that they wanted to delay the film for additional shoots, and get John Wick architect Chad Stahelski's hands in the movie to get this right. We can't deny that they pushed the movie with a $45M domestic P&A. Hell, they created (count 'em) 27 one sheets for the movie, and that type of quantity shows a studio's commitment to a movie's marketing. de Armas has been working it since CinemaCon. However, something isn't bringing horses to water. Maybe tonight.  


	Disney's Lilo & Stitch continue to be monsters at the box office with a $33M estimated third weekend after a $9.3M third Friday. 


	Chart is coming…


FRIDAY EARLY EVENING: Currently, many have Ballerina in the mid-$20M range, but Lionsgate believes there's a potential path to $30M at 3,409 theaters.


	Nobody in distribution land wants to a see a movie with great exits underperform. We need all the wins we can get. Ballerina is a R-rated movie, and the audiences for those always come out at night. What's hard here is that this spinoff came on tracking three weeks ago at $35M+, so if it eases to mid-$20Ms, eeesh. Friday, including $3.5M previews, is just under $11M.


	I'm hearing now the production cost was in the low-$90M net range, more than 60% of that funded by foreign sales. Given that this is part of the crown jewel John Wick franchise, Lionsgate was determined to make the best movie possible, hence the year delay, hence the additional photography. With an estimated $45M P&A spend Stateside, iSpot shows that close to 38% was spent on NBA Finals spots, and those go for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ya can't say that Lionsgate didn't push Ballerina out in the limelight, not to mention Ana de Armas has been promoting in Dwayne Johnson-like fashion since CinemaCon, all over social, etc.


Ballerina has just under 1,000 PLF auditoriums. 


RELATED: The Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Box Office


	It's a stacked summer, and this male-skewing action movie is in the wake of Paramount/Skydance's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, which has a firm hand on Imax screens, heading to a $14M (-49%) third weekend in third place at 3,496. That's better than Dead Reckoning‘s $10.6M third sesh. Running cume by Sunday is $148.2M.


	As we mentioned all along this week, No. 1 is Disney's to lose as Lilo & Stitch is seeing a third weekend of $32M-$34M after a $9M-$10M third Friday at 4,185 theaters. Running cume is between $335M-$337M.


	Fourth is Sony's Karate Kid: Legends at 3,859 sites. The pic is seeing $2.3M in its second Friday with a second weekend in the $9M range, -56%. Ten day running cume is $35.7M.


	Fifth is Focus Features' second-weekend wide expansion of The Phoenician Scheme, which jumped from six locations in NYC and L.A. to 1,678 theaters with a second Friday of $2.5M and second weekend of $5.7M. Currently, Wes Anderson's second weekend isn't as high as his Asteroid City, which landed at $9M in 2023. We'll see where this goes. Four stars, 81% positive and a good 62% definite recommend from a crowd that's 64% under 35, mostly guys at 57%.

	











FRIDAY AM UPDATE, after exclusive: Lionsgate is reporting $3.75M for the previews to Thunder Road's John Wick spinoff Ballerina. That number is from Wednesday and Thursday shows.


	The Rotten Tomatoes audience score stands at 93%, equal to 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4‘s which is best in the Keanu Reeves franchise.


Ballerina‘s audience score also is higher than previous solo femme action movies Furiosa (88%, 2024) and Alita: Battle Angel (91%, 2019).


	Exits on PostTrak were excellent Thursday night with a 79% definite recommend. Again, that's the fans, but it speaks volumes; we've said this before, but with the Comscore/Screen Engine polling service, “definite recommend” carries more weight than the positivity score which is 87%, still very good. This should bode well for Ballerina prancing past $30M. Men showed up to the guns-blazing ballet Thursday night at 61%. Best definite recommend and positive scores came from women over 25, who showed up at 29% and gave it an 83% and 90%, respectively.


Ballerina takes place during the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum and follows orphaned Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas), who is beginning her training in the assassin traditions of the Ruska Roma. Her father died at the hands of Gabriel Bryne's The Chancellor. She's as mad as hell, and she's not going to take it anymore.

	Social media org RelishMix says: “Convo on Ballerina is running positive for action fans excited to see one of their favorite franchises expand in glorious fashion. The cast is the cause of a lot of the film's positive sentiments including Ana de Armas, who has gained a lot of good will in other roles, and the promise of a returning Keanu Reeves as John Wick. Some comments are, ‘I love Ana de Armas, and I'm so excited to see her doing this kind of film after No Time to Die. She was the best Bond Girl!' and ‘I didn't actually expect Keanu to show up in the movie, glad he is gonna be in it!' plus, ‘Did I spy Norman Reedus? Between Ian McShane, Keanu, and the legendary Mr. Lance Reddick‘. Many are pleased with the direction of this film and the action spotlighted in the trailer, sharing, ‘I was wondering if they were going to do a spinoff with the dancers! This looks EPIC!!!' and, ‘I really hope that this is the start of a trilogy.'”


	RelishMix also notes that Reedus has the most social media followers from the Ballerina cast with his activated 19.2M, and de Armas has 15M fans, while Reeves is still off the grid for his movies.


	And as we told you Thursday night, it was imminent that Disney's Lilo & Stitch would cross $300M at 4,410 theaters, the second movie to do so YTD at the domestic B.O. after Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie. The hybrid/live-action feature take on the 2002 Disney toon made $5M Thursday, -7% from Wednesday, for a second week of $86.1M and a running total of $303.1M. Lilo & Stitch is expected to reign again with a third weekend of $35M.


	Rest of the top five for the week is as follows:


	2.) Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (Par) 3,861 theaters, Thu $2.3M (-10% from Wed), Wk $38.9M (-59%), Total $134.2M/Wk 2


	3.) Karate Kid: Legends (Sony) 3,809 theaters, Thu $1.2M (-10%), Wk $26.7M, Wk 1


	4.) Final Destination Bloodlines (NL) 3,134 theaters, Thu $1.M (-11%), Wk $16.1M (-48%), Total $117M, Wk 3

	











	5.) Bring Her Back (A24) 2,449 theaters, Thu $675K (-12%), Wk $10.4M, Wk 1 


EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us tonight that the John Wick spinoff Ballerina is looking to do around $3.5M-$4M in previews. That's all in, including Wednesday fan screenings that started at 7 p.m. as well as Thursday showtimes that began at 6 p.m.


	The hope is that the $80M-$90M Lionsgate production gets to north of $30M, which, as we told you, is around where recent female solo action movies openings live at the box office, read Furiosa ($26.3M 3-day last year) and 2019's Alita: Battle Angel ($28.5M 3-day in 2019).


	The Len Wiseman-directed spinoff produced by Thunder Road is expected to rank second behind Disney's third weekend of Lilo & Stitch, which is looking to make around $35M; that movie crosses $300M today.


Ballerina was delayed a year to undergo additional photography.  


	Upside on Ballerina is that Thursday night fans are enjoying the Ana de Armas movie with a Keanu Reeves cameo, giving a 94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes — as of this minute, that's higher than any John Wick RT popcorn score; John Wick: Chapter 4 received a 93% in 2023. Critically, even though Ballerina is 72% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, it's not as high as the John Wick movies, which had film review scores ranging from 86%-94% certified fresh.


Ballerina‘s all-in preview cash is on par with the Thursday preview box office of Furiosa ($3.5M) and higher than the $2.4M Tuesday night preview cash of Alita: Battle Angel. Essentially, the thinking is to comp Ballerina to female solo action movies instead of John Wick movies. Female solo action movies are a completely different subgenre and don't always attract the full-on male audience that typically attends an action movie with a male leading star.


	Still, Ballerina‘s combined preview cash is higher than the Thursday night of 2017's John Wick 2 ($2.2M) but far under both 2019's John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum ($5.9M, ) and 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4 ($8.9M, best preview cash in franchise).


	We'll have more updates as they happen Friday morning. Lionsgate didn't return our request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Rachel Zoe Joins ‘Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Amid Major Cast Shake-Up","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/rachel-zoe-real-houswives-of-beverly-hills/","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:49:47 GMT","

Bravo has officially found a new cast member for the upcoming 15th season of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” Fashion designer and former reality TV star Rachel Zoe is making her long-awaited return to the network.

Zoe announced the news via Instagram in a personal video message to fans.

“It's official, I am coming back to Bravo! I am joining the cast of ‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills',” she said.

She continued, “It's been a while and you've been asking me to come back to television, and I said when the stars align or it makes sense or I have enough to say to share with all of you—and now is the time. Really excited to be with all of you again, and I hope you are too, so let's have some fun!”

Her casting comes at a pivotal moment for the franchise, which follows the departure of longtime favorite cast member, Garcelle Beauvais.

A post shared by Garcelle Beauvais (@garcelle)

Beauvais confirmed her exit ahead of the Season 14 finale earlier this year. She also made the announcement via Instagram.

“It's been a wild ride. I mean, some amazing things have happened and some hard things have also happened, but it's been a ride nevertheless,” she shared. “One of the reasons why I'm leaving is my family, my boys.”

She added, “Their last year of high school is next year and I want to be a part of that. And Jade is starting a new career and I want to be a part of that too. And secondly, I have the most exciting projects that I am developing, producing and acting in. I can't tell you anything right now, but you'll know soon.”

A post shared by Rachel Zoe (@rachelzoe)

Zoe is no stranger to Bravo. She originally joined the network back in 2008 with her hit series “The Rachel Zoe Project.” The show chronicled her professional life in the fashion world while also showing a peek inside her personal life, running for five seasons before ending in 2013.

Since then, Zoe has remained a key figure in the fashion industry and a favorite of the network. Primarily through her digital lifestyle brand and newsletter, “The Zoe Report,” which launched in 2009.

In 2024, Zoe made headlines after she and her husband, Rodger Berman, announced their separation. Via a joint statement on Instagram, the couple shared, “After 33 years together and 26 years married, Rodger and I have come to the mutual decision to end our marriage. We are incredibly proud of the loving family we have created and our countless memories together.”

They emphasized that their two children remain their top priority and confirmed they plan to continue working together on their shared businesses.

Season 14 of ‘RHOBH' featured a dynamic cast that left the audience questioning who would return to the show. It included Bozoma Saint John, Sutton Stracke, Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne, Dorit Kemsley, Jennifer Tilly, and Kathy Hilton. However, Bravo has yet to confirm which Housewives will return for Season 15.

Still, Zoe's addition to the cast signals an exciting new era for the series. Fans are expecting to see a fresh blend of fashion, drama, and high-profile storylines. Fans of the show went on to comment on the news, with one writing, “Best casting decision in a long while! Can't wait for this 🎉.”

Another one wrote, “Oh wow, this should make this an interesting season!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘General Hospital' Weekly Recap (6/2-6)","https://entertainmentnow.com/soap-operas/general-hospital-weekly-recap/","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 16:55:54 GMT","

This was an explosive, soapy week for “General Hospital”. 

From the birth of Michael's third child to a new threat looming for Sonny, the daytime drama gave fans plenty to talk about. 

Michael and Willow's custody battle began this week as the two faced off for sole custody of their two young children. However, things came to a halt when Sasha went into early labor with her and Michael's child. Thankfully, Willow put her nursing skills to good use, safely delivering the new baby girl, whom Michael and Sasha named Daisy. 

As the Spencer-Corinthos family celebrated, the Ashfords struggled to keep their family together. Curtis continued to wrestle with the gravity of Portia's lies and Drew's blackmail of her. As he grappled with whether or not to give Portia a second chance, Curtis received some words of comfort and advice from Marshall and Jordan. 

While love may not be in the air for Curtis and Portia, it may be blossoming for Molly and Cody. The two shared a moment at the pool this week, reflecting on Cody's family drama and toasting to Britt. It appears that “General Hospital” is already planting the seeds for her return, as Deadline reported that actress Kelly Thiebaud will return in July. 

In other news, Marco and Lucas connected on a deeper level; Natalia received a DUI; and Jason and Anna agreed to work together to investigate Dalton.

The show is also setting up another foe for Sonny: Sidwell. The businessman is in partnership with Jordan to take the mob boss down for good. He's not the only one with his eyes on Sonny, however, as the town's district attorney is determined to build a case against him.

In the 15-second preview for next week:

Lucky's conversation with Lulu will most likely be him bidding her farewell, as Deadline has confirmed that Jonathan Jackson will once again be exiting the series.

In Thursday's episode, Liz turned down Lucky's proposal, explaining that she believes they want different things. Lucky admitted that Port Charles was no longer his home and that he couldn't find true happiness staying there. As a result, the two decided to part ways, and Lucky announced his departure.

What did you think of “General Hospital” this week? What are you looking forward to most next week? Let us know in the comments below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Fans Petition HGTV to Bring Back Michel Smith Boyd's Show After Second 'Rock the Block' Win","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/michel-smith-boyd-petition-luxe-for-less/","Sat, 07 Jun 2025 16:51:19 GMT","

When Michel Smith Boyd won the sixth season of “Rock the Block” with his teammate, longtime HGTV star Alison Victoria, the Atlanta-based designer made history as the first person to win the hit competition series twice. Boyd also won season four of the intense renovation challenge in 2023, alongside his former “Luxe For Less” co-star Anthony Elle. 

But as fans celebrated Boyd's history-making win on social media, many also lamented that the interior designer hadn't appeared on his own HGTV show since early 2023, in the first and only season of “Luxe For Less.” With no word on plans for Boyd's show to return in 2025, a fan petition is now collecting signatures to urge the network to re-launch Boyd's show. 

A post shared by Tracy Twinkie Byrd (@iamtwinkiebyrd)

Before season four of “Rock the Block” aired in early 2023, Boyd's new HGTV show “Luxe For Less” premiered on December 1, 2022. In the freshman series, he and his creative team — including Anthony Elle, the designer who was his teammate during his first “Rock the Block” win — employed “clever budget hacks to help homeowners create luxurious renovations without stretching their bank accounts,” per HGTV. But since the first season aired, the show's future has been in limbo, with no announcement of a renewal. 

On June 1, 2025, Boyd posted screenshots from a Country Living article about him winning “Rock the Block” again, and he wrote, “((It's the last quote for me)) ‘Give this king his show back! #LuxeForLess @hgtv'”

Fans flooded his comment section with support, including someone who wrote, “Exactly and we need like 12 episodes per season too.” Boyd replied, “Can a brother get a dozen!?”

Two days later, film and TV casting director Tracy “Twinkie” Byrd, took matters into her own hands, tagging Boyd in an Instagram post and announcing that she'd started a petition on Change.org to bring back “Luxe For Less.” Boyd shared the post in his Instagram stories and wrote, “Wowwwwww” 

Describing the goal of the petition, Byrd wrote on Change.org, “In a world where black culture is consistently thriving, pushing boundaries, and setting new trends, it's disheartening to witness moments where black voices and talents are sidelined. HGTV's remarkable show ‘Luxe for Less' is a beacon of this very creativity and excellence.” 

Byrd also argued, “The absence of ‘Luxe for Less' on our screens isn't just a missing television show; it's a gap in the representation and acknowledgment of black creatives who shift the cultural landscape forward. HGTV has the chance to set a precedent, to make a statement that creativity knows no boundaries of color, and that the contribution of black talents is not only valued but essential.”

A post shared by MICHEL SMITH BOYD (@michelboyd)

At the time of publication on the morning of June 7, the petition had collected 260 verified signatures. HGTV has not responded to EntertainmentNow's request for comment on the petition or the future of “Luxe For Less.”

Fans have been voicing their hope for HGTV to reinstate the show in posts across social media, including on Facebook, where one fan who shared the petition on June 5 wrote, “If you love all things home interior, design on a dime, etc. join me in advocating for Michel Smith Boyd to get his show Luxe for Less back on the air. Besides being a gifted creative, he is a 2x champion of HGTVs Rock the Block home renovation show. Show your support by adding your name below.”

On June 6, another fan tweeted, “I have been on here in a minute but @hgtv you all HAVE to bring the show Luxe for Less BACK! @michelboyd and his team were absolutely AMAZING! One of the most entertaining shows you've ever had. Their expertise and personalities were top notch!”

Boyd has noticed and shared his gratitude for all the love shown to him and his show. On June 3, he wrote in his Instagram Stories, “…these ‘bring back #LuxeForLess' posts/petitions have me blushing like 🥰❤️ Thank you. I'm grateful.”

George Clooney is proud of his former “E.R.” co-star Noah Wyle for the success of the Apple TV+ series “The Pitt.” In an appearance on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” June 3, Clooney said he and Wyle had been “dear friends” since shooting their own medical drama.

“He is just the most honorable, talented young man,” Clooney said. “I get to say [that] because I'm an old man and I cannot be happier for his success on the show. The show is just a beautiful show, and he does just a great job with it.”

Wyle is leading many major predictions in the Emmy nominations race for the Best Actor in a Drama Series. Wyle discussed the success of “The Pitt” with Yahoo! earlier this year.

“[It'] extremely gratifying,” he said. “I keep asking my son, where are all these conversations taking place? He's like, ‘Dad, you're not on Reddit.' I don't even know how to find that, so for me, gauging impact has been extremely tricky, except for my own circle of friends and family and what I get from the medical community. It's fucking great. Are you kidding! [laughs] I'm thrilled that this show that we put so much heart into is resonating the way that it is.”

 










Clooney, meanwhile, is appearing in Broadway's “Good Night, and Good Luck,” based on the 2005 film he wrote with Grant Heslov. The Oscar-winning star, who made his Broadway debut with the show, is nominated for Best Actor in a Play at the Tony Awards. The ceremony will air Sunday, June 8, at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.

CNN and HBO Max will air a live performance of the play “Good Night, and Good Luck” at 7 p.m. ET the night before. Clooney told Deadline that his “E.R.” experience will come in handy for the performance.

“I have a little bit of a history with doing live television,” Clooney said. “I talked NBC into doing ‘E.R.' as a live show, and then I did a live movie called ‘Fail Safe' for CBS. Saturday is a good night for us because it's our last evening performance. Our run is over so it's not costing the play anything anymore. Why don't we open it up and show people how fun it is to come to New York to see a play?”

“The Pitt” is now streaming on HBO Max.

 Best New Reissue

Genre:

Folk/Country

Label:

Asthmatic Kitty

Reviewed:

June 7, 2025

Only three sense memories remain from the night my wife and I came home from the hospital after our daughter died, 10 years ago this May. My brother, sleeping like a dog on the couch behind us, a miserable sentinel. The warmth of my wife's hot tears and breath on my face, inches from my own. And something else, in the background, playing over and over again: Sufjan Stevens' Carrie & Lowell.

Why would we do that to ourselves? The album that opens with “Death With Dignity,” the album whose most memorable chorus is a whispered “we're all gonna die.” And yet I kept returning to the record player, flipping the album over and over. The album functioned as the bleakest kind of prayer, the one that doesn't even ask for things, just offers a beseeching glance skyward: Notice me. Feel me.

In the myopia of my shock and early grief, I barely registered the complicated and brutal autobiographical truth of the record. Yes, it's an album with a Polaroid on the cover, clearly from a personal collection, paired with two first names. Yes, the lyrics are so specific to one man's experience as to approach the forensic: “When I was three, three maybe four….” And yet the thumbprint of tragedy, the outline and silhouette of grief, was all I needed from Carrie & Lowell. I gulped at it, greedily, again and again. My relationship to an album has rarely been more intense. Until this month, I couldn't bear to put it back on. To me, it had become like a death march, or a funeral mass: music for use.

But Carrie & Lowell, newly reissued by Asthmatic Kitty with a modest addendum of bonus tracks and a gorgeous 40-page photo album, survives my bloodshot fixation because it is so formally perfect. The arrangements feel inevitable in the way the harmonic motion of a Bach suite feels inevitable. There isn't a single breath on the album that doesn't feel drawn with specificity. Play the opening of “Death With Dignity” while staring at a creek, and the rhythms of the opening guitar figure will naturally match up with the flow of the water.

There aren't many artists who can capture and preserve this intimacy and intensity. There is an obvious comparison to Elliott Smith, who similarly matched up a shaky and tender vocal with arrangements that felt like you could stare straight through them. But not even Smith bared his soul as directly, simply, and plainly as Stevens does here. Smith was often obfuscating or misdirecting in his lyrics even when it seemed he was confessing, but Stevens lays it all out: times, places, dates, car models. The familiarity that I get from these songs is the same I get from a short story collection rooted in a specific setting—the Nevada of Claire Vaye Watkins' Battleborn, the Wyoming of Annie Proulx's Close Range. Stevens' memories become sacred the more granular they become.

Sufjan Stevens is embarrassed by this album. Mortified, even. He has been commemorating its re-release by disavowing it point-blank. In the essay that accompanies its packaging, he calls it “painful, humiliating, and an utter miscarriage of bad intentions.” He went on NPR recently and stood firm in this rejection in the face of the host's hesitant probing. Didn't he find some pride, comfort, or peace in the fact that his album reached so many people? No, he could only say. He attempted to write the story of his mother, another human being whom he never truly understood, and who had taken whatever secrets she held with her. He was just a lost boy, making patterns in the air from his grief. “I don't have any authority over my mother and her life or experience or her death,” he said. “All I have is speculation and my imagination and my own misery… I still don't feel good about myself for making these songs.”

Watching Stevens castigate himself for self-loathing by performing more of it in public is poignant and painful. He captured the essential hopelessness of making art to replace a person in fewer lines on the album itself: “Nothing can be changed/The past is still the past/The bridge to nowhere,” he sang on “Should Have Known Better.” “What's the point of singing songs/If they'll never even hear you?” he asks on “Eugene.” Lurking inside Stevens' refutation of Carrie & Lowell, deep beliefs insist themselves: The dead keep their secrets. We are left with nothing when they go save for a handful of cherished misconceptions. Death is real, and it's not for making into art.

And yet: What if we belong to other people as much or more as we belong to ourselves? What if our real secrets are not a palmful of baubles we keep inside some protected box, but the stories the loved ones who followed us with their eyes, who lavished their wondering love on us, told themselves? In this view, we don't take secrets with us when we die; we scatter them upon the earth in our passing like a flower releasing pollen. Maybe Sufjan holds more of his mother's secrets than he takes credit for.

Or maybe the dead do abscond with all their mysteries intact, and we'll always be outside, in the cold, yearning for the warmth of what they know. Maybe the songs Stevens wrote and recorded with his mother's name and face on them represent the only way those of us left living generate warmth for ourselves. Stevens' voice was the only sound I allowed to follow me into the darkest cavern. Even if his story was only ever for us, and never for his mother, we are transformed immeasurably, and for the better, by it.

	The MAGA right has responded to the explosive feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk largely with pleas for the American president and world's richest man to reconcile, if only for the greater good of Republican Party dominance. 


	That doesn't seem like that's going to happen anytime soon considering the attacks Musk leveled against Trump on Thursday, Trump's media tour bashing Musk on Friday, and the fact that White House staff and the president's proxies are actively pressuring people who've been allies to both to pick a side in MAGAland's ongoing divorce proceedings.


	“We are taking away Elon's friends,” a senior Trump administration official bluntly tells Rolling Stone. “If he wants them back, he will need to kiss Donald Trump's ass harder than he's ever kissed anybody's ass before in his entire life.” 


	This official adds: “Even then, it's not a given he gets to come back from this.”


	On Thursday, another source with knowledge of the matter told this magazine that Trump White House staff had already started making phone calls and sending messages to certain high-profile allies (big donors in the party, conservative luminaries, and so forth) of both Trump and Musk, demanding they choose pick sides in this melodrama — adding that it would likely be the easiest choice they'd ever make.

	











	“Nobody even has to ask me; it's no choice at all: I am Team Trump all the way. He is my friend and he's my president,” says Darrell Scott, a Cleveland, Ohio-area pastor who has advised Trump on different matters and initiatives ever since 2016. “What some people don't understand about Trump is that he is a very gregarious person. But when he needs to be the boss, he can switch to that mode pretty quickly. And I don't think Elon was able to deal with that … Now, he's probably got a lot of people in his ear about this right now. All I've done since this all blew up on Thursday so far is send him a text, telling him: ‘Be encouraged.'”

	It appears that the administration's high-school-cafeteria-style pressure campaign and popularity contest is — even at its very infancy — working out for them. Another Trump official notes that since this all exploded into full public display on Thursday, members of Trump's government and inner sanctum have been inundated with messages from outside allies and collaborators in the business, media, and political elite stressing their allegiance to the 45th and 47th U.S. president.


	The onrush of fealty is getting so intense that some of the messages, according to this administration official, include lines like: “In case the president didn't see my text…” and “Elon is dead to us.”


	But the Trump administration's response may ultimately involve more than just a pressure campaign for the duo's mutuals to choose a side. The president personally threatened on Thursday to cancel Musk's government contracts, and MAGA diehards like Trump's former top strategist Steve Bannon have called for Musk's immigration status to be investigated, and even for the government to seize control of Musk's company. The Trump team at least seems open to the idea of reopening federal probes into Musk's empire. “THIS ADMINISTRATION COULD ALWAYS START THE INVESTIGATIONS AGAIN,” one senior Trump appointee messaged Rolling Stone after the Tesla and SpaceX billionaire, who ruffled (to say the least…) his share of feathers while serving as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), turned on the president.


	It is unclear how many of these important “friends” the world's richest person will be able to hold on to in the near and long term — but so far, it's not looking too great for him. (On Friday night, Musk started deleting his posts criticizing Trump.)

	Right-wing influencers, meanwhile, have been divided in their response to the breakup. Most of them have lamented that Trump and Musk are fighting while urging them to figure out a way to reconcile, while some have dug in on one side of the feud or the other.


	“Broooos please noooooo. We love you both so much,” rapper, outspoken Hitler fan, and on-and-off Trump ally Kanye West posted to Musk's social media site X. 


	Bannon, for his part, told Politico that he's “going to fucking war” against Musk. The former Trump official is not showing Musk a hint of empathy, despite the fact that Bannon once went through his own (albeit temporary) excommunication from Trumpworld's upper crust.

	











	Furthermore, influential MAGA commentator @catturd2 has been lashing out at commentators sympathetic to Musk, as well as conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who said Trump must respond to Musk's allegation that the president's name appears in the government's files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Pro-Musk X user Ian Miles Cheong, meanwhile, wrote in a post that Trump should be impeached and replaced with Vice President J.D. Vance, who has been sympathetic to tech industry figures like Musk. Musk replied, “Yes,” to the post calling for Trump's removal.

	Vance and other top Trump administration figures are, of course, making clear where their allegiance lies. 


	“President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads,” the vice president wrote. “I'm proud to stand beside him.”

	In 1994, my parents finally went to see The Rolling Stones. The group released Voodoo Lounge, their twentieth album, in July that year, and immediately began touring it. In August, they came to East Rutherford, New Jersey, to play at a football stadium, and my mom and dad decided it was the right time to check a major show off their bucket list. The moment represented an inflection point for the group. It was the first album the Stones had released in five years and was met with a degree of skepticism. They were firmly in middle age, three decades into their career, and had seemingly come to the realization many sixties era Boomer artists were waking up to: Their largely middle class, middlebrow audience had grown up along with them, and were liquid enough financially to pay exorbitant prices for shitty seats to see the band that had eluded them for so long, even if there was rampant speculation the group was washed, and on the downside of their primes. 


	The Stones were on my mind last night at Lil Wayne's Madison Square Garden concert, because it's been 28 years since the Hot Boys released their debut album, Get It How U Live It! on an independent New Orleans based rap label that called itself Cash Money Records, nearly the same span of time between the Rolling Stones' debut in 1964, and the Voodoo Lounge Tour.

	











	Wayne's show last night, and the venue itself, was a hard booking to figure out, and made complete sense. Wayne has circled New York, a city with a sacred and tortured place in his heart, the entirety of his career. It's where he found his muses in Jay-Z and the Diplomats in the 2000s, as well as where he served an eight-month prison sentence at the peak of his fame and his artistic powers, in Rikers Island over a possession of a loaded weapon charge in 2007. And yet, here he was holding a glorified album release party in the world's most famous arena, ostensibly the first leg of a North American Carter VI tour that opens here the first week in June, but won't resume until the very end of July.

	The album we had all gathered to celebrate, two hours past the advertised start time for the show, is quite simply a fucking disaster. Tha Carter VI is the work of an artist who either doesn't have a creative team around him capable of pushing back on his worst and most indulgent impulses, or one unwilling to listen to dissenting voices. And in lieu of that lack of editorial process, its author has clearly misplaced, if not permanently lost, his once unimpeachable grip on his true north. Since Carter VI was released on Friday at midnight, my timeline's been ablaze with fans, former fans, and haters chiming in on what exactly had gone so terribly wrong.


	And yet the electrified Garden crowd was stuffed to the bleeds by the time Wayne hit the stage just after 10, strutting to the stage with a white electric rockstar axe, sporting blonde dreads, pink sweats tucked into heeled knee high boots, an oversized heavyweight Britney Spears T-shirt with her name in neon pink script, a chunky scarf, a bejeweled grill, white framed sunglasses—which would be subsequently swapped out for glasses so big each lens threatened to blot out Wayne's face—and a frozen wrist and neck, rocking doubled iced out crucifix chains and an iced out crucifix pinky ring to go with an iced out wallet chain and a slowly burning late-90s-sized blunt hanging out of a corner of his mouth. 


	There was a minimal stage show behind him: A steeply pitched platform behind the rapper with the Roman Numerals “I” and “V' glowing, garden variety pyrotechnics and smoke cannons, a live drummer and a DJ, but the real special effect was the music. The polished old pro bent time and space, keeping the unfortunate new work to a minimum and running through his hits, reliving, nearly chronologically, the thrill of experiencing his catalog all over again at a speed run.

	The show is special, as it is for any artist with the generational staying power of Wayne, or say, the Stones, because it can represent entire eras in music, in life, in the career of the artist, a chameleonic constant shifting that is a necessity when you've been around for decades. It's why the live experience in this age of streaming is so vital for younger fans trying to navigate this massive back catalog. 


	A pop animal like Wayne must be experienced outside. Pay attention to the ironclad, near chronological setlist built through generations of trial and error response on the road, and watch how tens of thousands of people who were there for each step of Wayne's career reacts to it. To experience the power of these highlights in the room, with a crowd. He has a roster of endless hits—some that touched the Billboard charts and some that never did because the samples can't be cleared and they're still not streaming but were ubiquitous in the aughts nevertheless—from decades of classic, iconic album and mixtape work, which matters when you're trying to understand the impact of an artist of this magnitude. 

	











	It's a reminder that Lil Wayne is one of the most unique and context-rich rappers of the modern era, thanks to his inventive and influential approach. No GOAT-level rapper less resembles the artist he was when he began, compared to the artist he became, than Wayne does.


	Like LL Cool J (Who made a brief but memorable cameo on the Garden stage), he was a survivor who never stopped evolving. Whose appeal to his longtime followers was in charting his evolution: From yapping adolescent with the good fortune of being in proximity to one of hip hop's great groups, powered by one of its greatest beat architects, to a young solo rapper experimenting with his style on his underground mixtapes while at the same time aping the influences he wore on his sleeve on his safe and pat major label releases, be it an imitation of Jeezy and T.I.'s early aughts southern crack rap, or Jay-Z's traditional, rockist east coast LPs, to finally combining all those years of experimentation, and metabolizing those influences and producing a sound and a style that was entirely personal and unique, that at last blended his strange instinctive mixtape shit and pragmatic one-for-them proper album releases to produce a run that changed rap to such a degree it has clearly become difficult to look back and understand how subversive and groundbreaking it was at the time.


	Old Wayne fans such as myself are a funny breed. We're washed people who haven't quite accepted we're washed, in overlaundered Polos with fucked up collars, wearing sunglasses inside in the dark at night and extremely expensive fendi buckets that look stupid as hell. But the music at MSG made us all children again. And this is why you can more or less skip Tha Carter VI, but can't afford to miss Wayne live this summer if you have the opportunity to go see him. His show recreates the joy of his journey, the sense of wonder, the three-decade progression in style and substance that made Wayne one of the greatest rappers of the modern era. 


	On the 30-year anniversary of the Voodoo Lounge Tour, my parents went back to the Meadowlands to see The Rolling Stones again last year, with a pair of tickets that were still wildly expensive and in demand, this time at a football stadium named after an insurance company rather than a football team. The hand-wringing over Voodoo Lounge and the Voodoo Lounge Tour was both warranted and empty, depending on your perspective and what matters to you as a fan. The album was characterized as a bloated, 15-track, one-hour-long product of the insufferable “CD era”, a glorified excuse to tour that has largely been forgotten, and you could argue that, in terms of new music, it was the official death knell of the Rolling Stones' relevance. It also was the richest tour ever to that point, a record the Stones themselves would break multiple times in the ensuing years, the birth of the band as conveyors of “adult contemporary” bullshit, a nostalgia factory/national mint, that thanks to their longevity made them one of the first groups to capitalize on their boomer fanbase aging into elder feeling-chasers and exploring the limits of what you could charge for a concert ticket, ushering us into this current, deeply fucked era of crazed fans willing to go into significant debt to see Taylor or Beyoncé.

	Mick and Keith are in their 80s; they are multi-millionaires and have spent the last three decades releasing music occasionally, strictly for their hardcore fan base, but largely living off the incredible creative output of their first three decades. I thought about that as Wayne poignantly ended his show with “A Milli”, one of the strangest Grammy-winning, Billboard Top 10 hits in rap history.


	I sat next to a middle aged mother and her teenage son freaking out to Wayne and particularly “A Milli” in the Garden last night, and considered these institutions in pop, the generations of fans who grew up on the Stones' music and Wayne's music, who exposed their kids and grandkids to that incredible initial run and come together whenever these acts go back on the road to appreciate one of the great catalogs in the American songbook again and celebrate their shared love for it. To run back the hits, and remember the glory days, when our favorite artists were young, and so were we.

	When one of his eyes doesn't feel as if it's wobbling up and down, or he doesn't feel so depleted that he has to nap, Matthew Sweet still has moments of hope. Until last fall, one of the downstairs rooms in his Omaha, Nebraska, home was his music room, filled with guitars, a recording console, and assorted gear. But since he can no longer climb stairs for the foreseeable future, he now spends a good deal of his time in that room on a newly installed king-sized bed. What remains of his musical setup is still visible, reminders of a life and career on pause.


	“I guess I have a feeling that I will make music with all of it,” Sweet says, in his first interview eight months after he was rushed to a hospital. “In that way, it's positive. It's a vision of the time when I'll be able to use everything. I don't feel like it's that far away. I don't feel like it will be an impossible thing for me to write songs. Then again, I don't really feel a burning desire to figure that out, because there's just so much stuff making it difficult right now.”

	











	For Sweet, 2024 was shaping up to be a reset. After several years off the road after the pandemic, the man who almost single-handedly kept power-pop alive had put together a new band and played shows in the spring. He was in the early stages of prepping his first album since 2021. In the fall, he started another round of gigs, this time opening for Hanson, whom he's known and worked with for more than 20 years, and doing his own separate shows. “I really felt very positive about it,” he says. “I was doing two-hour-long acoustic shows playing songs from all during my career.”

	Then, last Oct. 12, Sweet and his crew — his small acoustic band, his road manager — arrived at their hotel in Toronto. His tour with Hanson was into its second week, and Sweet had just driven up from the previous stop in Baltimore. As they were checking in, the singer, who had turned 60 a week before, felt a sensation he'd never experienced before. “The first thing I felt was really cool, like cold sweat,” he says. “And I remember saying to one of my band members, ‘Feel my arm.

	Slumping into a chair behind the front desk, Sweet began hearing what he calls “this kind of tinnitus, more like white noise, and that became really, really, really loud, in both my ears. And that's the last thing I remember until I was in an ambulance and I heard a guy say, ‘Sir, you've had a stroke.'”


	In the months since that diagnosis, Sweet has had to cope with more than canceled performances. First in Canada, then in his home state, and now at his house, he's had to relearn how to walk, talk, and play any sort of instrument. He's learned that a stroke can impact other parts of the body and that recovery can be slow and painstaking. Since he didn't have insurance at the time of his stroke, he's also become a representation of artists who can't always afford it and count on touring to pay their bills.  


	“It was really a drag, because the touring went so amazingly well in the first part of the year,” Sweet says now. “And then, bang, I had the stroke, and it was just all over.”


From his studio-bedroom, Sweet recalls the beginnings of his career with one of the chuckles that unexpectedly punctuates a conversation with him. It was the mid-Eighties, and the Nebraska-born Sweet, who'd moved to Athens, Georgia, for college and had become swept up in the burgeoning indie rock of the time, was on tour with the Golden Palominos. Featuring an ever-shifting lineup of New York-area musicians like keyboardist Bernie Worrell, singer Syd Straw, guitarist Arto Lindsay, bassist Bill Laswell, and drummer Anton Fier, the Palominos were Sweet's induction into the life of a traveling musician.

	“I was just a kid, and it was the first time I was ever really on a bus tour, so it was like Touring 101,” Sweet says. “I would like to go see Bernie in his room, and he'd be there with a bunch of girls in the bed with him. Just classic. Chrissie Hynde came to see us in Toronto. We stayed up with her all night in a hotel room, and I was like a fly on the wall, maybe providing the weed. Such cool memories.”

	











	With his winsome voice and penchant for charged guitar melodies rooted in his love of the Beatles, Sweet, along with bands like the Smithereens, kept guitar pop alive after hair metal had overtaken rock & roll. The battle was somewhat uphill, but Sweet's third album, 1991's Girlfriend, established him as an artist in his own pop right. With the advent of grunge the following year, Sweet's subsequent albums didn't have the same commercial impact, but he remained a master of the form, recorded three duet albums with the Bangles' Susanna Hoffs, and helped Hanson make the transition to indie pop by collaborating on their album Underneath. His voice was heard in a 2014 episode of The Simpsons (Homer and other dads form a band, and Sweet provided a Journey parody song for them to play), and he was also glimpsed in Austin Powers in Goldmember.


	For Russell Carter, Sweet's longtime manager, Sweet's return to the road in 2024 was the start of a plan to rebrand him as a legacy artist, especially for the Gen Xers who grew up with his records. But that schedule was tabled when Carter heard from his sons (one of whom was Sweet's road manager, another in his band) that Sweet was headed for an ICU in Toronto. “That was lucky,” Carter says. “He could have been in the middle of nowhere in a van on a trip to Canada. Or he could have been on an airplane. The circumstances of where he was couldn't have been better.”


	Taylor Hanson says he and his brothers were rattled by the news. “We were saying, ‘What's going on?'” Hanson says. “We heard it was something extreme and we knew pretty quickly he was going to the hospital. Everyone jumps to the worst scenario. At first we through it was a heart attack.”


	At the hospital in Toronto, aides had Sweet sit up in bed to demonstrate how his body had been impacted by his stroke: His left side couldn't handle the weight and would fold under him. In time, doctors lowered his blood pressure and some progress was made with his speech, as Carter learned during calls with him. “He had to make great effort to bring thoughts together,” Carter says. “He could make a great deal of sense, but not for long. But he improved day by day.” 


	Sweet also learned that his stroke had taken place in an unusual spot, the pons region in the back of the brainstem. The cause, he was told, was likely a spike in blood pressure. Adding to the mystery, Sweet had high blood pressure in his youth but had lowered it in recent years.

	











	By way of an ambulance transport plane with two nurses, Sweet was eventually flown back to Omaha to begin rehab at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital. “I was the last one to realize how bad it is to have a stroke like that,” he says. “I sort of felt like just everything was going to come back really soon. And then as I got back to Omaha and went to Madonna, they had group classes, where the idea is to explain to you what to expect from it. I found that really depressing. I did not want to go to this class full of people who all had strokes and have to learn how bad it could be, but it was part of my coming to terms with it.”


	At that facility, Sweet began physical therapy, walking exercises, and using a robotic device to help him regain more control of his impacted left arm. But his obstacles were just beginning. At that point, he didn't have health insurance, and the bills, starting with that pricy transportation from Toronto, began piling up. “A good six weeks without insurance, so it was crazy,” he says. “It was so, so expensive, $5,600 a day or something. I didn't know it could be that much. I would sit there and think, ‘What could I have bought with today's money?'”


	To help defray those costs, Carter set up a GoFundMe for Sweet soon after. Fans contributed an average of $50, but another indication of Sweet's respect in the industry was the list of musicians who donated: John Mayer, Pearl Jam's Jeff Ament, producer Brendan O'Brien, and members of R.E.M. (Peter Buck and Mike Mills), the Bangles (Hoffs and Vicki Peterson), and the Go-Go's (Belinda Carlisle and Jane Wiedlin).


	Movie-world admirers like Jon Cryer and Judd Apatow also contributed, resulting in a fund that currently sits at more than $600,000. “I just love his music,” Apatow tells Rolling Stone. “The sound of his voice and his guitar always makes me instantly happy. He's been in heavy rotation in my house forever and I've written entire screenplays to his music. 100% Fun powered me forward through many writing projects. I donated because he has brought me so much joy and wanted to let him know how much his work meant to me.”


	Sweet says he was initially unaware the fund had been set up and was shocked to see the list of donors. “Yeah, I saw those names,” he says. “I was like, ‘I know you, Ducky!' Probably the most emotional moments I had early on in the stroke was a result of being so amazed there were that many people that cared. It was an awakening to see how much heart people have. Part of me was like, ‘How do they all know how bad a stroke is?' I didn't know. You think old people have strokes.”

	











	Says Hanson of the outpouring, “I hope Matthew recognizes that his music has reached and touched a lot of people. More than sometimes he realizes.”


As his early rehab was taking place, Sweet's home, which he shares with his wife Lisa and their niece, was being retrofitted for his return. Carpeting was ripped up and replaced with wood floors to allow him to use his walker, and door frames were widened to accommodate a wheelchair. Until the upgrades were finished, the Sweets checked into a local hotel (“I was really ready to leave after being in a hospital bed all day,” he says), but that resulted in another setback: When Lisa attempted to help bathe her husband, they both slipped on the shower floor, and Lisa broke a leg and had to be hospitalized herself. “So,” Sweet says, “not good luck for us to have that happen.”


	Sweet's life hasn't gotten any easier since then. As likely aftereffectsof his stroke, he's been diagnosed with ataxia, a neurological condition that often leaves him off balance, and nystagmus, which make one's eyes unexpectedly move side to side or up and down. Sweet suspects the latter diagnosis may have resulted from a smaller stroke he could have experienced a few months ago. He'd also been diagnosed long before his stroke with essential tremor, the neurological condition that causes people's hands or heads to shake. (Katharine Hepburn famously suffered from it.) “There is a shaking that's pretty pronounced on the left side of my head, as weird as that sounds,” he says. “So the early part of the day, I'm often shaking a lot in the left side of my head and face.”


	Even with nystagmus, Sweet can see well enough, but aides help him type out texts to friends. A sense of vertigo also accompanies him: “When I look down, the floor looks like it's caving in, which is really kind of unnerving.” That makes it challenging for him to use a walker and has led him to have to rely on a wheelchair and nursing aides, who help transport him to his bed, shower, and bathroom or into a car. He can't walk upstairs and remains confined to the first floor of his home.


	Financially speaking, Sweet is doing better thanks to the GoFundMe, and he's applied for Social Security disability benefits and now has insurance via the Affordable Care Act. But with home-care costs continuing, his GoFundMe has been rebooted. Under the Trump presidency, the future of Social Security itself is uncertain. In the worst-case scenario, Sweet says he may have to sell his house and move to a less expensive place.

	











	The future remains a blank page, physically and professionally. “It's sobering to think I might just have to always have a person that can handle moving me one place to another,” says Sweet. “My thoughts originally were, ‘Well, how likely is it that I'll walk if I have the ataxia?' And no one will say. It's more like they don't know. This might be as good as it gets, or I might make progress.”


	Carter shares that sense of frustration. “He's getting treatment from lots of good doctors, but the most frustrating thing for Matthew is that he still has no prognosis,” he says. “They encourage him to put his nose to the grindstone and do all the PT and just hope for the best. It's somewhat discouraging that he hasn't made more progress, but I don't think that's unusual. It's a very slow process.”


	Then there's his music. Before the stroke, Sweet was in the early stages of making an album he was calling Midsommar. “I don't feel like it's in any way ready to be brought to fruition right now,” he says, “but I certainly remember it.”


	In conversation with Rolling Stone, Sweet speaks in a voice that is occasionally halting, but he's lucid and never losing his breath. Singing, however, could be another issue, despite undergoing speech therapy in rehab. “Maybe I'll regain some of the breath power, but it hasn't happened yet,” he says. “I just kind of run out of air at the end of a word, and then I have to start over and say the word again.”


	Given his issues with his left hand, guitar playing is off the table, but he's hopeful that he can play some keyboards, since he generally relied on his right hand for the instrument. Performing live, however, feels unfathomable. “Most of the venues we were in last fall had stairs in them,” he says. “There's just no way I could ever go up to the dressing rooms. So I think, ‘What would it even be like to tour? Other people play instruments, and I'm just there on stage attempting to sing?'”

	As part of his tour with Hanson, the band had been hoping to bring Sweet onstage for the title song of Underneath, which Sweet wrote for them. “One of the sad personal notes is that we were a show away from doing it at soundcheck and remembering the arrangement and then playing it,” Taylor Hanson says. “But it hadn't happened yet. I'm going to hold out that that will occur, in some form.”


	Sweet insists he is remaining as optimistic as possible. “I have to just be happy to be alive and try to do what I can each day,” he says. “Somedays I'm just tired and want to stay in bed. Some days I can be awake more. I do have a lot of weepy moments, but I'm generally a positive kind of person, and so I try to be hopeful and accepting and think, ‘If this is how I have to be, that'll be okay, and if I have breakthroughs, that'll be great.' All my life, I've been an optimist. So even if a lot of stuff is a little bit out of my reach right now, it doesn't make me not want to try and keep living.”

Likening a visit to the space station to a camping trip, former NASA astronaut and Axiom-4 mission commander Peggy Whitson said the orbital station has enough food, water and other supplies to sustain the daily lives of those on board.

""We have wet towels that we can use every day to clean ourselves. And we have enough resources from food and water perspectives that we can provide for ourselves. So it isn't like going to some ultra-rich hotel spa or whatever. It is very much a bit of a camping trip. But it's a lot of fun,"" she told NDTV.

Days ahead of the mission's June 10 launch, Dr Whitson said that the most ""special part"" would be the integration of her team of four with the seven astronauts already on board the International Space station (ISS). The orbital station, she said, is equivalent to inter-connected bus-sized modules of various sizes with four pull-up laboratories, a toilet, exercise hardware and life support systems. ""There's actually a lot more space than you think. But obviously, by increasing the crew size by four, it will be a challenge for us to all integrate and work together,"" she said when asked if the ISS will become crowded when the Axiom-4 team enters it.

Should the Axiom-4 mission launch be successful, Dr Whitson and her team members Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, European Space Agency project astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski of Poland, and Tibor Kapu of Hungary will be seen floating around the orbital lab amid its screens, plugs, wires, switches, pipes and knobs. But what she is confident of is life far beyond among the billions of galaxies that unfold outside the space station's portal windows.

""I haven't seen any (extraterrestrial life) with my own eyes. But what I have seen is just billions and billions of stars. And this is just our little galaxy. And there's billions and billions of galaxies. And I know, I know there has to be other life out there, because it is so expansive. I'm sure it exists, it may not look or sound like us,"" Dr Whitson said. That, she said, is the what pushes the idea of exploration and drives the continuous development of technologies further and further to find out about life beyond Earth.

Dr Whitson and her colleague Mr Shukla, who is called ""Shux"" by the team, will especially look at India from space. ""All of planet Earth is beautiful. India is special as well. It's relatively easy to pick out India because of the geography. I'm looking forward to seeing it again,"" she said.

The Axiom-4 mission will launch on June 10 at 5.52 pm IST on board SpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. Mr Shukla will be the second Indian to travel to space four decades after Rakesh Sharma's iconic spaceflight onboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft in 1984.

Once docked, the astronauts plan to spend up to 14 days aboard the orbiting laboratory, conducting science, outreach, and commercial activities.

The Axiom-4 astronauts will perform around 60 scientific studies and activities representing 31 countries during their 14-day stay at the ISS. Mr Shukla is set to conduct exclusive food and nutrition-related experiments developed under a collaboration between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), with support from NASA.

The experiments aim to pioneer space nutrition and self-sustaining life support systems, vital for future long-duration space travel. ISRO has lined up a set of seven experiments for Mr Shukla, who will also participate in five joint studies planned by NASA for its human research programme. It has drawn up plans to focus on India-centric food for carrying out experiments on the ISS, including sprouting methi (Fenugreek) and moong (green gram) in microgravity conditions.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}","other"

Driving through the night on a remote New Hampshire road in 1961, Barney and Betty Hill were startled when a strange light in the sky appeared to follow them, eventually hovering directly above their car in the shape of a flying saucer. The newlyweds, returning home from a honeymoon at Niagara Falls, were soon alarmed by a loud buzzing sound — and then, seemingly in an instant, they were back home 35 miles away, unable to recall how they got there. Their watches had stopped, and their memories were hazy.

This bizarre experience would become one of the first widely publicised alien abduction stories. At the time, no one had spoken publicly about such encounters. But the Hills — Barney, a 39-year-old postal worker, and Betty, a 41-year-old social worker — believed they had been taken aboard an extraterrestrial craft.

Now, their story is being brought to the screen in the film Strange Arrivals , starring Demi Moore as Betty and Colman Domingo as Barney. Based on the podcast of the same name, the movie revisits the couple's terrifying night and the events that followed.

In interviews years later, Betty described undergoing a physical exam aboard the alien craft. She recalled the beings photographing her skin, examining her hands and feet, and testing her nervous system. Under hypnosis in 1964, she said they inserted a large needle into her navel as a pregnancy test — despite her protests.

Barney died in 1969 of a brain hemorrhage at age 46. Betty later became a well-known figure in the UFO community, passing away in 2004 at 85. Their niece, Kathleen Marden — who was 13 at the time and now a veteran UFO researcher — insists her aunt and uncle were telling “God's honest truth”.

Kathleen recalls visiting the Hills two days after the incident. “Barney was visibly shaken. Their watches had stopped working, Betty's dress was torn, and they refused to bring their luggage inside, fearing contamination,” she said.

According to Kathleen, Barney reported his shoes were so scraped he had to buy a new pair, and Betty's torn dress showed signs of a struggle. During hypnosis sessions with psychiatrist Dr. Benjamin Simon, the Hills described being examined by humanoid beings aboard a disc-shaped craft. Barney spoke of floating toward the ship, while Betty described tissue samples being taken.

Their account gained attention after being leaked to a newspaper in 1965, and was later adapted into the best-selling 1966 book The Interrupted Journey and the 1975 TV movie The UFO Incident , starring James Earl Jones.

Despite initial scepticism, Kathleen points to supporting evidence: 16 eyewitnesses allegedly saw the same craft that night, and scientific analysis of Betty's dress revealed unusual elements. Still, Dr. Simon maintained that their memories may have stemmed from dreams and trauma — particularly for Barney, a Black man navigating the racism of 1960s America.

Kathleen, who lived with the Hills for two years and serves as trustee of their estate, says filmmakers haven't consulted her. She's concerned the new movie might distort the truth. She says of Betty and Barney: “They experienced anxiety as a result of this experience, but they had no major mental illness.

“I'm fearful Betty might be portrayed as a delusional individual and that her husband loves her so much that he comes to believe her delusion.

“I'm going to be very upset if that is the case.”

Promising hero Aadi Saikumar teamed up with director Ugandhar Muni for the highly anticipated supernatural thriller Shambhala: A Mystical World, being produced by Rajasekhar Annabhimoju and Mahidhar Reddy under the Shining Pictures banner. As the movie is getting ready for release, the makers recently started the promotions by unveiling the first look posters of prominent cast of the movie. Now, they've taken the next big step by releasing the film's teaser.

The teaser begins with a powerful voiceover, while a mysterious fragment hurtles down from space and crashes into a quiet village. The voice says, “There are countless unfathomable mysteries in this universe. When science cannot explain them, it calls them superstition. But the moment it finds an explanation; it calls it a breakthrough.”

From that moment on, a series of misfortunes begins to unfold. Death strikes repeatedly and without warning. The fragment seems to wield control over the five elements, unleashing chaos upon the village. The villagers begin to behave strangely, as if possessed by some dark force.

“To command the five elements is no ordinary feat… Its influence is so vast that we can't even begin to imagine the situations we might have to face because of it,” continues the voiceover.

Amidst this turmoil, the protagonist arrives in the village to stop the evil force. However, the villagers, now under the fragment's malevolent influence, turn against him and launch a violent attack.

Director Ugandhar Muni has chosen a unique story and presented it in a gripping manner, filled with suspense, thrills, and intrigue throughout. The teaser effectively introduces the key characters, each displaying unsettling and abnormal behavior that adds to the mystery.

Aadi Saikumar makes a heroic entry, perfectly suited to the role. He impresses with his screen presence and performs some intense, high-impact stunts. The film also features strong performances from Archana Iyer, Swasika, Ravi Varma, Madhunandan, Shivakarthik, and Shailaja Priya, who play pivotal roles.

On the technical front, the teaser stands out with Praveen K Bangari's striking cinematography and Sricharan Pakala's powerful background score, both of which elevate the tension and atmosphere. The production values are clearly top-notch, reflecting a high standard of craftsmanship.

Overall, the astonishing teaser has significantly raised anticipation for the film. The makers of Shambhala: A Mystical World are expected to announce the release date soon.","{'href': 'https://www.gulte.com', 'title': 'Gulte'}","other"

With 15 years under its belt, The CW's Supernatural is packed full of memorable characters. However, few can equal the gravitas and impact of Death. The inherent power that oozes from actor Julian Richings has become legendary in Supernatural circles. Later in the series, actress Lisa Berry donned the scythe of Death, adding her flair to the character after the on-screen demise of the original incarnation.

Each appearance of Death carried significant weight and serious implications for the overarching storyline. Considering the perceived absence of God in Supernatural, until Chuck's eventual reveal in season 11, Death was the top cosmic, primordial powerhouse present in the show. In Supernatural, everything dies, and that doesn't happen without Death.

When Death first graced the screen in Supernatural, the character's legacy was cemented. Sporting a fancy car and heralded by his theme song, Death's stylish stride down the streets of Chicago is one of the most well-known scenes in the show's history. Death proves instrumental to Sam and Dean's fight against Lucifer in season 5. The rings of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are necessary to unlock Lucifer's cage, and Death's ring is the final piece to the puzzle. At their meeting in the pizzeria, Death reveals to Dean that he is much older than the universe itself and perhaps even older than God.

Death informs Dean that he is bound to do Lucifer's bidding against his will and agrees to give the Winchesters his ring to aid their plans. This is a pivotal point in the season as Sam and Dean are gearing up for their showdown with the Devil. It's made apparent that if Death did not agree to help them, the boys had next to no chance of obtaining his ring due to his power. Dean first approaches with Death's scythe, which can reap any creature, in hopes of coercing Death to give up the ring, and Death makes the scythe disappear and reappear in his hand to a visibly shaken Dean.

In the Supernatural mid-season finale of season 6, Dean seeks Death's help to restore Sam's soul from Lucifer's cage. Dean visits a colleague of his father's named Dr. Robert. He knows the only way to get a face-to-face meeting with Death at this point is if he does. Dr. Robert agrees to stop his heart and warns Dean that he has only about 3 minutes to conduct his business before the situation turns dire. Death seems amused yet entertains Dean's proposal to rescue Sam's soul from Hell, under one condition.

Supernatural is a series that drew in a wide range of fans who loved following Winchester's adventures. But which characters were the best?

Death's counteroffer is that Dean must take over his role for 24 hours. To teach Dean a lesson about the delicate nature of the circle of life and how upsetting it can have catastrophic results, he wanted Dean to see things from his perspective. The result is Dean realizing what a burden it is to bear Death's responsibility, and just how quickly things can go awry by deciding to save only one life that is destined to die. After the 24 hours is up, Death keeps his part of the bargain by saving Sam's soul. This is the turning point in season 6 as it introduces the arc of Sam's tortured soul, eventually breaking through the mental barriers Death placed in his head to keep him from reliving his time in the cage.

After Castiel absorbs the souls of Purgatory, becoming the new ""God"" in the season 6 finale, the Winchesters decide it would be best to seek Death to help deal with their new problem. To further their issues, the mental wall placed in Sam's head to protect him from his immense trauma suffered in Lucifer's cage is close to breaking. They're aware that a spell exists to bind Death to do their bidding because Lucifer could do so before the apocalypse. The boys summon Crowley and ask him for the spell. Crowley warns them they are playing with deadly forces, but ultimately gives them the scroll that lists the spells' ingredients.

Once they've gathered the ingredients, Sam, Dean and Bobby start the ritual to summon and bind Death. He is not happy at this turn of events. Castiel appears after the spell and threatens to kill them, but Dean says that is impossible since they have Death under control. This leads to Castiel breaking the spell, and a war of words ensues between the new ""God"" and Death. Death gets over his anger at the Winchesters, becoming increasingly annoyed by Castiel's arrogance. This is a key point in establishing the future villains of season 7, as Death warns Castiel that there are things older than souls in Purgatory, hinting at the presence of the Leviathans.

In the aftermath of the demon trials at the end of season 8, Sam is in a bad way. His body is broken, and all the angels have fallen from Heaven because of Metatron's spell. Dean is searching for answers on how to save his brother, as Sam is unconscious in the hospital. Dean is fighting off rogue angels in the hospital's hallway when he is saved by a seemingly friendly angel named Ezekiel, who is actually the angel Gadreel. Ezekiel offers to try and heal Sam before they are overrun by angels at their position.

Inside his head, Sam encounters Death. Death tells Sam that he has been waiting for him, and Sam is close to giving in. Ezekiel informs Dean that his attempts to heal Sam are not working, but if he can inhabit Sam's body, he can heal himself and Sam from within. Dean enters Sam's psyche with help from the angel Ezekiel and pleads with him not to go with Death, ultimately tricking him into agreeing to allow Ezekiel to enter his body. Sam's choice not to go with Death and allow Ezekiel to heal him sets up the storyline for the entirety of Season 9 of Supernatural, as Sam and Dean become at odds after Sam discovers he was tricked into being possessed by an angel.

The finale of season 10 of Supernatural is also the episode in which the original Death appears. Most of the season sees Dean struggle with the Mark of Cain and becoming prone to ever-increasing violent outbursts. He isolates himself from Sam and Castiel as they search for options to remove the Mark of Cain from him, deciding that using Rowena's Book of the Damned is their best option. Rowena informs them of the ingredients the spell requires while Dean is still causing trouble. Castiel ultimately summons Crowley to help them gather the items for the spell.

The CW's Supernatural took fans on a ride for 15 seasons. With various complex plot devices and storylines, some aspects of the show remain a bit odd.

Dean eventually calls on Death and asks him to kill him as the Mark of Cain is changing him into a monster. Unfortunately for Dean, Death says that not even he can kill him because the Mark requires a host, as it houses a primordial being known as The Darkness. If The Darkness were set free from the Mark, it would mean the end of humanity. Sam finds Dean, and a brutal fight ensues. As Death hands Dean his scythe to kill Sam, Dean uses it on Death and kills him. Dean killing Death is significant as now there must be a new Death, and since the Mark of Cain is removed without transferring hosts, Amara is unleashed, setting the primary antagonist for the following season.

Billie was a reaper under the original Death's reign. She appears in the second episode of season 11, ""Form and Void."" She is seen in the hallway of a hospital where Sam is trying to cure the disease caused by the Darkness. She is singing the song ""O' Death,"" which plays during the first on-screen appearance of Death in season 5. This hints at her eventual resurrection as Death in season 13. Billie, the reaper, is killed by Castiel in Season 12 to free the Winchesters from a blood oath they took from Billie.

The episode begins as a typical monster-of-the-week Supernatural special. Sam and Dean investigate a haunted sanatorium where two boys were attacked and discover the ghost of an evil doctor still haunts the building, keeping the ghosts of his former patients hostage. There are parallels to Dean's encounter with Death in the ""Appointment in Samarra"" episode. To find the bodies of the ghosts and set their spirits free, Dean injects himself with medication to stop his heart. He then encounters Billie in her new job as Death. She informs him that now is not his time to die and that he and Sam have a lot of work to do. This establishes Billie as a major player, as she now has access to all of death's powers and abilities.

Rowena is on a rampage as she's traveling through the northwest and murdering the upper management of major pharmaceutical companies. Upset that they trusted her, Sam and Dean pursue her. Not only is she harming humans, Rowena is incinerating the reapers that collect the souls of the recently deceased. Jessica, a reaper assigned to spy on Sam and Dean by Death, tells them she is upsetting the natural balance of the universe by killing people before their time is due, and this can have cosmic consequences.

Rowena reveals to Sam and Dean that she is trying to get Death's attention by killing her reapers. She wants to make a deal to bring her son, Crowley, back from the dead. Billie is not the Death of old, who almost found it amusing for people to return from the dead. She plays strictly by the rules. Billie appears before Rowena, and the witch attacks her with all of her magic, but it does nothing to Death. Billie takes pity on Rowena and tells her she has changed for the better, and sometimes people lose things they can't get back. This marks a major turning point for Rowena as a character, and she aids Sam and Dean in their fight against the apocalyptic world of angels.

The multiverse version of the Archangel Michael has trapped Dean inside his head, placating him with false visions. Dean thinks he owns a bar and continues living out this loop day after day, while Michael uses his body to take over the world. Outside, Sam, Castiel, Jack, and a group of hunters gather to fight off Michael's monsters and attempt to free Dean from his mental prison. Sam decides upon an experimental device found within the Men of Letters headquarters that will allow him and Castiel to enter Dean's mind and convince him to expel Michael. As Sam and Castiel struggle to convince Dean he is living in an illusion, the monsters created by Michael attack the secret bunker.

Once Dean finally comes around to the idea, a fight ensues between Dean, Sam, Castiel and Michael. They can eventually lock Michael inside of Dean's head. Outside, Jack uses his powers to exterminate the siege of monsters, draining a bit of his soul. Dean is alone in his room gathering his thoughts as Death appears. She informs him that his various death books in her library now all end the same, with Michael breaking from his prison and ending the world. The only other option is for Dean to lock himself and Michael in a magical device called a Ma'lak Box, designed to hold archangels. Jack ultimately kills Michael, but the importance of Death's mentioning the Ma'lak Box is shown when the Winchesters use it to contain Jack. This sets up their brief conflict with Jack and eventually God.

In the season 14 finale, Jack is unintentionally causing a worldwide catastrophe. Upset that the Winchesters attempted to lock him in the Ma'lak Box, he flees. As he roams the city, he can hear all the lies being told to each other simultaneously by people in the streets. He orders them all to stop lying, causing everyone to be unable to lie. The result is complete chaos. These events force Chuck to appear and interfere, claiming Jack is a big problem. Dean wants to kill Jack, while Sam and Castiel are torn. Chuck fashions a gun that he says is the only way to defeat Jack, but the catch is that it will also kill whoever shoots it.

In Supernatural, Chuck does not fear much, considering he is God. However, Sam can detect that there is a hint of fear present when it comes to Jack. This episode marks the veil of Chuck's true intentions being lifted. He is more interested in an interesting story than in helping them. As Dean finally tracks Jack down, he realizes he cannot bring himself to kill him. This angers Chuck, and he kills Jack himself, without the gun, proving he was lying about it being the only way. Jack wakes up in The Empty, and Death appears to him. This is a pivotal moment that sets up the final season of the show. With Chuck being the final and ultimate antagonist, Billie begins to groom Jack to be able to kill God.

In the finale of season 14 of Supernatural, Sam winds Chuck with the gun meant to kill Jack. This prevents Chuck from leaving this world and creates a mental bond between Sam and God. Sam is captured by Chuck so that he can examine the mysterious wound that ties them to each other and him to this version of Earth. Meanwhile, Dean and Castiel learn from Michael that there is a spell capable of trapping God, however, one requirement is a Leviathan Blossom, which only blooms in Purgatory. Dean and Castiel set out to find the plant while Sam is tortured by Chuck. Unbeknownst to Sam, the true reason his connection to God via the gunshot wound will not heal is because he still has hope that they can defeat Chuck.

Chuck cooks up a plan to show Sam an alternate future where they defeat Chuck, and the world is in dire straits. Monsters rule, and the Winchesters become vampires as all of their loved ones are killed. This breaks Sam's hopes while simultaneously freeing Chuck from his bind to this world. As Dean and Castiel arrive from their adventure in Purgatory, it is too late, and Chuck easily destroys the magical bomb they crafted for him. As the episode ends, viewers see Jack and Death in The Empty. Billie says to Jack, ""It's time."" Billie was clever in waiting to return Jack from The Empty as Chuck was tied to their world. She knows Jack is their only hope. Death is instrumental in the true plan to defeat God. If she allowed Jack to return too soon, Chuck would notice him and kill him again.

As alien encounters and government disclosures grab headlines, Joseph shares how these so-called “extraterrestrials” might not be what they seem — and why spiritual deception could be at the root of it all.

From firsthand abduction accounts to the power of the name of Jesus in stopping them, this conversation dives into what most researchers won't say. Listen to the discussion:

We'll leave you with a bit more about Nizza and the show:

Jennifer Nizza knows what it means to discern — and confront — evil. Once trapped on the hampster wheel of the New Age for 25 years, she was radically saved out of the occult and bondage by Jesus Christ. Nizza was a psychic medium and a teacher of the occult, and, as a result, was demonically oppressed. She taught topics such as: the law of attraction, past life regression, automatic writing, tarot and mediumship. Despite being deeply rooted in the occult, at the age of 36, she cried out to Jesus for the first time and became a Christian.

Suddenly, the darkness she was embroiled in was illuminated. She quit her job as a psychic, picked up her cross to follow Jesus — and hasn't looked back. Nizza, author of the books From Psychic to Saved and Out of the New Age and Into the Truth, is now exposing the New Age, occultism, and paranormal deceptions through “The Ex-Psychic Saved Podcast.”

This podcast is dedicated to warning all about the dangers of the occult. She will talk about many New Age topics, expose where psychics get their information, interact with compelling guests, and much more!

I don't know what I was expecting… but to be left crying and filled with regret at how much I'd paid wasn't it.

A few weeks earlier, I decided to book an appointment to have a one-hour tarot card reading with a woman who describes herself as a psychic and medium.

A friend had recently tried it and said how uplifting it was, and a year earlier I'd watched a woman on TikTok discuss her 'eerily accurate' reading.

It just so happened they both went to the same place in London - I took it as a sign.

Around 40 minutes before my appointment, the psychic - who I shall called Harriet - calls me to apologise that she's running late as there is an issue with the Tubes.

Cue my friend's ‘she didn't see that coming' text…

Alas, another reason I'd wanted to give this a go was down to Michael McIntyre.

In his autobiography, the comedian tells how on a whim his then-19-year-old mother goes to a tarot card reading with a psychic who tells her she's pregnant, it will be a son and he will be ‘world-famous'.

When we finally start, Harriet tells me how honoured she is to be giving me my first reading. Gentle music plays in the background and the room is full of crystals.

‘The spirit brings me the right person at the right time.'

The cards from my reading, more on this later

Harriet assures me she won't deliver ‘scary' or ominous news but that ‘every message that comes through is what you need to hear' although ‘sometimes not what you want to hear.'

‘I see you looking out a bus window, wistfully,' she begins.

Harriet wasn't kidding about it not always being what you want to hear.

‘Most people come in when they are at a crossroads in their life. But you feel like you've got it. You've got an underlying sense of what is going to change and what's coming in. We need some reassurance.'

Harriet begins with my career.

‘I just get changes,' she says. ‘But sometimes not in the way you want - and not in a good way.'

Hang on, Harriet. I thought you weren't meant to deliver bad news…

‘There's a feeling of “I need to change”. Maybe relocation.'

Hmm, I ponder, I am quite happy in London and have no desire to move from my lovely flat. So where did she have in mind? A cottage in the countryside? A villa in the sunnier climes of Portugal?

‘Manchester,' Harriet signals her spirit guide is telling her.

Oh. I've never thought twice about that part of the country. I am from the south originally, so Manchester seems quite a rogue choice but you never know in the distant future…

‘Two months. End of August,' Harriet confirms.

Crikey. I'm locked into a contract on my flat until next year so that could be problematic.

‘You're about to jump on that train,' she continues.

Note, I have upgraded from a bus.

‘I feel like it's the same field, same kind of work but it's just broader. More of a place you can get to the top, that you can spread your wings and develop.'

Ok, well this sounds more promising.

‘It feels like you have a bit of a coach around you,' Harriet continues as she ‘tunes in with my energy and her team of spirits'.

‘This spirit pushing you and giving you all these wonderful words: ‘that's the name of the game', ‘we're going to go for it'. It feels like they've been with you for quite a while. It feels like a female spirit that's around you. Do you feel like that.'

Er.. no I don't.

‘Sometimes you might be given a message that this isn't the right time and you have to wait six months or so. But opportunities are coming sooner rather than later.'

So what are the spirit guides telling Harriet my next career move could be?

Brilliant... the death card  which came after the marriage card

‘Behind the scenes, I see scripts,' she says.

‘Have you ever worked in the theatrical arts? I'm seeing theatre and dialogue. It does feel like it's something unexpected. And colourful, I see a lot of colour around what you're writing. Explosions of colours around it.'

I continue to listen, puzzled, I have never worked in theatre and it's never appealed to me.

‘I'm also getting the message keep some mystery and secrecy around what you're doing. You've got some really good ideas that are not quite ready to be revealed.'

I must already be doing such a good job of keeping some mystery, I'm leaving myself in the dark.

‘I'm getting your mum,' Harriet then says. A lump forms in my throat.

‘Feels like you have support there.'

Now might be the time to confess another reason I found myself sitting in front of the psychic was because of my mum.

She died last year from cancer and I have been bereft without her ever since and desperate to somehow feel close to her again.

‘She steadies you,' Harriet says.

‘Feels like a steady relationship. You can confide in her. And that will be stabilising.

‘She feels like she can be an ally through this process. If nothing else really giving you some encouragement. But also she'll catch you if you fall is what I hear. You don't have a lot to lose by taking a leap of faith here. She's got your back.'

At this point I'm feeling both emotional and awkward. My mum was all of those things, but I can't bring myself to say anything to Harriet.

But then it gets worse…

‘I'm seeing your mum again,' she says.

‘Have you ever travelled with your mum? Maybe it would be a nice time for you two to go do something nice together, even if it's a long weekend. Because when you're around your mum's energy it does change your reality.'

Ah the real kick in the teeth. I'm too polite to say anything. 

Could it get any worse?

Yes.

Could have done without this card too... one man on crutches who can barely walk, the other freezing and poor

Harriet pulls out the death card… supposedly it doesn't represent death, but the end of something, it follows the marriage card. Reassuring.

The card showing people being stabbed in the back also makes an appearance, plus the one showing a man barely able to walk and ‘left outside in the cold'.

I make a mental note to quiz my friend again who found her reading ‘uplifting'.

It dawns on me how foolish I was to think my mum would send a message to me via a random woman in a rented room in London, or how she could actually predict my future.

I message my brother in tears feeling silly.

He swiftly brings me down to earth.

‘How much did you pay for that b*******?,' he replies.

‘Everything she said is complete chance and guess work. It means nothing.'

He's right.

Sigh, what a waste of £130 - but a lesson learned*.

*Unless in August I am working at a theatre in Manchester after going on holiday with my mum who has returned from the dead…

Just when you thought royal drama had simmered down, Meghan Markle broke the internet again, and no, it is not because of a scandalous Netflix deal or a new podcast drop. This time, it is her pregnant twerking video that has conspiracy theorists foaming at the mouth.

To celebrate her daughter Lilibet's fourth birthday, the Duchess of Sussex posted a throwback video that was supposed to be heartwarming. Spoiler alert: it turned into a full-blown online spectacle. The clip features Meghan, nine months pregnant, dancing her heart out in a hospital room to Starrkeisha's “Baby Mama.” Prince Harry even makes a cameo before she breaks into some joyful twerking, all while heavily pregnant.



The fakest bump I've ever seen in my life https://t.co/gevbY6hHVd

 

Seems wholesome, right? Not to the trolls of the internet.

Conspiracy theorists on X (formerly known as Twitter, but still just as chaotic) wasted zero time. They dove in headfirst, accusing Meghan of faking her pregnancy again — with one term trending harder than ever: moonbump. According to some very loud keyboard warriors, her bump was “too high,” “too firm,” or just moved “weird.” Others screamed “AI-generated!” or claimed the hospital looked like a set built for a Lifetime movie.

Markle's bump is 100% fake though -- she's mocking women in labour and taunting the Royal Family with her fraudulent children.

 

One self-identified nurse went viral claiming Meghan should have had a cannula or IV drip if she was really in labour. Another claimed her ability to dance at full-term was “superhuman,” clearly forgetting that Meghan was not strapped to a bed but literally just vibing.



Screenshots flew. Zoomed-in freeze frames appeared with childish annotations. Someone even tried to point out inconsistencies based on her jewellery and lack of medical equipment. Because obviously, nothing screams “conspiracy confirmed” like earrings in a maternity ward.

Still, Meghan stayed cool. Alongside the video, she dropped unseen photos of Harry and baby Lilibet, including a barefoot beach stroll and a sweet newborn cuddle. She called the duo the “sweetest bond” and described her daughter as Harry's “favourite adventurer.”

Even while the name Lilibet still stirs royal tension, with some reports claiming the late Queen was less than thrilled, Meghan is clearly unbothered. She is busy harvesting honey with her daughter and planning potential future businesses together.

The internet might be spiralling, but Meghan Markle? She is still out here dancing, glowing, and telling her own story, moonbump or not.

Thanks to the internet, he now has 40,000 followers on Telegram, a podcast on alternative medicine and geopolitics, and a suspiciously high number of PayPal donations from people called “WolfSpirit88” and “TruthSeeker1972”.

Conspiracy theorists are everywhere now. They walk among us, smiling benignly while secretly believing that the Moon landing was filmed in a warehouse just off the M25, that Greta Thunberg is a hologram generated by the Rothschild banking dynasty, and that Bill Gates is hiding inside your central heating system, collecting your biometric data every time you boil an egg.

It's not that the modern conspiracy theorist is wrong about everything. No, the problem is that they're right about nothing—but deeply, profoundly confident about it. Certainty, you see, is their chief commodity. It's the only currency accepted in their parallel universe, where logic is elitist, facts are fascist, and evidence is what you feel in your waters at 3am after half a bottle of gin and a YouTube binge.Take climate change. Now, to you and me, the notion that pumping billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for two centuries might just be warming the planet is not terribly controversial. But to the conspiracy theorist, this is merely another facet of the Great Lie. The Earth, they say, has always gone through “natural cycles”—though strangely, these cycles now include wildfires in Sweden and beachfront properties in Sheffield.The climate change denier is a curious beast. He will confidently tell you, between puffs on his diesel-powered vape, (why do conspiracy theorists all seem to smoke vapes? ) that global warming is a hoax cooked up by Al Gore and lizard people to sell solar panels and vegan yoghurt. He is often the same man who believes George W. Bush personally detonated the Twin Towers using thermite, WiFi, and a remote control shaped like Dick Cheney's reproductive organ.Indeed, there seems to be a remarkable overlap in conspiracy circles. One moment you're reading a blog post titled “Chemtrails and the Cabbalistic Agenda of the Illuminati”, and the next it's a twelve-page screed explaining how Covid-19 was “a psy-op orchestrated by Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum to force us all to drink cricket smoothies and submit to compulsory yoga”.According to this crowd, the pandemic didn't really happen. The dead bodies were crisis actors. The hospitals were empty. The footage of overwhelmed Italian ICUs was staged—possibly by Stanley Kubrick's ghost. And the vaccines? Ah, those were clearly designed to sterilise the population, implant nanobots, or possibly just make you slightly more left-wing.Of course, they'll say, “I'm just asking questions.” Which is conspiracy-speak for “I watched four hours of TikTok videos and now I have a PhD in virology, atmospheric science, and the globalist occult.” Asking questions is the sacred rite of the conspiracy theorist. But they never ask the one that matters: “What if I'm completely wrong and mildly unhinged?”Another sure giveaway is the use of capital letters where none are needed. “WAKE UP SHEEPLE!” they bellow in comment sections. “THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE! OPEN YOUR EYES!” It's as though they've confused political awareness with being trapped in a malfunctioning Caps Lock key.And then, of course, there's the “New World Order”—the all-purpose bogeyman of the paranoid imagination. To hear them tell it, a cabal of billionaire paedophiles meets every Thursday in a Swiss bunker to decide everything from interest rates to the colour of your socks. The EU, naturally, is their local franchise. And who's the regional manager? None other than the world's worst defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen.Yes, her.To suggest that Ursula von der Leyen is competent at her job is, to the conspiracy theorist, the ultimate shibboleth. Only they, the enlightened ones, understand that she's not a beleaguered bureaucrat wrestling with 27 bickering member states and a terminal shortage of talent. No, she is the High Priestess of the Euro-Soros-LGBT-Woke-Techno-Malthusian cult that secretly runs everything, including your local recycling rota.It's difficult to say how these ideas persist. You'd think, after 23 years of waiting for the “Deep State purge” promised by anonymous online accounts and guys called Dave with shaved heads and GoPros, they'd be a little chastened. But no. The beauty of the conspiracy mindset is its immunity to time, disproof and reality. Like a medieval plague cart, it trundles on regardless, ringing its bell and spreading a miasma of absolute nonsense.You try to reason with them, of course. You point out that the Earth is round, vaccines work, and that if the world really were run by a secret elite, we'd at least have functioning trains. But they just smile, that knowing smile that says, “You're still asleep, my friend. Still clinging to your Newtonian physics and your parliamentary democracy.”Meanwhile, they continue their research—by which they mean watching an unshaven man in a caravan explain why 5G is turning us all into hummingbirds. Their definition of a “source” is “someone I agree with,” and their measure of truth is whether something “feels off”. Which is how we ended up with people earnestly claiming that Prince Philip faked his own death to return as a sentient cryptocurrency.Some of this might be funny if it weren't occasionally tragic. There are people who have lost friends, jobs, and even custody of their children because they genuinely believed they were resisting a global plot to enslave humanity via QR codes and oat milk. Conspiracy theories used to be fringe entertainment for stoners and shut-ins. Now they're public policy in parts of the internet, and occasionally, regrettably, Parliament.So what do we do? Ban them? Debate them? Build giant nets and lure them into humane captivity with leaflets about free energy and Area 51?No. Like bad manners and flatulence, conspiracy theories are probably with us to stay.

It's not that the modern conspiracy theorist is wrong about everything. No, the problem is that they're right about nothing—but deeply, profoundly confident about it. Certainty, you see, is their chief commodity. It's the only currency accepted in their parallel universe, where logic is elitist, facts are fascist, and evidence is what you feel in your waters at 3am after half a bottle of gin and a YouTube binge.

Take climate change. Now, to you and me, the notion that pumping billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for two centuries might just be warming the planet is not terribly controversial. But to the conspiracy theorist, this is merely another facet of the Great Lie. The Earth, they say, has always gone through “natural cycles”—though strangely, these cycles now include wildfires in Sweden and beachfront properties in Sheffield.

The climate change denier is a curious beast. He will confidently tell you, between puffs on his diesel-powered vape, (why do conspiracy theorists all seem to smoke vapes? ) that global warming is a hoax cooked up by Al Gore and lizard people to sell solar panels and vegan yoghurt. He is often the same man who believes George W. Bush personally detonated the Twin Towers using thermite, WiFi, and a remote control shaped like Dick Cheney's reproductive organ.

Indeed, there seems to be a remarkable overlap in conspiracy circles. One moment you're reading a blog post titled “Chemtrails and the Cabbalistic Agenda of the Illuminati”, and the next it's a twelve-page screed explaining how Covid-19 was “a psy-op orchestrated by Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum to force us all to drink cricket smoothies and submit to compulsory yoga”.

According to this crowd, the pandemic didn't really happen. The dead bodies were crisis actors. The hospitals were empty. The footage of overwhelmed Italian ICUs was staged—possibly by Stanley Kubrick's ghost. And the vaccines? Ah, those were clearly designed to sterilise the population, implant nanobots, or possibly just make you slightly more left-wing.

Of course, they'll say, “I'm just asking questions.” Which is conspiracy-speak for “I watched four hours of TikTok videos and now I have a PhD in virology, atmospheric science, and the globalist occult.” Asking questions is the sacred rite of the conspiracy theorist. But they never ask the one that matters: “What if I'm completely wrong and mildly unhinged?”

Another sure giveaway is the use of capital letters where none are needed. “WAKE UP SHEEPLE!” they bellow in comment sections. “THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE! OPEN YOUR EYES!” It's as though they've confused political awareness with being trapped in a malfunctioning Caps Lock key.

And then, of course, there's the “New World Order”—the all-purpose bogeyman of the paranoid imagination. To hear them tell it, a cabal of billionaire paedophiles meets every Thursday in a Swiss bunker to decide everything from interest rates to the colour of your socks. The EU, naturally, is their local franchise. And who's the regional manager? None other than the world's worst defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen.

Yes, her.

To suggest that Ursula von der Leyen is competent at her job is, to the conspiracy theorist, the ultimate shibboleth. Only they, the enlightened ones, understand that she's not a beleaguered bureaucrat wrestling with 27 bickering member states and a terminal shortage of talent. No, she is the High Priestess of the Euro-Soros-LGBT-Woke-Techno-Malthusian cult that secretly runs everything, including your local recycling rota.

It's difficult to say how these ideas persist. You'd think, after 23 years of waiting for the “Deep State purge” promised by anonymous online accounts and guys called Dave with shaved heads and GoPros, they'd be a little chastened. But no. The beauty of the conspiracy mindset is its immunity to time, disproof and reality. Like a medieval plague cart, it trundles on regardless, ringing its bell and spreading a miasma of absolute nonsense.

You try to reason with them, of course. You point out that the Earth is round, vaccines work, and that if the world really were run by a secret elite, we'd at least have functioning trains. But they just smile, that knowing smile that says, “You're still asleep, my friend. Still clinging to your Newtonian physics and your parliamentary democracy.”

Meanwhile, they continue their research—by which they mean watching an unshaven man in a caravan explain why 5G is turning us all into hummingbirds. Their definition of a “source” is “someone I agree with,” and their measure of truth is whether something “feels off”. Which is how we ended up with people earnestly claiming that Prince Philip faked his own death to return as a sentient cryptocurrency.

Some of this might be funny if it weren't occasionally tragic. There are people who have lost friends, jobs, and even custody of their children because they genuinely believed they were resisting a global plot to enslave humanity via QR codes and oat milk. Conspiracy theories used to be fringe entertainment for stoners and shut-ins. Now they're public policy in parts of the internet, and occasionally, regrettably, Parliament.

So what do we do? Ban them? Debate them? Build giant nets and lure them into humane captivity with leaflets about free energy and Area 51?

No. Like bad manners and flatulence, conspiracy theories are probably with us to stay. They fulfil a deep psychological need: to impose meaning on chaos, to find patterns where there are none, and to feel secretly superior to all the dupes and drones who still think Tony Blair is human.

But we can mock them. And mock them we must.

Because satire, unlike the internet, has not yet been monetised by lizards. And because the best disinfectant is not sunlight—it's ridicule.

So the next time someone corners you at a barbecue to explain how a secret cabal of climate scientists faked 150 years of temperature data in order to tax your wood burner, take a deep breath, smile, and ask them gently: “If they're so powerful, why haven't they stopped you from talking?”

Former Patriots head coach Bill Belichick still has a lot of explaining to do regarding some of the mystifying decisions he made during his lengthy tenure coaching the team.

More often than not, when a controversy unfolds — in everyday life or even in the wide, wide world of sports — eventually the truth will come out, and folks will be able to say, “Ahhhh — that kind of makes sense.”

But there are several sports mysteries on the Boston sports landscape that, to this day, months, years, perhaps even decades later, we still don't have sufficient answers for.

There are multiple contenders for the title of best smeller, but no clear winner just yet.

From hunting prey to finding mates and avoiding predators, the ability to detect odors is crucial for survival in the animal kingdom.

But which species reigns supreme when it comes to smelling power? It turns out, that's not such an easy question to answer.

There are approximately 5.8 million odor molecules and each of those odorants can be combined to create an almost infinite number of odor mixtures, Matthias Laska, a zoologist who specializes in sensory capabilities at Linköping University in Sweden, told Live Science in an email.

""Considering that only a tiny fraction of those odorants have been tested with any species so far, any generalizing statement about whether species A has 'a better sense of smell' than species B would simply be unscientific,"" Laska said.

Part of the challenge in sniffing-out better smellers lies in how difficult it is to study olfaction in the first place. According to a book on the neuroscience of smell, ""Olfaction in Animal Behaviour and Welfare"" (CABI, 2017), olfactory research lags behind studies investigating vision, hearing, taste or touch. Unlike other sensory stimuli, odors are hard to control or measure — they disperse unpredictably, behave differently in air versus water, and vary greatly in chemical properties.

Still, researchers have found some intriguing clues as to which species might be the best smeller. One place to look is the number of olfactory receptor genes — the DNA sequences that code for proteins in the nose which bind to odor molecules.

Related: Can animals really smell fear in humans?

In a 2014 study published in the journal Genome Research, scientists counted the olfactory receptor genes in several species of mammal and found that African elephants had the highest number: a whopping 1,948. By comparison, humans have just 396 genes, dogs have 811 and rats have 1,207. This would make sense because elephants use their impressive sense of smell to locate food, recognize family members, detect predators and identify the short time window when a partner is ready to mate.



However, the genetic survey only compared 13 mammal species and did not include bears, who are anecdotally known to have a powerful sense of smell.

Another measure of an animal's smelling ability may be the size of its olfactory bulb, the brain region responsible for processing odors. Dogs, which are famous for their scent-tracking skills, have significantly larger olfactory bulbs than humans, according to a 2011 comparative study published in the International Journal of Morphology. Among birds, turkey vultures top the list for a keen sense of smell, which helps the flying scavengers detect carcasses from great distances.

But does having a larger olfactory bulb actually translate into a stronger sense of smell? A 2011 review published in the journal Science pointed out that the number of neurons in the olfactory bulb is fairly consistent across species, regardless of the bulb's size, which would undermine using size as a measure of olfactory capacity.



Smelling power can also be gauged by the ability to sense specific odors. One animal with an impressive sense is the African pouched rat, Tobias Ackels of the Sensory Dynamics and Behaviour Lab at the University of Bonn in Germany, told Live Science in an email. ""These rats can be trained to detect landmines and have been used to sniff out tuberculosis in human patients using their sense of smell.""

Beyond the world of vertebrates, male silk moths might take the crown. ""Moths are smelling champions when it comes to sensitivity,"" Gabriella Wolff, a neuroethologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, told Live Science in an email. Male moths can find mates located up to 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers) away by detecting female pheromone chemicals. ""In some cases, a male can detect a female from a single pheromone molecule,"" Wolff said.You can't get any more sensitive than that!""

—Why do cats make a weird face after smelling something?

—Why do dogs sniff each other's butts?

—Why can't we smell ourselves as well as we smell others?

Sharks have an exceptionally keen sense of smell — far more sensitive than that of humans — which is important for hunting and mating. While some species can detect chemicals in water at concentrations as low as one part per 10 billion, the popular claim that they can smell a single drop of blood in the ocean is a myth, according to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

Although humans have far fewer smell receptors than dogs, they are better at sniffing out certain fruit-related odors. These odors are ""behaviorally irrelevant to a carnivore such as the dog, but presumably behaviorally relevant for us primates,"" Laska explained. This leads him to believe that an animal's ability to smell a particular odor is dictated more by the behavioral relevance of that odor than by its neuroanatomy or genetic makeup.

Ackels puts it another way. ""Rather than naming a single 'champion smeller', it's more accurate to say that different animals are specialists, each with a sense of smell shaped by their ecological niche.""
