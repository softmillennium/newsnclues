                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump told NBC News on Saturday that Elon Musk would see "serious consequences" if he backs Democratic candidates who challenge Republicans supporting the "big, beautiful bill." "If he does, he'll have to pay the consequences for that," Trump told NBC News' Kristen Welker in a phone interview. Trump also said that he thinks his relationship with Musk is done after their public feud erupted this week. "I gave him a lot of breaks, long before this happened, I gave him breaks in my first administration and saved his life in my first administration," Trump said. "I have no intention of speaking to him," Trump added. When asked whether he thinks his relationship with Musk is over, he said, "I would assume so." Trump's remarks are among his most extensive public comments yet on his feud with Musk, and the latest sign that the president is not interested in mending his relationship with the onetime ally. Musk has been a vocal critic of the Trump-backed spending bill that moved through the House last month. Earlier this week, Musk called the spending bill a "disgusting abomination" that will lead to exploding federal budget deficits. "In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people," he wrote in a separate X post. Trump told NBC News that he is still "very confident" that the bill will be passed by July 4, and that he doesn't think Musk could derail the bill. "If you look at the Republicans, we've never been more unified," Trump told NBC News. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twenty-five minutes of live TV, more than a dozen posts on X, and three posts on Truth Social over the period of five hours (and counting) — that's how the already fractured friendship of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump publicly unraveled on Thursday. The first signs of trouble began when Musk showed opposition to Trump's spending bill, the "One Big Beautiful Bill," though he never explicitly targeted Trump. "Shame on those who voted for it," Musk tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Congress members who voted for Trump's tax cut bill. Trump, for his part, had stayed uncharacteristically mum about Musk's criticism of the bill. But that all changed on Thursday morning. Musk began digging up Trump's old posts on what was then Twitter about the deficit, including one from January of 2013. Musk unearthed another old X post by Trump from back in July 2012, presumably as a swipe at the new Republican tax bill that many economists and the congressional Budget Office said would increase the country's deficits. Trump responded to Musk's attacks for the first time when answering press questions during a White House event to welcome German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. "And you know Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles," said Trump. "And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Trump's comments about Musk continued at the press appearance. "He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn't said bad things about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. "I don't know what it is. The whole world is different, and they become hostile," he added. Musk began a whirlwind of tweets soon after, responding in near real time to what Trump said during the press appearance. "False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!" False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! Musk then began a series of tweets directed at the president beyond the bill, including saying that without him, Republicans would have lost. Musk polls his X followers about creating a new political party "that actually represents the 80% in the middle." Mark Cuban quoted the post with three checkmarks. Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle? Not even those in Congress who had to vote on the Big Ugly Spending Bill had time to read it! "Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do! "The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!" Musk responds to Trump's posts on Truth Social, calling them "such an obvious lie." That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT! Trump posts on Truth Social again to defend his tax bill. "I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress," Trump wrote. If this Bill doesn't pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. Musk says SpaceX will decommission its Dragon spacecraft "immediately." Prior to partnering with SpaceX, the agency depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions. In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW Musk says that Trump's tariffs will "cause a recession in the second half of this year." Some economists have also predicted that Trump's tariffs would hurt the economy, and Trump himself declined to rule out the chances of a recession back in March. Musk retweeted what appears to be a video of Trump partying with Epstein from the 1990s, doubling down on his earlier statement about the Epstein files. "This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Business Insider in a statement. "The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again." Musk took a softer tone later on Thursday night. Some five hours after his post about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, he walked back the decision in a response to an X user. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon," Musk wrote at 9:20 p.m. In a separate exchange on X, billionaire investor Bill Ackman encouraged Musk and Trump to make up. We are much stronger together than apart," Ackman wrote. Trump spoke about the feud on Friday morning during a phone call with CNN's Dana Bash. "I'm not even thinking about Elon," Trump said. Bash said people in Musk and Trump's orbit are trying to mend the rift. On Truth Social, Trump posted a screenshot of an X post from David Schoen, Epstein's defense attorney. Schoen said in the post that Epstein "had no information to hurt President Trump." Trump reiterated that he wasn't thinking about Musk while traveling with reporters aboard Air Force One. He wished Musk the best of luck on his Tesla business. Musk said on X that he would apologize to Trump "profusely as soon as there is a full dump of the Epstein files." The CEO was responding to a post from James Fishback, an investor who proposed the idea of DOGE dividend checks, who posted on X that Musk should send Trump a "full-throated apology." "You can substantively disagree with the President on policy, but you should not have baselessly and personally attacked him," Fishback wrote. Trump and Musk appeared to extend each other an olive branch — at least for a brief moment. The White House rapid response account on X posted a clip of Trump's gaggle with the press on Air Force One, highlighting the president saying he wishes Musk well. Musk deleted some of the X posts he made on Thursday, including one in which he said Trump was named in the Epstein files. He also deleted a tweet announcing his intention to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. However, other the X posts Musk made, including criticism of the tax bill, remain on his account.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk has appeared to delete some of his posts on his social media platform X that escalated his bitter feud with President Donald Trump this week. "Hmm...this page doesn't exist. Try searching for something else," said the X page that once displayed Musk's post. On Thursday, Musk also responded "yes" to a user's post that called for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vice President JD Vance. That post was also no longer available as of Saturday morning. In an interview on Friday with "manosphere" comedian Theo Von, Vance said Musk was making a "huge mistake" going after Trump, while attempting to downplay the billionaire's attacks as an "emotional guy" who got frustrated. It was not immediately clear why Musk deleted the posts. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Just over one week ago, Trump and Musk exchanged compliments at the conclusion of Musk's official time leading the Department of Government Efficiency. But their relationship devolved this week as the two men exchanged barbs on social media, stemming in large part from Musk's vocal opposition to Trump's "big, beautiful bill," CNBC previously reported. In one of the now-deleted posts, Musk accused Trump of being mentioned in files related to Epstein, without providing any evidence of his claim. Musk alleged, "that is the real reason they have not been made public." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected Musk's allegations. "This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted," she said in a statement to CNN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the 57-year-old executive didn't start his career with aspirations of being a high-powered CEO. In a May 15 podcast appearance on "How Leaders Lead with David Novak," Jassy said he too often sees young people who think they should be entering the professional world knowing what they want to do with the rest of their lives. "I have a 21-year-old son and a 24-year-old daughter, and one of the things I see with them and their peers is they all feel like they have to know what they want to do with their life at that age," he said. "And I really don't believe that's true." On top of that, he spent time working at a retail golf store, coaching his high school soccer team and investment banking. Even though many of those jobs didn't work out as he might've hoped, the experiences helped him understand the type of career that he wanted — and didn't want — to have, he said. "I do feel like one of the lucky parts for me was that I tried lots of things and was able to sort for myself what appealed to me and what didn't."

Being reliable, trustworthy, hard-working and a good learner are more important than being good at every single thing you try, Jassy added. "I feel like those are things that you can control. It's actually amazing to me how often people don't. I worked hard at those things over time," he said. 1 way to build a strong reputation in the workplace, author and former Google executive Maha Abouelenein told CNBC Make It on Oct. 9.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ilitch has an estimated net worth of $6.9 billion, Forbes reported on Tuesday. Most of that wealth likely comes from the Little Caesars pizza restaurant chain, which she co-founded with her late husband Michael Ilitch in Garden City, Michigan, in 1959. Ilitch, 90, took the reins as chairwoman of her family's holding company Ilitch Holdings, which owns Little Caesars, after her husband died in 2017. Growing up, Ilitch refilled napkin dispensers and salt and pepper shakers in her father's restaurant, according to Ilitch Holdings' website. As an adult, she worked in retail and as a reservation clerk for Delta Air Lines before getting married and becoming a full-time mother. DON'T MISS: A step-by-step guide to buying your first home—and avoiding costly mistakes Little Caesars opened its first franchised location in Warren, Michigan, in 1962, and grew rapidly from there: It opened its 50th location seven years later, the company's website says. Ilitch and her husband bought the Detroit Red Wings for a reported $8 million in 1982. Her husband also bought the Detroit Tigers from Dominos Pizza founder Tom Monaghan for a reported $85 million in 1992. And Ilitch owns Detroit's MotorCity Casino Hotel, first investing in it and then buying out her partners for $525 million in 2005, according to ESPN. Notably, Michael quietly helped pay rent for civil rights icon Rosa Parks during the 1990s, after Parks moved into an apartment in downtown Detroit, the Sports Business Journal reported in 2014. "It's important that people know what Mr. Mike Ilitch did for Ms. Rosa Parks because it's symbolic of what he has always done for the people of our city," Damon Keith, a former circuit judge on the 6th U.S. Court of Appeals who connected Parks with Michael, told the publication. "You don't find people like Mike and Marian often, who want to help when they're needed," Keith said to the Washington Post in February 2017.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Americans earning a regular salary may have trouble living comfortably in all 50 states. SmartAsset defines "comfortable" as earning enough to follow the 50/30/20 budget method, which recommends putting 50% of your income toward essentials like rent and food, 30% toward discretionary spending and 20% toward debt repayment and savings. It used the latest estimates from Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Living Wage calculator to estimate individuals' cost of necessities in each state. On the other side of the spectrum from West Virginia, residents in Hawaii need to earn a minimum of $124,467 a year to live comfortably, SmartAsset finds. That's the highest of any state and one of two states — along with Massachusetts — where individuals need to earn at least $120,000 a year to afford a comfortable lifestyle. Here's how much money it takes for a single adult to live comfortably in every U.S. state 2025. While the 50/30/20 budget can be an effective tool to manage your money, it can also be difficult to follow if you have high fixed costs. And though data suggests wage growth nationwide is actually outpacing price inflation, many Americans don't feel that way. Plus, President Donald Trump's tariffs threaten to push prices up even further. Boosting your income by switching jobs or getting a side hustle may be easier said than done, but it can help give you some breathing room in your budget, especially if you've already cut out as much discretionary spending as you can.

Vice President JD Vance said Elon Musk is making a “huge mistake” in going after Donald Trump and expressed hopes the billionaire will come back into the fold following the public feud that unfolded. 

“I'm always going to be loyal to the president and I hope that eventually Elon kind of comes back into the fold,” Vance said in an interview on the podcast “This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von” released on Saturday. “Maybe that's not possible now because he's gone so nuclear, but I hope it is.”</p>

ByteDance Ltd., TikTok's parent company, has been replacing US-hired staff near Seattle with leaders connected to China, aiming to replicate its e-commerce success in Asia after sales fell short in America.

TikTok Shop initially set a goal to increase its US e-commerce business tenfold last year to $17.5 billion in transaction volume, but the company had to drastically lower that goal, according to people familiar with the plan who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly. </p>

LG Electronics ClOi robots displayed at the LG Group Sciencepark R&D complex in Seoul in 2023. South Korea is still labeled an emerging market despite being a global leader when it comes to automation and robot technology. 

 If I told you there's a country with more than 1,000 robots for every 10,000 workers—and another with barely more than 100 per, which would you guess is classified as an emerging market? 

You'd likely be wrong. In 2023 it was the UK that had only 119 robots per 10,000 workers. South Korea meanwhile had 1,012. But for some reason, MSCI classifies the latter as an emerging market, just as it does Poland, Chile, Brazil, Taiwan, the UAE and China.</p>
