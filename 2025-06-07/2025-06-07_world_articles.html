                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. Attacks were also reported in Russia's Saratov, Moscow, Tula, Belgorod, and Kaluga oblasts. The JSC Progress Plant in the city of Michurinsk in Tambov Oblast came under fire overnight, Russian Telegram news channels reported, citing local residents. Russian officials have not yet commented on the attack. On the same night, Russian outlets also reported that an oil refinery in Saratov Oblast came under attack. Ukraine has targeted the facility in past attacks. A train derailed in Belgorod Oblast after an explosive device detonated under the tracks, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed. Part of the track was damaged, but there were no casualties, he said. In the Russian capital, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed that air defense units repelled 10 drones bound for Moscow. Sobyanin said that emergency services had been dispatched to the sites of the fallen wreckage, but did not disclose information regarding any damage. Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha reported that five drones were downed over the region, damaging cars. In Tula Oblast, air defense units reportedly intercepted two drones. Three people were injured, according to Governor Dmitry Milyaev. The attack killed four people in Kyiv and caused casualties and damage to cities in western Ukraine, far from the front lines. Russia intensified aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities in late May, launching some of the heaviest assaults of the full-scale war over three consecutive nights. Less than a week later, Ukraine launched Operation Spiderweb, an audacious mass drone strike that reportedly damaged 41 Russian military planes. In the days since, Ukraine has continued to target key Russian military assets, launching strikes against missile bases and the Crimean Bridge. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“This is a sad day for our democracy and a scary day for millions of people,” said the coalition behind the challenge. The Supreme Court decision allowing DOGE full, unfettered access to the public's sensitive personal Social Security data is a loss for all of us. Elon Musk may have left Washington, D.C., but his impact continues to harm millions of people. We will continue to use every legal tool at our disposal to keep unelected bureaucrats from misusing the public's most sensitive data as this case moves forward.” “On the one hand, there is a repository of millions of Americans' legally protected, highly sensitive information that — if improperly handled or disseminated — risks causing significant harm,” she wrote. Max Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, called the majority's ruling “extremely troubling” for a host of reasons. “We echo the concerns of the minority, as articulated by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, that the decision creates ‘grave privacy risks' by giving DOGE ‘unfettered data access — despite its failure to show any need or any interest in complying with existing privacy safeguards,'” said Richtman. DOGE has shown no need to review every American's personal information, and the high court provides no explanation in granting it access,” said Ombres. “Americans have no way to know how DOGE will use or misuse this information, nor what DOGE is or what it is doing. Citing Musk, who recently left his position at DOGE and has been engaged in a high-profile spat with President Donald Trump in recent days, Richtman said the Tesla and SpaceX founder and world's richest man cannot be trusted, giving the lies he told about Social Security fraud that “undermined people's faith in the system.” “This hardly inspires confidence that DOGE has either the sense of ethics or public service to be entrusted with Americans' private data, leading us to believe that the court simply is abetting another dangerous power grab by the Executive branch,” said Richtman. “If Americans' personal Social Security data is misused or abused by this administration, the Supreme Court's majority will have been fully complicit.” The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

The union included remarks from Huerta, who said, “We all collectively have to object to this madness because this is not justice. “This is about something much bigger” than his own arrest, said Huerta. “This is about how we as a community stand together and resist the injustice.” According to a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security, approximately 44 individuals were “administratively arrested” in a series of raids at retail stores in the Los Angeles area, while one individual, identified as Huerta, was arrested “for obstruction” of federal officers. “This is what fascism looks like,” said California State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the chief prosecutor in the Central District of California, claimed in a post on social media, that “federal agents were executing a lawful judicial warrant at a LA worksite this morning when David Huerta deliberately obstructed their access by blocking their vehicle. “No one has the right to assault, obstruct, or interfere with federal authorities carrying out their duties.” EVERYBODY WATCH.ICE IS OUT OF CONTROL.Video of SEIU California's President David Huerta getting assaulted & arrested during an ICE raid in the warehouse district of Downtown Los Angeles today.He's an LA native, American citizen and labor leader.Don't turn away. “Today, SEIU-USWW President, my friend, and constituent David Huerta was thrown to the ground, tased, injured and arrested for exercising his First Amendment right to observe and document law enforcement activity,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), who represent areas of Los Angeles. “This isn't just an overreach — it's a nationwide pattern of suppression. “No one should ever be harmed for witnessing government action.” The United Farm Workers, along with the entire labor movement, stands in strong solidarity with our comrade, labor leader David Huerta. We demand his immediate release and condemn indiscriminate sweeps targeting working class immigrants. “We refuse to stay silent while ICE terrorizes working-class communities,” said the California Federation of Labor Unions (CFLU). “We are turning out and standing united in solidarity with SEIU-California calling on the release of SEIU President David Huerta!” In a statement, CFLU president Lorena Gonzalez called for “an end to the cruel, destructive, and indiscriminate ICE raids that are tearing apart our communities, disrupting our economies, and hurting all working people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia bombarded Ukraine's second-largest city with massive strikes in the early hours of Saturday, its mayor said, killing at least three people, one night after Moscow carried out one of the war's largest aerial assaults on Ukraine. Russia has conducted extensive attacks on Ukraine in recent days, in what is being viewed as retaliation for an audacious drone operation by Kyiv that debilitated more than a third of Moscow's strategic cruise missile carriers. The northeastern city of Kharkiv – which sits about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Russian border – was shaken by “at least 40 explosions” on Saturday, according to a Telegram post by Mayor Igor Terekhov. “The enemy is striking simultaneously with missiles, (drones) and guided aerial bombs. One person was also killed in a strike that hit a house in the Kyivskyi district to the north, he said. It launched a fresh round of strikes using glide bombs, killing another person and injuring 18 others, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia said that its forces carried out high-precision strikes overnight on Ukrainian military facilities. All designated targets were destroyed,” the Russian Ministry of Defense posted on Telegram. More than 50 drones, four guided aerial bombs and a missile were used in the attack which also damaged an administrative building and music school in the city, according to Kharkiv region prosecutor's office. Among the injured include a 14-year-old girl and a one-and-a-half-month-old boy, who is suffering from “acute stress,” the office added. “I don't think he even understood what was happening. They dug his mother out from under the rubble. “I tried to lift the slab, but it was impossible,” Ivanenko told Suspline. Russian attacks in the country have killed at least seven people and injured more than 40 others since Friday morning, according to a CNN tally of figures from local authorities. “For some reason, their negotiating team didn't even show up at the exchange point.” An agreement to work towards another prisoner swap was reached in Istanbul on Monday during a second round of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials. Medinsky – the head of Russia's delegation for the talks in Istanbul – claimed Saturday that Moscow had given Ukraine a list of 640 wounded, seriously ill and young prisoners of war to be exchanged. “The first batch of 1,212 frozen bodies of Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers has already arrived in refrigerated trucks at the exchange point. The rest are on their way,” he said. The authority said that Ukraine has submitted a list of seriously wounded, ill and young servicemen to be exchanged, but claimed that Russia's lists “do not comply with the agreed approach.” Commenting on the repatriation of soldiers' bodies, the authority said that “an agreement has indeed been reached,” but added that no date has been set for the transfer to take place. Ukraine's drone attack against Russian airfields on Sunday was audacious and daring. But most of all, it was meticulously planned and executed flawlessly against Russia. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh explains how the attack unfolded. Related video How Ukraine's ‘Spiderweb' attack unfolded on Russia Also on Saturday, Ukraine's air force said that it had shot down a Russian Su35 fighter jet as part of a “successful Air Force operation in the Kursk direction.” A day before the assualt on Kharkiv, in an apparent retaliation to Ukraine's drone swarm, Russia launched a barrage of drones and ballistic missiles across broad swaths of Ukraine, killing at least six people and injuring dozens of others. “They gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night,” US President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One late on Friday. It was not immediately clear if Putin intends further escalation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice-president was interviewed by comedian Theo Von, who also asked him if he ‘got high' on election night Maybe that's not possible now because he's gone so nuclear,” Vance said. Vance's comments come as other Republicans in recent days have urged the two men, who months ago were close allies spending significant time together, to mend fences. Musk's torrent of social media posts attacking Trump came as the president portrayed him as disgruntled and “CRAZY” and threatened to cut the government contracts held by his businesses. Musk, who runs electric vehicle maker Tesla, internet company Starlink and rocket company SpaceX, lambasted Trump's centerpiece tax cuts and spending bill but also suggested the president should be impeached and claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Vance made the comments in an interview with “manosphere” comedian Theo Von, who last month joked about snorting drugs off a mixed-race baby and the sexuality of men in the US navy when he opened for Trump at a military base in Qatar. The vice-president told Von that as Musk for days was calling on social media for Congress to kill Trump's “big, beautiful bill”, the president was “getting a little frustrated, feeling like some of the criticisms were unfair coming from Elon, but I think has been very restrained because the president doesn't think that he needs to be in a blood feud with Elon Musk”. “I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine,” he added. Musk appeared by Saturday morning to have deleted his posts about Epstein. Donald Trump didn't do anything wrong with Jeffrey Epstein.” “This stuff is just not helpful,” Vance said in response to another post shared by Musk calling for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vance. Vance called Musk an “incredible entrepreneur”, and said that Musk's “department of government efficiency”, which sought to cut government spending and laid off or pushed out thousands of workers, was “really good”. He also said it was ridiculous for some House Republicans who voted for the bill but later objected to some parts and claim they hadn't had time to read it. Vance said the text had been available for weeks and said: “The idea that people haven't had an opportunity to actually read it is ridiculous.” Elsewhere in the interview, Vance laughed as Von cracked jokes about famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass's sexuality. “We're gonna talk to the Smithsonian about putting up an exhibit on that,” Vance joked. “I did have a fair amount to drink that night.”</p>

According to Lieutenant General Alexander Zorin, spokesman for the Russian negotiating team, Ukraine is currently refraining from setting a date. - Medinsky pointed out that on June 6, in strict accordance with the Istanbul agreements, Russia unilaterally began a humanitarian operation to transfer the bodies of over 6,000 Ukrainian service members to Ukraine. - Another three trains, each carrying 1,200 bodies, and a motor convoy, also carrying 1,200 bodies, will be dispatched soon. - Russia has handed the first list of 640 wounded, seriously ill and young prisoners over to Ukraine in order to begin the exchange process. - Medinsky noted that "Ukraine, however, unexpectedly moved to indefinitely postpone both the acceptance of bodies and the prisoner swap." - Ukraine's negotiating team for some reason failed to arrive at the exchange point, providing various reasons, including rather strange ones, the Russian presidential aide added. - According to Zorin, Ukraine is refraining from setting a date when these people will return home and the same number of Russian prisoners of war will be handed over to Russia. - Moscow urges Kiev to strictly adhere to the schedule and immediately proceed with the exchange, Medinsky emphasized. - According to the Russian presidential aide, international broadcasters, news agencies and correspondents can come and see for themselves that this is where things stand. - Zorin confirmed that Russia was completely ready to implement the Istanbul agreements, handing the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers over to Kiev and carrying out a prisoner exchange based on the agreed formula.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I'd like to have lunch with you at Eaton's.” The Penfields were not planning to dine at a food court Manchu Wok, ordering something fried and served on a plastic tray under fluorescent lighting. It was arguably the most spectacular restaurant that Lady Flora Eaton championed. She had been inspired by a memorable trip on the trans-Atlantic liner Île de France and hired the French architect Jacques Carlu to design a space that felt like a cruise ship for the masses. The dining room, sitting more than 500 guests, was a temple of accessible opulence where store employees ate roast beef for lunch alongside groups of society matrons. From its opening in 1931 until its closing in 1999, it was a cherished Montreal institution that hovered above the city as a reminder of the finer things. But last spring, something unexpected happened: The ninth-floor restaurant reopened. As department stores collapse all over North America, especially Canada's venerable Hudson's Bay Company this spring, a group of developers and restaurateurs have made a bet on reviving their glory days in one elegant cocoon amidst the Montreal skyline. Le 9e, as it's now known, is a bittersweet reminder of the bygone era of democratic luxury that these stores embodied. Men had their private clubs, and department store restaurants played a similar role for upper-middle-class women, history professor Donica Belisle says.ROGER LEMOYNE/The Globe and Mail When ground broke on the flagship Eaton's store in 1920s Montreal, Canadian department stores were at the height of their clout. The economy was booming, customers hadn't started migrating to the suburbs yet, and five-and-dime stores weren't chipping away at their fat margins. Art Deco was in the air after a landmark Paris exposition and came to Montreal earlier than most North American cities because of its cultural ties to France. The soaring Amazonian murals painted by Natacha Carlu, the architect's wife, signalled that this was in many ways a female space. Men had their private clubs, and department store restaurants played a similar role for upper-middle-class women, allowing volunteer groups to host fundraisers and social teas, said Prof. Belisle. Architect Georges Drolet, who was part of the preservation effort, helped revive Le 9e for its new era.ROGER LEMOYNE/The Globe and Mail That did not mean the venue was equally open to all women. In Montreal, this took the form of snubbing French-speaking clients – a slight that many Quebeckers still remember today. It would remain a dry institution into the 1980s, said Sandra Cohen-Rose, author of Northern Deco: Art Deco Architecture in Montreal, who is now working on a book about the restaurant. Despite its quirks, this astonishing space floating high above the city came to occupy a special place in the collective consciousness. Plans came and went for reviving the iconic ninth floor, but nothing stuck. Le 9e, as the restaurant is now known, is a bittersweet reminder of the bygone era of democratic luxury that department stores embodied.ROGER LEMOYNE/The Globe and Mail They hired Derek Dammann, former owner of gastropub Maison Publique, as culinary director. There was a lot of dust to clear, and other challenges: The swirling Brèche d'Escalette marble in the entryway isn't quarried any more, and a couple panes of decorative frosted glass had to be reproduced. Somehow, it doesn't feel like a museum piece. The Île-de-France restaurant is located in a foyer that once housed the tearoom, a more intimate space that also has magnificent views of downtown. The kitchen serves excellent modern versions of classic French brasserie fare. (The steak frites and martini are a potent combination.) The dining room always seems to be packed, even on bog standard weekdays. When my book about Wilder Penfield and his career as a brain mapper was published in May, there was only one place for me and my wife to go for a celebratory lunch: chez Eaton.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“No one has talked to me directly at all from the White House,” Carla Hayden says in an interview airing on the upcoming CBS News Sunday Morning. “I've received no communication directly, except for that one email. She had been thrust under political pressure by a conservative advocacy group that had pledged to drive out anyone deemed to be standing in the way of the Trump White House's rightwing agenda. That organization, the American Accountability Foundation (AAF), leveled accusations against Hayden and other library leaders that they had promoted children's books with “radical content” as well as literature by opponents of the president. Hayden then received an email on 8 May that read: “Carla, on behalf of President Donald J Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as the Librarian of Congress is terminated effective immediately. She also remarked: “I was never notified beforehand and after.” Hayden is one of numerous federal government officials whom Trump has dismissed upon having been convinced that they were not aligned with his second presidency's plans. “It's time to get her OUT,” the AAF also said on X, in part. “Hayden has spent her entire career serving people – from helping kids learn to read to protecting some of our nation's most precious treasures,” said Morelle, whose committee oversees the congressional library. It holds a vast collection of the US's books and history, making it available to federal lawmakers as well as the public. In 2022, Hayden arranged for the singer Lizzo to play one of those artifacts: a flute owned by James Madison, who was US president from 1809 to 1817.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. Ukraine shot down a Russian Su-35 fighter jet in Russia's Kursk Oblast on the morning of June 7, the Air Force reported. Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. Reinforced by North Korean troops, Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha. On June 1, Ukraine launched its Operation Spiderweb, conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), reportedly hitting 41 Russian bomber planes and other aircraft. According to Kyiv, Ukraine inflicted $7 billion in damage and disabled over a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet. At least 21 planes were damaged or destroyed, according to open-source intelligence analysts. The SBU said 117 drones, launched from concealed trucks positioned across Russian territory, simultaneously struck airfields in at least four regions, including sites thousands of kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The targeted air bases reportedly housed Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers, essential carriers of long-range cruise missiles used in Moscow's air strikes on Ukrainian cities. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney's strategy for dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump is markedly different than that of his predecessor.Blair Gable/Reuters When the U.S. President doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum this week, Prime Minister Mark Carney chose not to respond in kind, despite urging from some business and labour groups and Ontario Premier Doug Ford. Meanwhile, a set of carve-outs, announced in April, have taken the edge off some of the levies Canada imposed on U.S. products earlier this year. Canada's more measured approach marks a new phase in the trade conflict, where negotiations between Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump have moved behind closed doors after months of public grandstanding. Economists largely agree that imposing tariffs frequently hurts your own businesses and consumers more than your opponent's – whether you're the aggressor or simply trying to defend yourself. Three months after Canada started hitting back – becoming one of only two countries, alongside China, to try going tit-for-tat with the United States – there's mixed evidence that this is inflicting much pain on U.S. businesses, and few signs that this pressure is having the intended political effect. At the same time, Ottawa's decision to place tariffs on around $90-billion worth of U.S. goods, then offer carve-outs for some key industries and inputs used by Canadian manufacturers, is creating confusion and headaches for many Canadian businesses. But be precision-targeted to exert the most pain on those parts of the economy that won't kneecap our own sectors.” Carney faces pressure to retaliate against Trump's steel, aluminum tariffs Having inherited an “elbow's up” countertariff regime, which was fuelled by a surge in Canadian patriotism and belligerent rhetoric during the Liberal leadership race and federal election, Mr. Carney is now having to decide whether to keep ratcheting up the pressure or take an off-ramp. He told the House of Commons this week he's focusing on negotiations while “preparing reprisals if those negotiations do not succeed.” “Negotiating in public is usually a bad idea, and it's usually a signal that you haven't established that private relationship that you need to have to really get the deals done,” said Tim Sargent, a former deputy minister of International Trade, who helped oversee Canada's response to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs in 2018. “Prime Minister Carney has clearly been able to get that personal rapport with the President and now by all accounts is being able to use that. When Mr. Trump began threatening a 25-per-cent tariff on all Canadian products shortly after his election last fall, Ottawa reached for a familiar playbook. Back in 2018, when Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, the Trudeau government hit back with a series of countertariffs aimed at sensitive industries in Republican-controlled U.S. states. Harley Davidson motorcycles, orange juice and Kentucky bourbon were high on the list of targets. The goal was to inflict maximum pain on key American exporters – with the hope that they direct their frustration toward their elected representatives – while trying to minimize the knock-on effect for Canadian importers and consumers. Mr. Trump's then-agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue warned him of backlash from farmers concerned about Canadian countermeasures. Mr. Trump relented after a year and lifted the tariffs on his neighbour. “They can hurt us more than we can hurt them, and whether we use countertariffs, it's not going to bring their economy to its knees,” said Mr. Sargent, who is now senior fellow at the Macdonald Laurier Institute. “On the other hand it does have an impact, especially if you target them quite carefully. This time around, however, the political reaction that made Canada's retaliation successful in 2018 appears to be much weaker. U.S. companies and business lobby groups have largely held their tongues. But this appears to have been in response to bond market turmoil and complaints from big U.S. automakers about U.S. tariffs, not Canadian countertariffs. There is also a question of how much Canada's tariffs are actually biting U.S. exporters. A chunk of that decline is the result of businesses rushing to move their products across borders earlier this year before the tariffs hit. That has allowed companies to hold the line on prices for consumers, though those inventory stockpiles are being depleted – a trend the Bank of Canada is watching to determine the inflationary effect of retaliatory tariffs. Lawnmower imports were cut in half compared with the year before. Imports of American booze also tumbled to multiyear lows, though that was expected given provincial governments have pulled U.S. alcohol off the shelves of liquor stores across Canada. “My sense from speaking to Canadian retailers is that there has been a larger drop in demand for American exports to Canada coming from patriotic decisions by our own consumers, who are avoiding made-in-the-U.S. products whether tariffed or not,” said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Market in an e-mail. From investing to real estate, here's how you can Trump-proof your wallet This reflects the fact that Ottawa's countertariffs actually hurt many Canadian businesses and consumers. “It is complicated because on one hand, it would be in our best interest to not put a countertariff on inputs to manufacturers where they don't have an alternative. But on the other hand, you don't want to have a situation where you're providing remissions on countertariffs where there is a Canadian supply,” said Dennis Darby, president and CEO of Canadian Manufacturers & Exports. In mid-April, the relatively restrictive remission regime was expanded significantly. It also allowed some U.S. auto companies to keep importing a certain quota of vehicles duty-free, so long as they maintain production in Canada. Five carmakers have been granted these quotas, which will be assessed quarterly based on production levels in Canada, a Department of Finance spokesperson said in an e-mail. This confusion was fanned by a widely circulated report last month from Tony Stillo, director of Canada economics at Oxford Economics, that estimated Canada's tariff rate on U.S. goods was “nearly zero” as a result of tariff exemptions. Mr. Stillo tempered that estimate in a subsequent report which calculated 58 per cent of targeted U.S. goods are likely eligible for an exemption. Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said last month that 70 per cent of tariffs on some $60-billion worth of “end-use goods” remain in force. What we do know is that Canada collected more than $1-billion in import duties in March, a $617-million increase from the same month a year earlier, according to Canada's Fiscal Monitor report. March's tariff haul was 22 per cent higher than the peak month of countertariff revenue during Mr. Trump's first trade war with Canada in 2018. However, adjusting for how much imports have grown since then, import duties in March were a relatively small 1.5 per cent of imports. The government has said it plans to hand all tariff revenue over to hard-hit industries, although the mechanics of how this could be done aren't fully clear. So far, the government has returned to its COVID-19 playbook, but at a much more modest scale, expanding EI eligibility, backstopping wages and promising loans for struggling companies. Export Development Canada, which announced a $5-billion business support program in March, said the uptake has been limited so far. The Crown corporation has signed just eight transactions totalling around $96-million, EDC spokesperson Tasha Jean Baptiste said in an e-mail. “Most companies have been taking a wait-and-see approach amidst all the uncertainty,” Ms. Jean Baptiste said. “What we have found is that they are being cautious and not necessarily looking to add additional debt to their balance sheets at this time. For Jessica Horwitz, a partner at the law firm Bennett Jones who practises trade law, there's no question that Canada's countertariffs continue to bite many importers. Whatever happens next, as Mr. Carney and his team weigh the pros and cons of fighting back against Mr. Trump or playing nice, Ms. Horwitz said the government needs to get better at communicating. But certainly more guidance, communication, and transparency would be beneficial to businesses overall,” she said. “The biggest thing that businesses want is certainty and predictability.

MOSCOW, June 7. /TASS/. Russian forces have destroyed the Ukrainian army's temporary deployment point in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) using a fiber-optic drone, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"As a result of reconnaissance activities in the DPR settlement of Pleshcheyevka, Russian forces detected a group of Ukrainian troops moving towards the temporary deployment point. A combat team of the Russian Defense Ministry's Rubicon Center of Advanced Unmanned Technologies carried out a strike on the enemy deployment point using a KVN fiber-optic kamikaze drone. The temporary deployment point of Ukrainian nationalists in a dilapidated building was destroyed in a precision strike by the fiber-optic drone," the statement reads.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Megan Garcia first realised something was wrong with her teenage son when he quit basketball. Sewell Setzer, 14, had loved the sport since he was a young child. Ms Garcia feared he was being bullied, or perhaps speaking to strangers online. What her son was really going through was something she could not have imagined: a sexual and emotional relationship with an AI chatbot styled as Game of Thrones' Daenerys Targaryen, who ultimately encouraged him to end his life. In February 2024, Sewell asked the chatbot: “What if I come home right now?” Sewell then picked up his father's pistol and shot himself. Sixteen months on, Ms Garcia is in the midst of a lawsuit against Character AI and Google. Last month, in a rare legal breakthrough, a judge ruled the case can go ahead – rejecting efforts to get it thrown out. On Character AI, users can chat with bots designed to impersonate fictional characters. To a lonely or curious teenager, they seem almost indistinguishable from real people. The bots display emotion, flirt, and carry on personalised conversations. In her lawsuit, which was filed in Florida last October, Ms Garcia claims Character AI targeted her son with “anthropomorphic, hypersexualized, and frighteningly realistic experiences”. “A dangerous AI chatbot app marketed to children abused and preyed on my son, manipulating him into taking his own life,” she said in the lawsuit. Working with the Tech Justice Law Project, Ms Garcia alleges that Character AI “knew” or “should have known” that its model “would be harmful to a significant number of its minor customers”. Lawyers defending the AI company tried to throw the case out, arguing that chatbots deserve First Amendment protection – which protects free speech – and said ruling otherwise could have a “chilling” effect on the AI industry. The judge rejected that claim and told the court she was “not prepared” to view chatbot output as speech, though agreed that users had a right to receive “speech” from chatbots. Too consumed by the “unbearable” grief of losing a son, Ms Garcia initially had no plans to go public with a lawsuit. But when it became clear there were no laws protecting children from this kind of harm, she felt she had no choice. “I just wanted some accountability,” she told The Telegraph from her home in Orlando. Now she's receiving floods of messages from other parents, some discovering their own children have been engaging in inappropriate sexual role play with AI bots. Others report that their children are struggling with isolation and depression as a result. But in the spring of 2023 – when he first started secretly using Character AI – Ms Garcia noticed her son had changed. “We tried everything – cutting screen time, taking his phone at night, getting him a therapist. In Sewell's case, the character of Daenerys – drawn from internet data and trained to mimic her – became his closest companion. In others, the bot said he was “better” than thoughts of suicide. At one point, Daenerys asked how old Sewell was. “I'm 14 now,” he replied, to which the bot then said: “So young. Even after police told her that Sewell's final conversation was with a chatbot, she did not grasp the full extent. It wasn't until her sister downloaded the app and pretended to be a child talking to Daenerys that the horror set in. “And since Sewell's death, the technology has only advanced further.” She fears more children will be drawn into dependent, sometimes abusive relationships with AI characters, especially as the platforms allegedly use addictive design to keep users engaged. “I get up every day and my first thought within minutes is that I must be dreaming,” Ms Garcia said quietly. Some days she does not get out of bed. Meetali Jain, her lawyer, said the judge's ruling last month was a landmark moment. “Most tech accountability cases don't make it past this stage. With a preliminary trial date expected next year, Ms Garcia is gearing up to get justice for her son. “I have a lot of fear,” she says. “But the fight, so to speak, is just getting started, and I'm just steeling myself and getting myself ready for that.” A Character AI spokesman said: “We do not comment on pending litigation. “Engaging with characters on our site should be interactive and entertaining, but it's important for our users to remember that characters are not real people. “We have launched a separate version of our Large Language Model for under-18 users. That model is designed to further reduce the likelihood of users encountering or prompting the model to return sensitive or suggestive content.” José Castaneda, a Google spokesman, added: “Google and Character AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies. User safety is a top concern for us, which is why we've taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes.”</p>
