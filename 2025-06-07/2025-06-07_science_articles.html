                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unlike birds, which navigate unknown environments with remarkable speed and agility, drones typically rely on external guidance or pre-mapped routes. The team has developed the Safety-Assured High-Speed Aerial Robot (SUPER), capable of flying at speeds exceeding 20 meters per second and avoiding obstacles as thin as 2.5 millimeters - such as power lines or twigs - using solely on onboard sensors and computing power. Professor Zhang describes this invention as a game-changer in the field of drone technology, "Picture a 'Robot Bird' swiftly maneuvering through the forest, effortlessly dodging branches and obstacles at high speeds. Our system allows MAVs to navigate complex environments at high speeds with a level of safety previously unattainable. SUPER utilizes a lightweight 3D light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor capable of detecting obstacles up to 70 meters away with pinpoint accuracy. This is paired with an advanced planning framework that generates two trajectories during flight: one that optimizing speed by venturing into unknown spaces and another prioritizing safety by remaining within known, obstacle-free zones. By processing LIDAR data directly as point clouds, the system significantly reduces computation time, enabling rapid decision-making even at high velocities. The technology has been tested in various real-life applications, such as the autonomous exploration of ancient sites, and has demonstrated seamless navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments. SUPER's robustness in various lighting conditions, including nighttime, makes it a reliable tool for round-the-clock operations." The research team envisions a wide range of applications for this innovative technology, including autonomous delivery, power line inspection, forest monitoring, autonomous exploration, and mapping. In search and rescue missions, MAVs equipped with SUPER technology could swiftly navigate disaster zones - such as collapsed buildings or dense forests - day and night, locating survivors or assessing hazards more efficiently than current drones. Moreover, in disaster relief scenarios, they could deliver crucial supplies to remote and inaccessible areas. Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It probably required technological seafaring advancements beyond what was considered likely during the Paleolithic era. But those experts may have a surprising new answer thanks to research that shows the ancient people of the Philippines and ISEA may have mastered seafaring well before anyone else. The pivotal archaeological evidence comes in the form of stone tools excavated at sites in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste, showing strong evidence that as far back as 40,000 years ago, there was a technological sophistication from these ancient seafarers that rivals much later civilizations. Proving seafaring history represents a tricky endeavor, since organic wood and fiber that would have likely been used in constructing Paleolithic seacraft rarely survive in the archaeological record. Add in the discovery of fishing hooks, gorges, net weights, and the remains of deep-ocean fish such as tuna and sharks, and these archeological sites are a rich exploration of what is obviously a robust seafaring culture. That same rope technology was then adapted for the actual fishing. Rather, they posit that the movement came from highly skilled navigators equipped with the knowledge and technology to travel to remote locations over deep waters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And it's been challenging existing notions of the infant universe. "Our goal was to construct this deep field of space on a physical scale that far exceeded anything that had been done before," said UC Santa Barbara physics professor Caitlin Casey, who co-leads the COSMOS-Web collaboration alongside Jeyhan Kartaltepe of the Rochester Institute of Technology. "If you had a printout of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field on a standard piece of paper," she said, referring to the iconic view of nearly 10,000 galaxies released by NASA in 2004, "our image would be slightly larger than a 13-foot by 13-foot-wide mural, at the same depth. "The cosmos is organized in dense regions and voids," Casey explained. "And we wanted to go beyond finding the most distant galaxies; we wanted to get that broader context of where they lived." And what a cosmic neighborhood it turned out to be. Before JWST turned on, Casey said, she and fellow astronomers made their best predictions about how many more galaxies the space telescope would be able to see, given its 6.5 meter (21 foot) diameter light-collecting primary mirror, about six times larger than Hubble's 2.4 meter (7 foot, 10 in) diameter mirror. The best measurements from Hubble suggested that galaxies within the first 500 million years would be incredibly rare, she said. There's a timescale associated with that," Casey explained. "And the big surprise is that with JWST, we see roughly 10 times more galaxies than expected at these incredible distances. We're also seeing supermassive black holes that are not even visible with Hubble." While the COSMOS-Web images and catalog answer many questions astronomers have had about the early universe, they also spark more questions. Because the universe was producing too much light too early; it had only about 400 million years to form something like a billion solar masses of stars. We just do not know how to make that happen," Casey said. The dataset may also provide clues to other outstanding mysteries of the cosmos, such as dark matter and physics of the early universe that may be different from what we know today. The data was made public almost immediately after it was gathered, but only in its raw form, useful only to those with the specialized technical knowledge and the supercomputer access to process and interpret it. The COSMOS collaboration has worked tirelessly for the past two years to convert raw data into broadly usable images and catalogs. In creating these products and releasing them, the researchers hope that even undergraduate astronomers could dig into the material and learn something new. "It's not just for one group of people to figure out the mysteries." "We have more data collection coming up," she said. To do so, they'll be using spectroscopy, which breaks up light from galaxies into a prism, to confirm the distance of these sources (more distant = older). "As a byproduct," Casey added, "we'll get to understand the interstellar chemistry in these systems through tracing nitrogen, carbon and oxygen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As electronics become smaller, it is becoming increasingly difficult to continue scaling down silicon-based transistors. Has the development of our electronics hit a wall? As detailed in their new paper, to be issued in 2025 Symposium on VLSI Technology and Circuits , the team ditched the silicon and instead opted to create a transistor made from gallium-doped indium oxide (InGaOx). This material can be structured as a crystalline oxide, whose orderly, crystal lattice is well suited for electron mobility. With these goals in mind, the team got to work. This would make the material react with electricity in a more favorable way. "Indium oxide contains oxygen-vacancy defects, which facilitate carrier scattering and thus lower device stability," says Masaharu Kobayashi, senior author. "We doped indium oxide with gallium to suppress oxygen vacancies and in turn improve transistor reliability." This process ultimately enabled the fabrication of a gate-all-around 'metal oxide-based field-effect transistor' (MOSFET). "Our gate-all-around MOSFET, containing a gallium-doped indium oxide layer, achieves high mobility of 44.5 cm2/Vs," explains Dr Chen. "Crucially, the device demonstrates promising reliability by operating stably under applied stress for nearly three hours. In fact, our MOSFET outperformed similar devices that have previously been reported." The research is a step towards the development of reliable, high-density electronic components suited for applications with high computational demand, such as big data and artificial intelligence. The article "A Gate-All-Around Nanosheet Oxide Semiconductor Transistor by Selective Crystallization of InGaOx for Performance and Reliability Enhancement" was issued in 2025 Symposium on VLSI Technology and Circuits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Giant viruses play a role in the survival of single-celled marine organisms called protists. These include algae, amoeba, and flagellates, that form the base of ocean food webs. And since these protists form an important part of the food chain, these large DNA viruses are often responsible for various public health hazards, including harmful algal blooms. A new study from scientists at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science may help unravel the many types of viruses present in our waterways and oceans. This knowledge could help local leaders better prepare for when a harmful algal bloom may be impacting their coastline or if any other viruses are present in local bays, rivers or lakes. Using high-performance computing methods, researchers identified 230 novel giant viruses in publicly available marine metagenomic datasets and characterized their functions. This indicates that these viruses may be able to manipulate their host and the photosynthesis process during infection. Until recently, giant viruses were largely undetected by scientific methods due to limitations in bioinformatic pipelines. The researchers created an innovative tool called BEREN (Bioinformatic tool for Eukaryotic virus Recovery from Environmental metageNomes), designed to identify giant virus genomes within extensive public DNA sequencing datasets. "We discovered that giant viruses possess genes involved in cellular functions such as carbon metabolism and photosynthesis -- traditionally found only in cellular organisms, said Benjamin Minch, the lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the Department of Marine Biology and Ecology at the Rosenstiel School. "This suggests that giant viruses play an outsized role in manipulating their host's metabolism during infection and influencing marine biogeochemistry." Using BEREN, they recovered giant virus genomes from the data. The BEREN program used to facilitate this research fills a gap in the research field by providing an easy-to-use, one-stop tool for identifying and classifying giant viruses in sequencing datasets.
