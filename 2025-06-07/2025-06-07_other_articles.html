                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted in: Amazon Studios, CW, TV | Tagged: Supernatural, the boys During a Creation Entertainment this weekend, Misha Collins shared that his scene with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki during The Boys Season 5 reminded him a bit of Supernatural Season 6 Episode 15: "The French Mistake." Ever since it was announced that Supernatural fam Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins would be sharing screen time with Jensen Ackles (Soldier Boy) during the fifth and final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke and Prime Video's The Boys, fans have been checking out anything and everything that might offer clues to what they can expect. During Creation Entertainment's "The Road So Far… The Road Ahead: Creation Oklahoma City" this weekend, Collins offered an interesting tease about what goes down. While having to stay on "spoiler watch," Collins noted that their on-screen time together in The Boys might vibe a bit familiar for those who've seen Supernatural Season 6 Episode 15: "The French Mistake." The 2011 episode finds the angel Balthazar trapping Sam (Padalecki) and Dean (Ackles) in an alternate reality where they're known as – you guessed it – "Jared Padalecki" and "Jensen Ackles." Yup, it gets even more meta because "Jared Padalecki" and "Jensen Ackles" play Sam and Dean on a television show. Thankfully, Castiel (Collins) makes the save after some twists and turns (though a much larger threat loomed). Here's what Collins had to share earlier today during #SPNOKC, and huge thanks once again to Fangasm for getting the word out: @mishacollins : there's a little bit of a call back to what @jarpad @JensenAckles and I did in The French Mistake to what we did on The Boys… #ooooh #SPNOKC pic.twitter.com/o9Ijfn6eWd @mishacollins : when I read the script for #TheBoys I said there had better be me eating my own ass… #SPNOKC LOL pic.twitter.com/WCiY4TTI5Y "There are some things that are coming in Season 5 that you're not going to have in your bingo card," Mitchell shared while speaking with Deadline Hollywood during Amazon's Prime Video FYC event last month that also included Jack Quaid, Susan Heyward, Colby Minifie, Claudia Doumit, Tomer Capone, Jessie T. Usher, Antony Starr, Erin Moriarty, and Chace Crawford. "I look at the last two seasons … like an accordion. So it's exciting at the moment because we're filming all that," Starr added. You don't want the opposite, where they're like, 'Oh thank God.'" When the announcement came out, Kripke said we get to end it on our terms, which I think is a really beautiful thing. The best stories have a beginning, middle, and end. During an interview with Forbes from earlier this year, Kripke discussed how the streaming series has leaned into being a political show and how current events impact the season's writing (but not the show's endgame). "Look, I think 'The Boys' probably, for better or worse, is a political show at this point. I think the world has sort of grown to resemble the show more and more in a way that's not great. And so, we just sort of lean into it. I mean, the show is about why and how you should question your leaders. You should question anyone who is pitching you simple answers to complicated problems and who is saying that they're the only ones who can save you – like those are dangerous people. Obviously, we're not shy about saying that, but I take a little bit of pride in that for our bananas superhero show, we're one of the most current shows on TV in terms of like reflecting exactly what's happening in the world at this moment, and that's great. It's amazing for a superhero show to be doing that. So, I'm really proud that we pulled that off," Kripke shared, noting that over the seasons, the writers began to embrace how the series and real life were reflecting one another. "I mean, look – things adjust all the time. So, we're sort of used to this organic movement of the scripts always transforming a little bit, based on what's happening in the world. You're always rewriting these things right up until the day before they shoot and, sometimes, the day they shoot. So, we're used to changing things as the world changes – but yes, we definitely adjust scripts as new events come to light," the showrunner explained. But in terms of where the series and characters are heading during their final run, Kripke adds that the "big picture" endgame plans don't change. I mean, especially in the final season when every character has to reach their climax – like we've had those in our back pocket for a while and this season is mostly just figuring out how to get there, you know? I live in absolute terror of becoming the thing we've been satirizing for five years," Kripke shared during a recent conversation with Collider, explaining why he continues to be cautious about expanding the show's universe too much, too soon. I'm really working hard to not sell out. I worry about that every single day," he added. "I just want people to say, maybe it's for them, and maybe it isn't for them, but gotta hand it to them, they maintain a consistent level of quality."</p>

It's not that the modern conspiracy theorist is wrong about everything. It's the only currency accepted in their parallel universe, where logic is elitist, facts are fascist, and evidence is what you feel in your waters at 3am after half a bottle of gin and a YouTube binge.Take climate change. Now, to you and me, the notion that pumping billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for two centuries might just be warming the planet is not terribly controversial. The Earth, they say, has always gone through “natural cycles”—though strangely, these cycles now include wildfires in Sweden and beachfront properties in Sheffield.The climate change denier is a curious beast. He will confidently tell you, between puffs on his diesel-powered vape, (why do conspiracy theorists all seem to smoke vapes? ) that global warming is a hoax cooked up by Al Gore and lizard people to sell solar panels and vegan yoghurt. He is often the same man who believes George W. Bush personally detonated the Twin Towers using thermite, WiFi, and a remote control shaped like Dick Cheney's reproductive organ.Indeed, there seems to be a remarkable overlap in conspiracy circles. One moment you're reading a blog post titled “Chemtrails and the Cabbalistic Agenda of the Illuminati”, and the next it's a twelve-page screed explaining how Covid-19 was “a psy-op orchestrated by Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum to force us all to drink cricket smoothies and submit to compulsory yoga”.According to this crowd, the pandemic didn't really happen. The footage of overwhelmed Italian ICUs was staged—possibly by Stanley Kubrick's ghost. Ah, those were clearly designed to sterilise the population, implant nanobots, or possibly just make you slightly more left-wing.Of course, they'll say, “I'm just asking questions.” Which is conspiracy-speak for “I watched four hours of TikTok videos and now I have a PhD in virology, atmospheric science, and the globalist occult.” Asking questions is the sacred rite of the conspiracy theorist. But they never ask the one that matters: “What if I'm completely wrong and mildly unhinged?”Another sure giveaway is the use of capital letters where none are needed. “WAKE UP SHEEPLE!” they bellow in comment sections. OPEN YOUR EYES!” It's as though they've confused political awareness with being trapped in a malfunctioning Caps Lock key.And then, of course, there's the “New World Order”—the all-purpose bogeyman of the paranoid imagination. None other than the world's worst defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen.Yes, her.To suggest that Ursula von der Leyen is competent at her job is, to the conspiracy theorist, the ultimate shibboleth. Only they, the enlightened ones, understand that she's not a beleaguered bureaucrat wrestling with 27 bickering member states and a terminal shortage of talent. No, she is the High Priestess of the Euro-Soros-LGBT-Woke-Techno-Malthusian cult that secretly runs everything, including your local recycling rota.It's difficult to say how these ideas persist. You'd think, after 23 years of waiting for the “Deep State purge” promised by anonymous online accounts and guys called Dave with shaved heads and GoPros, they'd be a little chastened.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just when you thought royal drama had simmered down, Meghan Markle broke the internet again, and no, it is not because of a scandalous Netflix deal or a new podcast drop. This time, it is her pregnant twerking video that has conspiracy theorists foaming at the mouth. Spoiler alert: it turned into a full-blown online spectacle. The clip features Meghan, nine months pregnant, dancing her heart out in a hospital room to Starrkeisha's “Baby Mama.” Prince Harry even makes a cameo before she breaks into some joyful twerking, all while heavily pregnant. The fakest bump I've ever seen in my life https://t.co/gevbY6hHVd They dove in headfirst, accusing Meghan of faking her pregnancy again — with one term trending harder than ever: moonbump. According to some very loud keyboard warriors, her bump was “too high,” “too firm,” or just moved “weird.” Others screamed “AI-generated!” or claimed the hospital looked like a set built for a Lifetime movie. Markle's bump is 100% fake though -- she's mocking women in labour and taunting the Royal Family with her fraudulent children. One self-identified nurse went viral claiming Meghan should have had a cannula or IV drip if she was really in labour. Another claimed her ability to dance at full-term was “superhuman,” clearly forgetting that Meghan was not strapped to a bed but literally just vibing. Someone even tried to point out inconsistencies based on her jewellery and lack of medical equipment. Because obviously, nothing screams “conspiracy confirmed” like earrings in a maternity ward. Alongside the video, she dropped unseen photos of Harry and baby Lilibet, including a barefoot beach stroll and a sweet newborn cuddle. Even while the name Lilibet still stirs royal tension, with some reports claiming the late Queen was less than thrilled, Meghan is clearly unbothered. She is busy harvesting honey with her daughter and planning potential future businesses together. She is still out here dancing, glowing, and telling her own story, moonbump or not.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I don't know what I was expecting… but to be left crying and filled with regret at how much I'd paid wasn't it. A friend had recently tried it and said how uplifting it was, and a year earlier I'd watched a woman on TikTok discuss her 'eerily accurate' reading. It just so happened they both went to the same place in London - I took it as a sign. Around 40 minutes before my appointment, the psychic - who I shall called Harriet - calls me to apologise that she's running late as there is an issue with the Tubes. Cue my friend's ‘she didn't see that coming' text… Alas, another reason I'd wanted to give this a go was down to Michael McIntyre. In his autobiography, the comedian tells how on a whim his then-19-year-old mother goes to a tarot card reading with a psychic who tells her she's pregnant, it will be a son and he will be ‘world-famous'. When we finally start, Harriet tells me how honoured she is to be giving me my first reading. The cards from my reading, more on this later Harriet assures me she won't deliver ‘scary' or ominous news but that ‘every message that comes through is what you need to hear' although ‘sometimes not what you want to hear.' ‘I see you looking out a bus window, wistfully,' she begins. Harriet wasn't kidding about it not always being what you want to hear. ‘But sometimes not in the way you want - and not in a good way.' I thought you weren't meant to deliver bad news… ‘There's a feeling of “I need to change”. Hmm, I ponder, I am quite happy in London and have no desire to move from my lovely flat. So where did she have in mind? A villa in the sunnier climes of Portugal? I've never thought twice about that part of the country. I am from the south originally, so Manchester seems quite a rogue choice but you never know in the distant future… I'm locked into a contract on my flat until next year so that could be problematic. ‘You're about to jump on that train,' she continues. Note, I have upgraded from a bus. ‘I feel like it's the same field, same kind of work but it's just broader. More of a place you can get to the top, that you can spread your wings and develop.' ‘It feels like you have a bit of a coach around you,' Harriet continues as she ‘tunes in with my energy and her team of spirits'. ‘This spirit pushing you and giving you all these wonderful words: ‘that's the name of the game', ‘we're going to go for it'. It feels like they've been with you for quite a while. It feels like a female spirit that's around you. ‘Sometimes you might be given a message that this isn't the right time and you have to wait six months or so. But opportunities are coming sooner rather than later.' So what are the spirit guides telling Harriet my next career move could be? ‘Behind the scenes, I see scripts,' she says. ‘Have you ever worked in the theatrical arts? And colourful, I see a lot of colour around what you're writing. I continue to listen, puzzled, I have never worked in theatre and it's never appealed to me. ‘I'm also getting the message keep some mystery and secrecy around what you're doing. You've got some really good ideas that are not quite ready to be revealed.' I must already be doing such a good job of keeping some mystery, I'm leaving myself in the dark. ‘I'm getting your mum,' Harriet then says. Now might be the time to confess another reason I found myself sitting in front of the psychic was because of my mum. She died last year from cancer and I have been bereft without her ever since and desperate to somehow feel close to her again. If nothing else really giving you some encouragement. You don't have a lot to lose by taking a leap of faith here. At this point I'm feeling both emotional and awkward. My mum was all of those things, but I can't bring myself to say anything to Harriet. ‘I'm seeing your mum again,' she says. ‘Have you ever travelled with your mum? Maybe it would be a nice time for you two to go do something nice together, even if it's a long weekend. Could have done without this card too... one man on crutches who can barely walk, the other freezing and poor I make a mental note to quiz my friend again who found her reading ‘uplifting'. It dawns on me how foolish I was to think my mum would send a message to me via a random woman in a rented room in London, or how she could actually predict my future. I message my brother in tears feeling silly. He swiftly brings me down to earth. ‘How much did you pay for that b*******?,' he replies. ‘Everything she said is complete chance and guess work. *Unless in August I am working at a theatre in Manchester after going on holiday with my mum who has returned from the dead… The comments below have not been moderated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Likening a visit to the space station to a camping trip, former NASA astronaut and Axiom-4 mission commander Peggy Whitson said the orbital station has enough food, water and other supplies to sustain the daily lives of those on board. So it isn't like going to some ultra-rich hotel spa or whatever. But it's a lot of fun," she told NDTV. The orbital station, she said, is equivalent to inter-connected bus-sized modules of various sizes with four pull-up laboratories, a toilet, exercise hardware and life support systems. "There's actually a lot more space than you think. But obviously, by increasing the crew size by four, it will be a challenge for us to all integrate and work together," she said when asked if the ISS will become crowded when the Axiom-4 team enters it. Should the Axiom-4 mission launch be successful, Dr Whitson and her team members Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, European Space Agency project astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski of Poland, and Tibor Kapu of Hungary will be seen floating around the orbital lab amid its screens, plugs, wires, switches, pipes and knobs. But what she is confident of is life far beyond among the billions of galaxies that unfold outside the space station's portal windows. "I haven't seen any (extraterrestrial life) with my own eyes. And I know, I know there has to be other life out there, because it is so expansive. Dr Whitson and her colleague Mr Shukla, who is called "Shux" by the team, will especially look at India from space. It's relatively easy to pick out India because of the geography. I'm looking forward to seeing it again," she said. The Axiom-4 mission will launch on June 10 at 5.52 pm IST on board SpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. Mr Shukla will be the second Indian to travel to space four decades after Rakesh Sharma's iconic spaceflight onboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft in 1984. Once docked, the astronauts plan to spend up to 14 days aboard the orbiting laboratory, conducting science, outreach, and commercial activities. Mr Shukla is set to conduct exclusive food and nutrition-related experiments developed under a collaboration between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), with support from NASA. ISRO has lined up a set of seven experiments for Mr Shukla, who will also participate in five joint studies planned by NASA for its human research programme. It has drawn up plans to focus on India-centric food for carrying out experiments on the ISS, including sprouting methi (Fenugreek) and moong (green gram) in microgravity conditions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With 15 years under its belt, The CW's Supernatural is packed full of memorable characters. However, few can equal the gravitas and impact of Death. The inherent power that oozes from actor Julian Richings has become legendary in Supernatural circles. Each appearance of Death carried significant weight and serious implications for the overarching storyline. In Supernatural, everything dies, and that doesn't happen without Death. Sporting a fancy car and heralded by his theme song, Death's stylish stride down the streets of Chicago is one of the most well-known scenes in the show's history. Death proves instrumental to Sam and Dean's fight against Lucifer in season 5. At their meeting in the pizzeria, Death reveals to Dean that he is much older than the universe itself and perhaps even older than God. This is a pivotal point in the season as Sam and Dean are gearing up for their showdown with the Devil. Dean first approaches with Death's scythe, which can reap any creature, in hopes of coercing Death to give up the ring, and Death makes the scythe disappear and reappear in his hand to a visibly shaken Dean. In the Supernatural mid-season finale of season 6, Dean seeks Death's help to restore Sam's soul from Lucifer's cage. Dean visits a colleague of his father's named Dr. Robert. He knows the only way to get a face-to-face meeting with Death at this point is if he does. Dr. Robert agrees to stop his heart and warns Dean that he has only about 3 minutes to conduct his business before the situation turns dire. Death seems amused yet entertains Dean's proposal to rescue Sam's soul from Hell, under one condition. Death's counteroffer is that Dean must take over his role for 24 hours. To teach Dean a lesson about the delicate nature of the circle of life and how upsetting it can have catastrophic results, he wanted Dean to see things from his perspective. The result is Dean realizing what a burden it is to bear Death's responsibility, and just how quickly things can go awry by deciding to save only one life that is destined to die. They're aware that a spell exists to bind Death to do their bidding because Lucifer could do so before the apocalypse. Crowley warns them they are playing with deadly forces, but ultimately gives them the scroll that lists the spells' ingredients. He is not happy at this turn of events. Castiel appears after the spell and threatens to kill them, but Dean says that is impossible since they have Death under control. This leads to Castiel breaking the spell, and a war of words ensues between the new "God" and Death. Death gets over his anger at the Winchesters, becoming increasingly annoyed by Castiel's arrogance. This is a key point in establishing the future villains of season 7, as Death warns Castiel that there are things older than souls in Purgatory, hinting at the presence of the Leviathans. His body is broken, and all the angels have fallen from Heaven because of Metatron's spell. Dean is searching for answers on how to save his brother, as Sam is unconscious in the hospital. Ezekiel offers to try and heal Sam before they are overrun by angels at their position. Dean enters Sam's psyche with help from the angel Ezekiel and pleads with him not to go with Death, ultimately tricking him into agreeing to allow Ezekiel to enter his body. Sam's choice not to go with Death and allow Ezekiel to heal him sets up the storyline for the entirety of Season 9 of Supernatural, as Sam and Dean become at odds after Sam discovers he was tricked into being possessed by an angel. Most of the season sees Dean struggle with the Mark of Cain and becoming prone to ever-increasing violent outbursts. He isolates himself from Sam and Castiel as they search for options to remove the Mark of Cain from him, deciding that using Rowena's Book of the Damned is their best option. The CW's Supernatural took fans on a ride for 15 seasons. With various complex plot devices and storylines, some aspects of the show remain a bit odd. Unfortunately for Dean, Death says that not even he can kill him because the Mark requires a host, as it houses a primordial being known as The Darkness. Sam finds Dean, and a brutal fight ensues. Dean killing Death is significant as now there must be a new Death, and since the Mark of Cain is removed without transferring hosts, Amara is unleashed, setting the primary antagonist for the following season. Billie was a reaper under the original Death's reign. She appears in the second episode of season 11, "Form and Void." She is singing the song "O' Death," which plays during the first on-screen appearance of Death in season 5. This hints at her eventual resurrection as Death in season 13. Billie, the reaper, is killed by Castiel in Season 12 to free the Winchesters from a blood oath they took from Billie. The episode begins as a typical monster-of-the-week Supernatural special. Sam and Dean investigate a haunted sanatorium where two boys were attacked and discover the ghost of an evil doctor still haunts the building, keeping the ghosts of his former patients hostage. To find the bodies of the ghosts and set their spirits free, Dean injects himself with medication to stop his heart. He then encounters Billie in her new job as Death. She informs him that now is not his time to die and that he and Sam have a lot of work to do. This establishes Billie as a major player, as she now has access to all of death's powers and abilities. Rowena is on a rampage as she's traveling through the northwest and murdering the upper management of major pharmaceutical companies. Jessica, a reaper assigned to spy on Sam and Dean by Death, tells them she is upsetting the natural balance of the universe by killing people before their time is due, and this can have cosmic consequences. Rowena reveals to Sam and Dean that she is trying to get Death's attention by killing her reapers. Billie is not the Death of old, who almost found it amusing for people to return from the dead. Billie appears before Rowena, and the witch attacks her with all of her magic, but it does nothing to Death. Billie takes pity on Rowena and tells her she has changed for the better, and sometimes people lose things they can't get back. This marks a major turning point for Rowena as a character, and she aids Sam and Dean in their fight against the apocalyptic world of angels. The multiverse version of the Archangel Michael has trapped Dean inside his head, placating him with false visions. Dean thinks he owns a bar and continues living out this loop day after day, while Michael uses his body to take over the world. Outside, Sam, Castiel, Jack, and a group of hunters gather to fight off Michael's monsters and attempt to free Dean from his mental prison. Sam decides upon an experimental device found within the Men of Letters headquarters that will allow him and Castiel to enter Dean's mind and convince him to expel Michael. As Sam and Castiel struggle to convince Dean he is living in an illusion, the monsters created by Michael attack the secret bunker. They can eventually lock Michael inside of Dean's head. She informs him that his various death books in her library now all end the same, with Michael breaking from his prison and ending the world. The only other option is for Dean to lock himself and Michael in a magical device called a Ma'lak Box, designed to hold archangels. This sets up their brief conflict with Jack and eventually God. In the season 14 finale, Jack is unintentionally causing a worldwide catastrophe. These events force Chuck to appear and interfere, claiming Jack is a big problem. Dean wants to kill Jack, while Sam and Castiel are torn. Chuck fashions a gun that he says is the only way to defeat Jack, but the catch is that it will also kill whoever shoots it. In Supernatural, Chuck does not fear much, considering he is God. However, Sam can detect that there is a hint of fear present when it comes to Jack. This episode marks the veil of Chuck's true intentions being lifted. This angers Chuck, and he kills Jack himself, without the gun, proving he was lying about it being the only way. Jack wakes up in The Empty, and Death appears to him. Sam is captured by Chuck so that he can examine the mysterious wound that ties them to each other and him to this version of Earth. Meanwhile, Dean and Castiel learn from Michael that there is a spell capable of trapping God, however, one requirement is a Leviathan Blossom, which only blooms in Purgatory. Dean and Castiel set out to find the plant while Sam is tortured by Chuck. Unbeknownst to Sam, the true reason his connection to God via the gunshot wound will not heal is because he still has hope that they can defeat Chuck. Chuck cooks up a plan to show Sam an alternate future where they defeat Chuck, and the world is in dire straits. Monsters rule, and the Winchesters become vampires as all of their loved ones are killed. As Dean and Castiel arrive from their adventure in Purgatory, it is too late, and Chuck easily destroys the magical bomb they crafted for him. Billie was clever in waiting to return Jack from The Empty as Chuck was tied to their world. Death is instrumental in the true plan to defeat God.

A new report suggests that when the SkyDance Media and Paramount merger finalizes, the new company will make a massive mistake with Star Trek.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Patriots head coach Bill Belichick still has a lot of explaining to do regarding some of the mystifying decisions he made during his lengthy tenure coaching the team. More often than not, when a controversy unfolds — in everyday life or even in the wide, wide world of sports — eventually the truth will come out, and folks will be able to say, “Ahhhh — that kind of makes sense.” But there are several sports mysteries on the Boston sports landscape that, to this day, months, years, perhaps even decades later, we still don't have sufficient answers for. Chris Young's column appears in The Sun Chronicle's Weekend Edition. He can be reached at ballparkfigures@comcast.net and on Twitter (X) at @kidjohnson if you have any real answers to these mystifying questions among the five Boston-area sports teams.
