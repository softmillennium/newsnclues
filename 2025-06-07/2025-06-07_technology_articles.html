When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. According to NPR, most ATC towers and other facilities today feel like they're stuck in the 20th century, with controllers using paper strips and floppy disks to transfer data, while their computers run Windows 95. No more floppy disks or paper strips,” acting FAA administrator Chris Rocheleau told the House Appropriations Committee last Wednesday. The aviation industry put up a coalition pushing for ATC modernization called Modern Skies, and it even ran an ad telling us that ATC is still using floppy disks and several older technologies to keep our skies safe. Unfortunately, upgrading the ATC system isn't as simple as popping into your nearby Micro Center and buying the latest and greatest gaming PC. First and foremost, some systems can never be shut down because it is crucial for safety. Because of this, you can't just switch off one site to swap out ancient components for newer ones. Aside from that, the upgrades to this critical infrastructure should be resistant to hacking and other vulnerabilities, as even a single breach could cripple the nation, costing time, money, and lives. The FAA is pouring a lot of money into maintaining its old ATC systems, as they have to keep running 24/7. Nevertheless, age will eventually catch up no matter how much repair, upkeep, or overhaul you do. Currently, the White House hasn't said what this update will cost. It also announced several ‘Industry Days' so companies can pitch their tech and ideas to the Transportation Department. However, industry experts say this timeline is unrealistic. No matter how long it takes, it's high time that the FAA upgrades the U.S.'s ATC system today after decades of neglect. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

A developer has dusted off an almost 20-year-old software project for burning visual artwork onto the data recording surface (the bottom) of a Compact Disc. However, please note that this technique will make your Compact Disc into artwork, nothing more. This is because the process burns an ‘audio track' as the visual app's output, meaning there's no room left for files, archives, or anything else you may care to store on a CD in 2025. Arduinocelentano is the first to admit that this project is based on prior works by fellow hobbyist developers like argon and unDEFER. Actually, it is argon, who published their Instructables post around 18 years ago, who provides the clearest insight into the underlying technology here. In brief, “By carefully choosing the right 1s and 0s to burn to a CD, it is possible to burn visible images on normal CD-Rs.” Check out that link for more technical insight into how creating pictures on garden-variety CDs is possible. Many optical media users in previous decades will have noticed that it was sometimes possible to see if a blank disc had any data written to it because the uniform reflective surface changed after writing. These visual writing techniques rely on the same phenomenon for their artistic tricks. The tool from arduinocelentano actually notes that “If your Compact Disc is not mentioned in the track generating dialog, you'll probably fail”—and only four discs have been profiled for imaging due to the time/effort required to create accurate new calibration data. We downloaded and tested the tool from arduinocelentano. Basically, it is used for just two things: loading an image and creating the ‘audio track' data with the specially formed arrays of 1s and 0s that you will burn to a CD (as an audio CD) using your current tool of choice. The main window shows a blank CD workspace. Users open an image file from the Edit menu (jpg, png and xpm images are supported).

There are geometry presets for four types/brands of CD-RW (rewritable) media: two from Verbatim, one from TDK, and another ePerformance-branded disc. Tom's Hardware looked closely at technologies such as Lightscribe and LabelFlash in 2006; you can dive into an 11-page feature via that link. CDs and DVDs were popular during this era, so appropriate media with the scribe/flash surface was quite widely available. In 2008, I even wrote a couple of articles about using﻿ Lightscribe, providing some grayscale test print calibration images to help readers. Some people preferred their optical media with a plain white ink-jet printable reverse. That was faster and easier to print with an ink-jet equipped with the correct feed system, but output could be easily smudged at a later date. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

Gaming hardware company Zotac, known for its graphics cards, mini-PCs, and gaming handheld consoles, just launched a new product line designed for gamers. Zotac first released an April Fool's post about this fragrance earlier this year on the Zotac news page, saying that the fragrance uses a “proprietary blend of caffeine, taurine, and other secret ingredients.” It also listed what F5 smells like — a combination of sea breeze, cypress, mint, and white musk, delivering an aquatic and woody scent. We're unsure if the details on this page are still accurate, but one of our teammates here at Tom's Hardware got their hands on it during Computex 2025. According to them, the fragrance smells sweet and is suitable for everyone. Its top note lasts about 30 minutes, while the heart or body notes stay on for another half hour. Its base note stays on the longest, but according to our experience, the scent sticks around for just a couple of hours, at best. This isn't the first time a PC gaming company has dabbled in olfactory accessories. It then followed this up with an aromatic wireless mouse to keep your hand and workstation smelling fresh. If you're into gaming but want to smell something nice coming from your GPU instead of melting plastic, you can choose some of Yeston's Radeon RTX 9070 XT models, which come with a fragrance module in their shroud. HKEPC says that the fragrance is in open beta, and you need to apply by June 13 to try on this unique gaming accessory. After all, we also want to check out the other scents listed on its page, like Ctrl+Alt+Scent, Critical Hit, and GG. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

A user on X posted a blurry image they claim to be the next Bambu Lab 3D printer, leaked from WeChat on June 4th (expand the above tweet to see the image). Internet gurus immediately began the time-honored sport of image dissection to determine the type of printer that had been leaked. When the H2D leaked in March 2025, we did not report on it because Tom's Hardware was under embargo and already had the H2D in our workshop. This time around, there is no embargo, because we haven't been told of the next release yet. Nothing is alarming about this chain of events, as we saw it happen with the P1P, Bambu Lab's budget follow-up to the X1 Carbon in 2022. It was released without fanfare, and only a few units were sent to reviewers before the announcement. I recently spoke with one of Bambu Lab's PR people for a brief catch-up call to see how I liked the H2D's laser after spending more time with it. We also spoke of new filament lines, the successful launch of Bambu's CyberBrick modular RC vehicles, and new tools coming to MakerLab. When I asked if there was a new printer in the pipeline, she shrugged it off. There are always more printers coming out later. Bambu Lab is clearly determined to dominate the 3D printing landscape, with offerings for both home and business users at several price points. Since we don't have any insider information, let's take a look at the leaked photo together. First, we can see that this is a single-nozzle machine, with the same yellow rotating extruder wheel as the A1 behind a similar bubble window on the tool head shroud. What we can see of the nozzle and fans looks very much like an H2D tool head with a single nozzle. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Finally, there is a faint white timestamp in the lower right corner: 2025.04.2? Here is a photo of the Tom's Hardware H2D Laser Combo for comparison. The P1 line of printers shares the same print quality due to its use of the same build volume, motion system, and hotend; however, it is more affordable due to a simpler user interface. The photo would seem to back this up. There is no green tint to the window, suggesting a non-laser model. Other details are obscured or confusing: is there a poop chute? We hope so, as a cheaper H2D with only one color would be absurd. Is it hiding an attachment point for a cutter and plotter? Does it have the same build width? Although the H2D already has a less expensive model that ships without an AMS for $1,999, it's a far cry from the $549 P1P. A larger, less expensive 3D printer (perhaps an H1D or P1D) without any possible way to attach a laser could be just the printer the market is looking for.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kit costs 9,999 Alienware Reward Points (ARP), which you can earn via the firm's community app. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Alienware has added a tiny NUC-sized PC to its roster and is selling it to its app users for 9,999 ARP (Alienware Reward Points). This Alienware desktop PC replica construction set includes 318 "authentic Lego bricks." Of course, this model is designed to stand on one side as a tower, just like the Alienware Area-51 Desktop that inspired it. We see the tower with and without its side window in place. Both those examples were unmistakable chassis shapes, even at a distance. Another criticism is that we feel this is somewhere a little actual RGB LED lighting might have made a nice difference. The kit is built to be an ornament, after all. Or, perhaps someone could work on this kit to include RGB, and even some degree of PC functionality... Alienware has shoved it in the ARP Marketplace, where customers spend loyalty points on Alienware merchandise like keychains, stickers, and socks. You even gain ARP drops through daily log-ins, browsing time, and quests. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. How long it would take to gather 9,999 ARP is probably somewhat variable, but hopefully, people interested in Alienware and Lego might already have collections of this digital resource. Alienware says it wants a high redemption rate for this new Lego kit. We are seeing increasing numbers of Lego and semiconductor industry crossovers. Last December, we reported on the fantastic ASML TWINSCAN EXE:5000 Lego set. This was officially described as a "masterpiece in technology" but came with a prohibitive sticker price at $228, and was an employee exclusive, sadly. This year, we also saw Oxford Toys and SK hynix release a model allowing plastic brick construction fans to build their own Package and Test facility. SK hynix's set seemed to be on offer, advertised at under $30 equivalent in Korean currency, when it surfaced on social media. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Bing has added a new AI-powered video generation tool to its mobile app, that's built on OpenAI's Sora text-to-video model. The vertical video creations are 5 seconds long but aren't generated instantly—once you type in a prompt, you'll get a notification when the video is ready. The Standard generation speed is free, but you'll also be able to access the “Fast” option 10 times before you'll need to cough up 100 Microsoft Reward points to keep using it at that speed. You can share these videos anywhere, and they'll be stored in the Bing app for 90 days. Chinese phone brand Honor also recently partnered with Google to add a feature that converted still images in the Gallery app into 5-second video clips through Google's Veo 2 model. London-based Nothing took a year-long break from its top-end smartphone line after it debuted the Phone (2) in 2023. The company announced this week that it will unveil the Phone (3) at an event in London on July 1 at 1 pm ET. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. The company says it'll be its first true flagship phone with premium materials, and it'll have a high price to boot: somewhere around £800. But the spotlight won't just be on a new phone. This week, Nothing also shared that it will be entering “a new product category" at the event with its first-ever pair of headphones. Creatively dubbed Headphone (1), it'll be Nothing's first over-ears, but follows a long line of wireless earbuds. Not too long ago, Nothing announced a partnership with iconic audio brand KEF. Perhaps these headphones will be the pair's first collab. Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event is also expected to take place in July, and rumors abound that we'll see the Galaxy Z Fold7, Galaxy Z Flip7, and even a Flip 7 FE—a cheaper version of the company's flip folding phone. But Samsung took time to tease something else: an Ultra variant of its folding phone. What remains unclear is if the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold7 will offer an Ultra-like experience with no compromises, or if there will indeed be a dedicated Ultra version of that phone. There have been rumors that Samsung is working on a tri-fold phone, like Huawei's version that nets you an even bigger screen when unfolded; you'd think if anything got the Ultra moniker, it'd be that device. The Ruark MR1 have been some of the best sounding, most stylish desktop stereo speakers you can buy at their price for over a decade. Now in their third generation, they have been rebuilt from the ground up, with the aim of improving sound quality, refining the hand-crafted design and adding in some great new features to make them even more versatile than before. You can download the public beta for Android today. The mobile app has nearly everything you'll find in Adobe's desktop version, including layer-based editing and tools like masks, clone stamp, intelligent selection options, and all the tone and curve adjustment tools. I've been testing the Android app for a couple of days now, and it's fairly impressive, but a few things are missing. The biggest for me is the ability to crop by pixels rather than ratio, which seems like a very odd limitation. Adobe has been heavily touting the AI features, which make it possible to do smart selections that would be difficult otherwise. I've found this feature works like on desktop (it relies on the same cloud backend), but I still don't have much use for it. "Throw your laptop out the damn window and drag that 1994 Kawasaki 750SX stand-up jet ski out of Uncle Pete's garage, because summer is officially here." This is how Poolsuite, possibly the finest curated music app for outdoor frivolity, announces the arrival this week not only of a throughly revamped and upgraded version of its already superb iOS media player, but also that it's finally available on Android as well. This perfectly judged throwback tone pervades throughout the app, which now adds hundreds of new tracks across seven channels, as well as mobile mixtapes to go with the aesthetic overhaul. Sun-drenched playlists lovingly curated to lift spirits and deliver virtual vitamin D for free. If you haven't downloaded it already, do so right now—and never worry about what tunes to play at a BBQ ever again. Continuing the summer theme in style is this new limited edition beach-ready Big Bang from Hublot. “As light as a sea breeze with its featherlight ceramic,” says the brand, with a micro blasted “orange case that glows like the golden hour.” Well, I tried it on at Watches & Wonders in April, and unlike some other darker hued versions of this watch, it's playful and thoroughly approachable, yet with 100 meters of water resistance is equally at home either at a pool party or in deep waters. A one-click system also allows the included three interchangeable white rubber-lined straps in sky blue, dark blue or orange to be swapped in a jiffy, and the 72-hour power reserve keeps things going when off the wrist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indian grocery delivery startup KiranaPro's recent data loss story has more holes than Swiss cheese, as the startup remains unclear whether the incident was an internal breach or an external hack. We are going to talk [about] this with our board, the investors, and we are going to get a formal opinion on that also with our legal advisers,” Ravindran told TechCrunch. Earlier on Friday, Ravindran claimed in a post on X that the incident that affected its data was an internal breach. “After careful investigation, we conclude that this was not a hack. Specifically, it was the result of actions taken by a trusted internal employee who had legitimate access to our systems,” the co-founder wrote in his post on Friday. When TechCrunch asked if KiranaPro could rule out whether any third party had maliciously gained access to the former employee's account, Ravindran could not. “We have to do a complete forensic check on the company. We have to look at where the tracks happened. We have to check the computers, MacBooks, and whatever is used. We haven't done the investigation further,” Ravindran told TechCrunch. Launched in late 2024, KiranaPro operates as a buyer app on the Indian government's Open Network for Digital Commerce. The startup allows more than 55,000 customers in 50 cities to purchase groceries from their local shops and nearby supermarkets using its voice-based interface. The company also supports local language inputs, including English, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil. However, the startup said it is not aware if there were enough protections on the former employee's devices, such as multi-factor authentication, to restrict malicious third-party access, like malware. “Employee offboarding was not being handled properly because there was no full-time HR,” KiranaPro's chief technology officer, Saurav Kumar, confirmed to TechCrunch. Ravindran told TechCrunch that the GitHub data was restored after getting its backup from one of their employees. Nonetheless, Ravindran claimed that the customer data stored in the AWS cloud remained intact and was not accessed by any third parties, nor was it downloaded by the former employee in question. “Because if that is the case, I will get its notification on email or anything [sic],” he said. The startup has also not fully paid its current employees, the company's co-founder confirmed, soon after the company raised a seed round of ₹100 million Indian rupees (about $1.2 million), which Ravindran said has yet to be fully wired. The startup counts Blume Ventures, Unpopular Ventures, and Turbostart among its institutional venture backers, as well as Olympic medalist PV Sindhu and Boston Consulting Group managing director Vikas Taneja among its angel investors. It has 15 employees located in Bengaluru and Kerala.
