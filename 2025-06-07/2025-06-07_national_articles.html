Inspired Taste's homemade pasta recipe is perfect for home cooks of all levels, even beginners. Chefs Joanne and Alex Gallagher use fresh egg pasta dough for spaghetti, fettuccine, pappardelle, capellini and even lasagna sheets. From spaghetti lovers to penne passion, America's pasta preference reveals a carb-loaded culture clash across state lines. A study conducted by Inspired Taste aimed to uncover America's wide range of pasta favorites – namely, each state's favorite pasta shape. In doing so, it found unexpected regional preferences and nationwide outliers. Penne trails spaghetti by a thin margin. It's the top contender in states like Washington and Oregon. "What surprised me the most was just how close the race was between spaghetti and penne, which only had a 1% difference," Joanne Gallagher, recipe creator and co-founder of Inspired Taste in Walla Walla, Washington, told Fox News Digital. "It shows how deeply people take their pasta choices." "It shows how deeply people take their pasta choices," Joanne Gallagher, recipe creator and co-founder of Inspired Taste, told Fox News Digital. Even though elbows are the fourth-most popular pasta shape nationally, not a single state picked it as its favorite. Arizona stands out as the biggest penne lover, with 50% of residents favoring it – higher than any other state's penne preference. Penne is the second-most loved pasta shape in America, just behind spaghetti. Though not leading nationally, fettuccine dominates California at 33%. Hawaii and New Mexico are the only states to favor angel hair pasta, or capellini. South Dakota, Alaska and Montana are the only states to choose rotini – a swirly, long pasta – as their top choice. Orzo and angel hair are tied for least-loved, with 18% of respondents calling them their least favorite. "Everyone has a pasta shape that speaks to them, and that's what makes pasta so fun to cook with," Gallagher said. Khloe Quill is a lifestyle production assistant with Fox News Digital.

This image provided by John Porcellino shows “The Weight of my Bones” by John Porcellino, part of his King-Cat Comics and Stories, his long-running series that reflects the author's Zen practice. This image provided by John Porcellino shows “Non-thinking” by John Porcellino is part of his King-Cat Comics and Stories, a long-running series that reflects the author's Zen practice. Vishavjit Singh looked at the boy who uttered those words, and then he looked at himself — a skinny, bespectacled, turbaned, bearded Sikh in a Captain America suit. “I wasn't offended, because I knew that this kid was going to have this image of me, a Sikh Captain America, forever in his mind,” Singh said. Representation of non-Abrahamic religions and spiritual traditions, particularly in the mainstream comics universe, is minimal. Even when they are portrayed in comics, their presentation, as Singh and others in the field point out, is often inauthentic and sometimes negative. Recently, however, comic book writers and academics who study the intersection of religion and comics observe a renaissance of sorts, which they say is happening because people close to these faith traditions are telling these stories with a reverence and sincerity that resonate with a wider audience. Singh's journey to make that connection began after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, triggered anti-Sikh hate incidents. Having faced hate and exclusion throughout his life, he decided to spread his message of kindness and inclusion by capitalizing on the appeal of comics and superheroes — an area where he found Sikh representation to be “virtually zero.” He suited up as Captain Sikh America in Manhattan for the first time in summer 2013 — one year after a self-proclaimed white supremacist opened fire inside a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six and injuring four others. A couple wanted me to be part of their wedding ceremony. He doesn't speak directly about religion but rather the core values of Sikhism. Marvel's Black Panther heralded better representation for Africana religions in the U.S., according to Yvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. For example, one page might talk about the Orishas, divine spirits that play a key role in the Yoruba faith of West Africa, while another might feature Egyptian gods. One of the first superheroes with African religious roots, Chireau said, was Brother Voodoo, created in the 1970s by Marvel publisher Stan Lee, writer Len Wein and artist John Romita. The turn of the last century was a time of revival for Black-centric comics, she said, adding that immigration from African and Caribbean countries, including Haiti, led to increased understanding of religious practices originating in those places. “It's definitely gotten a lot better and much more authentic because the people who are telling these stories care about those religious practices,” she said. Brooklyn-born Haitian American comic book writer Greg Anderson Elysée said he didn't learn about African and Caribbean religious traditions until he was a teenager. Elysée was raised Catholic, but he now considers himself agnostic. Common depictions of African faith as voodoo and witchcraft are colonialist narratives aimed at demonizing Indigenous spiritual practices, he added. When we know who we are — whether you believe in the religion or not — it fills you with joy, a purpose and a sense of being.” Elysée is excited and relieved by the reaction to his work. “While this is entertainment, you also don't want to offend those who believe in it and truly get so much power from it,” he said. Porcellino was drawn to Buddhism in his 20s after what he describes as a period of intense mental suffering and health problems. As a punk rock fan, Porcellino saw commonalities between punk and Zen because “they are both concerned with the essence of things rather than appearances.” Both are ways of life — simple yet nuanced. He gave the example of a wordless story titled “October,” featured in King-Cat's 30th issue, that shows him as a high school student walking home one night from school. Porcellino views these comics as a healing presence in his life. “They are an important part of my spiritual practice,” he said. Robeson liked the idea of representing a religion and culture that do not get much attention in media. “Children's books are like mirrors and windows for kids,” she said. “It's helpful especially for children of immigrants who don't often see themselves in mainstream literature. At the same time, it also helps kids who are not Asian or Buddhist to learn something about those communities.” Amar Chitra Katha was a comic book company started by the late Anant Pai in Mumbai in 1967 as a way to teach Indian children about their own mythology and culture. Pai was an engineer turned comic books seller who used varied marketing techniques, including walking around with planks, nails and hammers in his bag so he could build shelves for bookstores that refused to display his comics because they lacked shelf space, said Reena I. Puri, the company's executive editor and a 35-year veteran of the business. “Most recently we've also portrayed (Indigenous) religions and have gathered folktales relating to these traditions from all over India,” she said. “We've educated ourselves and realized that our ancient texts were not as racist or colorist as we may be today,” she said. British comic book writer Mike Carey is known for his 2000-2006 DC Comics series “Lucifer,” which depicts the titular character's adventures on Earth, in Heaven and in various realms after abandoning Hell. Carey counts himself an atheist who went to Sunday school only “for the fun, stories and chocolate.” Carey delved into the concepts of faith, God and morality in a series titled “My Faith in Frankie,” which tells the story of a teenager with a personal god called Jeriven who gets jealous of her boyfriend. Even though many of his comics and novels explore religion and ethics, Carey said, he has never “felt any temptation whatsoever to believe.” “I've become more and more entrenched in that position, because organized religions are like any organization that sustain themselves, amass power, wealth and authority,” he said. This story has been updated to correct that Reena Puri's title is executive editor, not managing director.</p>

Fox 10's Kenzie Beach reported on two teenagers who were found dead in Tonto National Forest. High school students Pandora Kjolsrud and Evan Clark were found dead in a remote area of Arizona on May 27, marking the second and third teenagers found dead in Tonto National Forest since February. Kjolsrud, 18, and Clark, 17, were both found shot to death on May 27 near Mount Ord in the Tonto National Forest, north of Mesa, Arizona. A spokesperson for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office told Fox News Digital that the deaths are being investigated as homicides. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said it's "actively" investigating the deaths, but didn't release additional details. According to Fox 10, the Arcadia High School students were on a camping trip when they were found shot to death. She went missing from a group home in January, according to Fox 10, which reported her death was treated as a homicide. Her body was found dismembered more than 70 miles away from the group home she was reported missing from. 18-year-old Pandora Kjolsrud and 17-year-old Evan Clark were found dead inside Tonto National Forest. No arrests have been made in connection with Pike's death. The FBI and several local law enforcement agencies are investigating her death. There has not been any connection made between the two cases, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. A GoFundme for Kjolsrud's family says the 18-year-old "had a vivacious personality with an infectious smile that brought joy to so many." "She was a beautiful human being and a bright light in this world who loved every single person she met and had a unique ability to make every person feel special," the GoFundme stated. "He was funny, bright, kind and entrepreneurial. A community member who spoke with Fox 10 said she wants answers about Kjolsrud and Clark's deaths. That's the next thing you think about.

The Progressive group "Indivisible," which was behind many of the Tesla protests in recent months as well as mobilizing for other far-left causes, appears to now be getting involved in a key congressional swing district with the goal of growing resistance against President Donald Trump in Congress. With primary races already underway for the 2026 Midterm elections, the group appears to have in their sights Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican in a critical swing state representing New York's 17th District, in the form of a candidate with extensive ties to the group, progressive Democrat and Rockland County legislator Beth Davidson. Davidson's social media presence includes several posts promoting Indivisible, including attending an event in June in Rockland, New York and Davidson was featured in a promotional video for Indivisible Northern Westchester that same month. Indivisible has been front and center in other aspects of the race and local chapters of the group helped to organize protests at Lawler town hall events in April and May. NY Dem congressional candidate Beth Davidson has been a vocal supporter of Indivisible, a group known for disrupting town halls and Tesla dealerships (Getty/Davidson campaign website) "It is a long street, and we're trying to fill the entire street, so everyone coming into the rally will see people there and recognize it's not going to be all, like, sunshine and daisies," Jean-Gilles said. Ahead of the event, Davidson indicated that over a thousand protesters would attend the demonstration, saying on X: "Please pass him a note that 1100 or so of his ‘friends' are excited to see him in my county legislative district tomorrow!" At another Indivisible protest against Lawler earlier in the month, Davidson posted on X that she was "proud to stand with more than a thousand people at the #HandsOff rally organized by @IndivisWstchr @1199seiu @nwindivisible@cwaunion and more to stand up for our freedoms and our future!" "Mike Lawler may be silent on the daily assaults on healthcare, education, social security and national security, but We the People are NOT!" Former President Donald Trump headlines a National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) fundraising dinner, in Tampa, Florida on Nov. 8, 2021 (National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC)) Davidson congratulated Indivisible Rockland for a "packed event" in April 2025 after speaking at one of their events a month earlier, accusing Lawler of hiding from his constituents. Bill Batson, a member of the Indivisible Rockland steering committee, gave $250 to Davidson's campaign via his own campaign committee, FEC records show. In response to Indivisible and Davidson's apparent collaboration, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Maureen O'Toole accused the group of "infiltrating" congressional races to undermine Trump's agenda. "Indivisible has a new plan: Stop shouting outside congressional offices and start infiltrating them," said O'Toole. NY-17, where they're backing far-left extremist Beth Davidson to carry out their agenda." The group's website says that they were "brought together by a practical guide to resist the Trump agenda, Indivisible is a movement of thousands of group leaders and more than a million members taking regular, iterative, and increasingly complex actions to resist the GOPs agenda, elect local champions, and fight for progressive policies." Indivisible's presence at Tesla protests nationwide, according to a Washington Free Beacon report, included a "reimbursement program" for local activists that showed up at the protests. Indivisible, a group that has received more than $7 million from the George Soros network since 2017, according to the New York Post, has also been involved in protests calling to "abolish" ICE. Earlier this year, Indivisible published a "tool kit" with recommendations for protesting at town halls and lawmakers' district offices. A section on how to "take the fight to Elon" includes steps for planning and executing a demonstration at Tesla dealerships, showrooms and factories for Elon Musk's role as then-head of the Department of Government Efficiency. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Lawler campaign spokesperson Chris Russell, called Davidson's association with Indivisible "disgraceful." "They've had Nazi imagery and antisemitic tropes at their rallies and promoted a baseless election denialism conspiracy theory rooted in antisemitism on their website. I'm demanding she denounce them immediately, this dangerous rhetoric will lead to more violence and threatens our democracy." With primary races already underway for the 2026 Midterm elections, Indivisible appears to have in its sights Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican in a critical swing state, New York congressional district 17. I will always be a voice against anti-Semitism and for my Jewish community. It's time for Mike Lawler to stop weaponizing antisemitism for his own political gain and stop using the Jewish community — my community, not his — as political pawns." Lawler responded on X making the case that Davidson's statement did not go far enough. Fox News Digital reached out to the Davidson campaign for comment on this story. Davidson has been endorsed by Mondaire Jones, a progressive who is the last Democrat to hold Lawler's seat. Fox News Digital's Liz Elkind contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice President JD Vance was unexpectedly tasked with reacting in real time to Elon Musk‘s social media meltdown while recording a podcast. This kind of happened on the plane when I was coming down here.” After clearing the air about the timeline, Vance quickly denied that Trump was actually in the Epstein files and gave a nuanced take on Musk, who had been one of Trump's closest allies during the first four months of his term and frequently flew with him on Air Force One. “I'm always going to be be loyal to the president, and I hope that eventually Elon kind of comes back into the fold. Maybe that's not possible now, because he's gone so nuclear. A few minutes later, the vice president was shown a Musk post suggesting Trump should be impeached — with Vance replacing him. Yet Vance remained diplomatic throughout, suggesting that Musk has been a huge benefit to the Trump administration and could be again in the future. “The president doesn't think that he needs to be in a blood feud with Elon Musk,” Vance said. “And I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine.” Vance first weighed in on the conflict Thursday night with an X post, saying, “President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads. He also alluded to the Musk fight with a joke about his podcast appearance. “Slow news day, what are we even going to talk about? Slow news day, what are we even going to talk about? According to a source familiar with the matter, Vance was with Trump when the Musk fight started to get out of hand, and Vance spoke with Trump multiple times throughout the day. Trump himself went on Von's podcast last year, and the former MTV star has remained in the administration's orbit ever since. Von attended Trump's inauguration and joined the president in Qatar to visit American troops a few weeks ago. Vance also went on Von's podcast last October. Von and Vance hit a very wide range of issues, including whether or not Frederick Douglas could have been gay, which side of the Civil War Vance's ancestors fought for, and whether or not the disgraced early '90s group Milli Vanilli really sang its own songs. Vance said that he was a Milli Vanilli “truther.” But other serious fare came up as well, including when Von opined that Israel's military actions in Gaza constitute a genocide. “I don't think that the Israelis are purposely trying to go in and murder every Palestinian,” Vance said. Still, he added that if you have a soul, your heart should break seeing any innocent child killed and stressed that Trump is trying to find a peaceful way to end the conflict. How Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill' would affect Musk and Tesla Toward the end, Von pulled out one last twist, saying that he would soon host Gov.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's court wins, trade successes, and unexpectedly positive jobs report were being overshadowed by his rant against top corporate ally-turned budget critic Elon Musk. And as usual, Trump took the bait and the two exploded their social media with attacks on each other. But a day later, something that Trump fans have long waited to see happened. Pressed on Air Force One Friday to whack Musk, Trump chose the presidential path and said, “I just wish him well.” President Donald Trump told reporters Friday on Air Force One that he has been so busy working on foreign policy that he has not had time to think about Elon Musk after his feud with the billionaire. We'll see if a truce is in the works, but our friend and author Tevi Troy said he expects the two to make nice, just like they have in the past after public spats. This means that both sides ultimately have an interest in accommodation rather than conflict,” Troy told Secrets Friday. Our graders, Democratic pollster John Zogby and conservative analyst Jed Babbin, were entertained by the public fight but also found more significant issues to focus on. The two men characterized by narcissism and unprecedented hyperbole appear to be basically right about their charges against each other. I will probably be writing more about this next week so I will hold for now but thus far Elon Musk is angry that his $300 million investment in President Donald Trump and all things GOP has proven to be a colossal waste because the “big, beautiful bill” Trump is promoting doesn't reflect his principles and ideas. Trump, for his part, is riled because his investments in Musk Inc. in the form of government largesse have not produced the undying loyalty that is required. However, more Americans, 7.24 million, are unemployed today — the largest since 2017. In addition to frothing at Musk, the president is attacking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, former buddy Vladimir Putin, and The Boss, Bruce Springsteen (that is redundant!). The administration is now privately admitting that too many federal employees were fired. Is this any way to run a circus? The president won a 9-0 Supreme Court case putting another nail in DEI and his polling numbers remain unchanged. It was another good week for President Donald Trump. There was some progress on the massive budget reconciliation bill, Trump put a travel ban on a dozen countries and his war with the Ivy League colleges continued. And then there was his personal feud with Elon Musk. “Progress” on the reconciliation bill was both positive and negative, with Republicans' slim majorities in both houses of Congress magnifying every dissenter's impact. Trump wants to eliminate the statutory debt limit (which Congress raises often), and that didn't please fiscal conservatives. The new list includes Cuba, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Trump is definitely on the right side of this issue but there will, inevitably, be lawsuits. The Supreme Court is going to have to take up the question of whether individual judges can issue national bans on Trump's action. The two exchanged shots all week which is a fun diversion from the unpleasant tasks each of them face. Trump has made zero progress on peace in Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin or on his nuclear negotiations with Iran. Some day he'll learn that neither is going to produce any positive result and that both have to be dealt with in another, far more forceful way. And Trump is continuously helped by the Democrats' inability to say anything other than “orange man bad.” The latest fun is from former President Joe Biden, whose autopen exercises are at best suspect of manipulation. Biden issued a statement saying, “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false.” But as an old man with a bad memory — in the words of Special Counsel Robert Hur — how would Biden even know? His latest book is Beyond the Horse Race: How to Read Polls and Why We Should. Jed Babbin is a Washington Examiner contributor and former deputy undersecretary of defense in the administration of former President George H.W.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Martin says he has heard all kinds of concerns lately from people considering a visit to the United States. I think there is a worldwide fear about what is happening here,” said the Australian, who spoke to CNN recently while on an open-air bus tour of New York City. Along the way he says he's had lots of conversations with his fellow travelers about how the US' status as a magnet for tourists has changed. Eman Moretti, an Italian who is studying in the United States, said President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies have made him nervous about his family visiting him in New York. “With Trump it was a bit harder even for them to come,” said the student, flanked by his mother, father and his two brothers on a recent midday stroll through Times Square. “It was challenging, because you never know if people get in through customs. “Your visa could be canceled,” added Javier Muenala, visiting Times Square from Ecuador. “So it's a lot of risks that many people don't want to take.” Some of the nation's leading tourist destinations, including Orlando, Miami and Los Angeles, are bracing for how the decline will impact businesses that rely on spending from international travelers. The downturn is being felt especially hard in New York City, the nation's top destination for international travel. New York City Tourism + Conventions, the city's official marketing organization, has cut its forecast for international tourists in 2025 by 17%. Julie Coker, the group's CEO and president, told CNN the city is expected to host 2 million fewer international travelers this year than in 2024. “International tourism is extremely important to us because while it only makes up 20 percent of our total visitation, it accounts for 50 percent of our visitor spend. But there's recent evidence that some Canadians, offended by the political rhetoric coming from Washington, are boycotting the US. Tour operators such as Matt Levy, who has seen a slowdown in business, agrees. They're spending money in their own country, said Levy, owner of Spread Love Tours, which offers customized tours of New York for art lovers, foodies, families and other groups. Levy has been leading tours of the city for three years. He says much of his business relies on international tourism, especially Canadian student groups. But in recent months Levy says Canadian travel agents have told him their clients are avoiding the States because they're unnerved by threats of tariffs or turned off by Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st state. Levy said that if the political climate doesn't improve, business for him will likely be even worse in 2026. Next year is going to be vicious,” he said. “My three largest Canadian clients, all three of them told me universally (that) the PTA boards aren't going to let the kids come to America. Renée Rewiski has been a tour guide in New York City for more than a decade and says she has not seen numbers like this since the doldrums of the Covid-19 pandemic. “This time last year (we had) 20 people on the tour. We have five today,” Rewiski said on a recent day as she led a handful of tourists around lower Manhattan. Rewiski is a guide with Tours by Foot, which offers walking tours of such landmark New York neighborhoods as Brooklyn, Harlem and Greenwich Village. She worries that if something does not change soon, jobs could be at risk. I'm not sure how to change the attitudes, but just know people are losing their jobs in New York City (and) you're hurting the wrong people,” she said, addressing her comments to foreign tourists. Despite the recent headwinds, no one CNN spoke to in the New York travel industry says they're giving up. It's called, “With Love + Liberty, New York City.” Coker has a message for anyone thinking about visiting the Big Apple. “What we say to them is… New York City is open for business,” she says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Harvard University, elite law firms and perceived political enemies of President Donald Trump fight back against his efforts to use government power to punish them, they're winning thanks in part to the National Rifle Association. A year later, the court's decision in National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo has been cited repeatedly by federal judges in rulings striking down a series of executive orders that targeted law firms. Lawyers representing Harvard, faculty at Columbia University and others are also leaning on the decision in cases challenging Trump's attacks on them. For free speech advocates, the application of the NRA decision in cases pushing back against Trump's retribution campaign is a welcome sign that lower courts are applying key First Amendment principles equally, particularly in politically fraught disputes. The NRA's claims centered around a meeting Vullo had with an insurance market in 2018 in which the group says she offered to not prosecute other violations as long as the company helped with her campaign. “Some people have criticized free speech advocates as being naive for hoping that'll be the case, but hopefully that's what we're seeing now,” he added. The impact of Vullo can be seen most clearly in the cases challenging Trump's attempts to use executive power to exact revenge on law firms that have employed his perceived political enemies or represented clients who have challenged his initiatives. A central pillar of Trump's retribution crusade has been to pressure firms to bend to his political will, including through issuing executive orders targeting four major law firms: Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Susman Godfrey. (Other firms were hit with similar executive orders but they haven't taken Trump to court over them.) The judges all lifted Sotomayor's line about using “the power of the State to punish or suppress disfavored expression,” while also seizing on other language in her opinion to buttress their own decisions. Two of them – US district judges Beryl Howell, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Richard Leon, who was named to the bench by former President George W. Bush – incorporated Sotomayor's statement that government discrimination based on a speaker's viewpoint “is uniquely harmful to a free and democratic society.” The third judge, John Bates, said Vullo and an earlier Supreme Court case dealing with impermissible government coercion “govern – and defeat” the administration's arguments in defense of a section of the Jenner & Block order that sought to end all contractual relationships that might have allowed taxpayer dollars to flow to the firm. “Executive Order 14246 does precisely what the Supreme Court said just last year is forbidden: it engages in ‘coercion against a third party to achieve the suppression of disfavored speech,'” wrote Bates, who was also appointed by Bush, in his May 23 ruling. Justice Department lawyers have not yet appealed any of the three rulings issued last month. CNN has reached out to the department for comment. Among them is Mark Zaid, a prominent national security lawyer who has drawn Trump's ire for his representation of whistleblowers. Earlier this year, Trump yanked Zaid's security clearance, a decision, the attorney said in a lawsuit, that undermines his ability to “zealously advocate on (his clients') behalf in the national security arena.” “'Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors,'” they wrote, quoting from the 2024 ruling. “And yet that is exactly what Defendants do here.” Timothy Zick, a constitutional law professor at William & Mary Law School, said the executive orders targeting private entities or individuals “have relied heavily on pressure, intimidation, and the threat of adverse action to punish or suppress speakers' views and discourage others from engaging with regulated targets.” That notion was not lost on lawyers representing Harvard and faculty at Columbia University in several cases challenging Trump's attacks on the elite schools, including one brought by Harvard challenging Trump's efforts to ban the school from hosting international students. A federal judge has so far halted those efforts. In a separate case brought by Harvard over the administration's decision to freeze billions of dollars in federal funding for the nation's oldest university, the school's attorneys on Monday told a judge that Trump's decision to target it because of “alleged antisemitism and ideological bias at Harvard” clearly ran afoul of the high court's decision last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: “My Happy Place,” a CNN Original Series following celebrities on deeply personal journeys, airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT. CNN also tapped correspondents to share their happy places. At first glance, the desert landscape of Southern Utah seems like a sweeping, sun-baked canvas — wide open and endless. But tucked deep within its sandstone folds are narrow slivers of magic: slot canyons, sculpted over millennia by wind and rushing water. They draw hikers from around the world, eager to wander their labyrinthine paths and stand in awe beneath towering walls sometimes just feet apart. They require preparation and a healthy respect for nature's power. “Slot canyons are fun and easy … until they're not,” says Jim Clery, owner and guide at Utah Canyon Outdoors in Escalante, Utah. “It's not just walking,” says Lura Snow, deputy operations manager for Wildland Trekking in Utah. “There's often scrambling, navigating tight squeezes, standing water — and an otherworldly quality of light that feels like you've stepped into a secret place.” Exposed to sun and heat, these approaches can be deceivingly difficult. “Some routes require miles of walking through dry washes or sandy trails before you even get to the slot. For many, slot canyons evoke a sense of awe and curiosity. About an hour's drive east of Kanab, Utah, Buckskin Gulch — believed by many to be the longest and deepest slot canyon in the US, and possibly the world — draws hikers with its immense scale and towering canyon walls. Stretching for approximately 16 miles through a twisting corridor of sandstone, its walls can reach heights of 300 feet while narrowing to shoulder-width in places. For those up for an overnightYou can hike all the way through Buckskin Gulch to the White House Trailhead — a roughly 21-mile point-to-point trek. This route starts at Wire Pass Trailhead and travels the length of Buckskin Gulch, approximately 16 miles, before reaching its confluence with Paria Canyon. While camping is not allowed inside Buckskin Gulch, you can set up camp once you reach Paria Canyon, where dispersed backcountry camping is allowed with a valid overnight permit. Because the trail begins and ends at two different locations, arrange a shuttle in advance to return to the starting point. For a shorter, more accessible optionMany hikers choose an out-and-back route starting at the Wire Pass Trailhead. Most hikers continue a short way into Buckskin before turning around, making this route a rewarding and flexible way to experience the canyon's scale and beauty without committing to the full 21-mile trek. Recreation.gov advises Buckskin Gulch hikers to check weather conditions and river flow before setting out. Leave your itinerary with a reliable contact who will know who to call if your group doesn't return on time. If Buckskin feels intimidating, there are other places to begin. This three-mile route winds through sculpted sandstone, with playful climbs, squeezes and narrow passages — but no technical gear required. Peek-A-Boo greets you with smooth, swirling walls and natural steps, while Spooky Gulch challenges you with tight corridors where backpacks — and sometimes bodies — need to shimmy sideways to get through. The trickiest obstacle is a 12-foot climb to enter Peek-A-Boo, but solid handholds and good footing make it manageable. Because it's a loop, you can explore both canyons without backtracking. For those who want to ease into slot canyon hiking — or simply leave the logistics to someone else — guided trips offer an excellent alternative. Companies like Utah Canyon Outdoors and Wildland Trekking provide safety, gear, route knowledge and local insights, making it easier to focus on the experience without the stress of navigating on your own. “People hear ‘flash flood' and think giant walls of water,” says Snow. “But even a relatively small amount can be deadly.” But flash floods can be triggered by storms miles away. Even experienced hikers can be caught off guard by storms miles away. “You might have blue skies above you,” says Snow, “but if it's raining 50 miles away, that water can still come barreling through.” Slot canyons may feel still and silent, but they're full of surprises. Their shady, sheltered walls offer refuge for desert wildlife — from rattlesnakes and insects to the occasional tarantula. “Slot canyons are shady places, so wildlife takes refuge there,” Snow explains. She once joked about tarantulas “raining from the sky,” but it's usually just a spider dropping from a ledge — startling, not dangerous. (Tarantulas aren't considered dangerous to humans; their bite is mild and rarely causes more than minor irritation.) While rare, these encounters are reminders to stay alert and tread thoughtfully. Then there's the terrain: narrow passages, slick rock and puddles that can be deeper than expected, sometimes even requiring a swim. Water hazards and the occasional patch of quicksand are also possible, especially after storms. “Some people turn around at the first puddle,” Snow says. Clery adds that most injuries come from people hopping off short ledges. Related article Buffalo is a welcoming blend of cool and old school Spring and late fall are generally the safest times to visit. Summer monsoon season (late July through September) can bring flash floods, especially in places like Buckskin. “In summer, we're on the trail by 6:30 a.m.. That gives us time to get in and out before the heat and storms hit.” And if the weather — or your gut — says something feels off? Check with local Bureau of Land Management (BLM) offices, visitor centers, outdoor shops or guide services for advice and current conditions. A $6 day-use permit covers hikes like the popular Wire Pass route, while overnight trips into Paria Canyon require a separate permit, limited to 20 people per day. Spots can fill fast, so it's smart to plan ahead. Be sure to pack plenty of water — at least one liter per hour in summer — plus salty snacks, sun protection, a basic first-aid kit and blister care. “Desert hiking is slow, and you need to prepare for extra time,” Clery says. “People have carved their names over 8,000-year-old rock art,” Snow says. Snow urges hikers to carry wag bags for human waste, use Kula cloths (reusable antimicrobial pee cloths), and pack out everything — especially toilet paper and your own poop. Your decisions can have unintended consequences long after you leave. And if you really love a place, pick up someone else's trash on your way out. Because in the end, exploring slot canyons isn't just about seeing something beautiful — it's about being part of something bigger. But wherever you go, says Clery, “Don't expect to just show up and be spoon-fed a view.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News contributor Richard Fowler and National Review editor-in-chief Rich Lowry join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss Trump's funding battle with Harvard. A federal judge in Massachusetts on Thursday granted Harvard University's emergency request to block, for now, the Trump administration's effort to ban international students from its campus, siding with Harvard in ruling that the university would likely suffer "immediate and irreparable harm" if enforced. The temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs blocks the administration from immediately stripping Harvard of its certification status under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, or SEVP — a program run by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that allows universities to sponsor international students for U.S. visas. Burroughs said in her order that Harvard has demonstrated evidence it "will suffer immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hear from all parties," prompting her to temporarily block the SEVP revocation. Still, some see the order as a mere Band-Aid, forestalling a larger court fight between Harvard and the Trump administration — and one that Trump critics say could be unfairly weighted against the nation's oldest university. Banners hang outside the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library at the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 27. "Ultimately, this is about Trump trying to impose his view of the world on everybody else," Harvard Law professor Noah Feldman said in a radio interview discussing the Trump administration's actions. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the administration has frozen more than $2 billion in grants and contracts awarded to the university. It is also targeting the university with investigations led by six separate federal agencies. Combined, these actions have created a wide degree of uncertainty at Harvard. Harvard President Alan Garber acknowledges an extended round of applause during Harvard University's commencement ceremonies in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 29. Should Harvard lose its status for SEVP certification — a certification it has held for some 70 years — the thousands of international students currently enrolled at Harvard would have a very narrow window to either transfer to another U.S. university, or risk losing their student visas within 180 days, experts told Fox News. Some may opt not to take that chance, and transfer to a different school that's less likely to be targeted by the administration — even if it means sacrificing, for certainty, a certain level of prestige. Regardless of how the court rules, these actions create "a chilling effect" for international students at Harvard, Aram Gavoor, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School and a former Justice Department attorney, said in an interview. Students "who would otherwise be attending or applying to Harvard University [could be] less inclined to do so, or to make alternative plans for their education In the U.S.," Gavoor said. Even if the Trump administration loses on the merits of the case, "there's a point to be argued that it may have won as a function of policy," Gavoor said. People walk through the gate on Harvard Yard at the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on June 29, 2023. Meanwhile, any financial fallout the school might see as a result is another matter entirely. Though the uncertainty yielded by Trump's fight against Harvard could prove damaging to the school's priority of maintaining a diverse international student body, or by offering financial aid to students via the federally operated Pell Grant, these actions alone would unlikely to prove financially devastating in the near-term, experts told Fox News. Harvard could simply opt to fill the slots once taken by international students with any number of eager, well-qualified U.S.-based applicants, David Feldman, a professor at William & Mary who focuses on economic issues and higher education, said in an interview. Harvard is one of just a handful of American universities that has a "need-blind" admissions policy for domestic and international students — that is, they do not take into consideration a student's financial need or the aid required in weighing a potential applicant. But because international students in the U.S. typically require more aid than domestic students, replacing their slots with domestic students, in the near-term, would likely have little noticeable impact on the revenue it receives for tuition, fees and housing, he said. "This is all about Harvard, choosing the best group of students possible," Feldman said in an interview. If the administration successfully revokes their SEVP certification, this would effectively just be "constraining them to choose the second-best group," he said. "Harvard could dump the entire 1,500-person entering class, just dump it completely, and look at the next 1,500 [applicants]," Feldman said. Unlike public schools, which are subject to the vagaries of state budgets, private universities like Harvard often have margins built into their budgets in the form of seed money that allows them to allocate more money towards things they've identified as goals for the year or years ahead. This allows them to operate with more stability as a result — and inoculates them to a larger degree from the administration's financial hits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOUNTAIN LAKES, New Jersey — New Jersey Republicans are confident they will win the gubernatorial race this year after the state GOP came within three points of doing so the last go-round Both sides of the aisle have open, crowded primaries, but Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker and three-time gubernatorial candidate, is emerging as a top contender for the GOP side. In the 2021 gubernatorial race, Ciattarelli came within three points of making Gov. Swing state Arizona had nearly the inverse of these numbers and flipped blue in 2024, with 52% of voters supporting Trump and 47% supporting Harris. Both campaigns rallied heavily in Arizona, but Trump, who made just one trip to the state early in his campaign, was able to come within five points of winning it. “Republicans are bullish on 2025,” Adam Geller, a Republican pollster based in New Jersey, told the Washington Examiner. Republicans also have voter registration numbers on their side. Since former President Joe Biden took office in 2021, New Jersey voters have increasingly registered with the Republican Party. In 2020, New Jersey Democrats had an advantage of more than a million voters, but that advantage has since dwindled down to a little more than 896,300 registered voters as of January. Other Republicans are still in the running but do not appear to have high levels of support, according to polling. Other candidates polling closely behind her include Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), a moderate House Democrat, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, who is running a policy-focused campaign, and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, the farthest left of the Democratic candidates. “Ciattarelli has pulled away a long time ago and kind of never looked back,” state Assembly Minority Whip Brian Bergen, a Republican who represents a northern New Jersey district, told the Washington Examiner. “One of the reasons is Jack laid so much groundwork in 2021 when he ran, he had a real challenge on his hands. He had to combat Phil Murphy's name ID,” Bergen said, noting that Murphy was consistently in the press during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the public optimism, Republicans are also facing headwinds outside their control in New Jersey, including Trump's ability to turn out low-propensity voters that other candidates cannot. People voted for Trump and then went back to ordinary business, if you look down the ballot,” Bergen said. Statewide races are also expensive in New Jersey because candidates must buy into the pricey New York and Philadelphia TV markets, because the Garden State, located between the two cities, does not have a TV market. According to an analysis from AdImpact, this gubernatorial race is already the most expensive election in New Jersey political history, with ad spending crossing $85 million as of Wednesday. Democrats have far outspent all Republican candidates on advertising. So far, Gottheimer has spent the most, $22.8 million. Trump has been a consistent theme in ads across both parties, as the analysis found the president has been mentioned in 70% of all broadcast spots aired. Sherrill, Baraka, and Gottheimer's broadcast ads all mention Trump. However, if history repeats, Republicans might be out of luck this election. “Here in New Jersey, the party that is out of power really does better.” But, by that logic, patterns can also work against the Democrats. With Murphy's term nearing its end, New Jersey residents have not voted in three consecutive gubernatorial races for a Democrat since 1961, when Democrat Richard Hughes was voted to replace former two-term Democratic Gov.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story appeared in CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. We live in the golden age of grift. Most of us can't go a day without at least one scammy text about an unpaid toll or a call from an unknown number with a shockingly human-like AI voice on the other side. But way more hustlers, con artists and grifters than any other generation of human beings on Earth has ever had to comprehend before, let alone fend off. Thankfully, all the scam spam doesn't seem to have killed anyone's appetite for the grift as a genre. Lifting the veil on a doomsday cult? I'm in, every day, and twice on Sundays. Never forget: We once had two dueling Fyre Festival documentaries on Hulu and Netflix. OK, maybe I'm just a mark for tales of clever cons, exposed. This newsletter is, in part, an outlet for my own fascination with the business hype cycle, which tends to, you know, exaggerate the truth. Through his TikTok channel, Falcone excels at the art of the two-minute explainer, tackling frauds big (AI) and small (white chocolate). Falcone says he isn't a journalist, but he approaches his work with a similar hunger to peek behind the facade of a thing and expose it. Of his early foray into “unfun facts,” Falcone says, he wanted to find the intersection of “a little bit of a wet blanket, but you're OK afterwards… I don't like ruining people's day.” Yep.” (The delivery here is crucial: “Is-it-a-scamyep!”) The schtick is fast-talking facts and plenty of jokes about the companies and people and concepts that are, in one way or another, selling a bill of goods. I caught up with Falcone recently over Zoom to discuss the businesses of grift, comedy and journalism. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Alex Falcone: I've always liked the scheme-y underbelly. My grandfather worked in a few different contexts in carnivals, but the bulk of his life he was a pitchman, setting up a table by the midway selling kitchen gadgets and magic tricks. My dad's first job was as a kid standing in the audience while his father demonstrated a magic trick then yelling, “How did he do that? I met a con man when I was 16, and he taught me how to do card-cheating and pool-sharking stuff… and, like, mostly didn't use it for evil. I just like knowing how it works. I was working on “unfun facts,” which is like the opposite of a party trick. My party-ruiner is telling people something that's going to bum them out that they didn't know. And that, it turns out, had a lot of overlap with my interest in things that were slightly crime-y. Nightcap: Why do you think people on TikTok have been so receptive to the scam series? Falcone: I think everybody is vaguely aware that they're walking around in a haunted carnival all the time — that everybody is trying to take advantage of them. If you're at a midway, then you know the basketball hoop is harder than other basketball hoops. Otherwise they wouldn't give you stuffed animals for making one free throw. Nightcap: Do you find yourself, or your audience, experiencing scam fatigue? By slightly redefining what “scam” means, it allows me to keep finding new ways to talk about things instead of just being bummed out. Whenever I'm tired of talking about AI or crypto, I can do an episode on white chocolate. It was originally invented as a medical coating for pills. Every step of that is terrifying, but also it tastes like cat vomit. I have an escape valve for a lot of this. Nightcap: There's a bit of zombie-brain going around. I will say I spend a good amount of time — like a shameful amount of time — disassociating on TikTok. Falcone: I think that's great… There are a lot of problems with the way algorithms work, but one of the things that's great is you can just create an account with a new name, a fresh algorithm, and decide this algorithm is just for escapism. In TikTok, it took me 15 minutes before the algorithm was just rabbits and nothing else… So that is one of the ways that I've kept myself sane — having multiple algorithms that I play with depending on my mood. Nightcap: You've covered AI hype and marketing a few times… Falcone: It feels like there's an emperor-has-no clothes situation — that we're all just waiting for somebody to be like, Oh, wait, it's bad! Oh… we thought so, and then you told us we were dumb for thinking that it's not working, but it is actually bad. Nightcap: How do you source your scam material? Somebody mentioned to me the other day that the Oscars were originally started to prevent actors from unionizing, which I assumed couldn't possibly be true. The user submissions have a separate path, because the answer to “Is it a scam?” can sometimes be “no.” You pay to walk in the door of a store where everything still costs money. But I don't think it's a scam. Now I have 100-150 messages every day on the different platforms, asking “can you look into this thing for me” … But the main source is just things that I'm generally mad about in my own life. I have plenty of those to keep this going for another couple years. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump said Chinese leader Xi Jinping has agreed to restart the flow of crucial rare earth materials, after announcing a new round of US-China trade talks will be held in London on Monday. Trump made the comments a day after holding his long-awaited phone call with Xi, during which the two leaders agreed to resume negotiations stalled over mutual accusations of violating the truce reached in Geneva last month. For Washington, a major sticking point has been China's export restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets, which are essential for everything from cars to fighter jets, and critical to American industries and defense. In the weeks since the fragile detente, Washington has accused Beijing of slow-walking approvals for rare earth exports and reneging on its promise made in Geneva, with Trump expressing increasing urgency to speak to his Chinese counterpart to iron things out. After a 90-minute call on Thursday, Trump said he and Xi had “straightened out” some points related to rare earth magnets, describing it as “very complex stuff.” But he did not specify what exactly had been agreed upon. Asked Friday if Xi had agreed to restart the flow of rare earth minerals and magnets, Trump told reporters abroad Air Force One: “Yes, he did.” He did not further elaborate on how fast that would happen, or the volume of the materials that would be released. Instead, it quoted Xi as saying that China had “seriously and earnestly” complied with the trade truce agreement. Asked about it at the Chinese foreign ministry's daily briefing on Friday, a spokesperson sidestepped the question, saying it was a matter for other agencies to address. China, which controls 90% of the global processing of rare earths, imposed export restrictions on some minerals and magnets on April 4 at the height of the tariff war, after Trump slapped “reciprocal” levies on Chinese goods. The new system does not ban exports outright, but requires government approval for each shipment. While American businesses are likely to see more shipments approved in the next couple of weeks, the export licensing regime is here to stay, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. Some Chinese suppliers of US companies have recently received six-month export licenses, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said Friday, but it noted that uncertainty remains amid a large backlog of license applications. Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said the importance Trump attaches to rare earths shows how effective China's “rare earth card” is. “I hadn't realized just how important this rare earth card was before. Now the US side is clearly anxious and eager to resolve this issue,” he said in a video on social media on Thursday. “But of course, we'll link this issue to others – the US is restricting China on chips and jet engines, then China certainly has every reason to make use of this card.” “As for whether China will change its rare earth export control policy, that probably still needs to be negotiated in more detail” Jin added. Related article China has a powerful card to play in its fight against Trump's trade war Some Chinese scholars have expressed hope that US technology restrictions on China may now be up for negotiation, after Trump announced that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick – whose department overseas US export controls – will join Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in the next round of trade talks. “The issue of US export controls may no longer be an area that is completely non-negotiable in the future,” Cui Fan, an economics professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and advisor to the Chinese Commerce Ministry, wrote in a social media post. Beijing has insisted that its export controls are in line with international practices, non-discriminatory and not targeted at any specific country. Hours before the two leaders jumped on the phone on Thursday, a spokesperson for China's commerce ministry reiterated that stance at a regular news conference, citing the “clear dual-use attributes” of rare earth materials. Dual-use items refer to those with both civilian and military applications. “The Chinese government reviews export license applications for dual-use items in accordance with laws and regulations, and for applications that meet the requirements, China will grant approval to promote and facilitate compliant trade,” spokesperson He Yongqian said. A survey of member companies conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China late week found that, among those affected by rare earth export controls, 75% say their stock would run out within three months. Following a meeting in Paris this week, the European Union's trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said he informed Chinese commerce minister Wang Wentao about the “alarming situation in the European car industry” as a result of China's rare earth throttlehold.

Charles Barkley calls the NCAA 'idiots' and 'fools' during an appearance on OutKick's "Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich." A federal judge granted final approval on Friday to the $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to begin paying athletes directly. Judge Claudia Wilken approved the settlement on Friday that will allow schools to pay their athletes next month. The sweeping terms of the so-called House settlement include approval for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion that will be paid over the next decade to thousands of former players who were barred from that revenue for years. A federal judge on Friday signed off on the $2.8 billion settlement between college athletes and the NCAA, clearing the way for schools to begin paying their athletes. Payouts will be determined based on the sport and the length of athletic career, with most football and men's basketball players able to receive nearly $135,000 each. Nearly five years after Arizona State swimmer Grant House sued the NCAA and its five biggest conferences to lift restrictions on revenue sharing, Wilken approved the final proposal that had been hung up on roster limits, just one of many changes ahead amid concerns that thousands of walk-on athletes will lose their chance to play college sports. A NCAA Official Game Ball logo is seen on a basketball before the NCAA Division II National Championship Basketball game between the Minnesota State Mavericks and the Nova Southeastern Sharks on March 30, 2024, at the Ford Center in Evansville, Indiana. The NCAA lifted its ban on athletes earning money through endorsement and sponsorship deals in 2021. At one point, President Donald Trump was considering an executive order to regulate name, image and likeness in college sports after meeting with legendary Alabama Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban, the Wall Street Journal reported. On Fox News last year, Saban urged Congress to step in and make NIL "equal across the board." "And I think that should still exist for all players, but not just a pay-for-play system like we have now where whoever raises the most money in their collective can pay the most for the players, which is not a level playing field. President Donald Trump shakes hands with legendary Alabama football coach Nick Saban before delivering a special commencement address to University of Alabama graduates at Coleman Coliseum. The settlement also called for a clearinghouse to make sure any NIL deal worth more than $600 is pegged at fair market value in an attempt to thwart supposed pay-for-play deals.

San Francisco Giants shortstop Willy Adames (2) singles against the Atlanta Braves in the first inning of a baseball game at Oracle Park in San Francisco, Friday, June 6, 2025. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tyler Fitzgerald scored on a wild pitch by Pierce Johnson with two outs in the 10th inning and the San Francisco Giants beat the Atlanta Braves 5-4 on Friday night for their third straight win. After getting picked off first to end the ninth, Fitzgerald began the 10th on second base. He advanced to third on a one-groundout and then scored when Johnson (1-2) threw a 1-2 pitch to the backstop, sending the Braves to their fifth straight loss. He allowed a leadoff single to Heliot Ramos, but got bailed out when Sean Murphy threw out Ramos trying to steal second to keep it tied at 4. Kimbrel then walked Jung Hoo Lee, but picked him off first and then struck out Wilmer Flores to get out of the inning. The Giants' struggling offense produced three runs in the first with help from two errors by Atlanta and a run-scoring wild pitch thrown by Spencer Schwellenbach. San Francisco led 4-2 before the Braves tied it in the seventh when Matt Olson hit a two-run homer off reliever Ryan Walker. There was an odd moment in the fourth inning when Murphy hit a sacrifice fly to right with the bases loaded for Atlanta. Olson easily beat the throw by Mike Yastrzemski, but there was confusion because a ball had been thrown on the field by a fan in the stands. Both teams played their 26th one-run game, tied for the most in the majors. RHP Bryce Elder (2-3, 4.56 ERA) will start the middle game of the series for Atlanta against RHP Logan Webb (5-5, 2.55).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For two months, Democrats have agitated on behalf of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant, alleged gang member, and suspected human trafficker whom the Trump administration deported to El Salvador. But the immigration judge specifically ordered that Abrego Garcia not be deported to his home country of El Salvador, where Abrego Garcia claimed he would be in danger. As it turned out, Abrego Garcia never went anywhere until March of this year, when he was arrested as part of the new Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants who have received deportation orders. But as everyone knows, U.S. authorities deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — precisely where the judge had said he should not be sent. The Trump administration admitted it made a mistake but also maintained that once Abrego Garcia was in prison in El Salvador, the U.S. had little power to bring him back. By then, many Democrats had turned Abrego Garcia into an anti-Trump cause. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador and said he passed on a “message of love” from Abrego Garcia's wife to Kilmar. Van Hollen assured reporters that all the efforts to bring Abrego Garcia home, plus his family's love, gave Abrego Garcia “the strength to persevere.” For many Democrats, activists, and their allies in the media, it was a touching story. Not long after, though, the administration passed on information about Abrego Garcia's alleged gang activities and allegations he had abused his wife, who had sought protective orders against him. And then came information that he had been stopped driving in Tennessee in 2022 with a car full of what appeared to be illegal immigrants. It very quickly appeared that the Tennessee matter might become a serious problem for Abrego Garcia and his supporters. And now, that has turned out to be the case. On Friday afternoon, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that federal prosecutors in Tennessee have indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts of human smuggling. Prosecutors allege that Abrego Garcia, acting with several coconspirators, “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens who had no authorization to be present in the United States, and many of whom were MS-13 members and associates.” There were more than 100 trips in all, prosecutors say. The indictment also alleges that Abrego Garcia “worked with transnational criminal organizations in Mexico to transport undocumented aliens through Mexico and into the United States.” The indictment refers to Abrego Garcia's alleged coconspirators as “CC-1” and “CC-2,” etc., and gives readers an idea of how the scheme worked. Then, Abrego Garcia was stopped on Interstate 40 in Putnam County, Tennessee. (Abrego Garcia apparently modified his Chevy Suburban to turn it into a little bus.) He allegedly lied to police, telling them he had been in St. Louis when in fact he had been taking his usual route of picking up illegal immigrants in the Houston, Texas, area. “The grand jury found that over the past nine years, Abrego Garcia has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring,” Bondi said Friday. “They found this was his full-time job, not a contractor.” So much for the hardworking Maryland dad thing. Early on, after reports came out of Abrego Garcia's alleged gang membership and spousal abuse, the Democrats who took up his cause hurried to explain that they did not really support Abrego Garcia personally — they just wanted to make sure he received due process in the U.S. Well, now Abrego Garcia is receiving due process in the U.S. It should be a satisfying ending for both sides.</p>

The hosts added a second in the 30th minute with striker Salomón Rondón, Venezuela's all-time top goal scorer with 47 goals, after he chested down a cross from Nahuel Ferraresi and scored with his left foot. Bolivia, which now trails Venezuela by four points with only three rounds to play, never threatened goalkeeper Rafael Romo at the Monumental Stadium in the eastern city of Maturin, Venezuela. “It was a very important win for us. But we haven't won anything yet,” said Venezuelan midfielder Telasco Segovia. It will be another final on Tuesday.” Venezuela has not lost at home in the current edition of South American qualifying. Only Argentina is also unbeaten at home. Also on Friday, Colombia drew Peru 0-0 at home and failed to overtake Brazil in the standings. It was Colombia's fifth consecutive match without a win. The hosts at the Metropolitano Stadium in Barranquilla missed suspended striker Luis Díaz, who scored six goals in World Cup qualifying. Jhon Córdoba and Rafael Santos Borré were also out due to injury. World Cup champion Argentina, which secured its 2026 berth in March, leads South American qualifying after 15 matches with 34 points. Ecuador and Paraguay are next with 24 points, but the Ecuadorians have better goal difference. Brazil is in fourth place with 22 points. Venezuela, the only South American team to have never competed in a World Cup, has 18 points. Several teams could secure their World Cup spots in Tuesday's next set of matches. Ecuador will clinch its spot with a win at Peru and Brazil could also secure its berth with a win, provided Venezuela doesn't add points at Uruguay. All 10 South American nations play each other home and away.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump told reporters Friday on Air Force One that he has been so busy working on foreign policy that he has not had time to think about Elon Musk after his feud with the billionaire. Trump fought with Musk over social media Thursday, exchanging threats ranging from cancelling government contracts to starting a new centrist political party. President Donald Trump told reporters Friday on Air Force One that he has been so busy working on foreign policy that he has not had time to think about Elon Musk after his feud with the billionaire. When asked about a New York Times report surrounding Musk's alleged drug abuse, Trump opted not to attack his adviser-turned-adversary and instead said the report sounded “unfair.” A call had been reportedly scheduled between Trump and Musk for Friday, but Trump said Friday morning that he was not interested in a call. He said Musk had gone “crazy” after the Epstein comments and after Musk claimed that Trump's tariffs would cause a recession. “I'm not even thinking about Elon,” Trump said. Musk signaled a willingness to reconcile with Trump on Thursday evening, saying, “You're not wrong,” in response to a post by Bill Ackman, who said the pair should make peace “for the benefit of our great country.” But Musk suggested on Friday afternoon that Trump's attacks on him were unwarranted because he was initially criticizing Congress. Trump then attacked Elon personally,” an X user wrote, with Musk responding, “Exactly.”</p>
