                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“That show is me trying to deal with grief and loss. I'm going to be dealing with it forever but having a creative outlet to try and pour that into has been incredibly therapeutic and I hope it's therapeutic for people going through a similar situation to me.” TIFF People's Choice Award Winner 'The Life Of Chuck' Latest Indie To Test Box Office Revival With Neon Gifting Campaign - Specialty Preview International Insider: SXSW London's Royal Debut; Evacuations & Events In Germany; Cybercrime Investigation Flanagan noted that some of his other big projects like Doctor Sleep and Midnight Mass had aided his battle against alcoholism, the former helping him get sober. He is also showrunning Amazon's upcoming TV version of Stephen King's Carrie. Fans have oft speculated that grief and suicide serve as central themes of The Haunting of Hill House, a show that was loosely based on the 1959 Shirley Jackson novel. During a wide-ranging SXSW session, Flanagan said there is a “bias against horror” from audiences and the industry that resets when an award-winning project comes along. He said there has always been a “misperception of what horror can be,” using the example of Jordan Peele's Oscar-winning work, which quickly legitimizes the genre before this is once again forgotten. “People outside the genre remain perpetually surprised that there is a really good story in here and it's not just about the scares,” he said. Horror was always a popular genre in film but then the industry and some audiences tend to reset and be surprised again that it is just as dramatically viable, complex and beautifully artistic as any other genre.” Much of Flanagan's oeuvre has been adaptations of iconic horror scribe King's work and he is said to be working closely with King on a long-gestating adaptation of the Dark Tower series, while King has praised his projects in the past. For Flanagan, and perhaps surprisingly, King “is not a horror writer.” He described him as a “gooey-hearted, lovely humanist” who is “kind, fun and goofy.” “He writes emotional and empathetic stories about human nature and the horror elements are born organically out of the characters he creates,” added Flanagan. “Monologue is a dying art but there is nothing more impressive than watching an actor completely change reality with just words,” he added. But I love to watch it and want to push back against this cultural shift of low attention spans and bursts of entertainment.” The movie stars Tom Hiddleston as a man whose life is chronicled in reverse-chronological order and is seemingly having an impact on the world and universe around him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Netflix series Dept Q., Matthew Goode stars as DCI Carl Morck, a curmudgeonly cop afflicted by PTSD and almost Sherlock-level powers of deduction. Based on the novels by Jussi Adler-Olsen, which have also been made into a series of Danish-language films, the Netflix series is developed by and partially directed by Scott Frank, of The Queen's Gambit fame. Frank moves the action to Scotland, with Goode starring as the English outsider alongside such Scottish favorites as Kelly Macdonald, Chloe Pirrie, Mark Bonnar, Shirley Henderson and Kate Dickie. As Morck reels from an incident that almost killed him and paralyzed his colleague DI Hardy (Jamie Sives) he finds himself sidelined to a ‘lost cause' basement cold case unit with his sidekicks Akram (Alexei Manvelov) and Rose (Leah Birne). Here, in a Zoom chat from his home in the U.K. with his wife and children making excellent background appearances, Goode reveals how Morck's mindset might have “infected” him, a favorite memory of working with the late, great Maggie Smith on Downton Abbey, and how he felt about his Robert Evans role in the making-of-The Godfather limited series The Offer, when not everyone loved that version of the story—least of all Coppola. Ekta Kapoor's Balaji Telefilms & Netflix Unveil Creative Partnership Netflix Shareholders Vote Out Board Member In Rare Repudiation; Streamer Weighs Resignation Offer I know you were told not to do that, but — No, we weren't dictated to in that way. Scott [Frank] said, “I just think you'll find it more freeing not to be bound to something that sort of doesn't make any more sense because we've now brought it to Edinburgh and made you English.” But I met [the author] Jussi [Adler-Olsen] the other day for the first time. Obviously Jussi gave Scott license to go ahead and change things in bits and bobs, which he really has, I suppose. DEADLINE: Carl Morck is just one of my favorite characters. I'm addicted to any kind of detective story, but Carl really got me. GOODE: So is there a big difference between what I did and the guy before? DEADLINE: When I started watching I did wonder how you would do it, because in the original he's so Danish. That Scandinavian noir vibe is so central to the books and films, or so I had thought. But, seeing this version, there's a way about him that's also so British. So, I think it's like you're cousins in the way you do Carl, and nothing is lost and so much is gained by the Britishness. It's different, but in the right ways. GOODE: This is such a wonderful company of actors. Even though I was the only English one, and they could have easily hated me, obviously with that lovely Scottish-English situation, it wasn't the case. I'd wanted to work with Shirley Henderson—‘Shenderson'—for years. And Kelly Mcdonald, and then this fairly relatively new actress, Leah Byrne, who is a revelation in this show. It's very difficult to be talking about some of the things that she has to talk about and make them hilarious. That's why we're desperate to do a second season. DEADLINE: I have zero doubts that you're going to get a second season, if not more. DEADLINE: When you sign on to something like this, there's always a future that could go on for quite a long time. Do you talk about that up front? I'm just wondering how long you're thinking. GOODE: It is quite a modern phenomenon, really, as an actor, that you would get to sit in something for time. And now I think I'm at the right age that I'd like to have a character that I can come back to that has great, exciting, dark, hopefully funny stuff happening within the story, but also, how's this man going to change? Even if it's by minutia, there will be certain changes. GOODE: Will I come back with a sheepskin jacket again? But you know what happens to me at the end, so we're unsure. Because I saw that jacket and I thought that jacket is probably about 800 pounds minimum. So I'm like, has he bought it from a vintage store or more likely, did his wife get it for him when they were together? And I think it's the last one. GOODE: By the way, you're absolutely bang on. DEADLINE: He would never buy himself that coat ever. The beard thing I was really interested in, because it fits with Carl wanting to retreat, right? He wants to have this layer between him and everyone else. So in the opening scene, it would've been possibly interesting to have him clean shaven. Before things go so very wrong for him. GOODE: He is someone that screams, “Don't come near me.” And my wife didn't come near me for six months because she hates beards. DEADLINE: Were you a bit infected by Carl's personality? GOODE: I'm that person already, can't you tell? So basically, the job is going to do that to you anyway in the little ways when you are working that many hours. And also, you don't stop for six months because it's always a huge amount of dialogue to learn. So, you start off and you're two or three weeks ahead, I learned the first two scripts. And then you've got to just keep learning. My routine was up at 3, run bath, get in bath, bath is cold because at 3 in the morning the heating hasn't come on. And I'm going learn my day's lines and then I'm going to go through and make sure that the next three weeks are still in there as well [one of his kids interrupts to hug him]. Oh and then make massive cafetiere of coffee which 12 people normally have. And my treat is Ken Burns documentaries. [His wife Sophie Dymoke interrupts to hug him, then the conversation digresses to skincare, fond talk of the children, best North London pubs and how “sickeningly” handsome Jude Law is.] DEADLINE: So in terms of embodying Carl, I know you spoke to an old friend who was a murder investigator. GOODE: He was on the murder squad over here. He got out of [the force] and was driving me around for a while on a particular film that I was doing. One of his first days he was told to go to this house and check because the owner hadn't been heard of for a while, as you can imagine. And he was like, “Oh, the curtains are closed.” And as he got up to the house, he was like, “Oh, those aren't curtains. Those are flies.”There were a lot of stories. And so actually, in some ways, like anything, they have an interesting sense of humor, some of those people because it's sort of a survival instinct. DEADLINE: How did he specifically help you become Carl with his stories? GOODE: Well, just the level of the detail that he would remember of a crime scene was what I always found fascinating. This is a guy who's able to recall so much. But it's the observation that needs to be done of any scene you come to. I've had friends who've been in war zones. And f*cking terrifying jobs, some of these people have. But we've crossed paths, and we've remained in touch and I love them to death, but I wouldn't want that job. DEADLINE: I hate to tell you this, but just based on the books, Carl's mental health does not really improve. Well, I'm assuming he doesn't change very quickly. DEADLINE: Well, most men don't, I find. DEADLINE: That's a sidebar that we could talk about at length when your wife returns. GOODE: I hope she doesn't make it back in time. DEADLINE: I was obsessed with The Offer and I know it was always meant to be a limited series, but if that ever came up again, would you want to do Bob Evans again? What was so interesting too, is that Coppola came out and said, “That's not how it happened,” which might have felt quite scary to you? I'd originally gone up for a part in that. I was asked to read for another part. OK. Well it's obviously going to be load of big stars, and blah, blah, blah and I'll still watch it because it was really good scripts.” And then I was playing golf on a golf course during the pandemic, for the first time in ages, and it was p*ssing down rain. And I got a call from all my agents just saying, “Dexter Fletcher has offered you Bob Evans.” I said, “What? Paramount's been going through a whole load of structural change, with people going out and going in, so I think that time [for another season] might have passed and I don't know if a series could take Bob being the center of it. I don't know if he could, because obviously the author was Miles' character [Albert Ruddy]. DEADLINE: I know why you are not doing the third Downton Abbey film. DEADLINE: Were they going to kill you off? GOODE: I spoke to Michelle [Dockery] at length about what we could possibly… I think we were going to try and ask for a slight rewrite or something or other. And then eventually it was just that they were moving ahead. To be on a set with Hugh [Bonneville] and Allen [Leech]. I've got great stories from those sets. She came off [set], and she said, “I think that might've been my favorite day on a set ever.” GOODE: It was the wedding of our characters, and we shot it out very secretively somewhere out in the countryside. And our green room for 20 actors was the garden of an ex-Concorde pilot. This is going to sound jolly unprofessional, and it is a bit unprofessional, but it's f*cking funny. He came out with a bottle of rosé and just put it on the table, a bottle of Minuty, which was a nice Aix-en-Province rosé. Well, obviously we can't do that.” I'm just a bit naughty. I don't know if it's coming across or not. And I said, “Is it OK if I have another one?” And then you started to see all the other actors, particularly the ones that didn't have any lines that day, just a big ensemble piece, none of us had that much to do, really. And if you've made Maggie Smith happy, then it can't be wrong. He was a gentleman and it was a gorgeous house and gorgeous garden as well. And also we gave them good stories because then suddenly they've got a ton of half-cut, quite famous people in their garden having great fun. So, they've got anecdotes for the rest of their life. I wouldn't do it again though for any future producers listening. I know this is the final Downton film, but if there was a spinoff, would you ever do it? GOODE: Ultimately, it's a very difficult thing to balance. And if you think about Mary [Dockery] I was sad I wasn't going to go and do it because it would've been a giggle. But when you think about it in the terms of she's a modern feminist, a feminist icon, Lady Mary. Wouldn't it be great if something surprising happened to her? I only had the page that they sent me. So, let's hope that someone from her past, the people who Downtonites adore, like a Charles Blake or someone like that. There are a lot of people that loved Charles Blake for her. If he comes back and scoops her up. Or, she doesn't need a man. Why can't she just be Lady Mary? And why can't she keep a harem of men? Use them for sex and then get back on the tractor? She was killing men when we first met her. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cancellations and postponements come weeks before his scheduled performance at Glastonbury. Rod Stewart has canceled additional U.S. tour dates as he continues to recover from the flu. On Saturday (June 7), the 80-year-old music icon announced on social media that he is canceling four concerts and rescheduling two others due to ongoing health concerns. “I have to cancel and reschedule my next six concerts in June as I continue to recover from the flu,” Sir Rod wrote on Instagram. I'm devastated and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience to my fans. I'll be back on stage and will see you soon.” Three of the canceled shows (June 7, 8 and 10) were part of his Las Vegas residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Earlier in the week, Stewart — who received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2025 American Music Awards in May — had already postponed his June 1 and June 5 shows at Caesars Palace, citing an unspecified illness. Other 2025 Glastonbury headliners include The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo. Following Glastonbury, Stewart will return to North America in July, performing across the U.S. and Canada before resuming his Las Vegas residency in late September. After that, he's set for a run of South American dates before heading to Europe to finish out the year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ostensibly, the rally — organized by an array of veterans groups and backed by labor unions, such as the AFL-CIO — was a non-partisan protest against proposed cuts to veterans benefits and to the federal workforce, including at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In reality, it was an expression of rage against President Donald Trump and his MAGA agenda. “I think there's a lot of people in America that think this is a fight between the far right and the far left. It is impossible to make substantial cuts to the government without disproportionately impacting veterans, who make up nearly 25 percent of the federal workforce, but only five percent of employed Americans as a whole. The VA alone is facing losses of nearly 83,000 jobs, as proposed by the department's secretary, Doug Collins — about 18 percent of its total workforce. And they, in turn, promise certain benefits if we serve,” says Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, which represents about 750,000 government workers across the country. Kelley says his members are keenly watching as lawsuits contesting job cuts make their way through the courts: “They're saying that they want us to continue to stay in this fight. We want to be winning the war,” he says. And we're going to sing about it,” Casey tells Rolling Stone. His gentle voice purrs with an unmistakable Boston accent as he sits on a shady bench in the sweltering heat. “We all know what's caused us to be here.” It makes people just want to put their head in the sand,” he says. A young woman nearby, who this reporter later learns also hails from Boston but encountered the protest by accident, curiously eyes the 56-year-old punk rocker — with his old-school sailor tats, dapper black outfit, and neatly trimmed crewcut — and his interlocutor. She strains to listen in without being rude — it's not every day a founding member of one of your hometown's iconic bands plops down beside you to talk politics with a reporter, after all. “I think that that's part of what keeps the moderates away, and part of it is that ‘It's not affecting me personally right now,' and that's why that famous old statement from, I forget who said it: ‘First they came for the trade unionists, and then they came for me,'” Casey says, summarizing a confessional-turned-poem by Martin Niemöller, a Lutheran pastor imprisoned by the Nazis, of which there are many versions. Trump Finally Brings Back Illegally Deported Man — to Indict Him Right-Wingers Are Struggling to Cope With the Trump-Musk Feud The organizers of the rally, a recently established non-profit called the Unite for Veterans Coalition, likens their movement to the “Bonus Army” of 1932 — a group of World War I veterans who took to the streets amid the Great Depression to get cash payments that had been promised to them — and talk admiringly about Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, a legendary U.S. Marine who was instrumental in crushing a clumsy fascist coup attempt against President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. Here, now, in Washington D.C. on the anniversary of Operation Overlord, many veterans consciously sought to evoke that past — summoning the days when America had offered the lives of its citizenry to defeat a dictator. “Dad Fought Fascism in Europe,” one man's sign says. “We Will Fight it Here.” A woman holds another: “My Grandpa Fought Nazis.” Two men carry flags with three downward pointing arrows, one saying “American Iron Front” on it. He is aware that the Iron Front was a political paramilitary that fought the Nazis, among other forms of totalitarianism: The three downward pointing arrows are generally considered to represent opposition to Nazism, Communism, and Monarchism. One of the lessons of that era is that political extremism, fueled by proliferating violence and a masculinity crisis among young men, can create the conditions for the failure of a democracy. While Trump and his supporters may be ceding some of that ground by cutting veterans benefits, others are waiting to build movements around the political legitimacy supposedly conferred by veteran status. Far-right extremists have been omnipresent throughout modern American history, and veterans are a natural target for cultivation by ideologues. Political violence is nothing new, and a number of the veterans who spoke to Rolling Stone fear that civil unrest will be used as a pretext for a government crackdown on liberties, perhaps even used in an attempt to justify martial law. Other vets were at the rally to protest job cuts inflicted by Trump and Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. A thirtysomething former Marine mortarman who asked to be identified only as Andrew says that he lost his job at the Veterans Administration due to the DOGE cuts. He traveled from Michigan to show up at the protest. “I wasn't really political before,” Andrew says. “Like, everyone knows when you're the one liberal in an infantry battalion, but back then I didn't give politics much thought.” He describes generations of family that had served in the military or in federal jobs, proudly counting them on his fingers as he shouts their relationship and role, while the Dropkick Murphys take to the stage. That is a reference to “Who Will Stand with Us,” a new single which in the band's promotional material is described as “an urgent call to action to stand up against division and inequality.” “So here we are on D-Day today, and it's like everything that so many of our grandparents fought for — you're willing to just walk away from that, because you feel like the world's too ‘woke?' Like, what do you care if someone else wants to be woke?” Casey says. “Was it really worth it to surrender the democracy of the country, just so you could feel a little more like you had your guy win? “People over there are defending democracy, and people over here are defending democracy,” he tells Rolling Stone.

Being Stray Kids Takes a Lot of Work — and Close Friendships Inside the Billion-Dollar Effort to Make Trump Feel Good About Himself Clearly a band whose eleventh album was titled This Machine Still Kills Fascists, is unapologetic about both its politics and its embrace of America's early anti-fascist traditions. “I just feel when people say now, like, ‘Shut up and sing!' I feel OK. We've been going for 30 years with the same message,” Casey says. Send us a tip using our anonymous form. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Boyd also won season four of the intense renovation challenge in 2023, alongside his former “Luxe For Less” co-star Anthony Elle. But as fans celebrated Boyd's history-making win on social media, many also lamented that the interior designer hadn't appeared on his own HGTV show since early 2023, in the first and only season of “Luxe For Less.” With no word on plans for Boyd's show to return in 2025, a fan petition is now collecting signatures to urge the network to re-launch Boyd's show. Before season four of “Rock the Block” aired in early 2023, Boyd's new HGTV show “Luxe For Less” premiered on December 1, 2022. In the freshman series, he and his creative team — including Anthony Elle, the designer who was his teammate during his first “Rock the Block” win — employed “clever budget hacks to help homeowners create luxurious renovations without stretching their bank accounts,” per HGTV. On June 1, 2025, Boyd posted screenshots from a Country Living article about him winning “Rock the Block” again, and he wrote, “((It's the last quote for me)) ‘Give this king his show back! Fans flooded his comment section with support, including someone who wrote, “Exactly and we need like 12 episodes per season too.” Boyd replied, “Can a brother get a dozen! Two days later, film and TV casting director Tracy “Twinkie” Byrd, took matters into her own hands, tagging Boyd in an Instagram post and announcing that she'd started a petition on Change.org to bring back “Luxe For Less.” Boyd shared the post in his Instagram stories and wrote, “Wowwwwww” Describing the goal of the petition, Byrd wrote on Change.org, “In a world where black culture is consistently thriving, pushing boundaries, and setting new trends, it's disheartening to witness moments where black voices and talents are sidelined. HGTV's remarkable show ‘Luxe for Less' is a beacon of this very creativity and excellence.” HGTV has the chance to set a precedent, to make a statement that creativity knows no boundaries of color, and that the contribution of black talents is not only valued but essential.” Fans have been voicing their hope for HGTV to reinstate the show in posts across social media, including on Facebook, where one fan who shared the petition on June 5 wrote, “If you love all things home interior, design on a dime, etc. On June 6, another fan tweeted, “I have been on here in a minute but @hgtv you all HAVE to bring the show Luxe for Less BACK! On June 3, he wrote in his Instagram Stories, “…these ‘bring back #LuxeForLess' posts/petitions have me blushing like 🥰❤️ Thank you.</p>

George Clooney is proud of his former “E.R.” co-star Noah Wyle for the success of the Apple TV+ series “The Pitt.” In an appearance on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” June 3, Clooney said he and Wyle had been “dear friends” since shooting their own medical drama. “He is just the most honorable, talented young man,” Clooney said. The show is just a beautiful show, and he does just a great job with it.” Wyle is leading many major predictions in the Emmy nominations race for the Best Actor in a Drama Series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1994, my parents finally went to see The Rolling Stones. The group released Voodoo Lounge, their twentieth album, in July that year, and immediately began touring it. They were firmly in middle age, three decades into their career, and had seemingly come to the realization many sixties era Boomer artists were waking up to: Their largely middle class, middlebrow audience had grown up along with them, and were liquid enough financially to pay exorbitant prices for shitty seats to see the band that had eluded them for so long, even if there was rampant speculation the group was washed, and on the downside of their primes. Tha Carter VI is the work of an artist who either doesn't have a creative team around him capable of pushing back on his worst and most indulgent impulses, or one unwilling to listen to dissenting voices. And in lieu of that lack of editorial process, its author has clearly misplaced, if not permanently lost, his once unimpeachable grip on his true north. Since Carter VI was released on Friday at midnight, my timeline's been ablaze with fans, former fans, and haters chiming in on what exactly had gone so terribly wrong. And yet the electrified Garden crowd was stuffed to the bleeds by the time Wayne hit the stage just after 10, strutting to the stage with a white electric rockstar axe, sporting blonde dreads, pink sweats tucked into heeled knee high boots, an oversized heavyweight Britney Spears T-shirt with her name in neon pink script, a chunky scarf, a bejeweled grill, white framed sunglasses—which would be subsequently swapped out for glasses so big each lens threatened to blot out Wayne's face—and a frozen wrist and neck, rocking doubled iced out crucifix chains and an iced out crucifix pinky ring to go with an iced out wallet chain and a slowly burning late-90s-sized blunt hanging out of a corner of his mouth. The polished old pro bent time and space, keeping the unfortunate new work to a minimum and running through his hits, reliving, nearly chronologically, the thrill of experiencing his catalog all over again at a speed run. Sabrina Carpenter, Lil Wayne, Addison Rae, and All the Songs You Need to Know This Week Lil Wayne's First ‘Tha Carter VI' Track Featured in an NBA Finals Campaign Escaped Inmate Asks Lil Wayne, NBA YoungBoy, Meek Mill for Help Lil Wayne Celebrates Over 20 Years of ‘Tha Carter' With New Tour It's why the live experience in this age of streaming is so vital for younger fans trying to navigate this massive back catalog. A pop animal like Wayne must be experienced outside. He has a roster of endless hits—some that touched the Billboard charts and some that never did because the samples can't be cleared and they're still not streaming but were ubiquitous in the aughts nevertheless—from decades of classic, iconic album and mixtape work, which matters when you're trying to understand the impact of an artist of this magnitude. It's a reminder that Lil Wayne is one of the most unique and context-rich rappers of the modern era, thanks to his inventive and influential approach. Like LL Cool J (Who made a brief but memorable cameo on the Garden stage), he was a survivor who never stopped evolving. Whose appeal to his longtime followers was in charting his evolution: From yapping adolescent with the good fortune of being in proximity to one of hip hop's great groups, powered by one of its greatest beat architects, to a young solo rapper experimenting with his style on his underground mixtapes while at the same time aping the influences he wore on his sleeve on his safe and pat major label releases, be it an imitation of Jeezy and T.I. Old Wayne fans such as myself are a funny breed. We're washed people who haven't quite accepted we're washed, in overlaundered Polos with fucked up collars, wearing sunglasses inside in the dark at night and extremely expensive fendi buckets that look stupid as hell. But the music at MSG made us all children again. And this is why you can more or less skip Tha Carter VI, but can't afford to miss Wayne live this summer if you have the opportunity to go see him. On the 30-year anniversary of the Voodoo Lounge Tour, my parents went back to the Meadowlands to see The Rolling Stones again last year, with a pair of tickets that were still wildly expensive and in demand, this time at a football stadium named after an insurance company rather than a football team. It also was the richest tour ever to that point, a record the Stones themselves would break multiple times in the ensuing years, the birth of the band as conveyors of “adult contemporary” bullshit, a nostalgia factory/national mint, that thanks to their longevity made them one of the first groups to capitalize on their boomer fanbase aging into elder feeling-chasers and exploring the limits of what you could charge for a concert ticket, ushering us into this current, deeply fucked era of crazed fans willing to go into significant debt to see Taylor or Beyoncé. Being Stray Kids Takes a Lot of Work — and Close Friendships Inside the Billion-Dollar Effort to Make Trump Feel Good About Himself Mick and Keith are in their 80s; they are multi-millionaires and have spent the last three decades releasing music occasionally, strictly for their hardcore fan base, but largely living off the incredible creative output of their first three decades. I thought about that as Wayne poignantly ended his show with “A Milli”, one of the strangest Grammy-winning, Billboard Top 10 hits in rap history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix has entered into a new creative partnership with Ekta Kapoor's Balaji Telefilms in India, further enhancing its content offering in the world's most populous country. Kapoor, a Bollywood scion and International Emmy Award-winning producer known for her extensive work in Hindi television and film, has been a prominent figure in Indian entertainment for over two decades. 'Straw' Review: Taraji P. Henson and Teyana Taylor in Tyler Perry's Reliably Overwrought Netflix Thriller Monika Shergill, Netflix's vp of content in India, hailed Kapoor's impact on the Indian industry, noting her “deep understanding of the audience's pulse.” Shergill emphasized that this partnership is aligned with Netflix's broader strategy of delivering content that resonates with the varied tastes of its Indian subscribers. Kapoor, speaking on the collaboration, highlighted the opportunity to bring “powerful, culturally rooted, and emotionally resonant stories to a global audience,” citing Netflix's unparalleled global reach. She added: “The beginning of this new collaboration marks an exciting new chapter where we continue to push creative boundaries and deliver content that entertains, inspires, and connects people everywhere.” The deal builds on an existing history of collaboration between Netflix and Balaji Telefilms, which has produced several successful titles together, including Kathal, Pagglait, and Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare. Netflix views India as an important long-term growth market and continues to invest heavily there, although it has tempered its ambitions for the country significantly since Reed Hastings' wildly bullish projections during the streamer's early rapid-expansion era.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Only three sense memories remain from the night my wife and I came home from the hospital after our daughter died, 10 years ago this May. Why would we do that to ourselves? The album that opens with “Death With Dignity,” the album whose most memorable chorus is a whispered “we're all gonna die.” And yet I kept returning to the record player, flipping the album over and over. Yes, it's an album with a Polaroid on the cover, clearly from a personal collection, paired with two first names. Yes, the lyrics are so specific to one man's experience as to approach the forensic: “When I was three, three maybe four….” And yet the thumbprint of tragedy, the outline and silhouette of grief, was all I needed from Carrie & Lowell. My relationship to an album has rarely been more intense. Until this month, I couldn't bear to put it back on. But Carrie & Lowell, newly reissued by Asthmatic Kitty with a modest addendum of bonus tracks and a gorgeous 40-page photo album, survives my bloodshot fixation because it is so formally perfect. There is an obvious comparison to Elliott Smith, who similarly matched up a shaky and tender vocal with arrangements that felt like you could stare straight through them. Smith was often obfuscating or misdirecting in his lyrics even when it seemed he was confessing, but Stevens lays it all out: times, places, dates, car models. The familiarity that I get from these songs is the same I get from a short story collection rooted in a specific setting—the Nevada of Claire Vaye Watkins' Battleborn, the Wyoming of Annie Proulx's Close Range. Sufjan Stevens is embarrassed by this album. He has been commemorating its re-release by disavowing it point-blank. In the essay that accompanies its packaging, he calls it “painful, humiliating, and an utter miscarriage of bad intentions.” He went on NPR recently and stood firm in this rejection in the face of the host's hesitant probing. Didn't he find some pride, comfort, or peace in the fact that his album reached so many people? He attempted to write the story of his mother, another human being whom he never truly understood, and who had taken whatever secrets she held with her. He was just a lost boy, making patterns in the air from his grief. “I don't have any authority over my mother and her life or experience or her death,” he said. “All I have is speculation and my imagination and my own misery… I still don't feel good about myself for making these songs.” Watching Stevens castigate himself for self-loathing by performing more of it in public is poignant and painful. He captured the essential hopelessness of making art to replace a person in fewer lines on the album itself: “Nothing can be changed/The past is still the past/The bridge to nowhere,” he sang on “Should Have Known Better.” “What's the point of singing songs/If they'll never even hear you?” he asks on “Eugene.” Lurking inside Stevens' refutation of Carrie & Lowell, deep beliefs insist themselves: The dead keep their secrets. We are left with nothing when they go save for a handful of cherished misconceptions. Death is real, and it's not for making into art. And yet: What if we belong to other people as much or more as we belong to ourselves? What if our real secrets are not a palmful of baubles we keep inside some protected box, but the stories the loved ones who followed us with their eyes, who lavished their wondering love on us, told themselves? In this view, we don't take secrets with us when we die; we scatter them upon the earth in our passing like a flower releasing pollen. Maybe Sufjan holds more of his mother's secrets than he takes credit for. Maybe the songs Stevens wrote and recorded with his mother's name and face on them represent the only way those of us left living generate warmth for ourselves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bravo has officially found a new cast member for the upcoming 15th season of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” Fashion designer and former reality TV star Rachel Zoe is making her long-awaited return to the network. Zoe announced the news via Instagram in a personal video message to fans. “It's official, I am coming back to Bravo! She continued, “It's been a while and you've been asking me to come back to television, and I said when the stars align or it makes sense or I have enough to say to share with all of you—and now is the time. Really excited to be with all of you again, and I hope you are too, so let's have some fun!” Her casting comes at a pivotal moment for the franchise, which follows the departure of longtime favorite cast member, Garcelle Beauvais. Beauvais confirmed her exit ahead of the Season 14 finale earlier this year. I mean, some amazing things have happened and some hard things have also happened, but it's been a ride nevertheless,” she shared. She added, “Their last year of high school is next year and I want to be a part of that. Since then, Zoe has remained a key figure in the fashion industry and a favorite of the network. Primarily through her digital lifestyle brand and newsletter, “The Zoe Report,” which launched in 2009. In 2024, Zoe made headlines after she and her husband, Rodger Berman, announced their separation. Via a joint statement on Instagram, the couple shared, “After 33 years together and 26 years married, Rodger and I have come to the mutual decision to end our marriage. It included Bozoma Saint John, Sutton Stracke, Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne, Dorit Kemsley, Jennifer Tilly, and Kathy Hilton. However, Bravo has yet to confirm which Housewives will return for Season 15. Fans are expecting to see a fresh blend of fashion, drama, and high-profile storylines. Fans of the show went on to comment on the news, with one writing, “Best casting decision in a long while!</p>
