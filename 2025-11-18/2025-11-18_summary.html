The intervention on behalf of the accused sex trafficker comes as Trump is under fire over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

Online influencer Andrew Tate, a self-described misogynist who has millions of young male followers, was facing allegations of sex trafficking women in three countries when he and his brother left their home in Romania to visit the United States.

“The Tates will be free, Trump is the president. The good old days are back,” Tate posted on X before the trip in February — one of many times he has sung the president's praises to his fans.

But when the Tate brothers arrived by private plane in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, they immediately found themselves in the crosshairs of law enforcement once more, as Customs and Border Protection officials seized their electronic devices.

This time, they had a powerful ally come to their aid. Behind the scenes, the White House intervened on their behalf.

Interviews and records reviewed by ProPublica show a White House official told senior Department of Homeland Security officials to return the devices to the brothers several days after they were seized. The official who delivered the message, Paul Ingrassia, is a lawyer who previously represented the Tate brothers before joining the White House, where he was working as its DHS liaison.

In his written request, a copy of which was reviewed by ProPublica, Ingrassia chided authorities for taking the action, saying the seizure of the Tates' devices was not a good use of time or resources. The request to return the electronics to the Tates, he emphasized, was coming from the White House.

The incident is the latest in a string of law enforcement matters where the Trump White House has inserted itself to help friends and target foes. Since entering office for a second term, Trump has urged the Justice Department to go after elected officials who investigated him and his businesses, and he pardoned a string of political allies. Andrew Tate is one of the most prominent members of the so-called manosphere, a collection of influencers, podcasters and content creators who helped deliver young male voters to Trump. And news of the White House intervention on behalf of the accused sex traffickers comes as Trump is under fire over his ties to notorious child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his administration's recent efforts to stop the public release of the so-called Epstein files.

Ingrassia's intervention on behalf of Tate and his brother, Tristan, caused alarm among DHS officials that they could be interfering with a federal investigation if they followed through with the instruction, according to interviews and screenshots of contemporaneous communications between officials.

One official who was involved and spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid facing retribution said they were disgusted by the request's “brazenness and the high-handed expectation of complicity.”

“It was so offensive to what we're all here to do, to uphold the law and protect the American people,” the person said. “We don't want to be seen as handing out favors.”

It's unclear why law enforcement wanted to examine the devices, what their analysis found or whether Ingrassia's intervention hindered any investigation. The White House and DHS declined to answer questions about the incident.

But law enforcement experts said it is highly unusual for the White House to get involved in particular border seizures or to demand authorities give up custody of potential evidence in an investigation.

“I've never heard of anything like that in my 30 years working,” said John F. Tobon, a retired assistant director for Homeland Security Investigations, which typically analyzes the contents of electronic devices after they're seized by Customs and Border Protection. “For anyone to say this request is from the White House, it feels like an intimidation tactic.”

Tobon said that even if authorities resisted the request from Ingrassia, knowledge that the White House opposed their actions could cause them to be less aggressive than they would normally be: “Anytime somebody feels intimidated or as if they're not free to follow procedure, that's going to stay in the back of their mind because of the consequences. In this administration the consequences are different, people are getting fired.”

Samuel Buell, a Duke University law school professor and former federal prosecutor, called the pressure on behalf of the Tates “another data point” in the White House politicizing law enforcement.

“This is not something that would have been viewed as appropriate or acceptable prior to 2025,” Buell said. “There's a pattern here of severe departure from preexisting norms … that are being tossed aside left and right.”

The Tate brothers' lawyer, Joseph McBride, said he didn't know what happened to the devices but that his clients have still not had them returned. He said it's unclear whether any investigation into their contents is continuing.

His clients, he said, are innocent and there was no illicit materials on their electronics. “There have been multiple investigations against them and nothing has come of it,” McBride said.

Ingrassia worked at McBride's firm before joining the White House, and McBride acknowledged speaking “to Paul from time to time” but couldn't recall discussing the seized devices with him. Ingrassia, he said, has never given the Tates special treatment since joining the Trump administration.

The White House declined to answer questions about whether Ingrassia was acting on his own or representing the White House's wishes.

In a brief interview with ProPublica, Ingrassia denied trying to help the Tates, before hanging up. “There was no intervention. Nothing happened,” he said. “There was nothing.”

Ingrassia's lawyer, Edward Paltzik, said in a text message: “Mr. Ingrassia never ordered that the Tate Brothers' devices be returned to them, nor did he say — and nor would he have ever said — that such a directive came from the White House. This story is fiction, simply not true.”

When questioned about whether Ingrassia had asked authorities to return the devices, even if he did not order them to, Paltzik declined to comment, explaining that “the word ‘ask' is inappropriate because it is meaningless in this context. He either ordered something or he didn't. And as I said, he did NOT order anything.”

A DHS spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the intervention or any impact it might have had on an investigation, only saying in a statement that Customs and Border Protection “performed a 100% baggage examination and detained all electronic media devices when the Tate Brothers entered the country. Electronic media devices were detained and turned over to Homeland Security Investigators for inspectional purposes.”

Ingrassia's work at McBride's small New York law firm included helping to represent the Tate brothers. He has praised Andrew Tate's “physical prowess” on social media along with his “willpower and spirit,” calling him “the embodiment of the ancient ideal of excellence.”

Ethics experts said when government officials take actions to benefit former clients, it undermines public trust.

“The rule of law cannot be carried out if it depends on cronyism,” said Virginia Canter, a former government ethics lawyer who served in the administrations of both parties. “To have a member of the White House interfere when they've had a prior client relationship and some sort of personal relationship, that gives rise to questions of impartiality.”

Trump had nominated Ingrassia to lead the Office of Special Counsel, but the 30-year-old lawyer's chances for Senate confirmation imploded after Politico reported that he had sent a string of racist text messages to fellow Republicans and described himself as having “a Nazi streak.” Paltzik, his lawyer, raised doubts about the authenticity of the texts but said “even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor.”

In a post on X announcing he was withdrawing from his Senate confirmation hearing because not enough Republican lawmakers were supporting him, Ingrassia said he would “continue to serve President Trump and this administration to Make America Great Again.”

Last week, Ingrassia announced he was moving to a new role within the administration, after Trump called him into his office and asked him to serve as deputy general counsel at the General Services Administration.

It's unclear what prompted authorities to seize the Tates' property, but the bar for searching electronic devices is significantly lower for those entering the U.S. compared with those already in the country, even if they are citizens.

After the seizure, the contents were examined by federal agents with Homeland Security Investigations, according to the official involved. A Homeland Security official, who asked for anonymity because they didn't have permission to speak publicly, confirmed that HSI agents scrutinized the contents.

The Tates left the United States in late March.

No criminal charges have been filed against the brothers in the United States, though a lawyer representing four anonymous defendants sued by them in Florida filed court papers this year suggesting that federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York were investigating the pair. No other details have become public, and a spokesperson for the prosecutors' office declined to comment.

In an interview with conservative podcaster Candace Owens soon after landing in Florida, Andrew Tate revealed his devices had been seized, saying they were taken after he refused to give customs officers his passwords.

Tate, who was born in the U.S. but spent much of his childhood in Britain before moving as an adult to Romania, complained that his rights were violated, calling himself “one of the most innocent people on the planet.”

And he said law enforcement officials wouldn't find anything on his devices: “You think I sleep with a phone full of evidence? You think I don't wipe my phone every night? You think I'm dumb? Come get me.”

In that interview, Tate made no mention of a White House official intervening on his behalf and seemingly misidentified state authorities in Florida as responsible for taking his devices.

Shortly after the Tates landed on Feb. 27, Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that Florida authorities had launched an investigation into the brothers. Uthmeier said his office had “secured and executed subpoenas and warrants” and called the brothers' behavior “atrocious.”

“These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying upon women around the world,” he said at the time. “We're not going to accept it.”

The status of the Florida investigation is unclear. A spokesperson for the Florida attorney general declined to comment for this article.

Allegations of sexual abuse and violence have swirled around Andrew Tate for almost as long as he's been in the public eye. In 2016, Tate was booted off the cast of the British version of the “Big Brother” reality series around the time a video emerged of him whipping a woman with a belt. Tate said he and the woman were joking.

Tate's profile only rose afterward, and he began amassing a following as a self-help guru for young men. He quickly aligned himself with Trump's then-young MAGA movement.

“The tate family support trump FULLY. MAGA!” he posted on social media after meeting with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in 2017.

Tate moved to Romania a year after his brief foray in reality TV, in part, he said, because he believed authorities there investigate sex crimes less aggressively.

“I'm not a … rapist but I like the idea of being able to do what I want,” he said.

But in 2023, prosecutors in Romania accused the Tates of operating a criminal group that trafficked women, including some who alleged the brothers led them to believe they were interested in relationships but instead forced them into filming online pornographic videos. Prosecutors also said they were investigating allegations that the Tates trafficked minors. Andrew Tate was charged with rape. The Tates have denied the allegations, and the initial charges against them were sent back to prosecutors by a court because of procedural issues.

The Tates face similar allegations in Britain. Authorities there authorized a raft of charges against the brothers, including rape and human trafficking, based on allegations from three women. In 2024, arrest warrants were issued for the brothers, who have denied wrongdoing, but authorities said they would not be extradited to the United Kingdom until criminal proceedings in Romania were completed.

A woman has also sued the Tates in Florida, accusing them of luring her to Romania to coerce her into sex work. The Tates have denied the allegations, and last month a judge dismissed most of her claims but allowed for her to refile.

This year, Tate derided the allegations against him and compared himself to Trump on X. “Romania? No case UK? No case USA? No case,” he posted on X. “Lawfare? – Im one of the most mistreated men in history beside president Trump himself.”

The intervention on behalf of the Tates was not the first time those around Trump took an interest in legal issues involving the brothers.

In February, Romania's foreign minister said that presidential envoy Richard Grenell told him at an international security conference in Germany that he remained interested in the fate of the Tates. “I did not perceive this statement as pressure,” the foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, said, “just a repeat of a known stance.” Grenell told the Financial Times that he had “no substantive conversation” with Hurezeanu but supported “the Tate brothers as evident by my publicly available tweets.”

            Britain's domestic spy service, MI5, warned lawmakers on Tuesday that China's intelligence services are posing as recruiters to target people who work in Parliament, just weeks after the collapse of a case against two British nationals accused of spying for Beijing.
    


            In an alert, MI5 said that the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) was using websites like LinkedIn to build relationships with parliamentarians, in an effort to “collect sensitive information on the UK to gain strategic advantage.”
    


            Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the House of Commons, circulated the MI5 alert to Members of Parliament (MPs) and warned that Chinese state actors were “relentless” in their efforts to “interfere with our processes and influence activity at Parliament.” He listed two headhunters known to use LinkedIn profiles to “conduct outreach at scale” on behalf of Beijing.
    


            “Let me speak plainly: this activity involves a covert and calculated attempt by a foreign power to interfere with our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests, and this government will not tolerate it,” Security Minister Dan Jarvis told Parliament.
    


            The Chinese embassy in London dismissed the claims as “pure fabrication and malicious slander.” It said it had urged Britain to “stop this self-staged charade of false accusations,” which it said was undermining relations between the countries.
    


            MI5's warning comes after prosecutors last month abruptly abandoned a case against two British men charged with spying on MPs for Beijing, claiming that the government's evidence was missing a “critical element” which meant there was “no other option” but to collapse the case.
    


            That “critical element,” prosecutors claimed, was the government's refusal to call China an “enemy” or “national security threat.” Because the two men – Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, an academic – were charged under the Official Secrets Act 1911, they could only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. Because the British government had not labeled China an “enemy,” prosecutors said they had to drop the case.
    


            Downing Street said no minister, member of the government or special adviser was involved. Instead, Prime Minister Keir Starmer blamed the previous Conservative government, which was in power at the time of the alleged offenses, for wording its policies “very carefully” so as not to describe China as an enemy.
    


            Still, in the wake of the collapse of the case, Starmer was accused of prioritizing the relationship with Beijing over threats to Britain's national security. The episode raised questions about Britain's ability to balance the need to defend itself from espionage and interference while remaining economically engaged with the world's second-largest economy. The Chinese embassy rejected the “baseless” allegations.

            After the collapse, MI5 chief Ken McCallum said Chinese spies posed a daily national security threat to Britain. “When it comes to China, the UK needs to defend resolutely against threats and seize the opportunities that demonstrably serve our nation,” he said in his annual threat update in October.
    


            Without referencing the collapse of the spy case, McCallum said that the National Security Act of 2023 had addressed “longstanding weaknesses” in British legislation and “strengthened our hand against state-backed threats.”
    


            Jarvis, the security minister, said the latest attempts to use headhunters to spy on MPs “builds on a pattern” of hostile activity in recent years. He cited how Beijing-linked actors targeted parliamentarians' emails in 2021 and “attempted foreign interference activity” in 2022 by Christine Lee, a British lawyer accused by MI5 of spying for Beijing.
    


            MI5's latest warning comes weeks before the government must decide whether to approve a huge new Chinese embassy in London. The decision was delayed in August after Beijing refused to explain why the plans contained blacked out areas, and critics have long said the planned complex would pose a security issue. China said Britain had shown a “total lack of spirit of contract” in delaying its decision.
    


            Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow security minister, called on the government to refuse permission for the embassy and said ministers should cancel planned trips to China.
    


            “What message does it send when, despite an attack on this House and our Parliament, ministers are happily jetting off to stride down red carpets with the government responsible?” Kearns said.

Critics accuse the US president of trying to ‘shut women journalists up' with ‘demeaning language'

Donald Trump, who has a history of making extremely personal attacks on female journalists, referred to a Bloomberg News correspondent as a “piggy” during a clash onboard Air Force One on Friday.

While the remark did not initially get much attention, it picked up some traction on Tuesday and has drawn backlash from fellow journalists, including some who have previously been attacked by Trump themselves.

Catherine Lucey, Bloomberg's White House correspondent, had taken advantage of a press opportunity with the president – known as a gaggle – to ask a question about the unfolding Jeffrey Epstein scandal and the possibility of the House voting to release all of the files related to his case, which now appears likely.

As Lucey started to ask why Trump was behaving the way he was “if there's nothing incriminating in the files”, Trump pointed at her and said: “Quiet. Quiet, piggy.”

CBS News reporter Jennifer Jacobs first reported that Trump called a Bloomberg News reporter “piggy”, though she did not specify who it was.

“Disgusting and completely unacceptable,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper wrote on X, sharing a clip of the incident. Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson also called the remark “disgusting and degrading”.

When asked about the incident, Lucey directed the Guardian to a spokesperson for her news organization. Multiple representatives for Bloomberg News did not respond to requests for comment. The White House Correspondents' Association, which has released statements in the past defending journalists who faced attack from Trump, did not respond to requests for comment.

The insult is a familiar one for Trump. Alicia Machado, who won the Miss Universe pageant in 1996, has said that Trump once called her “Miss Piggy” and told her to lose weight. Trump owned the pageant at the time.

April Ryan, a longtime White House correspondent, was referred to as “Miss Piggy” by Trump administration official Lynne Patton in 2018 – though Patton apologized for the remark. (Trump himself called Ryan a “loser” who “doesn't know what the hell she's doing” that same year.)

In an interview with the Guardian, Ryan said that Trump's attack on the Bloomberg reporter was beneath the dignity of the presidency.

“The president of the United States is supposed to be the moral leader, the leader of the country, and he's acting like some thug on the street,” she said. “It's one thing for his minions to say that, but for him to call a woman that? That also shows how upset he is about the Epstein files. It lets us know that there's probably some fire there.”

Speaking rhetorically, she said to Trump: “Be careful how you call people names when you are in the pig pen yourself getting ready to go up for the slaughter.”

She also encouraged Lucey to keep asking tough questions. “She did the right thing by asking, and he wanted to intimidate her, and I pray that she fights on.”

In 2018, the International Women's Media Foundation (IWMF) called on the White House to be more respectful toward female journalists, referencing “recent demeaning language from the president against female journalists of color”.

Elisa Lees Muñoz, the IWMF's executive director, told the Guardian that Trump's “piggy” remark is more of the same. “President Trump's targeting of women journalists is nothing new,” she said. “His appearance-based insults are gendered attacks meant to shut women journalists up.

“While name-calling may seem harmless, coming from the head of our government, it often sets in motion a torrent of abuse towards the journalist, which not only impacts her ability to work, but also sends a chilling message to other women journalists who are confronting him with hard-hitting questions.”

Asked for comment about Trump's insult, a White House official blamed Lucey. “This reporter behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional way towards her colleagues on the plane,” the person claimed, offering no evidence for this allegation. “If you're going to give it, you have to be able to take.”

When asked what specifically the reporter had done that was inappropriate, the White House did not respond.

“People care less about labels than results,” Wilson has said, regarding criticism of her democratic socialist views.

During a meeting on Monday regarding the upcoming FIFA World Cup in North America next year, President Donald Trump threatened to move the games out of Seattle, citing the personal politics of Mayor-elect Katie Wilson.

Wilson, who identifies as a democratic socialist, took part in an election against incumbent Mayor Bruce Harrell two weeks ago. But because the race was very close, it wasn't until Thursday, when Harrell conceded, that Wilson was named as mayor-elect. 

Trump claimed Wilson's political ideology was reason to cancel the six games scheduled in the city.

“If we think there's going to be a sign of any trouble, I would ask [FIFA president] Gianni [Infantino] to move [games] to a different city,” Trump stated at the White House meeting. 

The president further complained that he viewed Wilson as a “very, very liberal-slash-communist mayor.”

“I don't think we will have this problem, but we will move the event to some place it will be appreciated and safe” if he feels the need for it, Trump added. 

Infantino, who took part in the meeting, responded by saying fans would “experience a safe and secure World Cup.” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said her agencies are “communicating with all these mayors about what their responsibilities are.”

Despite Trump's suggestion that Seattle would be unappreciative of the games, Seattle is considered the 13th best city when it comes to sports in the U.S., outranking Chicago, Baltimore, Houston, and more, according to an analysis from WalletHub. When it comes to soccer specifically, Seattle is considered the third-best city in the country — meaning that revoking its opportunity to host the World Cup would be a proverbial slap in the face to fans in Seattle.

Days before Trump's statement, Wilson sought to address her constituents who might have concerns about her democratic socialist beliefs.

“People care less about labels than results,” the mayor-elect wrote in a Bluesky post on Friday. “I was elected on the promise that all Seattle citizens should have access to a dignified life, regardless of their background or income.”

Within the platform outlined on her campaign website, Wilson calls for Trump-proofing the city — including sustaining vital services amid potential federal cuts “by raising new progressive revenue,” protecting immigrants and refugees from threats of deportation, defending LGBTQ communities, preserving reproductive rights, and more.

Trump has threatened to slash federal funding to several cities with left-leaning leadership, including New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral election earlier this month. In a “60 Minutes” interview prior to that election, Trump called Mamdani, who is also a democratic socialist, a “communist” and “far worse than a socialist.”

“It's going to be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York. Because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there,” Trump said. 

Days later, Trump walked back his comments somewhat. While speaking at a business forum in Miami, Trump said, “let's see how a communist does in New York,” adding, “we'll help him, a little bit, maybe.”

María Corina Machado pens a ‘freedom manifesto' as plan to force Nicolás Maduro from power remains unclear

Venezuela's top opposition leader, the Nobel laureate María Corina Machado, has declared her country “at the edge of a new era” as Donald Trump refused to rule out a ground invasion to topple its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, but also signalled he was open to talks.

Machado, who has lived in hiding since her movement's candidate was widely believed to have beaten Maduro in last year's presidential election, made her claim in a “freedom manifesto” that was published on Tuesday as uncertainty continued to shroud the South American country's future.

“This regime's long and violent abuse of power is ending. A new Venezuela is emerging from the ashes, renewed in spirit and united in purpose, like a phoenix reborn – fierce, radiant, and unstoppable,” wrote Machado, who claims to have a plan for the first 100 hours and 100 days after Maduro leaves power.

Machado, who has not provided specific details of those plans, claimed a change of regime would protect Venezuela from “future oppressive tyrannies, dictatorships, and despots” and create a country where government opponents could “walk from the shadows without dread”.

“The criminal regime must be held accountable,” for its brutality, added Machado, 58, a conservative politician who was the surprise winner of last month's Nobel peace prize.

She predicted Venezuela was poised for a “rebirth” after years of economic chaos, environmental destruction, violence and a mass exodus that has seen an estimated 8 million Venezuelans flee overseas. “We will bring them home,” Machado vowed.

But such claims have been made many times before and it remains unclear how Machado and her allies plan to fulfil their longstanding quest to force Maduro, who has ruled since 2013, from power.

Since August, Trump has ordered a massive naval buildup off Venezuela's northern coast, seemingly hoping to spark a military rebellion against Maduro or convince him to quit. The state department announced a $50m reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest – twice the value offered for the capture of the al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. On Sunday, the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, arrived in the Caribbean Sea. “Trump has put the gun on the table,” his former national security adviser, John Bolton, told CNN. “The question now is, is he going to use it against Maduro or not?”

So far, however, there has been no inkling of a split in Maduro's regime and Trump has yet to pull the trigger on further military action.

Speculation that Trump was poised to order airstrikes on Venezuela reached fever pitch last weekend. “Lots of people – even high up in the opposition … were convinced that it was about to happen, that bombs were about to fall,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for the International Crisis Group, adding: “[But] the bombs didn't fall.”

On Sunday, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, announced that as of next Monday, the US would declare the Cartel of the Suns – the supposed drug cartel it accuses Maduro of running – a foreign terrorist organization, offering a potential justification for an attack. Some observers read that move as an ultimatum for Maduro to decide on his future within the week.

“But we know that for Trump these deadlines don't mean a lot. He blows through deadlines – or he short-circuits them by acting as he did in the case of Iran, [launching his June strikes on its nuclear sites] while the clock was still ticking on his deadline,” Gunson added.

On Monday, Trump refused to dismiss the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Venezuela – and said he didn't “rule out anything” – but also anticipated negotiating with Maduro. “I probably would talk to him, yeah. I talk to everybody,” the US president said.

The ratcheting up of the pressure has left many South American governments on edge, fearing chaotic repercussions and bloodshed if Maduro's regime is brought down. Given Trump's well-known aversion to sending US troops abroad, many suspect that even if Maduro is removed – and key opposition leaders can fly home from exile – the new US-backed government will struggle to control a potentially volatile security situation or the start of an insurgency.

Others believe that even if Maduro falls, his shoes might simply be filled by another even more unsavoury authoritarian.

Saab's GlobalEye proposal comes on top of its previous pitch to create Canadian jobs if Ottawa buys the Gripen fighter jet, shown here in Lindköping, Sweden, last week.Felix Odell/The Globe and Mail

Swedish defence company Saab is intensifying its campaign to secure Canadian aircraft sales by offering to build the entire GlobalEye military surveillance plane in Canada if the Department of National Defence orders it.

In an interview at the Saab factory in Linköping, in southern Sweden, David Moden, senior sales director for the GlobalEye, said that building the entire aircraft in Canada would create 3,000 jobs. “We are offering a made-in-Canada solution by building and installing the plane's sensors there,” he said.

The GlobalEye is based on Bombardier's 6000-series long-range business jet, which is assembled at Toronto's Pearson airport. The plane, minus its interior fittings, is flown to Linköping, where it is completely stripped down and rebuilt into an airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) plane with an array of highly sophisticated radar and sensors.

Saab's offer would see the company transfer the technology to Canada. The jobs created, he said, would include those in aircraft maintenance and development.

This offer comes on top of Saab's previous pitch to generate 10,000 new Canadian jobs if DND were to buy the Saab Gripen fighter jet, which would be entirely built in Canada. Saab is looking for foreign partners to build the aircraft as new orders arrive because the Linköping factory lacks the capacity to double or triple construction rates. 

As previously reported in The Globe and Mail, Saab is in talks with Bombardier BBD-B-T and the Canadian government to build the Gripen in Canada, almost certainly at a new factory in Ontario or Quebec. The new factory could also make Gripens for Ukraine, whose President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has said he wants 100 to 150 of the jets.

Canada is in the market for new military surveillance jets to replace the old CP-140 Aurora aircraft. In 2023, then-defence minister Bill Blair announced that Canada would purchase up to 16 P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft for about $10.4-billion. The plane is based on Boeing's twin-engine 737 Next Gen passenger jet. 

It's not known whether DND would buy the GlobalEye as well, though it and the Poseidon planes have different mission profiles. The Poseidon focuses on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare; the GlobalEye is a long-range aircraft detection and tracking machine. 

But Canada is keen on developing advanced-technology research, engineering and construction jobs, which Saab is offering to provide if Ottawa buys the GlobalEye or the Gripen or both. 

Opinion: A Canadian-made Swedish fighter jet may kick-start a domestic defence aerospace industry. But at what cost?

The GlobalEye, which is far smaller than the Poseidon, has been ordered by the United Arab Emirates and Sweden, and may be bought by France. Its radar is capable of detecting aircraft, missiles or drones as far as 650 kilometres away. It can also detect – and identify – objects on the ground, such as tanks, and on the sea, including submarine periscopes that break the sea surface. 

“The sensors and the radar are the best in the world,” said Weston Pike, the Canadian pilot who is the GlobalEye's flight test engineer. “You can see everything happening in the air, the ground and on the seas. It can give you complete area intelligence.”

The Gripen made Canada's short list several years ago to replace the aging CF-18 fighter jets. The winner was Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth jet. Canada ordered 88 of the highly expensive aircraft, but has paid for only 16 of them. None of them would be built in Canada, though some 30 Canadian companies supply the aircraft with parts. None is considered a prime contractor for the aircraft.

The purchase of the remaining 72 aircraft was put under review by Mark Carney shortly he became Prime Minister in March. The review has yet to be published. 

It is broadly known that the Royal Canadian Air Force favours the F-35 and is wary of running a dual fleet of fighters. But the promise of thousands of new jobs, and building a military aerospace engineering, development and supply chain that can feed the export market, has tempted some cabinet ministers, including Industry Minister Mélanie Joly.

Saab will extend its sales pitch for both aircraft Tuesday through Thursday of this week during the royal visit of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia to Canada. Their entourage is to include senior Saab executives, Swedish Defence Minister Pal Jonson, Swedish Industry Minister Ebba Busch and representatives of some 60 Swedish companies.

In an interview in Stockholm last week, Mr. Jonson confirmed that he will be meeting with his Canadian counterpart, David McGuinty, as well as Bombardier CEO Éric Martel.

He said that Sweden's small size means that it doesn't have the capabilities to pump out Gripens in great quantities as new orders arrive. “We're not looking for clients, we're looking for partners,” he said. “For us, being a smaller country, it is vital for us to share maintaining the cost of that [Gripen] platform and enhancing it during its lifecycle span.”

Palestinians in Gaza tell CNN that they "reject" the United Nations Security Council's passage of a US-drafted resolution aimed at reconstructing the devastated enclave and forming a lasting peace. The resolution authorized elements of the plan, including the creation of a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, according to a draft seen by CNN. Palestinians say they do not want "foreign forces on the ground" in the enclave.

MOSCOW, November 18. /TASS/. The Chess Federation of Russia (CFR) has appealed to the Ethics and Disciplinary Commission of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) to open disciplinary proceedings against Vice-President of the European Chess Union (ECU) Malcolm Pein, according to a document obtained by TASS on Tuesday.

In October, the Telegraph daily published an interview with Pein, in which he spoke about how important chess was in Russia and called for resorting to all measures to uphold sanctions against Russian chess players, even using political levers of pressure.

During the 2024 FIDE General Assembly in Budapest, Pein contacted "with governmental structures like the Embassies of the United Kingdom, the Untied States of America, [the US] State Department, Ukrainian Ministry of strategic procurement," the document reads.

"Mr. Pein acknowledges his own involvement… in the direct influence on the decision" to keep sanctions against Russian chess teams, according to the document.

"Having said all the above, CFR respectfully requests EDC to open disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Malcolm Pein and apply sanction for the conduct and statements as described above. For the sake of completeness, CFR is of the opinion that the appropriate sanction would be an exclusion from office and/or a ban on taking part in any chess-related activity for a period of 12 months, and requests to apply the said," the document added.

The FIDE General Assembly rejected a proposal to reinstate in full Russian and Belarusian chess players' participation in tournaments, and allow them to play under the national flag and to the tune of the national anthem. The delegates voted in favor of conducting consultations with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), regarding a possibility of a partial admission of Russian and Belarusian players in international chess team events.

In July, FIDE allowed the Russian women's national team to participate in the World Team Championship under the FIDE banner and the ECU opposed this decision.

On Sunday afternoon, former U.S. vice-president Kamala Harris told a packed crowd in Toronto to stop saying “sorry” so much. Someone in the audience immediately chirped back, “We're Canadian!” and laughter rippled through the auditorium. 

For the third or fourth time that afternoon, we got to hear Harris's infectious guffaw, unscripted and light. In a lot of ways, we saw a Harris almost entirely different from the one who campaigned for the American presidency last year – a more relaxed, less frantic version of the former vice-president, who in 2024 was forced to slap together a presidential campaign in just over three months.

Perhaps the most refreshing thing about Sunday's talk at Meridian Hall, a promotional event for Harris's recent memoir 107 Days, was the extent to which Harris's answers diverged from her book. Celebrity book tours have a habit of parroting whatever content's on sale at the gift shop, but that didn't happen here – many of the insights were new. “This is not a campaign event,” Harris said with a laugh, after catching herself listing her accomplishments rather than answering a question directly.

Here are four revelations from Harris's Toronto tour stop that expanded on the themes of 107 Days – as well as a few brand new take-aways.

Book Review: Regrets? Kamala Harris has a few

Gen Z will shape the future of politics – and the way we talk about it online

Harris spent much of Sunday's talk discussing the power of young adults in modern politics: “I love Gen Z,” she said. “I love this generation.”

“Gen Z are demographically a larger population than boomers,” she continued, rattling off stats. “They have only known the climate crisis. They lost critical phases of their education and socialization during the pandemic. It is estimated they will have, in their lifetime, 10 to 12 jobs, whereas older generations came out of college with that one job, where they then retired.”

According to Harris, the power of Gen Z rests mostly in the generation's ability to decipher misinformation and disinformation. As technologies such as AI chatbots and social media continue to evolve, young people will continue to be a valuable asset as society wrestles with fake news, overseas political influence and increasingly lifelike deepfakes.

“Gen Z is not watching the evening news,” she said. “They're getting a lot of their information on TikTok and Instagram. As we are thinking about the future of democracy, the future of society, one of the issues we have to confront and really think about is this issue of how we share accurate information.”

Opinion: TikTok, Trump and the MAGA megaphone

Harris ‘cares deeply' about the relationship between the United States and Canada

In the first 10 minutes of her talk, Harris made a point of referencing the hot-and-cold relationship between the U.S. and Canada since President Donald Trump took office in January.

“I have many Canadian friends,” she said, recounting her time as a high schooler in Montreal and shouting out her extended family in Mississauga. “I care deeply about this relationship between the United States and Canada.”

She revisited the topic toward the end of the event: “I am convinced the strength of the relationship between nations is completely and almost entirely dependent on the strength between the people of those nations,” she said. “Let's have some faith in the fact that we still do have those relationships between people. That will carry us through these specific moments of conflict or crisis.”

Predictably, a few Trump jabs

When asked to contrast her campaign against Trump's agenda, Harris took a swipe at the President's leadership style: “There is some perversion coming from [Trump's] camp that the measure of strength is based on who you beat down, instead of what we know to be the real measure of strength, which is who you lift up,” she said, calling Trump's rhetoric towards disadvantaged communities “garbage.”

“I was raised with a sense of understanding that we each have a responsibility to serve, no matter your profession,” she continued.

In addition to her experience of losing the 2024 election – which she discusses at length in 107 Days – Harris recalled the feeling of winning a very different Trump election nearly a decade ago.

“I was elected to the United States Senate the same night that Trump was elected for the first time,” she said. “It was a very bittersweet personal experience because I thought we were going to have our first woman president that night. So I went to the Senate with a completely different agenda than I thought I had.” 

While Harris experienced several career milestones while in the Senate – including Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's controversial Senate hearings – the time in office came with a number of personal sacrifices, including missing her stepdaughter Ella's high school graduation, she said.

Hope for the future – and the importance of investing in local communities

Throughout the event, Harris returned to the idea of optimism – even when such a thing can feel impossible as fascism rises around the world.

“There are moments of darkness,” she said. “But the fight, from my perspective, is born out of a belief in what is possible. It is born out of a sense of optimism about what we can do, and what can be.”

For Canadians looking to improve the world around them, Harris suggested that they should invest their time into local non-profits, which, in the U.S. and Canada, are often stretched similarly thin.

“Human behaviour has a lot to do with what people are hopeful about,” she said. “Figure out in their community where there are non-profits doing the work you care about. There are non-profits doing a range of good works that would love to hear from you, to figure out how you can contribute to what they're doing. Sometimes it's baking cookies, sometimes it's doing whatever needs to be done, writing things, knocking on doors.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit Turkey on Nov. 19 to "reinvigorate negotiations" with Russia, the Ukrainian president announced on Nov. 18. 

The trip comes as the last publicly known direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia took place almost four months ago, with no tangible progress toward ending Russia's war despite U.S.-led efforts.

"We are preparing to reinvigorate negotiations, and we have developed solutions that we will propose to our partners," Zelensky, who is visiting Spain on Nov. 18, said. "Doing everything possible to bring the end of the war closer is Ukraine's top priority."

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff will also visit Turkey and join possible talks with the Ukrainian president, Reuters reported on Nov. 18, citing an unnamed Turkish source. 

The Kyiv Independent reached out to the U.S. Department of State for confirmation.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said no Russian representatives would be present in the country, noting that "for now, these contacts are taking place without Russian participation."

"We will wait for information about what will actually be discussed in Istanbul," he added.

Zelensky said he is set to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Nov. 19, where he plans to discuss possible paths toward a "just and lasting peace" for Ukraine.

"And this, I think, will be a sufficiently substantive conversation," he added.

Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed source, that Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan might communicate the results of the talks to the Kremlin.

A source in Ukraine's Presidential Office offered "no comment" when asked about the possible presence of Russian representatives during Zelensky's visit.

The Ukrainian president said Kyiv intends to revive prisoner of war exchanges with Moscow, stressing that the goal is to "restore" the process and "bring Ukrainian prisoners of war home."

This comes just days after Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov visited Istanbul on Nov. 11 to work on "unblocking" the stalled exchange process.

Although he did not announce direct talks with Russia, Umerov later said the parties had "agreed to activate the Istanbul arrangements" on the release of 1,200 Ukrainians held in Russia.

More than 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers are reportedly still held in Russian captivity.

Ukraine and Russia held several rounds of negotiations in Istanbul earlier this year, resulting in the exchange of thousands of prisoners and the repatriation of the remains of fallen soldiers.

Talks have not produced movement toward a ceasefire or a broader settlement.

U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to broker a deal between Kyiv and Moscow have stalled, as Russian President Vladimir Putin refused to compromise on his demands and declined to meet Zelensky. 

A planned summit between Trump and Putin in Budapest was also canceled after Washington reportedly concluded Moscow would not agree to a ceasefire.

Kyiv, backed by the U.S. and European governments, has called for a ceasefire along current front lines. Moscow has rejected the proposal and continues to demand that Ukraine cede the entire Donbas region.

On Nov. 11, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) Chernyshov was charged with illicit enrichment as part of a large-scale corruption case involving state nuclear power company Energoatom.





Ukraine's General Staff said that this is "a significant development that underscores Ukraine's unwavering commitment to its sovereignty."

"We are preparing to reinvigorate negotiations, and we have developed solutions that we will propose to our partners," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.



Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said both suspects crossed into Belarus shortly after the explosion.



"Several enemy infantrymen tried to penetrate and gain a foothold at one of the agricultural facilities," the 7th Corps said. "The enemy was destroyed."

On Nov. 11, Chernyshov was charged with illicit enrichment as part of a large-scale corruption case involving state nuclear power company Energoatom. 

At the time of the attack, around 11 p.m., there were no employees or other workers at the site. 



The United States Congress will renew its efforts to move forward in an attempt to pass a Russia sanctions bill into law, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham announced on Nov. 17.

A seventeen-year-old girl was killed and nine others were injured in an overnight Russian missile attack on the city of Berestyn in Kharkiv Oblast on Nov. 18, regional authorities said.

Purported videos posted on social media appear to show a large explosion and subsequent fire emanating from the Zuivska Thermal Power Plant in the occupied community of Zuhres in Donetsk Oblast, following a projectile strike on the target.

            Italian model and entrepreneur Pamela Genini had what many might consider an enviable life. The 29-year-old Milan resident was a successful real estate agent focused on high-commission seaside properties. A thriving influencer who was discovered on a popular reality TV program a decade earlier, she had just launched her own swimwear line with an influencer friend.
    


            In a country where the rate of unemployment and precarious employment for the under-30s is stubbornly high, Genini had broken the mold.
    


            But one evening in mid-October, Genini's 52-year-old ex-boyfriend Gianluca Soncin is alleged to have entered her apartment and fatally stabbed her. Police were called but arrived to find her dead on her balcony. Soncin was at her side, the investigating judge in the case said.
    


            Soncin, currently in solitary confinement awaiting formal charges, faces accusations of voluntary homicide, cruelty, stalking, and premeditation. His lawyer told CNN he had not yet answered any questions about what happened.
    


            Genini was the 72nd victim of femicide – usually defined as when a girl or woman is killed because of her gender, often by a current or former intimate partner – in Italy in 2025, according to the observatory group Non Una Di Meno (Not One Less), which keeps a tally of such killings. Four more women have been killed since Genini, according to the group, including Luciana Ronchi, 62, and 80-year-old Vanda Venditti. Six more cases are being examined as potential femicides.
    


            Last year, there were 116 cases of femicide, according to Non Una Di Meno, a slight decrease from the previous two years.
    


            Three years ago, Giorgia Meloni became Italy's first female prime minister. Critics question whether she has done enough since to tackle increasing rates of violence against women in the country, or challenge persistent inequality in the workplace. Official figures show that birth rates dropped by 6.3% in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, and that some Italian women earn up to 40% less than men in the same jobs.
    


            Italy's battle with femicide goes back decades. Meloni's government has passed anti-stalking legislation tied to previous femicides, and has made domestic violence an aggravating factor in sentencing, meaning those who are convicted in domestic violence cases now face longer prison terms for offenses, including life sentences in some cases.
    


            But many believe Meloni has not done as much in terms of prevention as they had expected.
    


            Meloni's Education Ministry last week pushed forward a law that upholds the current ban on teaching sex education in kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, a curriculum long seen by experts as a precursor to educating young people about domestic violence and consent, with an eye to prevention.
    


The live-streamed murder of two women and a girl has shocked Argentina



            Meloni, who changed the name of the long-standing Ministry for Equal Opportunity to the Ministry for the Family, Birth Rate and Equal Opportunities upon her election, has framed the continuing ban on sex education as a way to prevent the introduction of “woke gender theory” in schools.
    


            But opposition groups argue that denying young people exposure to basic sex education keeps the country grounded in its patriarchal past. “While Europe moves forward, Italy is returning to the Middle Ages,” opposition parliamentarian Alessandro Zan said last week.
    


            Meloni's office declined CNN's request for comment on the issue, but she has in the past denied being against advancing women's interests. As a single mother who supports the traditional family, she has insisted that it is “ridiculous” to accuse her of not doing enough for women.
    


            “It's fake news against me,” she said recently, in an address she posted on her TikTok account. She consistently points to her government's pledge to expand parental rights and give tax breaks to families based on the number of children they have. The Ministry for the Family, Birth Rate and Equal Opportunities also declined to comment.
    


            Italy is one of the last European countries not to have compulsory sex education in the public school system, despite evidence cited by the United Nations that effective sex education offers an opportunity to teach about gender-based violence.
    


            It's not just the potential for domestic violence that makes being a woman in Italy feel so challenging. Parity indicators, which include employment and confidence in having a family, are increasingly dismal. In 2024, Italy's already low birth rate fell once again, to 1.18, marking the 16th year in a row of steady decline, according to Italy's ISTAT national statistical institute. Provisional figures for the first seven months of 2025 showed a further drop, to 1.13.
    


            Women are blamed for not having babies, including by Meloni, who has touted the traditional family and pushed forward legislation criminalizing surrogacy and allowing anti-abortion activists to access clinics. At an event in 2023, Meloni said too many young women were being pressured to focus on their careers first, and put off having children.
    


            Her critics say, however, that she has done little to help provide affordable child care options, despite campaign promises ahead of the 2022 election that launched her to power. Instead, proposed plans to build day-care centers were slashed from her first budget.
    


            The ISTAT fertility report identifies several factors in the declining birth rate, including an increasingly small pool of potential parents due to the lower number of babies born in the country since the 1970s. “Employment insecurity, particularly the prevalence of temporary work contracts, and low wages, also have a heavy impact on Italy's falling birth rate,” the study says.
    


            Ariana Ricci, a 32-year-old human resources manager, voted for Meloni's hard-right Brothers of Italy party in 2022, hoping she would prioritize efforts to tackle wage disparity, reproductive rights, and women's safety. Ricci, who graduated from the prestigious Bocconi University in Milan, also studied overseas but says she wants to stay in Italy and be successful there, raise a family and own her own home.
    


            At the moment, however, she's renting a room in a student apartment-share in Rome in order to avoid moving back in with her parents. She says she's barely able to pay her rent and utility bills. She is easily employable on paper, but falls into the “precarious” job set, meaning no one will give her the coveted permanent contract, which comes with job security and ample benefits, but which research shows tends to be offered first to men.
    


New York became ‘too crazy' so she moved to an Italian village, met her husband and started a family



            Ricci works on temporary contracts, which do not afford her job security, but have become an increasingly common way for companies to avoid paying generous benefits, especially mandatory maternity leave. Men are not granted paternity leave in Italy.
    


            “If I were to start a family on a temporary contract, I wouldn't get my maternity leave paid, I wouldn't get my job back, and I couldn't afford childcare even if I did have a job to go back to,” she said. “What incentive is that to have a family?”
    


            She had hoped a female leader would see the bind many young, employable women seem to be in. “I'm seeing a focus on international affairs instead,” she told CNN. “Meloni has made Italy look great abroad, but she has forgotten us here in Italy in many ways.”
    


            The World Economic Forum's 2025 Global Gender Gap Report ranks Italy 85th out of 148 countries on issues like economic participation and opportunity, education, health, and political empowerment.
    


            While Italy has risen two rankings since Meloni's election, it remains among the lowest-placed countries in Europe for the overall gender gap. Notably, Italy fell to 117th place on women's economic participation, dropping six points since the 2024 report.

            Women's participation in Italy's labor market has slumped in the past two years to a rate of 41.5% while men enjoy nearly 60% participation. And they earn up to 40% less than men in some sectors, according to the Global Gender Gap Report.
    


            Only 39% of management positions in Italy are held by women, and just 7% of Italian companies have female CEOs, according to research published last year by the Bocconi School of Management's Executive Women Observatory.
    


            Elly Schlein, the leader of Italy's main opposition Democratic Party, has been one of the most vocal critics of the Meloni government's record on women's issues.
    


            Asked on a TV program last week about new budget cuts proposed by Meloni's government that are currently under debate in the Italian senate, Schlein said: “The hardest hit are women. When you cut welfare, schools, and funding for services for people with disabilities, the burden of care falls on families, and within families, on women.”
    


            But not all women agree. Beatrice Costa couldn't be happier with Meloni as she sits at a coffee bar in central Rome, holding her six-month-old baby in her arms. Her three-year-old is around the corner in a state-run nursery school until lunchtime.
    


            “I feel like I have permission to be a mother,” Costa told CNN, explaining that she had felt pressure growing up to have a career over family, or at least start her career first before thinking about becoming a mother. “The pressure not to have children is strong, the pressure to work outside the home, to give up the dream of having a family, to just get a dog instead, is hard to fight.”
    


            Costa, who has a university degree in communications, had already given birth to her first child when Meloni was elected. “I don't know if we had a second child because of her focus on the traditional family, or if we would have anyway, but I'm glad I am empowered to be a mother,” she said, adding that her husband has a good job as a tax accountant and that they were given a home by her parents, who also help with childcare.
    


            “Some might say I have it easy, but I feel like I'm carrying out an Italian tradition and finally I have permission to do it.”

In October, University of Montreal computer scientist Yoshua Bengio reached an extraordinary milestone. According to the academic search engine Google Scholar, he is the first living person to be cited in research literature more than one million times.

Dr. Bengio was born in France and raised and educated in Montreal. A pivotal figure in the discoveries that underpin the AI revolution, he can rightly be called an example of Canadian science at its best – a homegrown genius whose impact is global and, now, record-setting.

But in the world of science and technology, having an all-star player does not guarantee a profitable team. 

Like his prize-winning counterparts, Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto and Richard Sutton at the University of Alberta, Dr. Bengio's work has kept Canada at the forefront of artificial intelligence research. Nevertheless, a list of the world's top 50 AI companies compiled this year by Forbes includes only one Canadian entry and Canadian businesses have been slower than others to adopt the technology.

Opinion: Ottawa's blind spot on applied research makes productivity an afterthought

AI is not the only field where Canadian expertise has not correlated with economic benefits. Based on a new report, anyone looking for signs of an innovation-fuelled renaissance to address the challenges the country faces has reason to worry.

The report, issued Tuesday by the Council of Canadian Academies, takes a comprehensive look at the state of science and technology in Canada – the first such assessment since 2018. At its focus is the role that research and development plays in economic growth across the country. 

Like previous iterations, the report demonstrates that investment in Canadian R&D is historically weak. But what is striking about this latest snapshot is that those investments are continuing to decline relative to global competitors, and at an accelerating rate. 

Given Canada's fractured trade relationship with the United States, China's emergence as an R&D superpower, and the sweeping changes anticipated from AI and other technologies, the report concludes that innovation is playing a key role in the country's productivity crisis. 

Because innovation drives productivity and is central to economic performance, the low rate of R&D portends higher costs and a falling standard of living. According to the report's authors, solving that problem will require more than a single policy initiative or tax incentive.

“We need a new partnership between government and business to change the trajectory of the innovation across our entire economy,” said Ilse Treurnicht, an entrepreneur and former chief executive of Toronto's MaRS Discovery District, who chaired the expert panel behind the report. 

By design, reports from the federally funded Council of Canadian Academies do not make recommendations. In theory, this allows governments to take on board the council's findings and arrive at their own policy decisions. In practice, it means politicians can avoid appearing as though they are not acting when action is recommended. 

Yet the report, based on an 18-month investigation, has managed to be emphatic that action is required. In so many words, it suggests a major rethink of Canada's approach to innovation is required – in particular in how it trains, encourages and utilizes the country's intellectual capital. 

For industry, that means viewing brainpower like it typically treats minerals, timber and other natural resources: as a critical asset and a source of national wealth. For leaders in government and academia, it means a concerted focus on what the report calls the country's greatest weakness: the underused capacity of Canadians to create prosperity through innovation. As the report makes clear, a failure to address the issue comes with tangible consequences.

“Canada is going down the path of no longer being able to afford things we need, like health care and defence, and things we want, like social programs,” said David Castle, a professor of science, technology and innovation policy at the University of Victoria who was not involved in the report but reviewed its findings.

“Leaders across all sectors should study the report because we are experiencing decades of system-level failure to get ahead of the problem,” he said.

Economies can be compared using a measure called “research intensity” – meaning how much a jurisdiction spends on research and development relative to its gross domestic product. Last year, for example, Canada collectively spent $55-billion on R&D, which translates to a research intensity of about 1.8 per cent. 

In comparison, the 38 countries that make up the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development had an average research intensity of 2.7 per cent in 2023, the most recent year for which figures are available. That is significantly higher than Canada, which does not make the list of the top 20 countries with the highest research intensity.

The underperformance comes in spite of Canada having greater than average spending on R&D in its higher education sector, particularly at its most research-intensive universities.

Where Canada lags is in the amount of research conducted by its government agencies, but especially in its business sector, where investments hover around 1 per cent, or about half the OECD average.

In the past, this disparity has sometimes been chalked up to a large resource sector that may be less dependent on innovation than other kinds of industries. The new report maintains this is not enough to explain the gap – or the continued decline relative to the global average since 2000.

Other factors include a shift from manufacturing to a more service-based economy in Canada — although a similar dynamic has not prevented the business sector in the U.S. from making above-average investments in R&D. In Canada, however, the report finds that the lion's share of business R&D investments is concentrated in a few industrial sectors and the majority of investments come from small to medium-sized companies with fewer than 250 employees. 

Panel members found that two barriers to engagement in R&D were typically cited by business leaders. One was the overall risk and uncertainty inherent in the process and the other, a shortage of skilled individuals to pursue innovation.

Elicia Maine, a panel member and professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C., said both barriers could be addressed in part by promoting the needed expertise in Canada.

“Uncertainty can be a benefit, and it can be managed,” she said. 

In addition to conducting less R&D activity relative to other countries, Canada's business sector is less likely to make use of innovations created elsewhere.

In hard numbers, the report found that the willingness of Canadian businesses to adopt new technologies dropped from 32 per cent in 2017 to 19 per cent by 2022.

“The piece that I think is a bit scary is the most commonly cited reason for not using advanced technologies – by a wide margin – is that it is not viewed as applicable or necessary for the business," said Dr. Treurnicht. 

Whereas, in the past, Canadian companies may have succeeded by being as innovative as they needed to be, the pace of technological change and growing competition could puts a premium on more forward-looking strategies. 

If there is an area where government can play a useful role, it is by facilitating a more effective transfer of innovation from universities into the private sector, said Peter Morand, a consultant and former dean of science and engineering at the University Ottawa, who was not involved in the report. But such an effort would need to be a broad and well-defined priority.

“If the government really wants to improve our productivity and improve the economy, there has to be an all-of-government commitment to do that,” he said.

The report identifies the higher education sector as a bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming research ecosystem, but with an important caveat.

Based on the percentage of its population with postsecondary accreditation, Canada is often counted among the most educated countries in the world. This reputation rests in part on the organization of the school system in Quebec, where CEGEP – a level of education that students complete between Grade 11 and university or college – is counted as postsecondary in global metrics.

From an innovation perspective, what matter more is that Canada is underrepresented in the proportion of its population with an advanced degree – including a master's or a PhD. The net effect is that there are fewer people trained in the highest levels of any technical area.

The deficit becomes a problem in industry when those skills are needed to onboard leading technologies that could confer competitive advantage.

It also squares with earlier data, including a 2014 report, released by the council as well, which found positive attitudes toward science in Canada, but less direct connection to employment than other countries with comparable economies.

The report underscores the need not just for more advanced education but for education that is integrated with the business sector to address the country's long-standing productivity shortfall.

“We could mitigate it if we taught innovation skills to the people who are going to be innovating,” Dr. Maine said.

While the panel's conclusions echo those of earlier reports, they do so with a more diverse and larger array of data.

A final takeaway message is that the country has not measured enough to understand why efforts to change its R&D track record have not succeeded.

“If we're serious about building a real innovation economy, we have to really up our analytical capacity,” Dr. Treurnicht said.

            Thai police have arrested two men after they intercepted a pickup transporting dozens of monkeys inside mesh bags and a quantity of methamphetamine, authorities said, in one of two cases that saw 143 monkeys rescued from suspected wildlife smugglers in a single day.
    


            Thailand is an international hub for wildlife trafficking, one of the world's biggest illegal trades estimated to be worth between $7.8 and $10 billion per year, according to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.



            In the first case, rangers were patrolling in southeast Thailand's Khlong Hat District, near the border with Cambodia, when they heard “unusual animal noises” coming from a sugarcane field, according to a press release from Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation (DNP).
    


            After checking the area, the authorities found 10 plastic baskets hidden in the sugarcane containing 62 long-tailed macaques, a monkey native to Southeast Asia which is widely used in drug development because its DNA closely mirrors that of humans.
    


            There is also a thriving black market for the species, which is considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
    


            The monkeys – 44 males and 18 females – were bound inside blue nylon mesh bags, according to the press release.
    


            The monkeys were in a weakened state and were transferred to a local wildlife rescue center.
    


            Later that afternoon, rangers were patrolling in neighboring Aranyaprathet District when they spotted two men unloading blue mesh bags from a pickup truck on a country road near the Cambodian border, the DNP said.
    


            After a car chase, police arrested two male suspects, who they identified as Thai nationals.
    


            Inside the car they found 81 long-tailed macaques – 30 males, 51 females – tightly packed in mesh bags, as well as methamphetamine, according to the release. The monkeys were also transferred to the wildlife rescue center for treatment.
    


            The suspects are facing offenses related to possessing and trading protected wildlife without permission, as well as charges for possessing and consuming illicit drugs, the DNP release said.
    


            According to a police statement, the suspects in the second case said they were hired to smuggle the monkeys into Cambodia.
    


            “The discovery of consecutive cases like this confirms that the border area remains a target for wildlife trafficking networks, especially for long-tailed macaques, which are in high demand internationally,” said Somruek Suppamitkrisana, Director of the Wildlife Conservation Division.
    


            Earlier this year, Thai police arrested a man after he was found with two baby orangutans in a basket at a gas station in Bangkok.
    


            Last November, Thailand repatriated home to Myanmar almost 1,000 highly endangered tortoises and lemurs, which they recovered during an anti-trafficking operation.
    


            In March 2024, an endangered red panda was found alongside 86 other animals inside luggage at Bangkok airport, bound for Mumbai, customs authorities said.

The national flag flies in front of China's central bank in Beijing in 2022. In Canada, China has built a US$21.3-billion portfolio of official-sector finance, according to an investigation by U.S.-based AidData.Andy Wong/The Canadian Press

A sweeping investigation into the scale of Beijing's overseas lending has found that China has amassed a global lending portfolio worth more than US$2-trillion – a figure at least twice what earlier estimates suggested.

The totals uncovered in the study by the U.S.-based AidData, which draws on more than two decades of dealmaking across 30,000 projects, offer the most complete picture to date of China's overseas lending and point to a system far larger and more complex than official reporting has suggested.

A significant and growing share of China's lending since 2000 has gone to high-income and upper-middle-income countries, supporting thousands of projects across North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific in sectors such as energy, transportation and advanced technology.

The findings from the international-development finance lab, based at the College of William & Mary in Virginia, upend the prevailing view that China's overseas lending is concentrated in lower-income countries participating in its “Belt and Road” infrastructure push.

In Canada, China has built a US$21.3-billion portfolio of official-sector finance – loans channelled through policy banks, state-owned enterprises and other government-linked institutions. The total excludes purely private corporate investment by Chinese firms. 

Of the acquisition financing linked to those state-directed flows since 2000, 95.7 per cent has targeted sectors that Canada and other OECD countries often regard as “sensitive” – areas tied to national security, critical minerals and other strategic assets. Within those deals, the largest share – 71 per cent – went to mineral resources, with the balance concentrated in energy and industrial production.

The trend accelerated during a surge of dealmaking in the 2010s, led by Chinese state-linked firms through deals such as Sinopec's investment in Daylight Energy, CNOOC's takeover of Nexen and financing tied to Rio Tinto's acquisition of Alcan, as well as dozens of smaller transactions across mining, energy and industrial production.

Opinion: We are on the cusp of a new world order. Canada must act decisively to shape it

The investments in Canada mirror a global shift in Beijing's overseas activity, as China channels increasing amounts of capital into advanced technology, transportation, energy and critical minerals in wealthier economies.

The researchers reconstructed the portfolio by tracking 30,000 projects linked to more than 2,000 Chinese donors, revealing a footprint that was “much, much larger than anyone previously understood,” co-author Brooke Escobar said in an interview ahead of the report's publication on Tuesday.

The United States is the single largest recipient, with more than US$200-billion flowing into about 2,500 projects – followed by the EU's 27 member states, which together have borrowed US$161-billion. Other major destinations include Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands.

“There are very few places in the world where Chinese lending operations are not taking place,” Ms. Escobar said. The report notes the US$2.2-trillion amount is four times larger than some estimates. 

China's use of opaque financial structures and offshore channels has made its portfolio increasingly difficult to track. “What we actually find is kind of an offshoring effect on both sides,” Ms. Escobar said. Loans booked through foreign branches and routed through shell companies “make it so that these types of transactions essentially become invisible.”

Beijing is shifting away from reputation-building aid and toward a harder-edged model of global finance. The government “is focused on cementing its position as the international creditor of first – and last – resort that no one can afford to alienate or antagonize,” the authors wrote. “Beijing is not seeking to burnish its reputation as a global do-gooder.”

The country is increasing its use of collateralized lending, including arrangements where repayment is guaranteed by revenue streams unrelated to the projects being financed. Ms. Escobar said these structures – such as infrastructure loans backed by oil income in Iraq – have become more common in energy and mineral-rich countries and strengthen Beijing's leverage over borrowers.

A “fundamental re-orientation” away from economic development and social welfare in recipient countries has prompted Western governments to rethink how they support their own industries overseas. G7 countries have begun cutting aid budgets, expanding investment in national security and asserting greater control over strategic assets, the report found. 

China unveils zero-tariff deal for Africa, capitalizing on Trump chaos

Measures such as the Minerals Security Partnership, formed in 2022 by a group of G7 members and the European Union, direct financing into foreign mining and processing projects to reduce reliance on China for minerals used in advanced manufacturing and defence technologies.

China's acquisition activity appears to be accelerating in those strategic sectors. Beijing is securing approvals for roughly 80 per cent of overseas takeovers in “sensitive” areas, a rate the authors say is rising as the economic superpower concentrates on jurisdictions with weaker screening regimes and offshore structures that attract less regulatory attention.

The new figures show that China remained the world's largest official creditor in 2023, lending about US$140-billion to public- and private-sector borrowers worldwide – more than twice that of the U.S. and nearly US$50-billion higher than the World Bank, the largest multilateral source of development finance.

Beijing's expansion is also bringing a flood of cheaper money – a dynamic that has influenced bidding in sectors where Canada is active, including critical minerals.

“Chinese companies can bid more easily because they borrow at far below market rates,” Ms. Escobar said.

In October, Chinese President Xi Jinping told an assembly of world leaders at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing that his flagship policy, launched in 2013, had “boosted the flow of goods, capital, technology and human resources into the countries involved.”

WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) – The United States will expedite visas for foreign visitors with tickets to FIFA World Cup matches taking place next year in 11 U.S. cities, President Donald Trump said on Monday.

Washington will set up a scheduling system for visa-interview appointments that prioritizesforeign fans attending World Cup matches, which will take place from June 11 to July 19. Mexico and Canada will also host matches.

Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that government agencies had worked “to ensure that soccer fans from all around the world are properly vetted and able to come to the U.S. next summer easily.”

The president said his administration had sped up visa issuance for people in most countries, with the wait time now 60 days or fewer. He said the World Cup could generate $30 billion and create 200,000 jobs.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department added 400 consular officers to process visas, doubling the presence in certain countries.

“The U.S. is offering prioritized appointments so fans can complete their visa interviews and show they qualify,” Rubio said.

At the White House, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said 5 million to 10 million people would come to the U.S. for matches.

Over one million tickets have been purchased so far by fans from 212 countries, FIFA said.

In a statement, the football governing body said ticket holders would receive more information about the priority visa appointment system in early 2026.

BROOKFIELD, Vt.—Six generations of John Klar's family farmed in the Green Mountains of Vermont, yet he had never baled hay or raised animals.

But in the late 1990s, spurred by chronic illness, he left his law firm, returned with his wife and children to the countryside of his youth and bought a family farm.

UN, November 18. /TASS/. The US resolution on the Gaza Strip, adopted by the UN Security Council, is another "pig in a poke," Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN, stated after the vote.

"President [US Donald] Trump's plan did not indicate that they would engage in the demilitarization of Gaza and the disarmament of local groups, using all available means. The resolution, however, assigns the mission such peacekeeping tasks that they could turn it into a party to the conflict and take it beyond the scope of peacekeeping. As far as we understand, none of the potential troop-contributing countries signed up for this. At the same time, we note that the council members were essentially given no time to work conscientiously and seek compromises. <…> To sum it up, the document presented by the United States is another pig in a poke. Essentially, the Council is giving its blessing to the American initiative on parole of Washington," he stressed.

            A federal court Tuesday blocked Texas from using its newly drawn congressional map in next year's midterms, ruling that the map is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
    


            The ruling, which is likely to be appealed, is a major setback for President Donald Trump and Republicans, who had made Texas the centerpiece of a national campaign to redraw maps ahead of the midterms. Republicans in Texas had aimed to produce as many as five more seats favorable to Republicans next year at the president's behest.
    


            The court ordered Texas to use its previous map, which the state enacted after the 2020 census.
    


            US District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed to the bench by Trump in 2019, wrote that the challengers were “likely to prove at trial that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.”
    


            The three-judge panel that heard the case split 2-1, with Obama appointee David Guaderrama joining Brown. Reagan appointee Jerry Smith opposed the decision.
    


            Texas Democrats who fought the GOP-led effort – including by leaving the state to delay the passage of the map – celebrated Brown's ruling.
    


            “A federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, who leads the Texas House Democrats.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who called the special sessions for the legislature to create the new map, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge has dismissed a Trump administration legal challenge to New York policies that block immigration officials from arresting people at state courthouses, saying the federal government can't force states to cooperate with those enforcement efforts.

U.S. District Judge Mae D'Agostino late Monday granted New York's motion to dismiss the government's lawsuit, one of several legal actions from the Republican administration targeting state and local policies over immigration enforcement. 

The lawsuit challenged a 2020 state law banning federal immigration officials from arresting people who are coming and going from New York courthouses or in court for proceedings unless they have a warrant signed by a judge. The law, called the Protect Our Courts Act, was approved in response to enforcement actions at courthouses during President Donald Trump's first term. The law doesn't cover federal immigration courts.

In its lawsuit, the Department of Justice claimed that the New York law and two related state executive orders were unconstitutional because they obstructed the execution of federal immigration authorities. 

D'Agostino, though, found that New York's decision not to participate in enforcing civil immigration law is protected by the 10th Amendment, which sets boundaries on the federal government's powers.

“Fundamentally, the United States fails to identify any federal law mandating that state and local officials generally assist or cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Nor could it,” the judge wrote. “No such federal laws exist because the Tenth Amendment prohibits Congress from conscripting state and local officials and resources to assist with federal regulatory schemes, like immigration enforcement.”




The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a Tuesday email seeking comment about the ruling, including whether it plans to appeal.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose office argued for the lawsuit to be dismissed, said she was fighting for the “dignity and rights of immigrant communities.”

“Everyone deserves to seek justice without fear,” James said in a statement. “This ruling ensures that anyone can use New York's state courts without being targeted by federal authorities.”

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to invest $1 trillion into the U.S. economy over the next year.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman committed his country to increasing his planned investment into the U.S. economy to nearly $1 trillion over the next year on Tuesday.

MBS made the announcement while meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, saying the investments will take place across the U.S. economy. Trump initially stated that the investment would amount to "at least" $600 billion, but the Saudi leader confirmed the higher amount during his remarks.

"You've agreed to invest $600 billion into the United States and because he's my friend, he might make it a trillion, but I'm going to have to work on him. But it's 600. We can count on 600 billion. But, that number could go up a little bit higher," Trump said Tuesday.

"That means investments in plants, in companies, money on Wall Street. And what it really means for everybody, what really counts is jobs. A lot of jobs. We have a lot of jobs," Trump added.

Bin Salman vowed to meet the $1 trillion number just minutes later during comments to the press.

Today and tomorrow, we are going to announce that we are going to increase that, that $600 billion to almost $1 trillion of investment, real investment and real opportunity in many areas," he said.

"You know, that's great. I appreciate that. That's great. We're doing numbers that nobody's ever done. And in all fairness, if you didn't see potential in the U.S, you wouldn't be doing it," Trump replied.

"Definitely," bin Salman said.

"You don't want to lose money," Trump joked.

Trump rolled out the red carpet for the Crown Prince on Tuesday, greeting the Middle Eastern leader outside the White House flanked by dozens of U.S. servicemembers. It represents a return to the fold for Saudi Arabia after the country was largely shunned under former President Joe Biden's administration.

            • Saudi meeting: President Donald Trump downplayed potential conflicts of interest while hosting Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. He defended the Saudi leader as he dismissed questions about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The president also said he got a “positive response” from bin Salaman about joining the Abraham Accords.
    


            • Epstein vote: The House will soon vote on a bipartisan bill to compel the DOJ to release all of its case files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. At a news conference earlier, GOP Reps. Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene urged the House to advance the legislation as Epstein abuse survivors shared their stories. Democrats are pushing for the GOP to quickly take up the bill in the Senate if it passes the House.
    


            • Johnson and Trump express support: House Speaker Mike Johnson said this morning he will support the bill, though he raised concerns with how it is written. This comes after Trump, in a stark reversal, encouraged House Republicans to vote in favor and said he would sign a measure to release the Epstein files.
    


            President Donald Trump dismissed a question about the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, claiming that the Saudi dissident journalist was “extremely controversial” and that raising the subject in his meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was meant to embarrass his visitor.
    


            “You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you liked him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,” Trump said in the Oval Office.
    


            “Things happen,” Trump said later, going on to insist Prince Bin Salman — who the CIA assessed likely ordered the murder — wasn't involved.
    


            “He knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that. You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump said.
    


            President Donald Trump downplayed potential conflicts of interest between his family's business and the country of Saudi Arabia, saying in part that he has “nothing to do with the family business.”
    


            “I have nothing to do with the family business. I have left, and when I — I've devoted 100% of my energy. What my family does is fine. They do business all over. They've done very little with Saudi Arabia. Actually, I'm sure they could do a lot, and anything they've done has been very good,” the president said.
    


CNN reporting from earlier this year showed that the Trump family's business ties to the Middle East have more than tripled since the president's first term in office.
    


            The White House has repeatedly downplayed any appearance of a conflict of interest with the president's family business.
    


            “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt had previously told CNN.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters as he entered the Capitol on Tuesday that “once the House passes the bill to release the Epstein files, I'm going to move on the floor so that the Senate take it up immediately.”
    


            He added, “The American people have waited long enough and they want to see what's in it.”
    


            In a separate statement just before speaking with reporters, Schumer said that if Senate Majority Leader John Thune “tries to bury the bill, I'll stop him.”
    


            Asked about Speaker Mike Johnson's argument that the bill needs some changes, Schumer replied, “We've waited long enough.”
    


            President Donald Trump began his remarks in the Oval Office by praising Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's record on human rights.
    


            “We have a extremely respected man in the Oval Office today, and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine, and I'm very proud of the job he's done,” Trump said as their meeting was starting.
    


            “What he's done is incredible, in terms of human rights and everything else,” he said. “And he's the crown prince, the future king.”
    


            Tuesday is Prince bin Salman's first visit to the White House since 2018, the same year the Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. The CIA later assessed Prince bin Salman likely ordered the killing.
    


            Human rights groups have also criticized the kingdom for its extensive use of the death penalty and restrictions on free expression.
    


            As President Donald Trump was escorting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman into the Oval Office today, they lingered along the West Colonnade, where Trump has installed a lineup of presidential portraits he dubs the “Presidential Walk of Fame.”
    


            The display features images of Trump's predecessors, except for President Joe Biden, whose spot is taken by an image of an autopen. It's an allusion to Trump's accusations that Biden didn't approve some of his own policies, something the former president denies.
    


            Trump has personally been fixated on Biden's autopen use, CNN previously reported, and in June ordered an investigation into his actions and autopen use in a memorandum that cites Biden's “cognitive decline.”
    


            The “Walk of Fame” is one of many gold-trimmed additions Trump has made to the White House — features many have noted bear resemblance to gilded palaces in places like Saudi Arabia.
    


            Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, called out President Donald Trump for not ordering the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files, noting that this didn't have to come to a vote in Congress.
    


                    “I want to remind the president as well, that he has the power to release the files today. He has the power to release the files without a vote. In fact, a few months ago, the Oversight Committee put in place a subpoena for all of the files through the Department of Justice, and still they have released nothing,” Garcia said during a news conference on Capitol Hill.
                





            “So, at the end of day Donald Trump can, today, bring justice to the survivors and he refuses to do so,” he added.
    


            Garcia also slammed the president for his stark reversal in the matter and raised concerns about Trump's ultimate end game.
    


            “After saying that he would release the files during the campaign, after his attorney general said the files were on her desk, he then flip flops, has been doing everything in his power to stop the release of the files and stop justice for the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's horrific sexual trafficking ring,” Garcia said, adding that Trump only reversed his position again after “seeing a loss in the House.”
    


            He continued, “We're not going to forget his opposition. And we need to be clear-eyed that this new investigation that he has launched” could potentially be “another way to stop the release of the files to Congress, to the public” and block justice for survivors.
    


            Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly urged the Senate to hold a vote on House legislation that would compel the full release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.
    


                    “We got a little bit more work ahead of us. But my hope is that Leader John Thune will do the right thing and bring this legislation to the floor of the Senate, and allow a vote,” Kelly said at a news conference on Capitol Hill.
                





            He argued that the expected vote in the House today on the bill to release the Epstein files “hasn't come easy.”
    


            “Powerful people, like the president of the United States and the speaker of the House, have tried very hard to keep the whole truth from coming out,” he said, also accusing them of making Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva wait to be sworn in “just to delay accountability.”
    


            “We're going to need your help on the other side of the Capitol, making sure that Senate leadership doesn't delay this any further,” he said to advocates. “They need to schedule a vote on this so this can pass this into law.”
    


            Grijalva – who was the decisive signature on a petition to force a House vote on the matter – said the House “vote, this transparency and accountability are long overdue.”
    


                    “There are going to be people trying to frame this as a hoax, a distraction, or a partisan fight. To them, I say: You cannot call it a hoax when real survivors are standing right here,” the Arizona Democrat said.
                





            She called the House vote “a milestone, not the finish line” and called on the Senate to pass the bill.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson had long refused to bring the bill to the House floor, arguing it would not sufficiently protect victims of Epstein's crimes, and acknowledged a successful discharge petition was the driving force behind it coming up for a vote.
    


            But he said Tuesday he spoke with Senate Majority leader John Thune about changing the bill to address those issues.
    


                    “I called my counterpart in the Senate, Leader Thune, and I talked him through this with him and shared our deep concerns and of course they share those concerns as well. And so I'm very confident that when this moves forward in the process, if and when it is processed in the Senate – which it's no certainty that that will be – that they will take the time methodically to do what we've not been allowed to do in the House, to amend this discharge petition and to make sure that these protections are there,” Johnson told reporters.
                





            Johnson disputed that his support for the measure was a “reversal” from his previous position.
    


            “It's not a reversal,” he said. “As I just explained, we had big problems with the discharge from the moment it was filed. We talked with the authors. There was lots of people that went and pleaded with them to fix it so that everybody could be together because we've been for maximum transparency.”
    


            He continued: “But again there's a reason you have rules and processes here to ensure this is not done haphazardly. And I was not satisfied with that. But I've been for maximum transparency from the very beginning. We wanted the process to play out.”
    


            A line of mounted dark horses escorted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's limo up the White House driveway, kicking off an elaborate diplomatic display that is essentially a state visit in everything but name.
    


            Military bands trumpeted the prince's arrival, and a flyover of fighter jets — including F-35s, the same kind Donald Trump says he'll sell to Riyadh — buzzed overhead as the US president welcomed the Saudi leader to the South Lawn.
    


            Delegations from both countries lined an orange carpet, and an honor guard stood at attention as Prince bin Salman emerged from his Mercedes to greet Trump. They shook hands, and Trump grasped the prince's shoulder, before they smiled for a photo-op.
    


            The trumpets blared, the honor guard saluted, and the two men walked into the South Portico.
    


            Tuesday's visit isn't classified as a state visit, but only because the crown prince isn't Saudi Arabia's head of state — his father, 89-year-old King Salman, is.
    


            But in pulling out all the diplomatic stops, Trump is signaling the importance of Saudi Arabia to American interests, and his respect for the prince.
    


            As the House prepares to vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, President Donald Trump is welcoming Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House.
    


            The two leaders are expected to hold a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office later today. Agreements on artificial intelligence, nuclear energy and defense sales are expected to emerge from today's meetings, a senior US administration official said ahead of the talks.
    


More on the visit: It's Prince bin Salman's first visit to the White House in more than seven years and has all the trappings of a state visit, sources familiar with the matter said. The visit cannot be classified as an official state visit as Prince bin Salman is not Saudi Arabia's head of state. That position is occupied by his 89-year-old father, King Salman.
    


            Still, Trump is pulling out all the stops including, a welcome ceremony in the morning and a formal dinner in the evening.
    


            Trump has worked to cultivate a close relationship with the kingdom's de facto ruler in the hopes he will decide to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, which would be a major advancement of the president's signature Abraham Accords — a longtime goal.
    


            Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky argued President Donald Trump's reversal in favor of releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files bolsters his support within the party.
    


            “What he's doing this week is strengthening his position by coming on board, and we're glad to have him,” Massie said on Tuesday when asked if he thought Trump has diminished his appeal to the GOP base over how he's handled the Epstein files.
    


            The congressman said he hasn't spoken with Trump “in the last few hours” about Epstein.
    


            Asked when the last time he spoke to the president about the matter, the congressman responded, “The last time he tweeted about me was a few hours ago. I suppose he didn't approve of my recent marriage.”
    


            The president called Massie a “loser” in a Truth Social post late last week and mocked him for getting remarried recently after his late wife passed away last year.
    


            “I'm sorry I didn't invite you to the wedding,” Massie said he would tell Trump, adding, “I'm glad you're on board today and make sure this bill gets through the Senate without getting mucked up.”
    


            Massie was hesitant about potential amendments in the Senate to Epstein legislation if it passes the House.
    


                    “They want to amend the bill to protect survivors. I think some of them would like to amend the bill to protect the pedophiles, and if we see any inkling of that, that bill needs to be killed immediately,” he said.
                





            House Speaker Mike Johnson says he plans to support releasing all of the Jeffrey Epstein files when it comes to a vote in the House later today.
    


                    “I'm going to vote to move this forward,” the speaker said at a press conference Tuesday morning.
                





            Johnson said he'd support the bill even though he raised serious concerns with how the legislation is written.
    


            The leader told his Republican colleagues in an earlier closed-door meeting that he planned to vote for the bill on the House floor.
    


            While Johnson's support of the bill comes after months of trying to delay or prevent the effort from coming to the floor, it marks an acknowledgment that the bill has overwhelming Republican support.
    


            Johnson has called the effort a “moot point,” given the House Oversight Committee has its own extensive investigation into Epstein underway, and he has raised concerns over whether the legislation as written properly protects victims.
    


This post has been updated with additional developments.



            Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva and other members of Congress are standing with abuse survivors ahead of a House vote on a bill to compel the Justice Department to release its case files related to Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            Grijalva provided the decisive 218th signature that allowed a bipartisan effort to force a vote on the measure to move forward.
    


            Agreements on artificial intelligence, nuclear energy and defense sales are expected to emerge from Tuesday's meeting between President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a senior US administration official said ahead of the talks.
    


            The visit, which will feature the highest trappings of American diplomacy, is Prince bin Salman's first trip to the White House since 2018. The men are expected to announce further details of the $600 billion that Riyadh pledged to invest in the US when Trump visited the kingdom in May.
    


            On Monday, Trump said he was planning to approve sales of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, a step that could cause consternation in Israel, the only nation in the Middle East with the American-made jets.
    


            The White House said the visit would demonstrate Trump's ability to secure deals.
    


                    “Thanks to our Dealmaker-in-Chief, the United States secured $600 billion in historic investments during the President's visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, and Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement.
                





            GOP Rep. Thomas Massie called arguments that his legislation doesn't protect Jeffrey Epstein's victims a “red herring,” when asked about House Speaker Mike Johnson's calls for the Senate to amend the bill.
    


                    “That's been a red herring all along. The survivors have always been in favor of this legislation. And there's a provision in there you could read, if he would just read it, that protects them,” he said at a press conference on Capitol Hill with Epstein abuse survivors.
                





            Johnson on Monday indicated that he would vote to release the Epstein files on the condition that the Senate make changes so that “we have the protection of victims and whistleblowers.”
    


            Massie said Tuesday that if the Senate were to amend the bill, then the House would have to vote on the measure again.
    


            “Justice delayed is justice denied. It could be just another delay tactic,” he said.
    


            The congressman also accused Johnson of supporting the bill because the speaker “wants to save face.”
    


                    “He's going to vote for a piece of legislation today that he's disparaged for four months. However he needs to come on board, we want him on board. So we appreciate that,” Massie said.
                





            Sky Roberts, brother of the late Epstein abuse victim Virginia Giuffre, urged lawmakers to vote “yes” on the discharge petition to release the Jeffrey Epstein case files.
    


            Giuffre, one of the most prominent and outspoken survivors of Epstein's abuse, died by suicide earlier this year.
    


            “Today we find ourselves in a place of deep sorrow, shattered by the loss of our beloved sister, yet we are honored and privileged to carry her voice forward and continue her relentless fight alongside her fellow survivor sisters,” Roberts said, before reading a passage from Giuffre's memoir.
    


            In emotional remarks remembering his sister, Roberts spoke on the “monumental impact” she had on this effort to bring justice.
    


            “We demand justice, accountability, and support for survivors,” Roberts said. He said justice starts by first acknowledging that what happened is true.
    


                    “Your vote carries that weight. My sister is not a political tool for you to use. These survivors are not political tools for you to use. These are real stories, real trauma. And it's time for you to stop just talking about it and act. Vote yes,” Roberts said.
                





            Haley Robson, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse, said she's “grateful” to President Donald Trump for pledging to sign the bill to release the Epstein files, but that she “can't help to be skeptical.”
    


            “And to the President of the United States of America, who is not here today, I want to send a clear message to you. I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files, and I'm grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill. I can't help to be skeptical of what the agenda is.
    


                    “So with that being said, I want to relay this message to you: I am traumatized. I am not stupid. I am traumatized. I am not stupid. You have put us through so much stress,” she said.
                





            She blamed Trump for the “halt” of “these procedures that were supposed to have happened 50 days ago,” citing the delayed swearing-in of Rep. Adelita Grijalva, who delivered the final signature on the Epstein discharge petition.
    


            Robson also said she would stand beside Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene “in solidarity” if the Georgia Republican decides to read the names from the victims' list of alleged abusers from Epstein's orbit on the House floor.
    


            Jena-Lisa Jones, an abuse survivor, said she met Jeffrey Epstein when she was just 14-years-old.
    


                    “I was a child. I was in ninth grade. I was hopeful for life and what the future had held for me. He stole a lot from me … at 14. So just a little reminder there for everybody,” Jones said, growing emotional during her remarks and holding up a photo of herself at age 14.
                





            Jones and many of the survivors gathered on Capitol Hill this morning brought photos to show how young they were when they met the late convicted sex offender.
    


            The House will vote during its 2 p.m. ET vote series on the bill that would compel the Justice Department to release all of its Jeffrey Epstein case files.
    


            During the same series, lawmakers will vote on a measure from Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington sanctioning her colleague Rep. Chuy García of Illinois for the timing of his decision to retire.
    


            Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky addressed the difficult odds he and other lawmakers faced in bringing the discharge petition to force a House vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein case files.
    


                    “We've fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win,” Massie said during a news conference on Capitol Hill, quickly adding that they are now “on our side today.”
                





            “I didn't know that we would succeed when Ro (Khanna) and I started this effort. Most discharge petitions never make it,” he said, remarking on the “long odds” of getting to this point.
    


            He also thanked the Epstein abuse survivors for coming forward and giving hope to other survivors of sex crimes. He also commended the Republican women – Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace – who signed onto the petition and stood firm with them.

WASHINGTON (AP) — National Public Radio will receive approximately $36 million in grant money to operate the nation's public radio interconnection system under the terms of a court settlement with the federal government's steward of funding for public broadcasting stations.

The settlement, announced late Monday, partially resolves a legal dispute in which NPR accused the Corporation for Public Broadcasting of bowing to pressure from President Donald Trump to cut off its funding. 

On March 25, Trump said at a news conference that he would “love to” defund NPR and PBS because he believes they are biased in favor of Democrats.

NPR accused the CPB of violating its First Amendment free speech rights when it moved to cut off its access to grant money appropriated by Congress. NPR also claims Trump, a Republican, wants to punish it for the content of its journalism. 

On April 2, the CPB's board initially approved a three-year, roughly $36 million extension of a grant for NPR to operate the “interconnection” satellite system for public radio. NPR has been operating and managing the Public Radio Satellite System since 1985.

But the CPB reversed course under mounting pressure from the Trump administration, according to NPR. The agency redirected federal interconnection funds away from NPR to an entity that didn't exist and wasn't statutorily authorized to receive it, NPR says.

CPB attorneys denied that the agency retaliated against NPR to appease Trump. They had argued that NPR's claims are factually and legally meritless.




On May 1, Trump issued an executive order that called for federal agencies to stop funding for NPR and PBS. The settlement doesn't end a lawsuit in which NPR seeks to block any implementation or enforcement of Trump's executive order. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss is scheduled to preside over another hearing for the case on Dec. 4.

The settlement says NPR and CPB agree that the executive order is unconstitutional and that CPB won't enforce it unless a court orders it to do so.

Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, said the settlement is “a victory for editorial independence and a step toward upholding the First Amendment rights of NPR and the public media system.”

Patricia Harrison, the corporation's CEO, said in a statement that the settlement marks “an important moment for public media.”

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Education Department is handing off some of its biggest grant programs to other federal agencies as the Trump administration accelerates its plan to shut down the department. 

It represents a major step forward for the administration's dismantling of the department, which has mainly involved cutting jobs since President Donald Trump called for its elimination with an executive action in March. 

Six new agreements signed by the Education Department will effectively move billions of dollars in grant programs to other agencies. Most notable is one that will put the Department of Labor over some of the largest federal funding streams for K-12 schools, including Title I money for schools serving low-income communities.

Department officials said the programs will continue to be funded at levels set by Congress. They did not say whether the changes would bring further job cuts at the department, which has been thinned by waves of mass layoffs and voluntary retirement offers.

“The Trump Administration is taking bold action to break up the federal education bureaucracy and return education to the states,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement. “Cutting through layers of red tape in Washington is one essential piece of our final mission.”

The action leaves in place the Education Department's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio and its funding for students with disabilities, though McMahon has suggested both would be better managed by other federal departments.




McMahon and her staff have spent months hammering out the deals, which allow the department to lop off large parts of its footprint without action from Congress. It's being done through formal agreements that agencies often make with one another when their work overlaps.

The Education Department tested the idea in June with a deal that moved adult education programs to Labor. The new agreements take it a step further and lay the groundwork for more.

Officials say the new agreements provide a “proof of concept” as the administration works to persuade Congress to close the agency. The goal is to convince Congress that the deals should be cemented into legislation, eliminating a need for the department.

Under the new plan, Labor will oversee almost all grant programs that are now managed by the Education Department's offices for K-12 and higher education. Along with the $18 billion Title I program, that includes smaller funding pools for teacher training, English instruction and TRIO, a program that helps steer low-income students to college degrees.

It will effectively outsource the department's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and Office of Postsecondary Education, two of the agency's largest units. Two major roles of the postsecondary office will remain with the Education Department: oversight of student loan policy and the accreditation of colleges for eligibility to receive students' federal financial aid.

States and schools should not expect any disruptions in their funding, the department said, but their federal money will now come from the Department of Labor.

Another deal will put Health and Human Services in charge of a grant program for parents who are attending college, along with management of foreign medical school accreditation. The State Department will take on foreign language programs. Interior will oversee programs for Native American education.

Opponents have urged against such a shake-up, saying it could disrupt programs that support some of the nation's most vulnerable student populations. Some argue that other agencies don't have the expertise that schools and families rely on at the Education Department. Some also question the plan's legality, noting that legislation requires the Education Department to oversee some of its operations in-house.

Department officials say their plan is legally sound and argue it will make programs more efficient.

McMahon has increasingly pointed to what she sees as failures of the department as she argues for its demise. In its 45 years, she says it has become a bloated bureaucracy while student outcomes continue to lag behind. She points to math and reading scores for the country's K-12 students, which plummeted in the wake of pandemic restrictions.

Her vision would abolish the Education Department and give states wider flexibility in how they spend money that's now earmarked for specific purposes, including literacy and education for homeless students. That, however, would require approval from Congress. The task is complicated by the fact that some of the department's core work has long had bipartisan support.

The new deals are part of a broader plan to prove that America's schools and colleges can operate without the department. As part of the plan, officials say McMahon will continue touring the country to highlight the successes of local schools — and she will also spend more time making her pitch to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright discusses renewable energy demands, gas prices and artificial intelligence needs on 'Special Report.'

A project heralded by Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy and accelerated by President Donald Trump stands to deal a huge blow to China's dominance in the nanotechnology, energy and automotive sectors as the GraphiteOne project near Nome uncovered vast reserves — for which Beijing previously accounted for 90% of production.

As of 2024, the U.S. was at least 93% import-dependent on both rare earth elements (REEs) and graphite itself, according to the International Energy Agency, and the Graphite Creek deposit near Nome has already been dubbed the largest such tranche in the U.S.

But, this week's announcement that REEs were discovered in addition to the graphite lode portends a step-up that the U.S. can take against the CCP through Trump's "American energy dominance" agenda, according to a source familiar with the situation.

TRUMP CALLS XI'S RARE EARTH MOVE A ‘BAD MOMENT' — WHY IT MATTERS FOR US NATIONAL SECURITY, CHINA TIES

Batteries, renewable energy technology, fiberoptics, lights, magnets and consumer electronics like phones and tablets rely on REEs, which often places the U.S. at a manufacturing disadvantage — accentuated by China's 2024 export limits on magnet-related REEs, according to PRNewswire.

GraphiteOne President Anthony Huston said the Nome discovery is proof of a "truly generational deposit" at the Graphite Creek site. Some of the materials from the site will be shipped to an advanced graphite and battery anode material plant in Ohio.

Huston confirmed the presence of two Defense Production Act-qualifying materials and said that given the "robust economics of our planned complete graphite materials supply chain, the presence of Rare Earths at Graphite Creek suggests that recovery as a by-product to our graphite production will maximize the value."

REEs found include neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, along with ore rock containing garnet deposits. The site's chief geologist noted that garnets can absorb certain REEs into their mineral structure.

In his State of the State address earlier this year, Dunleavy praised the GraphiteOne project as the largest such in North America and encouraged it to continue moving forward with the support of both Juneau and Washington.

Huston said Dunleavy rightly understood the role of Alaska as a crucial American source of metals and minerals "transforming the 21st century" and making the U.S. less reliant on foreign sources, including "entities of concern."

CHINA WEAPONIZED SCIENCE AGAINST THE US. WE'VE FIGURED OUT A KEY ELEMENT THEY MISSED

Outside of Alaska, REEs have been discovered in Pennsylvania, with then-Rep. Lou Barletta, a Republican, trying to draw attention to them during his time in Congress in the 2010s.

Antracite coal deposits of Appalachian Pennsylvania have been found to contain as many as 17 different REEs, which could strike another blow to Chinese dominance.

Barletta told Fox News in 2018 that funding had been secured for a pilot program to look into extracting REEs from coal wastewater, as long-abandoned mines dot the landscape from Shamokin to Audenried, the latter falling in the aptly-named Carbon County.

While little has been done in Pennsylvania when it comes to extracting such minerals, compared to Alaskan efforts in the time since, researchers at Penn State said in September they had developed methods to recover cobalt, manganese and nickel from acid mine drainage and fly ash.

BOSTON (AP) — Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard University who once served as U.S. treasury secretary, says he will step back from public commitments after the release of emails showing he maintained a friendly relationship with Jeffrey Epstein long after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008.

Summers said in a statement that he would step back to “rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.”

“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said.

Summers did not detail exactly what stepping back would entail, saying he would continue to teach and promised to “rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.”

However, the Center for American Progress, a progressive DC-based think tank, confirmed Tuesday that Summers was “ending his fellowship at CAP.” A spokesperson for the Budget Lab at Yale also said Summers is no longer a member of the organization's advisory group.

OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, declined to say Tuesday if Summers was stepping down from its board of directors, referring questions to Summers spokesperson Kelly Friendly who said she did not have anything to add “beyond his statement.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Summers joined the OpenAI board in Nov. 2023, part of an effort to restore stability at the nonprofit and bring back its CEO Sam Altman after its previous board members fired Altman days earlier.




Summers' announcement came just days after President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would ask the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Summers' relationship with Epstein, along with former President Bill Clinton and LinkedIn founder and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has since said she has ordered a top federal prosecutor to lead the investigation.

Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges he sexually abused and trafficked underage girls.

Emails made public last week showed many in Epstein's vast network of wealthy and influential friends continued to stay in touch long after his 2008 guilty plea.

A 2019 email to Epstein showed Summers discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing that “I said what are you up to. She said ‘I'm busy'. I said awfully coy u are.”

Epstein, who often wrote with spelling and grammatical errors, replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.”




When asked about the emails last week, Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life” and that his association with Epstein was a “major error in judgement.”

Summers served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Clinton. He was Harvard's president for five years from 2001 to 2006. He is currently a professor and is a director of the school's Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government.

Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, from Massachusetts, told CNN she believes Harvard should severe ties with Summers, saying he “cannot be trusted” with students.

“For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,” Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor, told CNN.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Aaron Rodgers might get a chance to say goodbye to one of his favorite places after all.

Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday there's a chance that Rodgers and his fractured left wrist could still play on Sunday when the Steelers visit Chicago.

Rodgers injured his non-throwing wrist late in the first half of Pittsburgh's 32-14 victory over Cincinnati on Sunday. While Tomlin said Rodgers wanted to come back in, the four-time MVP remained in the locker room for evaluation while backup Mason Rudolph helped the AFC North-leading Steelers pull away to improve to 6-4.

The 41-year-old Rodgers, the NFL's oldest active player, will not need surgery on the wrist. He will not practice on Wednesday. What happens after that will depend on how Rodgers adjusts to the brace he will wear and how that impacts his ability to operate normally.

Tomlin doesn't expect pain tolerance to be an issue, though Rodgers will have to show he's able to protect himself.

Rudolph, who filled in capably in the second half against the Bengals, would start for Pittsburgh against the NFC North-leading Bears (7-3) if Rodgers can't go.

Rodgers has a long history with Chicago, dating to his highly successful run in Green Bay earlier in his career. He is 11-1 as a starter at Soldier Field and once famously proclaimed he “owned” one of the NFL's oldest franchises.

Tomlin brushed aside the idea that Rodgers' dominance over the Bears will play a factor in whether he plays.




“Aaron always wants to play. Opponent has nothing to do with it,” Tomlin said. “It's his love affair with the game of football.”

Tomlin isn't sure exactly when Rodgers sustained the injury, though cameras caught Rodgers clutching the wrist after a second-down heave to the back of the end zone with Pittsburgh driving late in the first half. Rodgers was hit at the end of the play, though he did stay in to make one more pass, an incompletion to Roman Wilson.

Rudolph completed 12 of 16 passes for 127 yards and a touchdown against the Bengals and will practice with the starters until Rodgers returns, whenever that might be.

Tomlin has sometimes allowed veteran players to miss an entire week of practice and then play on Sunday. Former quarterback Ben Roethlisberger spent a week on the COVID-19 list in 2021 but was cleared to play the night before a visit to the Los Angeles Chargers.

The unknown of how the brace will affect Rodgers means he won't be given that accommodation. Tomlin said the team will need to see how the brace affects what he called Rodgers' “functionality” before deciding whether he can play.

Asked what kind of input Rodgers will have, the NFL's longest-tenured head coach chuckled.

“It's his body, so certainly he's gonna be a component of the discussion,” Tomlin said.

Rudolph gives Pittsburgh a reliable fallback option. The 30-year-old — now in his second stint with the Steelers following a lengthy run as primarily a backup from 2018-23 — memorably won three straight starts at the end of the 2023 season to help the Steelers make the playoffs.

“He's proven over his time here that he's capable of coming in and playing winning football for us,” Tomlin said. “And that's no small task.”

While offensive coordinator Arthur Smith and Rodgers work closely in putting the game plan together, Smith also seeks input from Rudolph, one of the reasons Pittsburgh's offense didn't miss a beat against the Bengals and the NFL's worst defense.

The challenge will be more difficult in Chicago, where the Steelers have won just once in 13 tries. The Bears lead the NFL in takeaways and are second in third-down efficiency.

Rodgers isn't the only player whose status is uncertain for this week. Outside linebacker Alex Highsmith continues to deal with a pectoral injury that forced him to sit out against the Bengals. Cornerback Darius Slay could be back after spending last week in the concussion protocol.

Running back Jaylen Warren, who injured his ankle in the third quarter against Cincinnati, will be limited this week but could be available. Kenny Gainwell compiled 105 total yards and two receiving touchdowns on Sunday while getting an expanded look, which seems likely to continue.

While Warren was cleared to return late against the Bengals — and even went back onto the field at one point, only for the Steelers to call timeout — Tomlin opted to stick with Gainwell, whom Tomlin felt had the “hot hand.”

The trip to Soldier Field begins a daunting three-week stretch for Pittsburgh, which has a tenuous one-game lead over Baltimore. Pittsburgh hosts Buffalo on Nov. 29, then opens December by visiting the Ravens.

NOTES: Tomlin, who initially took issue with cornerback Jalen Ramsey being ejected on Sunday for taking a swing at Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, offered a different perspective on Tuesday, a day after the league suspended Chase one game for spitting on Ramsey. Asked how he'd like to see Ramsey address something similar in the future, Tomlin said: “I have no message if someone spits in your face. Do what comes natural.”

EXCLUSIVE — Republicans in Congress are renewing a push to combat noncitizen voting in federal elections, directing their attention to the registration forms used to vote by mail.

The Citizen Ballot Protection Act, spearheaded by Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL) and Rep. Gary Palmer (R-AL), would codify states' ability to require proof of citizenship on mail voting applications. The legislation, introduced Tuesday, was offered during the previous Congress but failed to gain traction under Democratic leadership and then-President Joe Biden.

“Voting in our country is a sacred right that must solely be limited to American citizens,” Britt said in a statement. “To allow states to uphold this principle should be simple commonsense.”

The proposal would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which says voter registration forms submitted by mail may not include “any requirement for notarization or other formal authentication” and is intended to empower states to enact citizenship requirements for mailed applications. The current requirement includes attesting on the form, under penalty of perjury, that the applicant is an American citizen.

The Supreme Court in 2013 struck down an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship when registering to vote, concluding that states could not create new requirements for federal elections under the NVRA.

The proposed bill is also in response to Washington, D.C., and cities in Maryland, Vermont, and New York that allow noncitizens to vote in local elections.

Noncitizen voting does occur in federal elections, but documented cases are extremely rare.

Recent reported cases include six green card holders who were indicted last year for alleged illegal voting in Ohio and a student from China at the University of Michigan who was charged last year with noncitizen voting. A state audit in North Carolina conducted after the 2016 elections revealed that 41 green card holders voted out of nearly 4.8 million votes cast. A similar audit in Georgia last year identified 20 alleged cases of noncitizen voting out of 8.2 million registered voters.

A broader case study after the 2016 election of 42 voting jurisdictions across a dozen states identified 30 likely instances of noncitizens voting out of 23.5 million ballots cast.

Democratic lawmakers and voting rights advocates typically oppose such legislation, arguing it amounts to voter suppression that blocks more U.S. citizens from casting ballots than it does the number of noncitizens. Republicans, meanwhile, say the bill and those like it are safeguards that instill confidence in elections.

“It should not be controversial that states have the legal right to prevent noncitizens — including illegal aliens and oﬃcial representatives of foreign adversaries — from voting in state and federal elections,” Britt said.

The measure, should it be brought to the Senate floor, is unlikely to receive the Democratic support needed to clear a 60-vote filibuster, though Republicans could attempt to pass it as part of a larger piece of legislation.

REPUBLICANS ADVANCE BILL TO BLOCK NONCITIZENS FROM VOTING IN DC ELECTIONS

“Americans deserve to know their elections are secure,” Palmer said in a statement. “The Citizen Ballot Protection Act is a great step towards restoring faith in the ability to conduct free and fair elections and preventing illegally cast ballots from swaying the outcome.”

The bill has garnered early support from several GOP senators, including past and present members of leadership. Original co-sponsors include Britt's fellow Senate Rules Committee members: Chairman Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and John Boozman (R-AR).

Abdul Carter received a rude awakening Sunday when the New York Giants sidelined him for their first defensive series against the Green Bay Packers.

Interim head coach Mike Kafka said it was a coach's decision, prompting speculation about a potential punishment. Kafka added he wanted to "just keep the rest of that in-house," and Carter himself told reporters that he had done something wrong in the week leading up to the game.

Sure enough, it turns out it was indeed a punishment for missing a team walkthrough while sleeping at the team facility, according to multiple reports.

The Athletic also reported that Carter has been "late to meetings," and former head coach Brian Daboll was letting it "slide." Daboll was fired last week after the Giants blew their third double-digit, fourth-quarter lead of the season.

Carter, though, denied those reports on Tuesday. The rookie said he made an "honest mistake" in not realizing a change in the normal practice times following Kafka being tabbed as interim head coach, so he was getting treatment instead. He claimed, though, that he was not asleep.

"My mistake was an honest mistake," Carter told ESPN on Tuesday. "I own the fact that it was an honest mistake. I was getting treatment and I told Coach Kafka that, too. But to say I was sleeping at that time just wasn't true. And it also wasn't a trend. This was the only time it happened."

Carter was the third overall pick out of Penn State this past April, but he quickly drew the ire of the Big Blue faithful when he asked Lawrence Taylor if he could wear his famed No. 56 – L.T. declined.

Carter then sought permission from Phil Simms to wear No. 11, the same number he wore at Penn State and a badge of honor for the Nittany Lions. Simms obliged, but his family was not on board, and ultimately, Carter's wish was denied. He eventually settled on No. 51.

To make matters worse, in 11 games, Carter has just one half-sack. However, his 17% pass-rush win rate is the 16th-best mark in the league, one spot behind teammate Brian Burns, who has 13 of the Giants' 22 total sacks. Burns' 13 sacks are two behind Myles Garrett for the league lead.

That goes to show that a market correction is in play for Carter, but it's becoming apparent he needs to start posting actual statistics fast before he stays on fans' bad side.

Brian Walshe, the 50-year-old convicted fraudster accused of killing his wife Ana in their suburban Boston home after learning of an affair, switched his plea on two lesser charges Tuesday morning, just before jury selection in his murder trial was set to begin.

Walshe pleaded guilty to counts two and three of his three-count indictment, admitting to misleading police officers and unlawful conveyance of a human body.

As prosecutors outlined their case against him, his defense attorney said that he admitted to the lesser allegations but continued to deny the murder charge against him.

Walshe's lawyer said he was not admitting to murder and denied putting her remains in a dumpster and denied that he had a role in incinerating her remains.

There was a moment of contention after prosecutors called out Walshe for telling the judge he was still married while under oath.

After a sidebar meeting with the judge, the defense said Walshe recognized that legally, he was no longer married after the death of his wife.

Prosecutors said that the plea was not negotiated, and it appeared that the trial would still move forward on the top charge of murder.

Jury selection is proceeding for the top charge. 

Judge Diane Freniere told potential jurors that prosecutors allege that police found the following items in a dumpster by Walshe's mother's house: Ana Walshe's clothing, her COVID vaccination card, towels with "red-brown stains," a hatchet, and a hacksaw.

In court Monday, prosecutors also revealed that a rug from the Walshe's home was discovered in the dumpster.

MAGA, Nigeria (AP) — A schoolgirl who was abducted with 24 others from a dormitory in northwestern Nigeria has escaped and is safe, the school's principal told The Associated Press on Tuesday, as hunters joined security forces in the search for the missing students in forests close to the school.

The girls were kidnapped before dawn on Monday, when gunmen attacked the dorm at the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Kebbi state's Maga town. Local police said the gunmen scaled the fence to enter the school premises and exchanged gunfire with police officers before seizing the girls and killing a staff member.

No group has claimed responsibility for taking the girls, but analysts and locals say gangs of bandits often target schools, travelers and remote villagers in kidnappings for ransoms. Authorities say the bandits are mostly former herders who have taken up arms against farming communities after clashes between them over strained resources.

Mass school kidnappings are especially common in northern Nigeria, and the Kebbi school is close to conflict hot spots including Zamfara and Sokoto states, where several gangs are known to operate and hide out. 

The student who escaped arrived home late Monday, hours after the kidnapping, according to the school principal Musa Rabi Magaji. Another student was able to escape the gunmen in the minutes after the raid and was not abducted, the principal told AP.




“They are safe and sound,” Magaji said. 

A video verified by AP shows the two schoolgirls, who appear to be in their early teens, lost in thought and surrounded by family and other villagers, with hijabs covering their heads. High schoolers in Nigeria are usually aged between 12 and 17.

Security forces and hunters, meanwhile, have intensified efforts to find and rescue the others, local officials said. Security teams swept nearby forests where gangs often hide while others were deployed along major roads leading to the school.

Kebbi Gov. Nasir Idris visited the school on Monday and assured of efforts to rescue the girls, and Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Waidi Shaibu met with soldiers in the hours after the attack and directed “intelligence-driven operations and relentless day-and-night pursuit of the abductors,” according to an army statement.

“We must find these children. Act decisively and professionally on all intelligence. Success is not optional,” the army chief said.

By Tuesday morning, the dorm and the classroom block — a walking distance apart — were deserted. In Maga, families waiting for news of their children's freedom expressed anger and frustration.

Resident Abdulkarim Abdullahi, whose daughter and granddaughter — aged 13 and 10 respectively — were among the kidnapped children, said he overheard the noise from his house.

“I was at home when I suddenly heard gunshots from the school. We were told that the attackers entered the school with many motorcycles,” said Abdullahi.

Amina Hassan, wife of the school vice principal Hassan Yakubu Makuku, said the assailants broke into their house, which is on the school premises, and fatally shot her husband. He was also the school's chief security officer.

“Three of them entered and asked my husband, ‘Are you Malam Hassan?' and he responded, ‘Yes, I am.' They told him that we are here to kill you,” she told the AP.

At least 1,500 students have been seized in the region since Boko Haram jihadi extremists seized 276 Chibok schoolgirls over a decade ago. But bandits are also active in the region, and analysts say gangs often target schools to gain attention.

Analysts and residents blame the insecurity on a failure to prosecute known attackers, and the rampant corruption that limits weapons supplies to security forces while ensuring a steady supply to the gangs.

“Let's say people have been kidnapped in the markets — it doesn't go far, (or) if people have been kidnapped on the road — it doesn't go far,” said Oluwole Ojewale, a security analyst at the Institute for Security Studies. “What gains traction is when (it is) strategic kidnapping, like school children.”

There's one practical, non-trolling reason President Donald Trump has encouraged third-term talk despite the clear language of the 22nd Amendment: He is trying to stave off lame-duck status.

Weeks after Trump finally acknowledged he can't really run in 2028 under the current constitutional requirements, the first signs of how the new status quo will look are starting to emerge:

A critical mass of Republican lawmakers appears likely to break with Trump on the Jeffrey Epstein files, leading the president to reverse course; Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) is actively seeking a post-Trump identity; the clash with Indiana Republicans over redistricting; and prominent Make America Great Again social media influencers aren't exactly focused on topics beneficial to the White House or GOP.

This may have more to do with poll numbers and the off-year election results than term limits, but Republicans and Republican-adjacent voices are starting to contemplate life after Trump.

Trump remains a dominant figure in the GOP. His detractors inside the party are weak and marginal. Most prominent Never Trumpers are now functionally Democrats, many of them increasingly left-wing. He still drives the news cycle unlike any other political figure in the country, and there is zero chance he will willingly cede the spotlight anytime soon.

But Trump's second term has come in stages. In the weeks between his stunning comeback victory and his return to the White House, the Resistance was muted, and he was much more broadly accepted than at any point during his first term. He had won the popular vote for the first time in three tries, and some polls showed a small majority actually approving of him.

Then came the flurry of executive actions, beginning as soon as his Jan. 20 inauguration, which thrilled Trump's base but angered Democrats. Trump was seen as delivering on his campaign promises at a frenetic pace, even if there were some questions about how durable some of these changes would prove without legislative reinforcement.

All this was soon followed by the elevation of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency. This solidified the Democrats' return to Resistance mode and, on the heels of the executive orders and high-profile deportations, spent down Trump's political capital. Trump didn't extend Musk's DOGE contract — the two fell out shortly after his departure, and, other than rescissions, the whole project has taken on a lower profile post-Musk.

In June, Trump's decision to strike Iran was the first big move of his second term to divide his base. But Trump supporters were less divided than some prominent MAGA voices predicted. The strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities were seemingly successful and did not metastasize into a wider war. Trump has since had more success in the Middle East, bringing home the surviving Israeli hostages who were still in Hamas captivity two years after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and more or less ending the war in Gaza, than in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The backlash was small and easily contained.

Trump is now contending with multiple issues that divide his base and encourage would-be successors to chart their own course: H-1B visas, Epstein, multiple threatened military interventions, and the actual drug-boat strikes. None of these has remotely dented his popularity with Republicans or self-described MAGA movement members, though they may hurt Trump's party at the margins with low-propensity voters. But they have depressed enthusiasm for Trump among allies who were helpful in 2024.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) has so far retained more grassroots support than any of Trump's previous intraparty foes. It is possible this will prove true for Greene as well, though her rift with Trump is still fairly new. Trump-Massie tensions date back to the president's first term.

The Trump tariffs looked like a crisis averted. The markets had jitters after “Liberation Day” but eventually settled down. But the tariffs face an uncertain future before the Supreme Court and have been folded into the broader cost-of-living crisis that now threatens Republicans, several years after inflation hit a 41-year high under former President Joe Biden. Democrats were able to campaign successfully on affordability in November.

THE DEMOCRATS' SHUTDOWN FOR NOTHING

We are less than a year into Trump's second term, and he has survived many political predicaments that would have done in almost anyone else. While his numbers are down, a 42.6% job approval rating in the RealClearPolitics polling average is higher than that of former Presidents George W. Bush or Barack Obama at a comparable point. It's above his first-term lows.

The question is how Trump will deal with not having an obvious next act for the first time in his political career and how that affects the incentives of those who plan to stick around once he is gone from the White House, presumably for good.

CEO Alexander Berger on how the funder's second act aims to show that effective giving can scale up

Over the past decade, Open Philanthropy has been the rare philanthropic shop with both the resources and the rigor to make a dent in some of the world's biggest problems.

Working closely with Good Ventures — the foundation built by Facebook and Asana co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna — Open Philanthropy has directed more than $4 billion since 2014 across a wide portfolio, from global health to housing to frontier science. Its money has backed philanthropic efforts estimated to have saved 100,000 lives, helped catalyze the YIMBY movement in California, fought to improve conditions for billions of farmed animals, and supported research that went on to win a Nobel Prize.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Whatever you think about “effective” giving as a label — or effective altruism, the movement that Open Philanthropy is inescapably associated with — this is one of the clearest experiments we have in what analytically minded, effectiveness-obsessed philanthropy can do at scale.

Now, as it enters its second decade, Open Philanthropy is changing its name — and changing some of what it does. It will now call itself Coefficient Giving, a rebrand meant to signal that the organization is moving from primarily serving one anchor donor — Moskovitz and Tuna — to advising and deploying capital for many.

In practical terms, that means converting internal programs into multi-donor funds that other philanthropists can join — among them the $125 million Lead Exposure Action Fund and the $120 million Abundance and Growth Fund — while continuing core work in areas that benefit global health and development. The group says it directed more than $100 million from donors beyond Good Ventures in 2024, and has already more than doubled that number in 2025. But the mission, they emphasize, remains the same: maximize impact for every dollar given.

Why “coefficient”? As CEO, Alexander Berger, puts it in my conversation with him, “coefficient is a multiplier”: the “co-” nods to collaboration with other givers; the “efficient” is a reminder of the north star of effectiveness.

Berger, who has helped steer the organization through years of bets on global health, AI risk, and “abundance and growth,” is a pragmatic optimist. In the conversation that follows, we dig into what the name change means in practice: how pooled funds will make decisions, how they're weighing AI and near-term global health, and where philanthropy's comparative advantage really lies in a world of volatile public budgets and accelerating technology.

Consider this a map to Open Philanthropy's — sorry, Coefficient Giving's — second act, and a test of whether the multiplier effect can deliver more impact, faster.

This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. 

You've said the last two years marked a significant shift, moving from a single anchor funder toward partnering with other donors. And now you're rebranding. What problem didn't the old setup solve, and what will feel different with the new name and approach?

There's not a problem that it's trying to solve — it's really about sort of delivering on the original goal that we launched Open Philanthropy with way back in the day. The ambition was to sort of be a resource for other people who would come along, who would be in Cari and Dustin's shoes, sort of asking that question: Where can I give my resources in a way that it's going to have the most impact for other people? 

We basically spent our first decade trying to build up to the point where we were sort of on track to hit Cari and Dustin's goals of giving away their resources in their lifetime. We're sort of within striking distance of that now. And over the last couple of years, we've started to pivot to invest in that original ambition of being a resource to others.

And the new name — why Coefficient Giving?

We weren't sure if we were going to change the name. When we came across “coefficient,” we were just like, oh, that's really good. That might be it. Because the “co” signals interest in collaboration and working with others. “Efficient” is a nod to the focus that we've always had on cost-effectiveness. And together, a “coefficient” is a multiplier. And so we think that speaks to our focus on ROI [return on investment] and being able to help multiply the impact of others.

Many organizations have “open” in the name without actually being all that open. But Open Philanthropy was known for its transparency and publishing detailed explanations of the reasoning behind its funding — including when things didn't go well. Will that continue under Coefficient?

We don't see this as a change in terms of our level of openness relative to the status quo. But there were a lot of other organizations that had “open” in the name, and you would be surprised by how often we got confused with them. Writing about our reasoning, sharing our worldview, and the sort of big mistakes that we've made or places where we think we could have done something better to have more impact, is a big part of how we show up.

When we came across “coefficient,” we were just like, oh, that's really good. That might be it. Because the “co” signals interest in collaboration and working with others. “Efficient” is a nod to the focus that we've always had on cost-effectiveness. And together, a “coefficient” is a multiplier.

But also, honestly, that's evolved over time. In our earliest days, we would write these long posts about every grant that we made, and that just didn't scale with the organization. We're different from GiveWell — GiveWell's model is that they're really trying to explain all of their reasoning in public because they're trying to sell their recommendations to retail donors. We work with people whom we can and do talk to, mostly offline. We're not trying to make literally everything available on the website in the same way, and we haven't been for a long time.

It's a strange moment: public-health budgets slashed and turmoil around USAID. Meanwhile, private tech wealth is surging and AI is accelerating. What's the job only philanthropy can do — and how does that shape your second decade?

The number one framework that we use for picking what causes to work on is the importance, tractability, neglectedness framework. But another way is to ask: Where is there a good argument for philanthropy as opposed to the state or the private sector to intervene? Often, we think of that being a place where there's a structural imbalance in power or resources, and someone's interests are structurally not represented.

For example, a lot of our giving goes to develop new medical technologies for some of the world's poorest people who are suffering from diseases that just aren't a problem in the rich world. The market incentive really isn't there. And so that's a place where we see a strong case for philanthropic subsidy. I think that's true of a lot of our more abundance-oriented work, such as enabling more housing to get built in the most productive places. The benefits flow to the potential people who might move in the future, but they don't get to vote for those policies because they're not there yet.

One important part of the answer is that most people — most high-income Americans — should be giving a lot more. The average American gives something like 2 percent of their income to charity. The pie of charitable dollars just could be bigger because there are so many good things to do and so many ways to be helpful in the world.

When it comes to replacing government dollars, the NIH [National Institutes of Health] is such an overwhelming and powerful funder of scientific research. USAID is so large compared to even the biggest foundations. We are looking and have been doing active funding to fill specific gaps in some places where public funding has pulled back, even though, of course, it's really regretful that we're now in this world where the funding that used to be there isn't anymore. Over time, are there more things that we could do to try to get more leverage and try to have public policies that are more supportive of some of these good things? That's a longer slog.

You've funded longer-run bets like AI safety, and you also fund near-term, high-confidence lifesaving work in global health. What's the positive case that attention to AI doesn't crowd out global health and poverty?

Those are some of the toughest questions that we face. One important part of the answer is that most people — most high-income Americans — should be giving a lot more. The average American gives something like 2 percent of their income to charity. The pie of charitable dollars just could be bigger because there are so many good things to do and so many ways to be helpful in the world.

At the same time, there's a budget. Those trade-offs are really hard for us. One of the reasons why we're excited to be rebranding as Coefficient Giving and doubling down on work with other donors is because we think we shouldn't have to make the trade-offs alone. We've found a lot of appetite from others to get engaged in some of these causes. Being able to connect people with high-impact opportunities or some of these funds that we've developed has been a way to help relieve that sort of zero-sum issue.

As you convert in-house programs into multi-donor funds — the lead exposure fund, the abundance and growth fund — what happens if donors disagree? Who decides? 

So far for the pooled funds, the answer has been that basically people are giving money to Coefficient Giving to allocate within that area based on what we see fit. And actually, a couple of our external partners have given us a push to say, “don't let people have too much governance control. I want to make sure that you're able to fund the things that seem best.'”

So we've been really lucky so far to find partners who didn't want to sign up for every cause that Coefficient works on, but they do agree and are excited about some specific area like lead or like abundance. There's a group of core donors who are coming together to help start something together or make it multi-donor. And then other folks come in because they're interested in the space but not able to give at the anchor level. Over time, I'd be excited to eventually have other partners on an industrial scale and to think about whether those kinds of people eventually become board members or something. But that would be down the line.

The federal posture on AI in the Trump administration looks more accelerationist today than in 2023. You've funded AI safety and governance for years. Where's your point of leverage in this environment, and what would count as progress in the next year or so?

We've been investing in this space for a long time. Going back to 2015, we helped build up the space of academic and think tank research on AI risks and safety. We were quite prescient there, but I think we generally don't see ourselves as trying to achieve some specific policy goal in the next 12 to 18 months. We want people across the spectrum to be paying attention to these risks and taking them seriously, and thinking about how we can mitigate these risks while capturing some of the potentially enormous upsides.

When we look at some of the things that have come out of the administration, like the AI action plan, we actually see a lot of areas for agreement or potential agreements. Our hope is that there will be ongoing space for bi-partisanship. We're in this for the long haul. We expect to continue to help build up this ecosystem, ideally in a bipartisan and non-partisan way for the decade to come, as opposed to really thinking about it as some big push or policy agenda in the short term.

You've supported abundance-oriented policy and housing reform for years. What does “it's working” look like in those areas?

We've been funding the abundance and growth movement for about 10 years. One of the lessons there is that you really can't evaluate it on too short of a timeline. For instance, California YIMBY, which this legislative session helped pass California's SB 79 to make it a lot easier to build multi-family housing near transit, that bill has failed two or three times going back to, I think, 2018. If five years into our funding you had looked around and said, “What have you achieved, how many units have been built?” I don't know that you would have been able to point to very much. But it's remarkable how much this movement has grown, how much policy influence it's had, how much it's shaping the conversation.

That importance, neglectedness, and tractability framework has always been your north star. After a decade of giving, has it gotten harder to find causes that fit those criteria? Has your weighting of those criteria changed?

I don't particularly think so. When we started off, we were looking for those causes that were important, tractable, and neglected, but we were really, really uncertain about how to weigh those different criteria against each other. Over time, one of the big lessons was to actually downweight perceived tractability and upweight importance and neglectedness.

If you think about the importance of different health problems or different diseases, it just varies by so many orders of magnitude. Neglectedness varies by hundreds of times, thousands of times. And tractability is much harder to measure. Over time, we've been impressed with the returns in the causes that we picked for seeming extremely important and extremely neglected. The things that seemed tractable — or maybe we were pushing on an open door — often we were wrong, or the tractability environment would shift.

Our aim — and so far we've seen some success — is being a resource to people who have never heard of effective altruism or are not interested in it or don't find it very motivating or welcoming. And I think that's good.

Your ability to predict tractability is so much lower. I hope that we'll prioritize continuing to double down on some of our existing causes that we think are really important, and continuing to look for ones that are really neglected and could be an outlier.

From the outside, Open Philanthropy was often treated as synonymous with effective altruism — probably more than was warranted. How do you see that relationship going forward?

“Synonymous” always would have given us heartburn. Our mission is to help others as much as we can with the resources available to us, and we bring a really analytical lens to that question. That's a commonality with effective altruism.

But I do think effective altruism as a community isn't necessarily something that is very appealing to everybody. We don't want to be only appealing to the subset of people who happen to be interested in effective altruism. Our aim — and so far we've seen some success — is being a resource to people who have never heard of effective altruism or are not interested in it or don't find it very motivating or welcoming. And I think that's good.

You've talked about being open to failure in pursuit of outsized impact — something philanthropy talks about more than it practices. Where has risk tolerance mattered most?

There's a lot of rhetoric in philanthropy about being open to failure and taking risks and pursuing high-risk, high-return opportunities. It can be really hard, within the confines of most organizations, to actually make those bets and see them fail and then iterate.

But we have felt like the returns to being able to take those risks have been really high. I don't think we would have been able to fund a lot of the scientific research that we funded over the last decade without accepting that most of it isn't going to end up having a big humanitarian impact. We've been funding David Baker at the University of Washington for a long time, on applying AI and ML to design proteins — and he won the Nobel Prize along with the Google DeepMind leaders in chemistry last year. Now we're funding a lot of folks in protein design to apply some of those new design tools to developing vaccines for a bunch of neglected diseases. We're seeing some of that in AI safety as well—early investments in field-building.

When I started, I kind of had an idea of, you either want to be in the maximally high-risk space or in the GiveWell space. But I think over time we've seen a lot of success in the middle space, where you're making progress on something important on a reasonable guess. It's not the craziest, highest-risk thing, but it's also not as straightforward. Our current view is that you can really do effective philanthropy, and the returns can look similar in some ways across that risk spectrum.

President Donald Trump is feting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday during the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia's first White House visit since Saudi agents killed Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.

The U.S.-Saudi relationship had been sent into a tailspin by the operation targeting Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the kingdom, that U.S. intelligence agencies later determined Prince Mohammed likely directed the agents to carry out. But seven years later, Trump has tightened his embrace of the crown prince, whom he views as an indispensable player in shaping the Middle East in the decades to come. Prince Mohammed, for his part, denies involvement in the killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and Virginia resident.

The two leaders will unveil billions of dollars in deals, including one to sell the Saudis F-35 fighter jets, and huddle with aides to discuss the tricky path ahead in a volatile Middle East. They'll end their day with an evening White House soiree, organized by first lady Melania Trump, to honor the prince.

Other news we're following:








The president said the Crown Prince “knew nothing about it” and said of Khashoggi that “a lot of people didn't like that gentleman.”

Trump lashed out at a reporter who asked the question, calling her “fake news” and chastising her saying “you don't have to embarrass our guest by asking him a question like that.”

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Trump that his country would be increasing its financial commitments to the U.S. from $600 billion to $1 trillion.

“Good, I like that very much,” Trump said.

Prince Mohammed was asked if Saudi Arabia can sustain the investments given the current low level of oil prices, but he indicated that the deals on computer chips fit with his country's development.

The president has tried to make the case that his mix of tariffs and diplomacy will create $21 trillion in investment commitments before the end of the year. 

It's an improbably high sum and the White House can't fully explain how the president reached that total.

But Trump is facing pushback from the public on his economic leadership and has promised that the investments will create jobs domestically.

“We have a extremely respected man in the Oval Office today,” Trump said to open the news media spray, calling Mohammed bin Salman “a friend of mine for a very long time.”

Trump also praised the prince's father.

The president is still speaking about how great he thinks the U.S. is performing under his leadership.

The president and Prince Mohammed walked slowly on the White House Colonnade, where Trump has hung portraits of all the presidents except one — Biden — in gold frames, with gold ornamentations above them and large gold letters on the wall that say in a curly script: “The Presidential Walk of Fame.”

Trump and the crown prince walked slowly, pausing for several minutes at the portraits of former Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt.

In place of Biden's portrait, Trump has hung a picture of an autopen signing the former president's name. Trump showed it off to Prince Mohammed before they went to enter the Oval Office together.

Rep. Valerie Foushee, a Democrat whose district includes part of Raleigh and its suburbs, said the expanded deployment of federal immigration agents “is a profound abuse of power, a violation of civil rights, and a stain on our democracy.”

“Our cities are not border cities, and our state is not a war zone,” Foushee said in a news release. “Yet, the Trump Administration has chosen to initiate policies designed to instill fear, undermine due process, and disproportionately target Black, Brown, and immigrant residents.”

Trump greeted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House's South Lawn entrance.

Trump welcomed the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia with a handshake and arm slung over Prince Mohammed's shoulder.

A military band was also on hand for Prince Mohammed and there was a flyover.

Former President Joe Biden famously greeted Prince Mohammed with a fist bump during his 2022 visit to Saudi Arabia.

This is Prince Mohammed's first White House visit since the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents. 

Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi requesting all information about whether companies and industries that donated to the Trump administration have brokered deals to avoid prosecution by the administration.

“When corporations break the law and exploit the American people, they must be held to account,” the letter reads. “It is your duty as attorney general to uphold the laws of this country, regardless of who committed the wrongdoing and how much support they have given to the Trump administration.”

The Justice Department and White House have dismissed allegations of corruption.

Lee questioned the Justice Department's decision not to criminally prosecute Boeing, an aerospace firm that donated to Trump's inauguration, after a decision by the administration earlier this month to not prosecute fatal crashes by the firm's planes. She also contended that cryptocurrency and defense firms may have “conflicts of interest with President Trump” that are preventing them from being investigated or prosecuted.—Correction: An earlier post erroneously said the Boeing crash was earlier this month. The decision this month involved crashes in 2018 and 2019. 

But the Republican speaker denounced what he called a politically-motivated “show vote” to release the files of the convicted sex offender as an attack on Trump.

Trump has “nothing to hide” in the investigation over the late financier's alleged sexual trafficking. 

Johnson argued during a private morning meeting of House Republicans and at his weekly press conference at the Capitol that release of the Epstein files could put victims unnecessarily in the limelight. He hopes it can be amended in the Senate. 

Nevertheless Johnson said he expects a unanimous vote in the House this afternoon, sending the legislation that would force the release of the files to the Senate.

Greene, once a close ally of Trump's who has sparred increasingly with him recently, made the comments at a press conference Tuesday ahead of a House vote to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. She was among the few Republicans to sign on to a discharge petition to force the Epstein vote, and she squarely blamed Trump for allowing the issue to divide the party's base.

“This has been one of the most destructive things to MAGA,” said Greene. “Watching the man that we supported early on. Three elections ... watching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart.”

Worries about immigration enforcement in Raleigh, North Carolina, have spread among South Asians who were drawn to the Research Triangle Park region by high-tech jobs.

Satish Garimella is mayor pro tempore in Morrisville, just west of Raleigh, where Asians represent nearly half the of the town's population of more than 30,000. He grew up in India but is now a U.S. citizen.

Garimella said the expected arrival of immigration agents is “creating a lot of panic in the community” that immigrants lawfully in the country could be swept up. He's recommending that they carry with them IDs, copies of passports and other documents affirming their legal status.

“You just don't know when you will be questioned and what things are needed,” said Garimella, a product manager for a pharmaceutical company. “Even a person who is a citizen is not immune.”

Women speaking out at the U.S. Capitol are holding pictures of themselves as the children they were when they met the wealthy financier and convicted sex offender.

The photos are meant to show lawmakers that “this is who you are fighting for,” Haley Robson said, and she denounced any political retribution against the lawmakers who led this effort.

“I can say firsthand, stepping out against Epstein and his crimes against children, we have all experienced that ourselves,” Robson said. “So for you to knowingly put yourselves at risk and put your career at risk is unbelievable to watch. And we are so grateful.”

Wendy Avis, 14 when she met Epstein, said “none of us here signed up for this political warfare.”

“Stop making survivors fight alone for the truth that should have protected us in the first place,” Avis said.

A coalition of 11 human rights groups called on the Trump administration to use its leverage to press Saudi authorities, who badly want to broaden its business and defense connections with the U.S., to make concrete commitments on human rights and press freedom during the visit.

The activists say Saudi authorities continue to harshly repress dissent, including by arresting human rights defenders, journalists, and political dissidents for criticism against the kingdom. Human rights organizations have also documented a surge in executions in Saudi Arabia that they connect to an effort to suppress internal dissent.

“Saudi Arabia's crown prince is trying to rebrand himself as a global statesman, but the reality at home is mass repression, record numbers of executions, and zero tolerance for dissent,” Sarah Yager, Washington director at the group Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. “U.S. officials should be pressing for change, not posing for photos.”

“It's not going to happen,” Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday, a day after Trump said he's willing to do whatever it takes to stop drugs entering the U.S., including strikes against cartels in Mexico.

“He has suggested it on various occasions or he has said, ‘we offer you a United States military intervention in Mexico, whatever you need to fight the criminal groups,'” Sheinbaum said. “But I have told him on every occasion that we can collaborate, that they can help us with information they have, but that we operate in our territory, that we do not accept any intervention by a foreign government.”

Sheinbaum said she has said this to Trump and to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and that they have understood.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., says the victims of Jeffrey Epstein fought “the most horrific fight” to ensure the public learns what happened to them.

Greene says she worked to follow their lead even when it meant being attacked by Trump for signing a petition to force the Justice Department to publicly release its files on Epstein.

“He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition. Let me tell you what a traitor is: A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves. A patriot is an American that serves the United States of America and Americans like the women seen behind me.”

The top House Democrats defended Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Illin., in a statement ahead of a vote that would reprimand him for an alleged plan to anoint his chief of staff as his successor in Congress.

Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., Katherine Clarke, D-Mass. and Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., called Garcia a “progressive champion” and “a good man.

They did not address the allegations the resolution makes against Garcia.

The resolution was brought by a fellow Democrat, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp-Perez. The effort advanced in the House on Monday with Republican support.

“We unequivocally oppose this misguided resolution and urge our colleagues in the House Democratic Caucus to reject it,” wrote the group.

Pro-Israel conservative leaders are gathering Tuesday in Washington to discuss “Exposing and Countering Extremism and Antisemitism on the Political Right.” The meeting features U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, and Morton Klein, president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America.

“We are disappointed in President Trump,” Klein said, adding that he should “rethink and retract” his comments.

At the recent annual summit of the Republican Jewish Coalition, which was similarly focused on condemning antisemitism within the party, executive director Matthew Brooks called it “the early stages of an undeclared civil war within the Republican Party, as it relates to Israel, and antisemitism and the Jewish community.”

When Trump doesn't like someone, he knows how to show it. In just the last few days, he's described Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as a traitor, mocked Rep. Thomas Massie's second marriage after his first wife died and demanded that comedian Seth Meyers get fired from his late-night television show.

But he had nothing bad to say about two people roiling his party: white nationalist Nick Fuentes and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson. The former Fox News host recently hosted Fuentes for a friendly interview, where he declined to challenge his guest's bigoted beliefs or a remark about problems with “organized Jewry in America.”

Although Trump has targeted left-wing campus activism as a hive of anti-Jewish sentiment, Fuentes' influence is a test of whether conservatives are willing to accommodate bigots as part of their political coalition.

The sponsors of a bill to force the Justice Department to publicly release its files on Jeffrey Epstein are calling on the Senate to “not muck it up.”

“I don't want the D.C. swamp playing any games. They need to pass this in the Senate and they should not amend it,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who appeared at a press conference Tuesday with survivors of Epstein's abuses.

Khanna also praised Republican colleagues Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who helped lead the petition effort to force a vote Tuesday in the House to release the Epstein files.

“Both of them have suffered, as you know, extraordinary political consequences for what they did,” Khanna said.

Wall Street is poised to open with more AI-related losses, just as Trump plans to celebrate a major Saudi investment in U.S. artificial-intelligence infrastructure. 

Nvidia, at the center of the craze over AI, slid another 1.1% ahead of its earnings report on Wednesday. This month alone the AI juggernaut's shares are down 8.6%. Most other chipmakers also retreated early Tuesday, with Micron, Intel and Qualcomm shedding between 1% and 2%. Microsoft fell 1.5% and Amazon lost 1.8%.

Worries that stock prices have shot too high have roiled world markets recently, with big swings in places that rely heavily on exports of computer chips. Critics have been warning that the U.S. stock market could be primed for a drop because of how high prices have shot since April, leaving them looking too expensive.

Most foreign leaders who come to meet with Trump are driven to the doors of the West Wing, where the president often greets them. But Mohammed bin Salman will be welcomed with an arrival ceremony on the South Lawn.

It has all the trappings of an official state visit, even though bin Salman isn't a head of state.

An Oval Office meeting and luncheon in the Cabinet Room will follow. The crown prince will then leave the White House in the afternoon and return hours later for an East Room dinner in his honor. Trump and first lady Melania Trump will be there to welcome him back.

Most foreign leaders get the Oval treatment and lunch. Dinner typically isn't part of the plan.

He's determined to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in sectors like mining, technology and tourism. 

To that end, Saudi Arabia is expected to announce a multi-billion dollar investment in U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure, and the two countries will lay out details about new cooperation in the civil nuclear energy sector, according to a senior Trump administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly ahead of the formal announcement. 

An investment summit at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday will include the heads of Salesforce, Qualcomm, Pfizer, the Cleveland Clinic, Chevron and Aramco, Saudi Arabia's national oil and natural gas company, where even more deals with the Saudis could be announced.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  This account of events surrounding the deadly Camp Mystic flooding in Hunt, Texas, is based on lawsuits, official statements and other reporting from CNN and its news affiliates.



            Weeks before 8-year-old Eloise “Lulu” Peck was carried off by the violent Texas floods that swallowed Camp Mystic in a surge of darkness and debris, she had suddenly begun to fear the forces that would one day claim her.
    


            She filled a page in her notebook with a drawing of rising water, black skies and the kind of creeping dread that children rarely have words for.
    


            “(The drawings were) a quiet reflection of the worries that lingered in her gentle heart,” her parents wrote in the lawsuit they filed on her behalf. “That she left this world in the very way she feared most is a truth too heavy to bear.”
    


            In the pitch-black, storm-lashed hours before dawn on Independence Day, surging floodwaters ravaged Hunt and Kerr County in central Texas, including the summer camp filled with sleeping children.
    


            Four months' worth of rain fell in just hours and the nearby Guadalupe River rose to 30 feet, sweeping homes, cars, campers and cabins downstream.
    


            The catastrophic flooding killed 27 girls and counselors at Camp Mystic.
    


            Lulu's family, along with the families of 17 oth﻿er campers and two counselors, have filed lawsuits against the all-girls Christian camp and its owners, accusing them of gross negligence.
    


            The court filings accuse the camp of failing to move cabins out of flood-prone areas, responding poorly to the emergency, and putting profits ahead of the safety of the girls in their care.
    


            The four lawsuits, filed last week, are the first attempt by grieving parents to seek accountability for the flood that turned a haven of faith and childhood friendships into a scene of unimaginable loss.
    


            “The conditions surrounding their deaths were marked by absolute horror, physical pain, and emotional distress, all of which were foreseeable and preventable had Defendants acted with even minimal care for their safety,” the Peck family lawsuit said.
    


            The lawsuits provide an account of the living nightmare that unfolded that morning on July 4 and shed light on the last moments of young girls struggling to survive. Here's what we learned.
    


            The children taken by the current of the furious river clung to the branches of trees, according to one of the lawsuits, their bodies engulfed in foul, mud-laden water swirling with debris. They held on, blind to whatever threats drifted beneath the murky surface.
    


            “Some victims survived for a period of time, while trapped within the cabins, enduring prolonged physical suffering, panic, and terror as the water level rose beyond their reach,” the Peck family lawsuit alleges.
    


            “Others were pulled into the current and swept away into the darkness. These children faced the unimaginable; a slow and terrifying awareness that they were being overcome by the flood, alone in darkness, unable to reach safety,” the lawsuit states.
    


            As the rain poured down and lightning split the sky, counselors in two cabins near a hill made the desperate choice to flee the rapidly rising waters, the lawsuit claims.
    


Families of 15 Camp Mystic flood victims file lawsuits claiming gross negligence after 27 girls and counselors died



            They climbed through windows, dragging terrified girls into the deluge, running across mud-slicked ground to the top of a hill. Hours passed as they waited, soaked and shivering in the relentless rain, listening “to screams for help from other cabins that housed their friends and fellow campers,” says the lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors who perished: Anna Margaret Bellows, Lila Bonner, Chloe Childress, Molly DeWitt, Katherine Ferruzzo, Lainey Landry and Blakely McCrory.
    


            Five other cabins were evacuated to Rec Hall, an older, two-story structure on higher ground than the lower lying cabins, according to that lawsuit.
    


            From their vantage point, they could see the counselors in the cabins that were told not to evacuate “flashing SOS on their flashlights, begging the Camp for help.”
    


            Those cabins are where little girls had been sleeping, mere steps from the swelling river.
    


            In the Twins cabins, girls startled awake by thunder begged Edward Eastland, a camp director and the co-owners' son, to allow them to evacuate.
    


            “He told them they had to stay because the water would go back down,” the lawsuit said. But it didn't.
    


            “The girls got on their top bunks, as the water pressed them against the cabin ceiling. Several girls decided to swim out to avoid drowning in the cabin, and others were swept out by rushing waters. Some girls never made it out of the cabin,” stated that same lawsuit.
    


            About 30 minutes later, Eastland and several girls were washed out to a tree nearby, where they held on through the night. Some campers tried to grasp its branches, only to be torn away by the raging current; others bobbed by, unable to reach it.
    


            “Girls in the tree watched in horror as their friends floated by begging for help,” the lawsuit said.
    


            Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts told CNN that despite spotty cell coverage and chaotic conditions, Eastland and his father, Richard “Dick” Eastland, were actively helping evacuate campers within 2 hours of receiving the first warning, emphasizing that the camp had moved 166 girls to safety during those critical hours.
    


            Dick Eastland, who co-owned Camp Mystic with his wife, Tweety, died trying to save some of the girls, a family spokesperson has said.
    


            The trees the campers clung to had weathered floods before, but nothing like this. It was Texas' deadliest freshwater flooding in more than a century.
    


            Long before the morning of July 4, Camp Mystic's owners knew how powerful and dangerous the Guadalupe River was, the lawsuits allege.
    


            The camp's history of flooding is long and deadly, with major inundations in 1932, 1978 and 1984, and the flooding of a nearby camp in 1987, Peck family lawsuit said.
    


Camp Mystic's owner warned of floods for decades. Then the river killed him



            Yet, Camp Mystic failed to build adequate warning systems, evacuation routes, or modern flood safeguards, the victims' family lawsuits allege.
    


            Eastland warned for decades about the hidden dangers of the beautiful but volatile Guadalupe River, a peril he saw firsthand while running his family's youth camp alongside its banks.
    


            He successfully pushed for a new flood warning system after 10 children at a nearby camp were swept to their deaths in 1987, and in recent years served on the board of the local river authority as it supported renewed efforts to improve warnings on the Guadalupe.
    


            “I'm sure there will be other drownings,” Eastland said in a 1990 interview with the Austin American-Statesman. “People don't heed the warnings.”
    


            Eastland has been praised as a hero for his efforts to save campers and remembered as a beloved figure by generations who spent their summers in the idyllic riverside refuge. His legacy is less clear as a public steward of the sometimes deadly river that ultimately took his life.
    


            About a decade after it was installed, the warning system Eastland had championed in the late ‘80s had already become antiquated and broken. The river authority ultimately shut it down in 1999, saying it was “unreliable with some of the system's stations not reporting information,” according to an article in the Kerrville Daily Times. Yet periodic attempts to adopt a more modern flood-monitoring system, including one with warning sirens that might have alerted campers last week, repeatedly failed to gain traction – stalled by low budgets, some local opposition and a lack of state support.
    


            But parents point out another concern.
    


            Most of the cabins had been located in FEMA's 100-year “Special Flood Hazard Area” up until 2013. That's when the camp petitioned FEMA to remove most of the cabins from floodplain maps, says the lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors. The move did nothing but spare the Eastlands costly insurance premiums and expensive renovations, the filing states.
    


            “Since July 1932, Camp Mystic knew that cabins that housed defenseless little girls sat in the bullseye of potential flood waters from the Guadalupe River and never said a word about it to trusting parents,” the Peck family lawsuit says. “Since that date, Camp Mystic continued to play Russian Roulette with the lives of the little girls, disregarding what Camp Mystic knew would be an unspeakable tragedy when the flood hit those cabins.”
    


Camp Mystic plans to reopen after flooding killed 27 people



            Watts argued that it is not correct that FEMA was petitioned: “The bottom line is that Camp Mystic was there before FEMA was ever promulgated by Congress. It didn't even exist. The original maps, with all due respect to the forefathers of FEMA, were kind of done on paper and crayon. It wasn't very scientific. Now we have digital imagery. We have elevation to a 10th of an inch. We know what's actually in a 100-year floodplain.”
    


            While Camp Mystic sympathizes with the grieving families, “We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well,” camp counsel Jeff Ray said in a statement last week.
    


            Although camp representatives say the Eastland family prioritized the children's safety, the narrative presented in the families' lawsuits — which the defense has not yet formally answered to — offers a starkly different account of what happened:
    


            In their final hours, Camp Mystic's young campers, many of whom likely still slept with stuffed animals and needed help braiding their hair, faced a terror their parents can barely bring themselves to imagine.
    


            As the dark waters crept across their cabin floors, inch by inch, some of the girls climbed onto their top bunks, trying to keep their heads above the rising flood, feeling the current tug at their legs.
    


            Others spent their last panicked moments in darkness, surrounded by cries and the roar of a river that had swallowed the world outside.
    


            Some of the campers piled into Richard “Dick” Eastland's Tahoe, desperate to escape the neck-deep water.
    


            His car was submerged and found the next day, appearing to have been “smashed against a tree. All inside were killed,” said the lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors.
    


Camp Mystic's ‘littlest souls' were nurtured in Bubble Inn. All the cabin's girls and 2 counselors were lost in the Texas flood



            “Their parents are left to live every single day for the rest of their lives with the intense grief de and the thoughts of what their babies endured that fateful night,” says the lawsuit filed by the families of Virginia “Wynne” Naylor, Hadley Hanna, Virginia Hollis, Jane “Janie” Hunt, Lucy Lee Dillon, and Kellyanne Lytal.
    


            What haunts them most is the belief that their daughters didn't have to die.
    


            According to the lawsuits, the camp had no meaningful evacuation plan. Even as floodwaters breached the cabins, no order to flee was given until it was far too late — despite the fact that safer ground was just a few hundred feet away. A hill only 20 yards from Bubble Inn could have been reached “in a matter of seconds,” one of the lawsuits says.
    


            Camp Mystic's entire emergency plan fit on a single page, offering a few instructions for all potential disasters, according to the same lawsuit.
    


            The last two lines of the document instructed children to remain inside their cabins during flooding and reassured them that “all cabins are constructed on high, safe locations.”
    


            “To instruct children to stay in a cabin with rising flood waters was ultimately a death sentence,” the lawsuit filed by the families of the six campers says.
    


            Watts told CNN that the camp's decision to keep everyone sheltered in place followed long-standing safety guidance from local and national authorities, who warned against moving through floodwaters.
    


            The parents allege that for years, the camp concealed that many cabins sat in or near dangerous floodplains, and that the camp lacked even the most basic tools like walkie-talkies, communication protocols and a real plan to protect their daughters. Counselors and campers, they say, were left to improvise.
    


            The camp responded to the allegations outlined in the lawsuits last week.
    


            The horrific flood was “unprecedented,” Ray said. “We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area.”
    


            Camp Mystic has announced plans to partially reopen next summer for its 100th anniversary.
    


            The section of the camp close to the Guadalupe River will remain closed. The more recent expansion, which sits uphill and was not damaged in the flooding, will reopen.
    


            While parents remain frozen in the darkest chapter of their lives, still waking to the nightmares of what their daughters endured, still fighting for answers, they say Camp Mystic has already begun turning the page.
    


            The lawsuit filed by the family of 9-year-old Ellen Getten says that even as families were learning to live with an empty bed, the camp was promoting its reopening, soliciting donations and preparing to return “to business as usual.” The filing calls it “not only unthinkable – it is offensive to the memories of the deceased and the families and loved ones they left behind.”
    


            To the parents, the message felt unmistakable: the camp was ready to move on, eager to reopen its gates for summer 2026, while they remained knee-deep in grief, still fighting for the truth.
    


            The grieving families of five other girls later joined the Getten lawsuit. Linnie Anne McCown, Abby Lynn Pohl, Margaret Gaffney Sheedy, Mary Barrett Stevens and Greta Katherine Toranzo were just 8 to 10 years old when floodwater swept them away.
    


            “The horrifying nature of these girls' untimely deaths cannot be overstated,” the updated lawsuit states.
    


            “The overpowering waters cascading through the Camp … did the inevitable by tearing children away from the roofs, doors, furniture, trees, and hands of others that they clung to, and propelling them down the raging river into the inescapable darkness.”
    


            Months after the flood, the families say they have yet to hear meaningful acknowledgment or responsibility from those in charge. The lawsuits describe an institution concerned more with its reputation than its reckoning — fixated on reopening a for-profit camp while parents struggle through a grief that has no end date.
    


            The world may be ready to move on. But these families cannot — not until someone answers for what happened to their daughters.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Federal immigration authorities will expand their enforcement action in North Carolina to Raleigh as soon as Tuesday, the mayor of the state capital said, while Customs and Border Protection agents kept operating in Charlotte following a weekend that saw more than 130 people arrested in that city.

Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said Monday that she did not know how large the operation would be or how long agents would be present. Immigration authorities have not spoken about it. The Democrat said in a statement that crime was lower in Raleigh this year compared to last and that public safety was a priority for her and the city council.

“I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges,” Cowell said in a statement.

U.S. immigration agents arrested more than 130 people over the weekend in a sweep through Charlotte, North Carolina's largest city, a federal official said Monday.

North Carolina's Democrat Governor is weighing in on federal immigration activities in Charlotte. AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports.

The Trump administration already conducted immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago. Both of those are deep blue cities in deep blue states run by nationally prominent officials who make no secret of their anger at the White House. The political reasoning seemed obvious.

The move into North Carolina was more surprising.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The mayors of Charlotte and Raleigh are both Democrats, as is the governor, but none are known for wading into national political battles. In a state where divided government has become the norm, Gov. Josh Stein in particular has tried to get along with the GOP-controlled state Legislature. The state's two U.S. senators are both Republican, and President Donald Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.




The Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on North Carolina because of so-called sanctuary policies in a handful of jurisdictions. Those policies limit cooperation between local authorities and immigration agents.

But some observers say focusing on a place with less confrontational politics may be part of the equation.

The White House “can have enough opposition (to its crackdown), but it's a weaker version” than what it faced in places like Chicago, said Rick Su, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who studies local government, immigration and federalism.

“They're not interested in just deporting people. They're interested in the show,” he said.

The Trump administration made Charlotte, a Democratic city of about 950,000 people, its first focus for a North Carolina immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime — despite fierce objections from area leaders and declining crime rates.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Border Patrol officers had arrested “over 130 illegal aliens who have all broken” immigration laws. The agency said the records of those arrested included gang membership, aggravated assault, shoplifting and other crimes, but it did not say how many cases had resulted in convictions, how many people had been facing charges or any other details.

U.S. Rep. Valerie Foushee, a Democrat who represents part of Raleigh and some of its suburbs, said Tuesday that the deployment of federal immigration agents in North Carolina “is a profound abuse of power, a violation of civil rights and a stain on our democracy.”

Worries have spread in the area's South Asian community, which includes many people who were drawn to the Research Triangle region by high-tech jobs.

Satish Garimella is mayor pro tempore in Morrisville, a few miles west of Raleigh. Close to half of the town's population of more than 30,000 is Asian.

Garimella, who grew up in India but is now a U.S. citizen, said the expected arrival of immigration agents is “creating a lot of panic in the community.” He recommended that people, including middle- and high-school age children, now carry identity cards, copies of passports and other documents showing their immigration status.

“You just don't know when you will be questioned and what things are needed,” said Garimella, a product manager for a pharmaceutical company. “Even a person who is a citizen is not immune.”

Officials have released no information about operations in Raleigh.

A handful of cities and counties in North Carolina have found themselves part of America's debates over crime and immigration, two of the most important issues to the White House.

The most prominent was the fatal stabbing this summer of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train, an attack captured on video. The suspect was from the U.S., but the Trump administration repeatedly highlighted that he had been arrested previously more than a dozen times.

While the Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on the state because of sanctuary policies, most North Carolina county jails have long honored “detainers,” or requests from federal officials to hold an arrested immigrant for a limited time so agents can take custody of them.

Nevertheless, some common, noncooperation policies have existed in few places, including Raleigh and Charlotte, where the police do not help with immigration enforcement.

In Mecklenburg County, the jail did not honor detainer requests for several years, until after state law effectively made it mandatory starting last year. Wake County, where Raleigh is located, had a similar policy.

Matt Mercer, a spokesperson for the North Carolina Republican Party, said in a text message that the arrival of immigration agents to Raleigh would be a sign that failures by “radical Democrats will finally be taken seriously.”

DHS said about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored since October 2020, putting the public at risk.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) is soon to come face-to-face with difficult political decisions thanks to the actions of House Republicans.

The House plans to pass legislation this week to compel the release of the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files that will come on the heels of a last-minute reversal by President Donald Trump, which has been a contentious point of debate among Republicans for months.

TRUMP CALLS ON HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO PASS BILL RELEASING FULL EPSTEIN FILES

The lower chamber is also expected to pass a separate measure to roll back a controversial provision tucked into the shutdown-ending funding bill entitling Republican senators whose phone records were surveilled in connection to the 2021 Capitol attack to each sue the federal government for $500,000 or more.

Both are expected to clear the GOP-controlled House, presenting the latest friction point between the chambers and forcing Thune to reckon with whether to ignore bills fixated on subjects that have split the GOP or try to navigate the political peril by forging ahead with votes.

Senate GOP leaders have previously shown little willingness to entertain Epstein legislation to force the release of federal records tied to the late convicted sex offender. That includes Thune, who has downplayed the need to consider the measure but has also endorsed the Justice Department releasing the files without legislation.

A forced Senate vote in September by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to release the files ended in defeat mostly along party lines, with only two Republicans, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Rand Paul (R-KY), siding with all Democrats to vote against tabling the measure. The House's forthcoming vote is being forced against the wishes of Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) after a majority of representatives signed a discharge petition.

But all that was before Trump offered political cover to Republicans over the weekend by urging the House to pass the measure, marking a stark reversal from his previous lobbying against it. He posted to Truth Social, urging House Republicans to “vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.'”

Trump suggested Monday that the Senate should hold a vote but advised senators not to dwell on the subject so as not to “detract from the success of the Republican Party.” If passed by Congress, Trump confirmed he would sign it into law.

“They can do whatever they want,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office. “Let the Senate look at it. Let anybody look at it. But don't talk about it too much because, honestly, I don't want to take it away from us. It's really a Democrat problem.”

Email correspondence released by House Democrats last week revealed conversations in which Epstein alleged that Trump, prior to becoming president, “spent hours at my house” and “of course he knew about the girls.”

Thune's office did not comment on how he intends to handle the Epstein files or legislation on the DOJ surveillance operation known as “Arctic Frost.” As the majority leader, Thune can block most roll-call votes. Senate Democrats, who have advocated the release of the files, are expected to ratchet up the pressure and attempt to drive a further wedge among Republicans by trying to pass the legislation via unanimous consent, which any one member can block.

Johnson has softened his opposition to a provision Thune slipped into recent government funding legislation that greenlights a legal payout to the eight GOP senators whose phone records were subpoenaed without notice by former special counsel Jack Smith in his Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot investigation. It allows those affected lawmakers to sue the DOJ for $500,000 or more in damages and prompted wide-ranging criticism from Republicans, particularly in the House.

But after seeking clarity from Thune, Johnson said Senate Republicans' “motivation was pure” and endorsed tweaking the provision so that it only applies to future cases rather than advocating a full repeal.

JOHNSON CHANGES TUNE ON ‘ARCTIC FROST' FUNDING BILL PROVISION AFTER SPEAKING TO THUNE

“They were trying to put teeth into the provision of law that prevents these abuses like Jack Smith and these rogue prosecutors who weaponize the DOJ and go after political enemies,” Johnson said on Fox News Sunday. “There ought to be a penalty so we can deter further action like that in the future.”

The Epstein files bill could be passed in the House as early as Tuesday, and the DOJ legislation as early as Wednesday. The Senate returns from recess on Tuesday afternoon.

            The longest government shutdown in US history shook travel plans across America earlier this month as a shortage of air traffic controllers resulted in thousands of delayed or canceled flights.
    


            But even the end of the shutdown doesn't fix the the broader air traffic controller shortage that's been plaguing American flyers for years. Artificial intelligence, with its ability to analyze troves of data and potentially upend industries, might be able to help. After all, some in the field have called AI as impactful on everyday life as electricity or fire.



            While AI does have some practical uses in aviation like crunching data on weather patterns or aircraft trajectories, experts highlighted a range of reasons why the technology won't be a substitute for air traffic controllers anytime soon – or likely ever.
    


            “It's a human system, and it's human-centered for sure because it demands almost near perfect performance,” said Ross Sagun, a former pilot and air traffic controller with more than 50 years of flight experience. “The smallest mistakes can turn into giant disasters.”
    


            Air traffic controllers play a critical role in aviation, guiding jets safely both on the ground and in the air, ensuring safe distances are maintained between aircraft and communicating with pilots – skills that require multitasking, quick decision-making and intense concentration. The Federal Aviation Administration says it handles more than 44,000 flights a day, and 5,500 are in the sky at peak operational times.
    


            Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, described the job as demanding “unique skill and precision” in his written testimony for a hearing in March before the US House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Aviation of the Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure. He called air traffic controllers the “backbone” of the National Airspace System, adding that they “require rigorous training, a mastery of complex systems, and the ability to perform under immense pressure.”
    


            That pressure is exactly why the job can't be outsourced to AI, according to Sagun. Hearing emotion and stress in a pilot or fellow controller's voice is a key signal that something is wrong and it's unclear whether AI can detect those cues.
    


            “That's where you jump in, you scream for help, and we get people over there to take over the situation,” he said.
    


            The rate at which AI is evolving and changing would also make it hard to certify the technology, he added.
    


            There's little to no margin for error in air traffic control given the safety risks. Even if the technology were to be used for automating the process of guiding aircraft as they land or take off, human workers would still need to manage unforeseen circumstances, according to Amar Gupta, a research scientist with MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
    


            And some research as far back as the early 2000s suggests that type of arrangement, in which a human worker intervenes in the event of an emergency or automation error, may not always be effective. One study from 2005, for example, found that controllers were more likely to detect incidents manually than when using an automated tool that wasn't 100% reliable.
    


            Air traffic controllers might not be as vigilant if automation were to play a bigger role in their jobs since they wouldn't be as actively engaged in the environment, according to Michael McCormick, associate professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
    


            “That is the one thing that humans are very poor at doing — that very quickly, you lose vigilance, generally through boredom,” McCormick said.
    


            Experts say there is a place for AI to help with air traffic control, but it would just be to assist with duties rather than replacing jobs.
    


            With many air traffic controllers either retiring or finding other jobs during the shutdown, such help may be welcome. Air traffic controller staffing has plummeted since 2012, according to data cited by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), and the Federal Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan indicates the number of certified professional controllers fell below targets in 2024.
    


            AI could be useful for helping controllers understand weather patterns, potentially helping to predict the possibility of storms, according to Sagun.
    


            The FAA is working toward an upgraded system that uses AI to help analyze trajectories from aircraft in flight, estimate possible conflicts and provide recommendations to controllers, according to McCormick, though he says it is still years from testing and implementation.
    


            Searidge Technologies, owned by United Kingdom-based air traffic control services provider NATS, has developed an AI system for monitoring ground movements and facilitating communication with pilots.
    


            The technology is being used at London's Heathrow Airport to track aircraft exiting the runway and Florida's Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to monitor gate occupancy.
    


            The company says on its website that the technology isn't a replacement for human control. It's seeing “strong global interest” in its system and expects more “operational rollout and demonstration sites in the coming year,” Ron Reddick, vice president of global sales for Searidge Technologies, said in an emailed statement to CNN.
    


            But don't expect major upgrades to happen overnight in the United States.
    


            Implementing new technologies into air traffic control requires rigorous testing and is a lengthy ordeal, backed by infrastructure designed to last for decades. The Department of Transportation plans to upgrade the FAA's air traffic control system by 2028 with “all new hardware” and “all new software,” Secretary Sean Duffy said in May. But those upgrades are now going to take longer than initially planned, Duffy recently told reporters at a press conference.
    


            “The entire process takes years,” said McCormick when asked how long it would take to implement AI in current air traffic control systems. “We're in initial stages. We're not far down the road.”

﻿Or they could save it.

On Monday, the UN Security Council approved a US-drafted plan that calls for an international security force and that at least keeps the door open for eventual Palestinian statehood. But for the future of the tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the most important events may be happening not in New York, but below the streets of Rafah.

Gaza is hardly peaceful. Some 268 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the ceasefire began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, on top of those killed by Hamas. But there's been no return to the full-scale combat that persisted for two years.

That could still change. An acute risk to warfare resuming centers around dozens of Hamas fighters — perhaps as many as 200, though no one knows exactly — who have been trapped in underground tunnels behind Israeli lines since before the ceasefire, cut off from their compatriots and likely running low on food and water. The presence of these fighters is a serious threat to the ceasefire. They were likely responsible for the two ambushes that killed three IDF soldiers in October, each prompting Israeli retaliatory strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip.

Along with the ongoing dispute over whether Hamas is doing all it can to return the bodies of deceased hostages, the trapped Hamas fighters are also proving to be a diplomatic stumbling block, preventing the sides from moving on to larger issues: Israel wants the fighters to turn over their weapons and surrender; Hamas wants them to be given safe passage back to Hamas-controlled territory; the Trump administration wants the whole thing to go away.

The fate of the fighters is also an irresistible metaphor for the status of the ceasefire as a whole: They're currently in an untenable situation — but are stuck in place by the fear that whatever move they make might lead to something worse.

Five weeks after the ceasefire deal went into effect, Gaza is effectively divided in half: Israeli forces have withdrawn behind the so-called “yellow line,” but they still control a thick and largely depopulated swathe along Gaza's external borders with Israel and Egypt. Hamas, meanwhile, controls the Strip's interior. Hamas has not only not disarmed, it has reasserted control over the areas it controls, carrying out gun battles with rival armed gangs and executing accused collaborators with Israel. Though much of Hamas's leadership in Gaza was wiped out during the war, its rank and file appear surprisingly well-equipped.

The Trump administration would like to move on to the next phases of Trump's 20-point peace plan, which involve disarming Hamas, setting up an “International Stabilization Force” to provide security, and transitioning to a new governing authority in Gaza. That's going to be tough, as even White House officials admit in private.

Several Muslim-majority countries including Azerbaijan, Indonesia, and Pakistan have expressed interest in contributing troops to the new security force. (Turkey has as well, though that's a non-starter for Israel.)

But these countries are not interested in having their troops try to forcibly disarm Hamas, which could involve actual combat with the group amid the rubble of Gaza. And there's little indication that Hamas is interested in disarming on its own. The group's leaders rejected the prospect of a stabilization force before the Security Council vote.

The Israeli government, meanwhile, is not all that interested in moving forward to the later stages of the US peace plan that envision the Palestinian Authority taking control of Gaza and a new push toward a two-state solution. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is hoping to avoid a right-wing exodus that could bring down his government, vowed on Sunday to oppose any attempt to establish a Palestinian state, ahead of the UN vote on the US-drafted resolution, which calls for a “credible pathway” toward statehood. This language — as well as the fact that the normally UN-averse Trump administration is calling for a vote on it at all — arose from demands from the countries that would make up the stabilization force.

At the moment, the biggest threat in the region may be inertia: Grim as the status quo is, the current leaders of both Hamas and Israel seem to prefer it to moving forward with a political process that would leave Hamas disarmed, politically neutered, and replaced with a Palestinian Authority in a more credible position to demand statehood. Ironically, this is in many ways a return to the situation prior to October 7, 2023, when Hamas and Israel were tacitly working together to marginalize the PA and undermine Palestinian unity.

On the other hand, the current status quo is probably not sustainable, which brings us back to the Hamas fighters trapped in the tunnels under Rafah. Inertia might be driving both sides into a frozen conflict with each retreating behind the yellow line, but it will be harder to keep conflict frozen with a few dozen armed Hamas militants trapped behind enemy lines.

Some see the situation as a potential off-ramp that could allow the peace plan to move forward: Israel could agree to let them go only under the condition that Hamas begin turning over its weapons. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff has suggested that the fighters themselves could be granted amnesty and that this could be a “model” for what they're trying to achieve in the rest of Gaza.

Maybe. The issue reportedly came up in recent talks between Netanyahu and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. The prime minister has rejected a suggestion that he allow the fighters to travel, unarmed, across the yellow line into Hamas-held territory. And while there are reports of a possible plan to allow them to travel to a third country, it's not clear if there's a country willing to take them in.

As with Hamas and Israel broadly, the current situation can't last forever and efforts to forestall the inevitable may lead to catastrophe.

The longer the men are trapped, the more desperate they are likely to become, raising the potential that they may simply go down fighting rather than surrender. Given the massive retaliation Israel has carried out in response to deadly attacks on its forces over the past month, we may soon be faced with the question of just how much fighting there can be in Gaza while we're still saying a “ceasefire” is in place.

Cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Jeremy London discusses the best lifestyle approach to maintaining good heart health, including the "80/20" rule for eating whole foods.

A daily glass of orange juice might do more than deliver vitamin C. It may influence gene activity in ways that support heart health, according to new research.

In a small but detailed study, 20 healthy adults drank about two cups of 100% orange juice every day for two months. 

Researchers from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, North Carolina State University and the University of California, Davis, tracked changes in more than 1,700 genes within participants' immune cells, finding broad shifts in genetic activity tied to blood pressure, fat metabolism and inflammation — all key factors in cardiovascular health.

The findings highlight how citrus flavonoids — plant compounds also found in berries, tea and cocoa that act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories — may influence the body at a molecular level. The research was published in the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research in late October.

Most of the changes among participants pointed toward lower inflammation and healthier blood vessel function, though responses differed by body weight. Normal-weight participants showed shifts in inflammation-related genes, while those who were overweight displayed changes tied to fat metabolism and energy use.

"These findings reinforce the therapeutic potential of orange juice by providing unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms behind its health effects," the researchers wrote. 

"Orange juice isn't an elixir — it's one deeply studied example."

The findings also suggest that body weight "may influence molecular response to bioactive compounds in OJ and provide information for personalized recommendations on the consumption of flavonoid-rich foods," they added.

The researchers cautioned that the study was small and lacked a control beverage, showing associations rather than proof of cause and effect. 

They said more research is needed to determine whether these molecular shifts translate into clinical benefits.

"Orange juice isn't an elixir — it's one deeply studied example," Pace told Fox News Digital. 

Nonetheless, she said, the new study "opens the door to incredible possibilities for how individualized nutrition can truly work." (She was not involved with the study.) 

"In normal amounts, the sugar content doesn't cancel out the benefits."

Pace said she recommends low to moderate daily orange juice consumption.

Fox News Digital reached out to the study's authors for comment.

Meanwhile, past research has found that adults who drank 100% orange juice before a meal ate fewer total calories and had lower blood sugar levels throughout the day compared to those who drank a sugar-sweetened "orange drink," Fox News Digital previously reported.

Researchers at Toronto Metropolitan University determined that the difference likely comes from orange juice's natural flavonoids, which may slow sugar absorption, showing that the body can differentiate between natural sugars and added sugars, according to the 2024 study.

Brett McGurk is a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.



            More than two decades ago, on January 24, 2004, I landed in Baghdad as a legal adviser, assigned an office in what was then known as the Green Zone. It was raining and cold, and my duffle bag was thrown into a puddle off the C-130 aircraft that had just done a corkscrew dive to reach the runway without risk of ground fire. Young American soldiers greeted me as we piled into a vehicle, sped out of the airport complex and then along a road called the “Highway of Death” due to car bombs and snipers.
    


What has our country gotten itself into?



            That was my first thought on that harrowing ride, and over the course of a year in the country and then across subsequent presidential administrations, I often counseled prudence and caution when setting American foreign policy objectives. That is especially the case when it comes to the use of military power, the application of which must be tied to clear, articulated and achievable aims.
    


            You might think the current situation in Venezuela – where the US has now deployed 15% of its naval power and is conducting ground exercises nearby – triggers a cautionary tale to stop before our country once again finds itself in a situation that we do not fully understand with uncertain consequences.
    


            Not so fast.
    


            The situation in Venezuela today has little comparison to Iraq and far more resembles Panama 35 years ago, before the US military operation to remove a dictator and install an elected government that enjoyed vast support from the population there.  That mission was a success, and Panama today is a functioning democracy, friendly to the US, albeit not without problems from crime to corruption.
    


            Is it possible that we are so paralyzed by the Iraq (and Afghanistan) experience, to miss an opportunity to improve the lives of Venezuelans and stability in our own hemisphere along the lines of Panama?  



            On December 20, 1989, President George H.W. Bush addressed the nation to define the rationale behind the mission he had just ordered into Panama.  He explained that Panama was led by “an indicted drug trafficker,” Manuel Noriega, who would soon “be brought to justice” in the US.  Bush added that Noriega annulled democratic elections, and that the winners of those elections would soon take power in Panama City likely with broad support.  Noriega's regime also threatened and harmed Americans, including the recent death of an American soldier, shot by Noriega's security services.
    


            Finally, Bush discussed the strategic importance of the Panama Canal, and Washington's commitment to existing treaties that Noriega was unlikely to honor.
    


            Against that backdrop, Bush explained the goals of the mission: “To safeguard the lives of Americans, to defend democracy in Panama, to combat drug trafficking, and to protect the integrity of the Panama Canal Treaty.”
    


            Two weeks later, Noriega was in US custody, the elected opposition government took power, and US forces began to leave the country.
    


            I recently spoke with a former US military counterpart who took part in this operation, parachuting into Panama before Bush made that address. “Out of our many military ventures since Korea,” he told me, “Panama must be considered one of our most successful. To go there now is to see a very prosperous Democratic country.”
    


            Now, let's look at Venezuela –
    


            The country is run by Nicolas Maduro, who like Noriega faces criminal indictments in US courts. The charges against Maduro are more extensive. His 2020 indictment in New York lists counts of narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, and corruption. He is also accused of heading the trafficking organization “Cartel de los Soles,” which the State Department just branded a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Washington has offered a $50 million reward for anyone that can help bring Maduro into US custody.
    


            Like Noriega, Maduro has also invalidated successive elections and violently suppressed democratic movements inside his country. The US and most of its Western allies recognize the opposition led by Maria Corina Machado as Venezuela's legitimate government. Opposition parties according to independent observers received 70% of the national vote in Venezuela's presidential elections in 2024, which Maduro claims to have won.
    


            Finally, Maduro, like Noriega, has threatened and harmed American citizens, as well as regional peace and security. In recent years, like his allies in Iran, Maduro has effectively held Americans as hostages for diplomatic maneuvering with the US. These hostages include an American sailor vacationing in Venezuela, longtime American residents of the country, and US-based executives of Citgo, the US subsidiary of Venezuela's state oil company.
    


            In 2023, Maduro threatened to invade neighboring Guyana, an American ally, and today claims sovereignty over two-thirds of Guyana, justifying the claim – much like Putin over eastern Ukraine – based on false history and a staged referendum.
    


            If Maduro is replaced in Caracas, there is no guarantee that local authorities throughout the country would work with the new government, opening the prospect for civil wars and a violent competition for power and resources.  Maduro claims to have recruited a militia in the millions to resist any US-backed operation, and while that claim may be exaggerated, we should presume that drug cartels may seize control in the countryside as opposed to the forces of democracy we might hope or wish to see prevail.
    


            Venezuela is over 10 times larger than Panama, something military planners would likely recommend required a far larger force than the nearly 26,000 personnel deployed in in the 1989 operation.
    


            The geostrategic context is also vastly different. In 1989, the Soviet Union had collapsed with the Berlin Wall coming down six weeks before the US invasion of Panama. America was the undisputed great power in the world, and there was no reason to expect or anticipate other great powers resisting the military operation or making moves of their own in other hemispheres.
    


            Today, Russia and China are aligned with Maduro, and their leaders would likely cite any US operation in Venezuela as further justification to pursue their own hemispheric ambitions, against Ukraine and Taiwan, respectively.
    


            President Donald Trump last week said cryptically that he had “made up his mind” on a course of action in Venezuela. That followed CNN reporting on multiple high level White House meetings with military commanders on options following the Naval buildup off the coast and exercises conducted by the US Marine Corps across rural and urban areas of Trinidad and Tobago.
    


            Maduro seems to be reading into these moves a possible American intervention, calling up his militias while also appealing for dialogue, even singing John Lennon's peace anthem “Imagine” at a recent rally.
    


            Adding to the confusion, the administration has not been clear on the aims for what it now calls Operation Southern Spear. The Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, described the mission as one to “defend our homeland, remove narcoterrorism from our hemisphere, and secure our homeland from the drugs that are killing our people.” While there has been no mention in official statements of restoring democracy in Venezuela, or an objective to seek the removal of Maduro as its leader, Trump has declared Maduro's days “numbered” and the military deployments, including the most advanced carrier strike group in the US arsenal, suggest aims beyond the publicly stated goals of Southern Spear.
    


            To be sure, the removal of Maduro is in the interests of the US and the people of Venezuela. Before the rule of Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, the country was among the most prosperous in South America, whereas today it's a shambles with per capita income falling by 72 percent, one of the sharpest economic collapses in history. More than three-quarters of the country by reputable polling opposes his rule, and there is an opposition government prepared to take power if given the chance to do so.
    


            The Trump administration despite its saber rattling seems unlikely to pursue regime change militarily, a course of action that would cut against its stated aversion to prolonged military engagements. Nor would I advise them otherwise. The differences with Panama at this stage outweigh the similarities or hope that an operation against Maduro might go as well as Panama over three decades ago.
    


            But the administration should not withdraw the leverage that it has now built up against Maduro and use it to good effect.
    


            Short of a military operation to oust Maduro, the administration can demand that he give up key figures of the drug trafficking networks inside Venezuela, withdraw claims on Guyana, and pledge to hold new elections with international observers, which he would surely lose.  To go a step further, the administration might demand his exile, perhaps to Russia, where he can join Bashar al-Asad, the former president of Syria, another dictator who destroyed his own country for the sake of personal power.  For any of this to work, the administration would need to secure support from allies, including in South America, something that to date it has been unable or unwilling to do when it comes to its aims in Venezuela.
    


            In any case, before the US embarks on a policy to replace Maduro, whether by military means or otherwise, there should be a congressional debate to weigh pros and cons, something that today also is not happening due to dysfunction in Washington.
    


            The US after two decades of protracted military engagements overseas is rightly wary of any new endeavor that envisions regime change.  That caution is warranted, but in Venezuela the case for Maduro's removal from power are both compelling and draw more parallels to Panama than to Iraq.  However, the build-up of military power off its coast can best be used to achieve objectives that in the end do not require its use in the country.

            Surging import costs. Mounting payroll and healthcare expenses. A shortage of affordable loans. And a stressed-out workforce. Small businesses are facing mounting pressure from America's affordability crisis.
    


            Doug Scheffel, owner of a family-run ETM Manufacturing in Massachusetts, laid off about a quarter of his employees in April as the Trump administration's haphazard tariff rollout dented demand for the machine parts and sheet metal his company sells.
    


            “Everyone is hunkering down and building up cash. It's never been this bad,” Scheffel told CNN in a phone interview. “It's very uncertain and impossible to plan in this environment.”
    


            Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, accounting for the vast majority of total businesses in the nation, nearly half of all employees and the bulk of the job growth.



            Like other small businesses, ETM Manufacturing can't take advantage of growth opportunities because financing is so expensive. The average rate on a new urban small business term loan was over 7% at the end of last year, according to the Kansas City Fed, but many small businesses face rates well north of 10%.
    


            “It's infuriating,” Scheffel said.
    


            High prices at the grocery store and elsewhere have left some of ETM's employees preoccupied with their own finances.
    


            “Most of our employees are distracted. They're worried about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their kid,” Scheffel said. “Bad stuff happens when they're not totally focused.”
    


            Scheffel's employees are hardly alone. About one in four US households are living paycheck to paycheck, meaning they are spending over 95% of their income on necessities like housing and groceries, according to estimates from Bank of America.
    


            The mood among mom-and-pop shops on Main Street is mixed. While small business owners tell CNN they are hopeful about the future and excited about how artificial intelligence can help them, some are concerned about the headaches incurred by the ever-changing trade war and high costs.
    


            Bryan Pate, CEO of San Diego-based PT Motion Works, an exercise equipment company that sells elliptical bikes, GIBBON SlackBoards and Indo Board balance boards, told CNN that his business is struggling to keep up with rapidly rising healthcare costs.
    


            Over the past two decades, the average cost of single coverage health insurance has surged by 120% for companies with fewer than 50 employees, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), a nonprofit that advocates for small businesses.
    


            “It's unbelievable how much healthcare has gone up,” Pate said, noting this is a big disadvantage small businesses have against large corporations. “It's an unfair barrier to hiring.”
    


            Those healthcare and payroll expenses add to the pressure from the historic tariff hikes under President Donald Trump.
    


            “We just don't know what the guy is gonna do. It creates so much anxiety and time-wasting,” Pate said of Trump's evolving tariff policies.
    


            Trump has raised tariffs on US imports to an average rate of 16.8%, the highest since 1935, according to estimates released by The Budget Lab at Yale on Monday.
    


            Pate said his businesses have been hammered by tariffs — including the 20% levy on Taiwan, where its bikes are manufactured.
    


            Ironically, the tariffs are wiping out some US manufacturing jobs.
    


            Pate said his company recently ended contracts with seven assembly workers based in San Diego and now employs workers in Mexico instead. And Pate plans to raise prices on bikes to offset the cost of tariffs but worries that will erode demand.
    


            “It's been economically painful, and long-term, if tariffs stay where they are, it's just not going to work,” he said.
    


            Troy Rackley, CEO at The Next Level of Performance, a Sarasota, Florida-based water treatment technology company, told CNN on the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington he has had to raise prices on some of his products due to US tariffs on imports from Australia and China. 



            Rackley dismissed the argument that exporting countries are paying US tariffs and hopes the Supreme Court rules against the Trump administration's use of emergency powers to justify its global tariffs.
    


            “China, Mexico and Canada don't pay. I'm the one that's paying for it,” Rackley said. “I pay taxes on my income, and now I have to pay additional taxes on what I bring in.”
    


            Khari Parker, a graduate of the Goldman Sachs small business program and co-founder of Connie's Chicken and Waffles in Baltimore, isn't facing any tariff trouble, but he's struggling to find affordable capital.
    


            “We've being hit with very, very high rates of 20% to 30%,” Parker said.
    


            The Trump administration has worked to support small businesses by providing capital through the Small Business Administration (SBA).
    


            Since Trump took office, the SBA estimates it has approved more than 58,000 small business loans worth over $32 billion. For fiscal 2025, which closed at the end of September, the SBA said it guaranteed a record-setting $44.8 billion of small business loans.
    


            Small business optimism increased sharply after Trump took office before retreating after Trump's tariff plans spooked financial markets, according to the NFIB. Optimism later recovered and is currently slightly above its 52-year average.
    


            One recurring struggle for small businesses like Parker's: attracting talent.
    


            “It's very hard to find workers. We can't always offer the same competitive benefits or pay that larger businesses can,” Parker said.
    


            For some companies in construction, those challenges have been amplified by the immigration crackdown.
    


            “A lot of the workforce is nervous from all the stuff going on with immigration,” said Antonio McMillion, president of Maryland-based developer MFP Management & Construction.
    


            McMillion said his company has been forced to hire more expensive workers, raising their labor costs on some projects by up to 40%.
    


            “Hopefully we can pass on the price to the client, but that could also mean you don't get the job,” he said.
    


            Pate, the CEO of PT Motion Works, is very frustrated by tariffs but remains optimistic about the future because of his employees' resilience in the face of uncertainty.
    


            “It could be very depressing and demoralizing,” he said, “but no one is throwing in the towel.”

A Party for Socialism and Liberation chapter, known for its left-wing protests, led a mass uprising in Charlotte this weekend against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Thousands of activists took to the streets of Charlotte on Saturday for an “emergency” march, carrying uniform signage bearing the name of a national socialist organization responsible for fomenting much of the recent anti-ICE unrest across America.

The foreign-funded Party for Socialism and Liberation's Charlotte chapter organized the citywide resistance in response to U.S. Border Patrol launching a large-scale deportation operation, dubbed Operation Charlotte's Web, in the so-called “sanctuary city” over the weekend.

During the demonstration, activists at the forefront of the march unfurled a banner displaying the organization's branding. Protesters were seen waving Mexican flags and chanting “Chinga La Migra,” a Spanish slogan that roughly translates to “F*** ICE.”

DHS BEGINS IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN IN CHARLOTTE

Asha Patel, a PSL leader, told WCNC Charlotte that her group is trying to drive deportation officers out of the city, similar to the anti-ICE pressure campaign seen in Chicago. Patel credited these counter-efforts as the reason why Border Patrol withdrew from Chicago late last week.

“It's not a coincidence that Border Patrol was forced out of Chicago,” she said. “It was through a mass movement of people demanding that they leave. And so that is what we're doing here today.”

PSL Charlotte also held an organizing meeting on Sunday afternoon in a rented office space uptown to strategize on how to disperse federal forces from the city.

“Chicago showed us that the people can defeat the deportation machine but only if we fight back and are organized,” a PSL organizer said in an announcement video advertising the strategizing session.

OFFICER INJURED IN VAN ATTACK DURING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT OPERATION IN CHARLOTTE

PSL Charlotte began circulating call-to-action material days before Border Patrol made landfall in North Carolina. A coalition of local and national organizations sponsored the protest, including Blakk Liberation and 50501, one of the organizing forces behind the nationwide “No Kings” movement.

On the heels of their successful turnout over the weekend, PSL operatives are pouncing on the opportunity to recruit new members. PSL Triangle, which covers the cities of Chapel Hill, Raleigh, and Durham, will host an informational event on Thursday night at Nuestro Barrio Liberation Cafe, a coffee shop “dedicated to resistance” near North Carolina Central University's campus, for comrades to learn about how to join the socialist collective.

PSL is a self-described “revolutionary” political party headquartered in San Francisco with well-documented ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

The Network Contagion Research Institute, a watchdog organization that tracks geopolitical influence, previously reported on the PSL's connections to the CCP through its billionaire benefactor, Shanghai-based businessman Neville Roy Singham, a Maoist megadonor known for backing CCP-praising nonprofit organizations and media entities that echo pro-Beijing propaganda.

PSL, a longtime defender of China's human rights record, has published articles denying the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and hailing CCP Chairman Mao Zedong's Chinese Revolution as “a historic achievement,” one of the “greatest events…in the history of the working-class struggle.”

With the stated objective of overthrowing America's capitalist system, PSL calls on its city-specific chapters to stage disruptive protests across the country.

The causes vary depending on the political climate and what polarizing issues PSL can mobilize around. PSL's members participated in the anti-Israel encampment on Columbia University's campus. In 2020, PSL was actively involved in the anti-police riots.

That year, several PSL members were charged with rioting, incitement, attempted first-degree kidnapping, and obstructing government operations, among a slew of offenses, for forming a seven-hour blockade outside a police precinct in Aurora, Colorado. According to authorities, the mob blocked doors and adjacent roads. However, all of the charges were dropped after PSL demanded the case's dismissal.

When the summer riots in Los Angeles erupted, PSL activated followers from all corners of the country to rise up in solidarity, orchestrate parallel protests, and even intimidate ICE agents.

For example, PSL's Los Angeles branch gathered Angelenos on the steps of City Hall to get “ICE Out of LA,” a rallying phrase that has since been repurposed for cities targeted by federal immigration officials.

PSL's San Antonio arm explained to the San Antonio Express-News that they believe the more cities that oppose ICE operations through these mass mobilization campaigns, the more difficult a federal crackdown will become.

In June, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, named the PSL in a letter as part of a congressional investigation into the non-governmental organizations that were funding the Los Angeles riots.

WHO IS FUNDING THE ANTI-ICE ACTIVISTS IN LA?

Hawley cited “credible reporting,” suggesting that the PSL provided financial resources or logistical support to individuals engaged in “lawless mob actions.” The senator's letter, addressed to PSL leadership, noted that knowingly financing unlawful protest activity is considered aiding and abetting criminal conduct.

PSL chapters, such as the ones operating in Milwaukee and the District of Columbia, continue to convene massive “ICE Out” rallies to “Stop the Raids.” 

The Washington Examiner contacted PSL Charlotte for comment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — For years, Washington has been warning others not to trust loans from Chinese state banks fueling its rise as a superpower. But a new report reveals an ironic twist: The United States is the biggest recipient of all — by far. And the security and technology implications have yet to be fully understood.

China's state lenders have funneled $200 billion into U.S. businesses for a quarter of a century, but many of the loans have been kept secret because the money was first routed through shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Delaware and elsewhere that helped obscure their origins, according to AidData, a research lab at the College of William & Mary in Virginia. 

More alarming, much of the lending was to help Chinese companies buy stakes in U.S. businesses, many tied to critical technology and national security, including a robotics maker, a semiconductor company and a biotech firm.

The report found a far more widespread and sophisticated lending network than previously thought — a web of financial obligations extending beyond developing countries to rich ones, including the U.K., Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and other U.S. allies.

“China was playing chess while the rest of us were playing checkers,” said former White House investment adviser William Henagan, who worries the hidden lending has given China a chokehold on technologies. “Wars will be won or lost based on whether you can control products critical to running an economy.”

While the U.S. still welcomes most foreign investment — and President Donald Trump has courted it — money from China has drawn particular scrutiny as the world's two biggest economies with opposing ideologies battle for global supremacy. 

Deals financed by China's state-owned banks, the ones studied in the AidData report, are especially problematic. The lenders are controlled by China's central government and the Communist Party's Central Financial Commission, and they are directed to advance China's strategic goals.

In total, the AidData report found China lent more than $2 trillion from 2000 through 2023 around the world, double the highest previous estimates and a surprise to even longtime analysts of China's rise. And much of the lending to wealthy countries was focused on critical minerals and high-tech assets — rare earths and semiconductors needed for fighter jets, submarines, radar systems, precision-guided missiles and telecom networks.

“The U.S., under both (former President Joe) Biden and Trump, have been beating this drum for more than a decade that Beijing is a predatory lender,” said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. “The irony is very rich.”

Until now, a full accounting of China's state lending has never been published because much of the financing is buried beneath layers of secrecy, masked by Western-sounding shell companies and mislabeled by international databases as ordinary private financing.

“There is a complete lack of transparency that speaks to the lengths to which China goes, whether through shell companies or confidentiality agreements or redactions, to make it extremely difficult to come up with this full picture,” said Scott Nathan, the former head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., an agency set up in the first Trump term to invest in foreign projects deemed in the U.S. national interest.

Since the report's last documented loan in 2023, U.S. scrutiny has gotten better. Screening mechanisms, such as the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., got beefed up in 2020 to protect sensitive sectors in the economy. 

But China has gotten better, too, in part by setting up banks and branches overseas — more than 100 in recent years — that then lend to offshore entities, further clouding the origins of the money.

“In places where there are more cops on the beat,” Parks said, “it has found ways to work around barriers to entry.”

Chinese state bank financing has touched projects across the U.S., particularly in the Northeast, the Great Lakes region, the West Coast and along the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has renamed the Gulf of America. Many loans targeted critical high-tech industries, according to the report.

— In 2015, for instance, Chinese state-owned banks lent $1.2 billion to a private Chinese business to buy an 80% stake in Ironshore, a U.S. insurer whose clients included the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation officials and undercover agents who might need help paying legal bills in case they got into trouble in their jobs. 

U.S. regulators were unaware of the Chinese government involvement because the financing was funneled through a Cayman Island business with no obvious ties to China, according to the report. U.S. officials later realized the Chinese government could access information and ordered the Chinese buyer to divest.

— That same year, the Chinese government published “Made in China 2025,” a list of 10 high-tech areas, such as semiconductors, biotechnology and robotics, where it wanted to reach 70% self-sufficiency within a decade. The next year, in 2016, the Export–Import Bank of China, a policy bank, provided $150 million in loans to help a Chinese company buy a robotics equipment company in Michigan.

After China's adoption of the manufacturing master plan, the percentage of projects targeting sensitive sectors such as robotics, defense, quantum computing and biotechnology rose from 46% to 88% of China's portfolio for cross-border acquisition lending, according to AidData.

— In 2017, a Delaware private equity firm using a Cayman Islands company tried to buy a U.S. chip maker; the deal was blocked when investigators discovered both companies were owned by a Chinese state-owned enterprise. That same Delaware company successfully bought a U.K. semiconductor maker that had to be divested when British authorities found out. 

— And in 2022, the U.K. forced a Chinese company to divest another sensitive British firm in the industry, a designer of chips in Apple phones but potentially adaptable for military systems. The Chinese company had bought it through a company in the Netherlands that they owned. That Dutch firm is now accused of withholding semiconductors vital to automakers in the U.S.-China trade war.

To trace China's hidden lending, AidData dug through regulatory filings, private contracts and stock exchange disclosures in more than 200 countries written in multiple languages.

The effort to track China's state loans and investment started more than a decade ago when Beijing launched its Belt & Road Initiative to build infrastructure in developing countries. The project expanded sharply three years ago when the AidData team, which eventually grew to 140 researchers, realized many of the loans were landing in advanced economies such as the U.S., Australia, the Netherlands and Portugal, where acquisitions could allow it to access technology that Beijing considers essential to its global rise. 

The report says the findings show a shift in the use of state credit from promoting economic development and social welfare to gaining geo-economic advantages. 

“There's global concern that this is part of a concerted effort to gain control over economic chokepoints and use this leverage,” said Brad Setser, an adviser to the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. “It's important that we understand what they're doing, and they don't make it easy.”

House Democrats were unable to block a motion from Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) reprimanding her fellow Democrat, Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia (D-IL), for the methods he used to announce and then recant plans for reelection, setting up for a final vote Tuesday.

The House voted against tabling Perez's motion, which would have essentially removed it from consideration, on Monday night, 206-211. A vote on the resolution will likely come Tuesday, as it must now be debated on the House floor.

Despite efforts from leadership to whip in favor of tabling the motion, two Democrats joined all Republicans in voting against tabling: Perez and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), a fellow centrist who often sidesteps leaders on contentious legislation. Ten Republicans and six Democrats did not vote.

Perez's motion to condemn Garcia is a rare moment of Democrat vs. Democrat infighting and an even rarer instance of a lawmaker seeking a reprimand of someone within the same party.

Perez's motion came after Garcia filed for reelection on Oct. 27 but then decided to retire on Nov. 7. His chief of staff, Patty García, filed for the race on Nov. 3, just prior to the state board's deadline, raising speculation that Chuy Garcia gave his chief a heads-up to file for candidacy to become the only Democratic candidate in a D+17 seat.

Gluesenkamp Perez had said the Illinois Democrat's decision to “anoint an heir is fundamentally undemocratic” in a statement on why she filed the motion.

On the House floor, Perez insisted that her resolution does not challenge Garcia's record and work in Congress and Illinois, but “no good work means that you are able to end your career with impunity and choosing your successor.”

“It's clear to me that my responsibility as an elected representative is to say loudly and consistently, humbly, and with love that no one has the right to subvert the right to choose their elected representatives,” Perez said.

Perez was the sole Democrat to speak in favor of her resolution. A handful of Democrats are speaking in defense of Garcia, arguing that the resolution is “dragg[ing] his name through the mud” and is not the most pressing issue happening in lawmakers' districts.

“This Democratic intraparty fighting is not what any of us want, and it's not what the American people deserve, and I would hope get back to focusing on the issues that are most critical,” Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA) said. “And if any of us have an issue with what's going on in somebody's district, we should have the decency and respect to go to them and ask them about what's going on in their district before we do all of this kind of character assassination on the House floor.”

Perez responded and said that members should speak out and take accountability, “not just when it's politically convenient to condemn someone, but when it's in your own family.”

The motion was met with disapproval from Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA) and other leaders right off the bat, who was seen sternly talking to Perez before the Washington congresswoman introduced her privileged motion on Nov. 12.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said ahead of Monday's vote he would support the motion to table and he expected it to succeed.

When asked whether the manner in which Chuy Garcia retired was wrong, Jeffries said people are more concerned with the high cost of living in the country.

“As House Democrats, that's what we're going to focus on,” Jeffries continued. “I do not support this so-called resolution of disapproval. And I strongly support Congressman Chuy Garcia. He's been a progressive champion in disenfranchised communities for decades, including during his time in Congress, and he's made life better for the American people.” 

Prior to the vote, Garcia's office circulated talking points about his decision to retire, per a memo obtained by Politico. In the talking points, his office said the motion “creates distraction and divisiveness among Democrats” and was a “ploy that our opponents will use for their own gain.” 

The memo also argued that the congressman followed “all requirements and deadlines” under Illinois law and “the ballot was open to everyone.” 

“We deeply appreciate your boss' support and welcome their participation in floor debate about this inappropriate response that weaponizes Congressman Garcia's personal decision in order to score political points,” Chuy Garcia's office said.

Illinois's 4th Congressional District is rated D+17 by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, so whoever wins the Democratic nomination is all but assured a win in the general election, hence Perez's resolution.

Patty Garcia may be the only Democrat in the race, but Byron Sigcho-Lopez, a progressive Chicago alderman, told the Chicago Sun-Times earlier this month he is considering an independent bid in the district. Mayra Macías, former executive director of both Latino Victory Project and Build Back Together, is also planning to run as an independent, per NOTUS.

A person familiar told the outlet that Macías was spurred to run because Chuy Garcia “attempted to coronate his chief of staff, as she believes voters in her home district deserve a choice in who represents them.” 

The Washington Examiner reached out to Chuy Garcia, Perez, and Macias for comment.

The Trump administration says it will transfer much of the U.S. Department of Education's programs to other agencies, a move experts say is part of President Donald Trump's directive to dismantle the agency.

During a press call with reporters on Tuesday, a senior administration official said the administration had signed agreements with four other federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to begin managing programs currently under the Education Department.

Under the new agreements, the Labor Department will administer more federal K-12 programs, and the State Department will assume additional tasks related to international education, according to the Education Department.

Trump signed an executive order in March aimed at closing the Education Department, which oversees the country's $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio, provides funding to low-income students and enforces civil rights in classrooms across the country.

Only Congress can unilaterally eliminate the Education Department. But the Trump administration may be trying to use a workaround by contracting with other agencies to perform the department's tasks.

"They are attempting to hollow out the U.S. Department of Education, leaving behind a shell of the original organization," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration laid off nearly half of the Education Department's staffers.

"We'll peel back the layers of federal bureaucracy by partnering with agencies that are better suited to manage programs," Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon wrote in a recent op-ed in USA Today.

The government shutdown "underlined just how little the Department of Education will be missed," McMahon said.

Former President Jimmy Carter established the current-day Education Department in 1979. Since then, the department has faced other existential threats, with former President Ronald Reagan calling for its end and Trump, during his first term, attempting to merge it with the Labor Department.

Here on the Reviews team, Black Friday is our Super Bowl, and for good reason. The actual event is still over a week away, but our favorite retailers, big and small, are already celebrating with some of the best deals we've seen all year. If you're hoping to knock out as much of your shopping as possible in one go, from early holiday gifts and Thanksgiving essentials to big-ticket tech upgrades, Amazon's Black Friday sale has it all.

Amazon's sale is definitely massive, but not all of the discounts are actually worth it. Especially with the main event still days away, we expect that many products will drop to even lower prices when it arrives.

We've compiled the best deals from Amazon below that you won't regret buying now, especially if you're in immediate need. If you can wait, I'd recommend it — but if an untimely birthday or early holiday party has you shopping now, these picks will help you skip the worry.

In this article

Meta won its high-profile antitrust case against the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused the company of holding a monopoly in social networking. In a memorandum opinion released Tuesday, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said the FTC failed to prove its argument. The case, initially filed by the FTC five years ago, centered on Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.

"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now," Boasberg said in the filing. "The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so. A judgment so stating shall issue this day."

Boasberg dismissed the case in 2021, saying the agency didn't have enough evidence to prove "Facebook holds market power." In August of that year, the FTC filed an amended complaint with more details about the company's user numbers and metrics relative to competitors like Snapchat, the now-defunct Google+ social network and Myspace. After reviewing the amendments, Boasberg in 2022 ruled that the case could proceed, saying the FTC had presented more details than before.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former operating chief Sheryl Sandberg, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom and other current and former Meta executives all testified in the trial, which began in April.

Meta shares were little changed on Tuesday. The stock is up about 2% for the year, badly underperforming broader indexes and most of its megacap tech peers. 

"The Court's decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition," the company said in a statement. "Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America." 

The FTC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  

The ruling comes a little over two months after Google avoided the harshest possible penalty from an antitrust case it lost last year. While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided the company would not be forced to sell its Chrome browser, bucking the Department of Justice's request. Google was, however, ordered to loosen its hold on search data.

In the Meta case, the FTC claimed the company shouldn't have been allowed to buy Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, and the agency called for those units to be divested. The commission also alleged that there were no major alternatives for apps like Facebook and Instagram that people use to communicate with friends and family in a online, social space.

However, a major challenge for the FTC, according to the judge, was in proving that Meta is breaking antitrust law today, not years ago when the primary use of social networks was very different and based on sharing other kinds of content.

"To win the permanent injunction that it seeks here, the FTC must prove a current or imminent legal violation," he wrote.

Boasberg ultimately sided with Meta's argument that the technology industry has evolved since the early days of Facebook, and the company now faces a wide variety of competitors like TikTok.

"While each of Meta's empirical showings can be quibbled with, they all tell a consistent story: people treat TikTok and YouTube as substitutes for Facebook and Instagram, and the amount of competitive overlap is economically important," Boasberg wrote. "Against that unmistakable pattern, the FTC offers no empirical evidence of substitution whatsoever."

Much of Judge Boasberg's conclusion was built on the transformation that's taken place in the social media market in recent years and Meta's changing position within it. User trends have moved heavily in the direction of video, where TikTok and YouTube have massive user bases and huge network effects.

"The most-used part of Meta's apps is thus indistinguishable from the offerings on TikTok and YouTube," Boasberg wrote.

Boasberg explained that there was enough evidence to show "that consumers are reallocating massive amounts of time from Meta's apps" to those services and others, which has "forced Meta to invest gobs of cash to keep up."

"Meta is not a monopolist insulated from competition," he wrote. "The Court finds the evidence favoring Meta on this issue both credible and convincing."

Boasberg also cited various documents and testimony from "industry insiders" that show how other tech companies like TikTok and YouTube viewed Meta as serious competition. "TikTok and YouTube tracked Meta's products as competitive threats," Boasberg wrote.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brian Chukwuisiocha, a 22-year-old computer science student based in the Washington metropolitan area. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

Apple taught me how to own my work and care more about who's using the products I work on.

I worked there in my sophomore year from May 2024 to August 2024 as an intern. It was a great experience, and it really aligned with my original motivation for getting into software engineering: to make things that people can use and help them in everyday life.

They liked the amount of knowledge I had in coding for iOS apps, and I was interviewed for four different positions. After two to three rounds of interviews, I ended up on the Apple Fitness+ team. I was earning $42 an hour while there.

But when it came time to start thinking about post-graduation employment, I didn't end up applying for an entry-level role at Apple. Instead, I accepted a full-time job offer from my most recent internship.

Apple is a dream company for many software engineering students, and working in Cupertino was a one-of-a-kind experience. Ultimately, there were a couple of factors that led me to seek out a different job for after college.

In my three months on the job, I learned that Apple is very intentional about the environment it's created on the main campus. It's fostered an atmosphere of creativity that's led to their most iconic products.

However, Apple Park is sort of siloed off from the rest of the world. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just took me a minute to learn what's what with all of the secrecy and privacy that Apple is known for. There were a lot of parts of the campus that I didn't have access to as an intern.

It's a whole Apple village. For example, they have trails for walks or jogs, and the gym is the coolest gym I've ever seen in my life. The only thing it's missing is a place to sleep.

I appreciated the seclusion, since it promoted collaboration with my teammates, and I made friends that I'll probably have for a lifetime in my fellow interns. It's so closed off that you don't hear the outside world, like an ambulance passing by.

I've lived in several different countries, and I'm used to being surrounded by people of diverse backgrounds. For me, as a Nigerian man, it was hard to find my community there. It was hard to find food I loved and places to get my hair done compared to the East Coast where I'm from.

Apple Park probably couldn't exist in New York, though, so I understand why the West Coast is appealing for tech companies. There's more space, and you can create your own tech community and economy.

It makes sense for Big Tech, but I'm a multifaceted person. I have interests outside of tech, and it felt like I couldn't grow my other passions in the Bay Area.

In my years of programming, I've learned that new grads can have a tougher time standing out at Big Tech companies. You're coming in at the bottom of the food chain. Many undergrads just don't have enough experience to differentiate themselves from the rest of the applicants hoping to land a full-time position.

They can end up being just a number at some tech firms, and I didn't want that to happen to me.

After I graduate, I'll be working in financial tech in New York City. But that doesn't mean I'm out on Big Tech.

I have a long career ahead of me, and Apple isn't off my radar.

President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of his nation, on Tuesday brushed off questions about bin Salman's involvement in the 2018 killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

"Things happen," Trump said when asked about Khashoggi's killing by a reporter as he sat next to bin Salman in the Oval Office. 

Khashoggi, who was a critic of the regime, was also a U.S. resident.

Trump called the ABC News reporter "fake news" after she asked about Khashoggi, about claims by families of 9/11 victims that Saudi Arabia bankrolled the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and about the propriety of Trump's business investing in Saudi Arabia.

"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial," Trump said of Khashoggi.

"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen," Trump said.

Referring to bin Salman, Trump said, "But he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that."

"You don't have to embarrass our guests by asking a question," Trump said.

Bin Salman has denied ordering Khashoggi's killing.

But in February 2021, a month after then-President Joe Biden took office, the United States' director of national intelligence released a report that said bin Salman approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi.

On Tuesday, bin Salman said, "You know, I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America. But, you know, we have to focus on reality."

"Reality based in CIA documents, and based on a lot of documents that Osama bin Laden used Saudi people in that event, for one main purpose, is to destroy this [relationship], to destroy the American-Saudi relation," bin Salman said.

"It's really painful to hear .... anyone that been losing his life for you know, no real purpose or ... not in a legal way," bin Salman said, referring to Khashoggi.

"And it's been painful for us in Saudi Arabia," the prince said. "We did all the right steps of investigation ... in Saudi Arabia, and we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this still doesn't happen."

At the same time as the report implicating bin Salman in Khashoggi's death, then-Secretary of State Anthony Blinken imposed visa restrictions on 76 Saudis who were "believed to have been engaged in threatening dissidents overseas, including but not limited to the Khashoggi killing.

"President Trump looks forward to welcoming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to the White House, where the two leaders will participate in an official working visit," White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said in a statement.

"Thanks to our Dealmaker-in-Chief, the United States secured $600 billion in historic investments during the President's visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, and Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more," Kelly said.

The prince's visit is his first to the United States since Khashoggi was killed.

Millions of federal student loan borrowers who graduated in the spring will need to start repaying their debt for the first time soon.

That's because the six-month grace period that the Department of Education allows students after they finish school is winding down for May graduates.

"In other words, 'Happy Thanksgiving!'" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. "It's time to start making payments on your student loans."

Outstanding federal education debt in the U.S. exceeds $1.6 trillion, and more than 40 million people hold these loans. Between 4 million and 5 million federal student loan borrowers enter repayment each year, mainly during November and December, Kantrowitz said. The typical monthly student loan payment is around $350.

This year, borrowers begin repayment amid a challenging time for the lending system. More than 5 million people are in default on student loans, and President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" phases out several repayment plans that were intended to make payments more affordable.

Here's what you need to know about starting repayment on your student debt.

Student loan borrowers are more likely to miss their first bill than any other payment, Kantrowitz said, because their debt has been "out of sight, out of mind, for six months." Recent graduates are also often balancing other new expenses, including rent, a car, and new work clothes, Kantrowitz said.

As a result, he said, "I tell students to put a reminder in their calendar two weeks before payments are supposed to start."

You should get your first bill at least 21 days before your payment is due, according to the Education Department. To avoid being late, borrowers can enroll in automatic payments with their loan servicer.

If you don't know which company is managing your student loans on behalf of the government, you can find out at Studentaid.gov.

Before your first bill is due, you'll want to research your repayment options, experts said. As for the right plan, "there's no simple answer," said Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit.

"It can be very borrower-specific," Mayotte said.

As a result of a lawsuit brought by the American Federation of Teachers against the Trump administration, the Education Department has made available some of the student loan repayment plans it had partially paused.

Those options are: the Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan.

Both are income-driven repayment plans, which means they set your monthly bill based on income and family size, and lead to debt forgiveness after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. (However, recent legislation will phase out PAYE and ICR as of July 1, 2028.)

Starting July 1, 2026, student loan borrowers will have access to one more option, the "Repayment Assistance Plan," or RAP. The plan leads to student loan forgiveness after 30 years, compared with the typical 20-year or 25-year timeline on other plans, but will offer the lowest monthly bill for some borrowers.

Meanwhile, the Standard Repayment Plan is a good option for borrowers who are not seeking, or are not eligible for, loan forgiveness and/or can afford the monthly payments, experts say. Under that plan, payments are fixed and borrowers typically make payments for up to 10 years.

There are several tools available online to help you determine how much your monthly bill would be under different plans. Borrowers should also be able to change into a different repayment plan at any time.

The start of student loan repayments may cause financial hardship for many borrowers.

Struggling borrowers should first see if they qualify for a deferment, experts say. With a deferment, loans may not accrue interest, whereas they almost always do in a forbearance.

If you're not working, you can request an unemployment deferment with your servicer. If you're dealing with another financial challenge, meanwhile, you may be eligible for an economic hardship deferment. Those who qualify for a hardship deferment include people receiving certain types of federal or state aid and anyone volunteering in the Peace Corps, Kantrowitz said.

Other, lesser-known deferments include the graduate fellowship deferment, the military service and post-active-duty deferment and the cancer treatment deferment.

Microsoft made it easier for corporate workers to make AI agents that go off and do work. Now it's demonstrating a tool that IT specialists can use to see and manage those agents.

The software, named Agent 365, provides a list of artificial intelligence agents inside companies' systems, even if they're from other companies, Microsoft announced Tuesday. The company will present the product to business leaders and information technology practitioners at its Ignite conference in San Francisco this week.

"In the same way you provision an identity for a new employee or a contingent worker, you'll provision identity and access controls for your agents," Judson Althoff, CEO of Microsoft's commercial business, told CNBC in an interview.

With Agent 365, administrators will be able to approve new agents, see which ones are becoming popular and find out how many hours of employee time they're saving each week. They'll also be able to spot security risks and block agents. End users will be able to analyze agents' activities.

Following the ascent of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, software companies have built AI agents capable of developing software, generating ads and performing other simple tasks. Traditional corporations have started buying in.

Agents from Adobe, Cognition, Databricks, Glean, ServiceNow and Workday will automatically show up in Agent 365. The software will also display agents that customers have built with Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio. Other companies that sell AI agents can integrate with Agent 365, said Ray Smith, vice president of autonomous agents at Microsoft.

EY, one of the world's top accounting firms, had built an internal catalog of its AI agents, but has started implementing Agent 365 to gain more control, said Mark Luquire, a managing director for the company.

Companies selling cybersecurity software recognize the complexity that might result from agents proliferating. Okta, which sells software for managing access for employees, said in September that it will bring out tools for discovering agents and tracking their activity.

Customers enrolled in Microsoft's Frontier program for receiving early access to AI features can request to try Agent 365, Smith said. Microsoft has not finalized pricing.

WATCH: Microsoft sees 'huge' challenge and great opportunity as global economy enters a new phase, president says

Google's Gemini 3 is here — and you can start playing with it right away.

The search giant said its new AI model, which will be widely available on Tuesday, takes a "massive jump" in reasoning, is more creative than Gemini 2, and is better able to combine text, image, and video.

For Google, the weight of expectations hangs heavy on Gemini 3. After GPT-5's modest arrival earlier this year, the pressure has been on for Google to deliver something much better. It's also an opportunity for Google to reassert itself as an AI leader and cement a turnaround that's been three years in the making.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis described the latest updates to Gemini as going from "simply reading text and images to reading the room."

Here are the key things to know about Gemini 3.

Google said Gemini 3 is an improvement in both reasoning and multimodal abilities. Put those together, and you get something better at explaining and visualizing ideas. "It doesn't just process text or images separately," said Tulsee Doshi, product lead for Gemini, on a roundtable with reporters this week. "It actually understands the nuances across them to convert information into the medium that actually makes most sense for you."

Google says this is strengthened by the model's coding abilities, meaning it can create a presentation or an interactive graphic to explain a complex idea. Google DeepMind's CTO, Koray Kavukcuoglu, said he thinks this will be a big deal not just for coders, but for students and anyone trying to use AI as a learning tool.

Google's flexing its distribution advantage by rolling out Gemini 3 to search on launch day — with a catch. Out of the gate, any US users who pay for Google's Pro or Ultra Gemini tiers will see a new "Thinking" option in Google Search's AI Mode, which will use Gemini 3 if you choose it. Google says it will soon make Gemini 3 in search available to all.

The new model should perform better searches by breaking down your query into even more pieces, Google said. Robbie Stein, VP of Search, said that people have been asking Google more complex questions as it's rolled out new AI capabilities. Gemini 3 will also be capable of building more visualizations and interactive graphics right onto the AI Mode search page.

Google is going out of the gate with Gemini 3 "Pro" (whether a standard non-Pro Gemini 3 will follow at some point is unclear). It's pushing its smartest model out first this time, which it claims to be its "most factual" model to date.

AI companies often boast about how their models outperform others on various benchmarks. These aren't always super useful to the average person, and the real test for Google will be in how users receive and use its new model. However, one notable figure Google shared was that Gemini 3 scored 37.5% without tool use on Humanity's Last Exam, a test for AI models comprising 2,500 questions across a wide range of subjects. Doshi said this makes Gemini 3 better at solving maths and science problems "with a very high degree of reliability."

So far, it's been fairly primitive, but Google is now launching the next step — simply called "Gemini Agent — which it says will be able to carry out multi-step tasks from within Gemini. Google is still calling this "experimental," but said it will be much more useful and able to interact with various Google apps, such as managing your Google Calendar or rearranging your Gmail inbox.

One of Google's big visions is to create a universal AI assistant, and these agentic features are part of that plan. The more it knows about you, the more it can do by itself. Google says you'll be able to do things like ask the agent to research an upcoming holiday based on information in your emails to find a suitable rental car for your trip, with little human input.

Josh Woodward, Gemini's app lead, said the new model has some "latent capabilities," which are more hidden functions that are starting to emerge. One of those is creating generative interfaces using something called "dynamic view,' where you might ask Gemini for information about a famous historical figure, and it can generate a fully interactive website with clickable widgets and tabs.

This is because Gemini 3 is much better at coding, Google said. The company is tapping those advantages with a new platform it's launching called Antigravity, which takes vibe coding to another level by having an autonomous agent perform most of the work for you.

Google gave a demo of an agent building an interactive flight-tracking app with just a prompt. The agent can also create progress reports along the way and a final walkthrough report.

"I think for everyone in software engineering we realized that LLMs, large language models, have really fundamentally changed how people code and how we build software, how we bring ideas to life," said Kavukcuoglu.

Parts of the internet went down again on Tuesday.

A network issue at web security business Cloudflare disrupted internet services and took down sites such as ChatGPT and X for many users for around three hours on Tuesday morning.

A Cloudflare spokesperson told Business Insider that the company first saw "unusual traffic" to one of its services at 6:20 a.m. ET, with a status update on its website around 30 minutes later saying it was experiencing "internal service degradation."

The outage continued until around 9:30 a.m. ET, Cloudflare said in a later statement.

After initially saying it did not know what had led to the "spike in unusual traffic," Cloudflare said that the cause of the outage was "a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic."

"The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare's services," it added.

"I won't mince words: earlier today we failed our customers and the broader internet," Dane Knecht, Cloudflare's CTO, said in an X post.

Cloudflare said after the end of the outage that there was "no evidence that this was the result of an attack or caused by malicious activity." The company added that it would soon share a detailed explanation of what went wrong on its blog.

"Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable," the company's statement said. "We will learn from today's incident and improve."

Business Insider found that during the outage, some affected sites were sporadically back online, only to stop working shortly afterward.

As of 11:45 a.m. ET, Business Insider was able to access X, ChatGPT, and other online services previously affected by the outage, such as Spotify, as well as Downdetector, a site that tracks website outages — which was also down for periods on Tuesday morning.

Cloudflare provides technology to help protect websites against hackers and fake traffic, and to make web pages faster. It is used by millions of websites globally, which means when it goes down, it affects a big portion of the internet.

The outage came around the same time as scheduled maintenance was taking place at data centers in several locations, including Atlanta and Los Angeles, according to Cloudflare's status page.

X, OpenAI, and Spotify could not immediately be reached for comment.

The disruption follows a major outage at Amazon Web Services last month, which impacted many online services, including Snapchat, Venmo, and Reddit.

A similar incident occurred in June, which affected major sites and cloud platforms, including Google Cloud, Cloudflare, and Amazon Twitch.

Internet outages are becoming a frequent issue for users, as the vast majority of websites rely on a handful of content delivery networks.

"We're seeing outages happen more frequently, and they're taking longer to fix," said Jacob Bourne, an analyst at EMARKETER.

"That's a symptom of strained infrastructure: increased AI load, streaming demand, and aging capacity all pushing systems past the edge."

EMARKETER is owned by Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company.

Microsoft on Tuesday announced new strategic partnerships with Nvidia and the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, the latest sign that the company is working to reduce its dependence on OpenAI.

As part of the agreement, Microsoft will invest up to $5 billion into Anthropic, while Nvidia will invest up to $10 billion into the startup.

The investments have pushed Anthropic's valuation to the range of $350 billion, up from its $183 billion valuation as of September, according to a source close to the deal who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. The terms of the company's next round are still being finalized, the person said.

Anthropic has committed to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute capacity from Microsoft and has contracted for additional compute capacity up to one gigawatt, according to a blog post. Anthropic has also committed to purchase up to one gigawatt of compute capacity with Nvidia's Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems.

"This is a dream come true for us," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a video on Tuesday. "You know, we've admired the work of Anthropic and Dario for a long time, and this is the first time we are going to deeply partner with that Anthropic to accelerate Claude."

Nvidia and Anthropic are collaborating to "support Anthropic's future growth" for the first time, the blog post said. The companies will work together on engineering and design to optimize Anthropic's models for performance and efficiency, and optimize Nvidia architectures for Anthropic's specific workloads.

Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into Anthropic's rival OpenAI, backing the company as early as 2019. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet in recent years following the launch of its ChatGPT chatbot. 

OpenAI completed a recapitalization last month, and Microsoft formally outlined its partnership with the startup. Microsoft holds an stake in OpenAI's for-profit business that is valued at $135 billion, or roughly 27% of the company on an as-converted diluted basis.

Anthropic was founded by former OpenAI research executives, including its CEO Dario Amodei, in 2021. The Amazon-backed company is best known for developing a family of large language models called Claude.

Amazon Web Services was named Anthropic's primary cloud provider in 2023 and its primary training partner in 2024. Amazon will continue to serve in both of those roles, Anthropic said Tuesday.

"As an industry, we really need to move beyond any type of zero sum narrative or winner take all hype," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in the video. "What's required now is the hard work of building broad, durable capabilities together so that this technology can deliver real, tangible local success for every country, every sector and every customer. The opportunity is simply too big to approach any other way."

Nvidia is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.

The House on Tuesday is expected to vote to order the Department of Justice to release all of its files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, two days after President Donald Trump abruptly dropped his opposition to the bipartisan bill.

The measure is set to come up during the chamber's first vote series of the day around 2 p.m. ET, NBC News reported.

"Almost everybody" will vote to pass it, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told NBC on Monday night.

That wasn't always the case. The push to release the Epstein files had faced opposition from GOP lawmakers, following the lead of Trump, whose White House had warned that backing the effort would be considered a "hostile act."

A discharge petition that would have forced a vote on the bill was jammed up during the government shutdown, as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., kept representatives out of session for nearly eight weeks. The prolonged absence delayed the swearing-in of Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, the final signature needed to move the petition forward.

The shutdown ended last Wednesday and Grijalva, after being sworn in, signed the discharge petition. But, with pressure mounting, Johnson said he would bring the Epstein bill to a vote earlier than expected.

The bill from Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is being brought to the floor under a procedure that will require a two-thirds majority to pass. If it succeeds, it will head to the Senate.

"Today, we stand in a moment that will decide whether our government still belongs to the American people, or to those who prey on them," said a survivor of Epstein's abuse who spoke alongside a group of others at a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning.

The survivors were joined by Massie, Khanna and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a longtime Trump loyalist who has recently become one of his critics. 

"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition," Greene said of Trump at the presser. 

"Today, you are going to see, probably a unanimous vote in the House to release the Epstein files. But the fight, the real fight, will happen after that," she said.

Johnson said later Tuesday morning that he would vote for the bill, which he acknowledged could get unanimous support. But he nevertheless accused Democrats of "forcing a political show vote on the Epstein files," and spoke at length about his issues with the discharge petition.

One of his critiques has been that Epstein's victims may not be adequately protected. Massie, asked earlier Tuesday about Johnson's stance, called it a "red herring."

"The survivors have always been in favor of this legislation," he said, noting that the bill instructs the DOJ to redact victims' names and identifying information.  

Trump, a former friend of Epstein's who had a falling out with him years earlier, said on the campaign trail that he would support releasing the government's files from its investigations into the wealthy and well-connected financier. Epstein died in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.

But Trump's DOJ said in a July 6 memo that it had conducted an "exhaustive review" of Epstein-related matters and determined "that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted."

That determination, and Trump's repeated insistence that the focus on Epstein was a Democratic "hoax," has spurred outrage across the political spectrum, including from some of Trump's own supporters.

The House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of documents from Epstein's estate, including emails appearing to show Epstein discussing Trump.

Trump on Sunday night abruptly reversed course, urging House Republicans to vote in favor of the Epstein files bill.

On Monday, Trump said he would sign the bill if Congress passes it.

Zoox on Tuesday began allowing select San Francisco users to hail its driverless vehicles, pitting the Amazon-owned robotaxi service against Alphabet's Waymo in the same market for the first time.

Riders can sign up to join the "Zoox Explorers" program to take free rides in the company's box-shaped vehicles in certain San Francisco neighborhoods, including SoMa and the Mission and Design districts, the company said.

Zoox will take users off the waitlist depending on their location and as it adds more robotaxis to its fleet. The company hopes to remove the waitlist entirely in 2026, Zoox spokesperson Marisa Wiggam said.

Founded in 2014 and acquired by Amazon for $1.3 billion in 2020, Zoox is building a robotaxi business that aims to compete with Waymo. But unlike others in the robotaxi space, Zoox's vehicle has no steering wheel, with the company opting to design its robotaxis from the ground up.

Zoox notched a major milestone in September when it opened up its robotaxi service to the public for the first time in Las Vegas. The company is offering free rides on and around the Las Vegas Strip while it waits to get regulatory approval for a paid service.

The company has been testing its autonomous vehicle technology in San Francisco since 2017 via retrofitted Toyota Highlander SUVs. The company began to deploy its toaster-shaped driverless shuttles on San Francisco streets last year, before allowing friends and family of Zoox employees to hail its robotaxis in parts of the city.

Zoox has deployed a fleet of 50 robotaxis between San Francisco and Las Vegas, the company told CNBC in September.

Waymo opened up its service to all San Francisco riders in June 2024. Since launching its service in Phoenix in 2020, Waymo has provided more than 10 million paid rides, the company said in May.  

Last week, the Google sister company announced that it would begin offering freeway rides in the San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix markets. Waymo also said it was expanding its service to include San Jose and the San Jose Mineta International Airport.

As Zoox builds out its service, the Amazon company has deployed its test fleet in Seattle, Austin, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.

Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare was hit by an outage on Tuesday, knocking several major websites offline for global users.

Many sites came back online within a few hours. In an update to its status page around 9:57 a.m. ET, Cloudflare said it had implemented a fix to resolve the outage, though it noted some users may still experience issues accessing its online dashboard.

"We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal," the company added.

E-commerce platform Shopify, job search engine Indeed, Anthropic's Claude chatbot, President Donald Trump's Truth Social and Elon Musk's social media platform X were among the sites impacted by the Cloudflare issues, according to Downdetector, which itself could not be accessed briefly for some users. Some of NJ Transit's digital services were brought down by the outage.

OpenAI's status page indicated ChatGPT and its Sora short-form video app had fully recovered after they experienced issues due to a "third-party service provider."

A Cloudflare spokesperson said the "root cause" of the outage was an automatically generated configuration file used to manage threat traffic that "grew beyond an expected size of entries," which triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for several of its services.

The company said it began to observe a "spike in unusual traffic" around 5:20 a.m. ET.

There's no evidence that the outage was a result of an attack or caused by malicious activity, the spokesperson added.

"Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable," the spokesperson said. "We apologize to our customers and the internet in general for letting you down today."

Cloudflare's software is used by many businesses worldwide, helping to manage and secure traffic for about 20% of the web. Among the services it provides are that it guards against distributed denial of service attacks, which are when malicious actors attempt to overload a website's system with so many traffic requests that it can't function.

Shares of Cloudflare slid more than 2%.

The issue comes less than a month after Amazon Web Services suffered a daylong disruption that took down numerous online services, followed by a global outage of Microsoft's Azure cloud and 365 services.

In July 2024, a faulty software upgrade by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike caused a widespread outage that temporarily halted flights, impacted financial services and pushed hospitals to delay procedures.

Tax software provider Intuit has agreed to pay OpenAI more than $100 million a year to use the artificial intelligence startup's large language models to bolster its financial products.

Intuit shares climbed 2% premarket following the news.

By using OpenAI's technology inside GenOS, its internal AI system, Intuit is aiming to upgrade its products with advanced AI agents. The models will work across Intuit's TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma and Mailchimp services.

The companies are also partnering to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot with Intuit's offerings.

TurboTax users can link their Intuit accounts to ChatGPT, and take tax or financial actions in a secure fashion. ChatGPT can then guide those customers through tasks tied to their TurboTax filings or financial profile without ever accessing the underlying documents. The experience will run inside ChatGPT.

As part of the partnership, users will be able to authorize Intuit to pull the right data and return tailored results, like estimating a tax refund, finding the right credit card, or generating QuickBooks insights off real-time business activity.

For OpenAI, the deal adds a major finance partner, a meaningful revenue stream, and momentum behind its strategy of turning ChatGPT into a broad platform that works across numerous industries. The company also needs to show it has significant growth avenues to justify its $500 billion valuation and more than $1.4 trillion in spending commitments.

OpenAI has struck similar deals with companies like PayPal, Shopify, and Walmart, which have begun integrating payments, shopping and transaction capabilities into ChatGPT.

Privacy is of particular importance when it involves financial data. A user's information will stay inside Intuit's ecosystem, even when accessed through ChatGPT.

Toyota Motor on Tuesday announced plans to invest $912 million in U.S. manufacturing plants in five Southern states as part of a previously announced plan for the company to invest up to $10 billion domestically by 2030.

The investments announced Tuesday are broadly meant to support increasing production of hybrid vehicles, which Toyota leads with a more than 51% market share through the third quarter of this year, according to Motor Intelligence data. Most of the investments are expected to be completed by 2027.

The largest investment announced Tuesday is $453 million in Toyota's Buffalo, West Virginia, plant to increase assembly of four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines.

Other investments include $204.4 million in a plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, for four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines and $125 million to expand Corolla production in Blue Springs, Mississippi, to include hybrid models.

The investments are expected to create 252 new jobs, according to Toyota, which is the second-largest seller of new vehicles in the U.S. behind General Motors.

"Customers are embracing Toyota's hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand," Kevin Voelkel, Toyota Motor North America senior vice president of manufacturing operations, said in a release. "Toyota's philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy."

Tuesday's news comes less than a week after the Japanese automaker confirmed plans that were announced last month by President Donald Trump to invest up to $10 billion more than previously expected over the next five years in the U.S.

It also comes days after Toyota scion and Chairman Akio Toyoda reportedly wore a "Make America Great Again" hat and T-shirt featuring Trump and Vice President JD Vance while hosting a racing event at the Fuji Speedway in Japan.

Automotive News on Sunday reported Toyoda, a racer and car enthusiast, hosted U.S. Ambassador George Glass at the event, which also included comments about tariffs.

"I'm not here to argue whether tariffs are good or bad. Every national leader wants to protect their own auto industry," Toyoda reportedly said. "We are exploring ways to make tariffs a winner for everyone. The people we want most to be winners are our customers."

Toyota and the entire automotive industry have been trying to navigate production plans amid regulatory changes impacting all-electric vehicles and Trump's litany of tariffs this year on new vehicles and auto parts.

Tax software provider Intuit has agreed to pay OpenAI more than $100 million in a multiyear deal to use the artificial intelligence startup's large language models to bolster its financial products.

Intuit shares climbed 3% on Tuesday.

By using OpenAI's technology inside GenOS, its internal AI system, Intuit is aiming to upgrade its products with advanced AI agents. The models will work across Intuit's TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma and Mailchimp services.

The companies are also partnering to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot with Intuit's offerings.

TurboTax users can link their Intuit accounts to ChatGPT, and take tax or financial actions in a secure fashion. ChatGPT can then guide those customers through tasks tied to their TurboTax filings or financial profile without ever accessing the underlying documents. The experience will run inside ChatGPT.

As part of the partnership, users will be able to authorize Intuit to pull the right data and return tailored results, like estimating a tax refund, finding the right credit card, or generating QuickBooks insights off real-time business activity.

For OpenAI, the deal adds a major finance partner, a meaningful revenue stream, and momentum behind its strategy of turning ChatGPT into a broad platform that works across numerous industries. The company also needs to show it has significant growth avenues to justify its $500 billion valuation and more than $1.4 trillion in spending commitments.

OpenAI has struck similar deals with companies like PayPal, Shopify, and Walmart, which have begun integrating payments, shopping and transaction capabilities into ChatGPT.

Privacy is of particular importance when it involves financial data. A user's information will stay inside Intuit's ecosystem, even when accessed through ChatGPT.

Correction: A prior version of this story had incorrect terms of the deal between the two companies.

When Panera Bread began shrinking its sandwiches and skimping on salads, it started shedding customers.

Now, to win them back, the chain plans to reinvest in the business and undo many of those same cost-cutting measures, it said Tuesday.

Once the No. 1 fast-casual brand in the U.S., Panera has dipped to No. 3, ceding the top spots to Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panda Express. Last year, its sales fell 5% to $6.1 billion, according to Technomic estimates. For years, the chain's traffic has been shrinking, according to CEO Paul Carbone, who took the reins earlier this year. Controversy after the chain's foray into energy drinks didn't help matters, either.

Panera's troubles have coincided with a tough year for fast-casual restaurants. Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Cava have all cut their full-year forecasts as they see younger consumers eating out less frequently.

Carbone has a plan to bring back customers. Under the strategy, named "Panera RISE," the company aims to refresh its menu, focus on value, improve its service and build new restaurants. He said the plan has the backing of the franchisees who operate roughly half of its 2,200 U.S. locations, along with the support of JAB Holding, the investment arm of the Reimann family that owns the company.

Panera's slide has been poorly timed for JAB. The firm has been plotting an IPO for the chain's parent company, Panera Brands, which also owns Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros. Bagels.

In 2021, four years after taking the chain private, JAB struck a deal with Danny Meyer's special purpose acquisition company for a merger that would take the company public again. But Panera scrapped those plans a year later, citing market conditions. In late 2023, the company confidentially filed for an initial public offering that still hasn't happened.

When asked about the status of Panera's IPO plans, Carbone told CNBC that the chain's management team is currently focused on growing traffic and implementing the Panera RISE strategy.

Phase one of Panera's plan is to improve the quality of its food, reversing cost-cutting measures imposed in the face of high inflation, according to Carbone.

"We squeezed food costs. We squeezed labor," he said.

Some of those changes happened while Carbone was chief financial officer. He now calls himself a "reformed CFO" — albeit one who still listens to earnings conference calls.

"It's really about death by a thousand paper cuts, it truly is," Carbone said about the chain's downturn.

Take Panera's salads, for example. In the summer of 2024, Panera began using a mix of half romaine, half iceberg lettuce to make its salads, saving the chain money compared with when it was using romaine alone. This summer, it reverted back to entirely romaine salads.

"You know what guests told us? No one likes iceberg, and no one gets that and says, 'Oh my God, that white salad, it looks so appetizing,'" Carbone said.

And then there's the cherry tomato. Carbone said Panera is one of the few restaurant chains that doesn't slice the bite-sized tomatoes in half, a decision made to save on labor costs.

"We make the guest chase the cherry tomato around the bowl," he said.

And when a salad comes with an avocado, customers have to cut the halved fruit themselves, rather than it coming presliced. The chain will start slicing the cherry tomatoes and avocados early next year.

Plus, Panera's salads typically have five ingredients, while those of competitors like Sweetgreen feature as many as eight.

But it wasn't just salads that were affected by the cost-cutting measures.

"In some instances, we shrunk portions, so guests would walk into our cafe to buy a sandwich that has gone up significantly in price, with lower-quality ingredients, in a smaller size," Carbone said.

The menu refresh will also include new items. Last month, the chain announced that it is testing new "fresca" and "energy refresher" drinks.

Panera previously offered highly caffeinated energy drinks, but it discontinued the line, which included Charged Lemonade, following two wrongful death lawsuits and related negative publicity. Panera denied wrongdoing and settled the lawsuits earlier this year.

When it comes to value, Panera is planning on leaning into a barbell menu strategy, offering customers options on both the low- and high-price end. The approach has worked particularly well for casual-dining chains like Chili's, but Panera doesn't have the same appetizer offerings as a full-service restaurant.

"We haven't cracked the code yet," Carbone said. "We're doing a lot of testing."

Chains across the restaurant industry have embraced value offerings, from McDonald's Extra Value Meal to Applebee's "2 for $25" deal, igniting the so-called value wars. However, restaurants have to balance the desire to attract cash-strapped diners with maintaining their profit margins.

To improve the customer experience, Panera is planning to invest more into labor. Like many restaurants, Panera in recent years scheduled fewer workers and relied more on the self-order kiosks it pioneered in the industry. That approach saved money, but customers often walked into a cafe and couldn't find an employee in sight, according to Carbone.

Panera will also invest back into its kiosks, which it hasn't significantly upgraded since they first entered its restaurants roughly a decade ago. And its dining rooms will get a facelift, too.

If these changes succeed in bringing back lapsed customers, then Panera's restaurants will become more profitable, fueling future restaurant growth. And those new bakery-cafes could look different.

"What does the cafe of the future look like? We're doing a lot of work around that, we're going to test different things," Carbone said.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Two U.S. Senators are pressing the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department to investigate a crypto company closely tied to the family of U.S. President Donald Trump over alleged links to illicit actors in North Korea and Russia.

In a letter on Tuesday, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., minority members on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, raised concerns that World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm heavily owned and run by the Trump family, may pose national security risks. 

The letter — obtained exclusively by CNBC and addressed to Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent — argued that World Liberty Financial lacks adequate safeguards to prevent bad actors from moving funds or gaining influence over its governance.

The senators cited a September report from a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporate watchdog called Accountable.US, which said World Liberty Financial had sold its $WLFI tokens to "various highly suspicious entities." 

Those entities included traders with ties on the blockchain to a notorious North Korean hacking organization, a sanctioned Russian "ruble-backed sanctions evasion tool," an Iranian crypto exchange and Tornado Cash, a known money-laundering platform, the watchdog alleged.

World Liberty Financial denied any wrongdoing, saying "there is no conflict of interest between World Liberty Financial, a private crypto company with zero political power, and the U.S. government."

"World Liberty Financial conducted rigorous AML/KYC checks on every pre-sale purchaser of the $WLFI governance token — the highest standard in the industry — and turned down millions of dollars from potential purchasers who failed the tests," a World Liberty Financial spokesperson told CNBC.

Generally, AML refers to anti-money laundering regulations and policies, while KYC — or know your customer — refers to procedures used to verify that clients are who they claim to be.

The World Liberty Financial website lists family members Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Barron Trump as co-founders. The website shows Donald Trump as a "Co-Founder Emeritus." An entity affiliated with the U.S. President and some of his family members also holds major equity interests in WLF.

A number of the company's "governance token" $WLFI were released for public trading in September, after earlier private investment rounds. WLF says holders of the tokens "play a key role in helping to shape the future of the protocol," with the ability to propose and vote on company proposals. 

However, Accountable.US' investigation called into question who those holders were. The group's report noted that World Liberty Financial had sold $10,000 worth of its $WLFI tokens in January to traders who had a history of transacting with a wallet that is now sanctioned for association with the North Korean state-sponsored hacking team, Lazarus Group. 

By selling the tokens, World Liberty Financial took money from people with "open and obvious connections to enemies of the U.S." and raised national security risks by giving them "a seat at the table" to influence the firm's governance, the senators alleged in their letter.

World Liberty Financial plans to continue expanding and launching new products, including a debit card and tokenized commodity assets. 

The letter from the senators noted these expansions but warned that the reported token sales to bad actors "indicate an absence of robust sanctions and anti-money laundering controls," and that "WLF risks supercharging illicit finance activity." 

It added that "the Trump family's close ties to the company also create a financial conflict of interest for Trump Administration officials that report to the President: prioritizing token sales will directly enrich the Trump family — while compliance activities may interfere with this wealth creation."

DT Marks DEFI LLC, "an entity affiliated with Donald J. Trump and certain of his family members," holds 22.5 billion $WLFI tokens valued at over $3 billion and is entitled to 75% of the proceeds from $WLFI token sales, the letter noted.

"That means every time a governance token is sold, three-quarters of that money goes directly to President Trump and his family, even for sales to entities linked to North Korea and Russia," the two senators said.

Accountable.US, in a separate report in August, estimated that roughly $11.6 billion, or 73%, of Trump's net worth is tied to his cryptocurrency ventures, which included the launch of a $TRUMP memecoin. According to Reuters, an annual financial disclosure released by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics for the 2024 calendar year showed that Trump's move into crypto added significantly to his wealth.

The Democratic senators added that the timing of their requests was essential as Congress considers new crypto regulation that could shield governance tokens like $WLFI from existing U.S. oversight and exempt issuers of such tokens from certain recordkeeping and disclosure requirements. 

"As Congress considers legislation on the market structure for digital assets, we must ensure that crypto interests do not profit at the expense of U.S. national security and that illicit actors are not handed the keys to financial platforms that they can later exploit," it added. 

Trump, once a critic of crypto during his first term, has since embraced the industry, with his administration pushing several crypto-friendly bills, including the recently passed GENIUS Act.

Warren and Reed's letter asked the Treasury and the Justice Department to outline information related to potential enforcement actions against World Liberty Financial by Dec. 1.

The Treasury and Department of Justice did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Warren, a ranking member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, is a frequent critic of Trump's embrace of the crypto industry and the crypto industry more broadly. She has previously pressed World Liberty Financial on its business dealings, including on a recent deal regarding the firm's stablecoin. 

The company's stablecoin USD1, which is backed by dollars and short-term U.S. government treasuries, was used by the U.A.E.-backed investment fund MGX for a $2 billion investment into Binance, helping lift USD1's traction and transaction volume. 

The New York Times reported in September that the UAE had secured a massive chip deal from Washington shortly after the MGX deal closed.

Meanwhile, on Oct. 23, Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering while heading the cryptocurrency exchange. Trump would go on to say a few days later in a CBS "60 Minutes" interview that he knew nothing about Zhao despite granting him the pardon.

A report from the Wall Street Journal suggested that Binance not only facilitated the settlement of MGX's investment using USD1, but also assisted in building the technology behind the stablecoin, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

Binance CEO Richard Teng has denied that the company had any role in MGX's decision to complete its investment in USD1. 

Donald Trump Jr. and World Liberty Financial's CEO Zach Witkoff, son of U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, told CNBC in October that concerns about conflicts of interest with the Trump administration were "complete nonsense."

"Don and my World Liberty mission is big, but our dads' mission is much bigger. They're not focused on stablecoins, nor are they involved in a stablecoin business," Witkoff said.

In this article

Home Depot on Tuesday cut its full-year profit forecast and missed Wall Street's earnings expectations for the third straight quarter as it saw weaker home improvement demand, tepid consumer spending and lower-than-usual storm activity.

The retailer said it now expects full-year sales will climb about 3% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to be slightly positive. That compares with its previous expectations for full-year sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales to increase by 1%.

The revised outlook includes an estimated $2 billion in incremental revenue from GMS, a building products distributor that Home Depot acquired earlier this year. The company's sales were not part of its previous full-year guidance.

Home Depot expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to decline by about 5% from the year-ago period, compared with its prior expectations that they would fall by about 2%

In a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said the retailer previously expected home improvement activity would increase. It also anticipated higher sales of roofing materials, generators and other supplies that typically sell before and after seasonal storms.

Neither dynamic materialized, he said, putting pressure on the business. 

"When we set guidance, we had anticipated that demand would begin to accelerate gradually in the back half of the year as interest rates and mortgage rates eased," he said. "But what we saw was that ongoing consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand."

Here's what Home Depot reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Home Depot's stock was down about 3% in early trading on Tuesday. As of Monday's close, the company's shares are down about 8% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's 13% gains during the same period.

For Home Depot, housing turnover typically sparks larger and more lucrative projects as customers fix up their homes before or after moving. Those big projects, however, have dropped in frequency as higher interest rates have led to steeper mortgage rates and borrowing costs for loans, which a homeowner may use to pay for a kitchen remodel or major addition.

Since roughly the middle of 2023, McPhail has told CNBC that homeowners have been in a "deferral mindset." That's led to a bit of a waiting game for Home Depot, as it holds out for either lower mortgage rates or a shift by consumers who get used to higher mortgage rates as the new normal.

In the most recent three-month period, that waiting game continued. McPhail told CNBC that demand was "stable" from the fiscal second quarter to the third quarter when adjusting for the lack of hurricanes. 

But, he added, "at this point, it's hard to identify near-term catalysts that would lead to acceleration." 

Home Depot's net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 dropped to $3.60 billion, or $3.62 per share, from $3.65 billion, or $3.67 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue decreased from $40.22 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Adjusting for one-time items, including the value of intangible assets, Home Depot reported earnings of $3.74 per share.

Comparable sales rose 0.2% in the quarter, falling short of analysts' expectations of 1.4% growth, according to StreetAccount.

Sales trends compared to the prior year slowed as the quarter progressed. Comparable sales were up 2% in August, up 0.5% in September and down 1.5% year-over-year in October, Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising said on the company's earnings call.

CEO Ted Decker said on an earnings call that the primary driver of that deceleration was the lack of storm activity — particularly when lapping a year-ago period with a lot of hurricanes. He said that pressure will continue into the fourth quarter.

Compared with other big-box retailers, Home Depot's customers tend to be more financially stable. About 90% of its do-it-yourself customers own their homes and the home professionals who shop at the retailer tend to get hired by homeowners.

Even so, McPhail told CNBC Home Depot gave a weaker outlook in part because shoppers across income groups are reluctant to take on high-dollar projects. He said a slower housing market and the higher cost of borrowing has contributed to the trend.

He said other factors may also be having a chilling effect, including the prolonged government shutdown, an uptick in corporate layoff announcements and a decline in home values in some markets.

However, Bastek said on the company's earnings call that Home Depot has not seen customers trading down to cheaper products. Instead, he said, they are often opting for more innovative and premium appliances, power tools or other items, which tend to cost more.

Big-ticket transactions, which the company defines as costing $1,000 or more, rose 2.3% year over year. Still, Bastek added the company continues to see "softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund renovation projects."

Average ticket, the typical amount spent by customers at the store or on the company's website, rose 1.8% year over year in the quarter. However, customer transactions fell 1.6% year over year.

A bright spot in the quarter was online sales, which rose by 11% year over year, McPhail said.

As do-it-yourself customers postpone bigger projects, the company has tried to attract more business from contractors, roofers and other professionals.

The company has made two key purchases of pro-related companies. Last year, it bought Texas-based SRS Distribution for $18.25 billion — the largest acquisition in its history. The company sells supplies to professionals in the landscaping, pool and roofing businesses. Home Depot acquired GMS earlier this year.

Like other retailers, Home Depot has felt the pinch of higher costs on some imported items because of tariffs. McPhail said in May that the company was diversifying the countries where it sourced its goods and intended to "generally maintain our current pricing levels across our portfolio."

However, company leaders warned in August that it may have to hike prices in some categories because of higher tariffs.

McPhail told CNBC that Home Depot has increased some items' prices, but said "where there were price actions, they were modest." 

He said Home Depot has kept prices the same for some key items or even been able to reduce them. For example, he said, its bestselling 7½-foot Grand Duchess Christmas tree and many of its strings of lights for trees have dropped in price.

Global equities tumbled Tuesday as concerns of inflated valuations and an uncertain macro environment grips investors ahead of Nvidia earnings this week.  

The pan-European Stoxx 600 traded in negative territory on Tuesday with mining-linked stocks and banks leading Europe's losses. The Stoxx Europe 600 Technology Index shed 1.5%, following in the footsteps of U.S. stocks as fears of an artificial intelligence-fueled bubble persist.  

The three major U.S. indexes, Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, ended the previous trading session in the red. On Tuesday, U.S. equities continued to slide, with Wall Street's major averages all falling into negative territory after the opening bell. Tech stocks posted notable declines, with Nvidia, Palantir, Amazon and Microsoft among the stocks moving lower.

Asia-Pacific markets were also lower on Tuesday, led by declines in Japan and South Korean benchmark indexes.

Mike Gallagher, director of research at Continuum Economics, said the market action implies equities could fall about 5% from recent highs — or "a bit more."

He told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" that the sell-off is "natural profit taking" following a strong market run since April.  

It all comes on the backdrop of AI bubble fears and the market holding tight for Nvidia's third-quarter earnings, which are due after Wednesday's close. Nvidia is seen an important bellwether for the AI industry as many of the largest players rely on its GPUs.  

The recent earnings seasons shows that the big hyperscalers are still getting lots of revenue coming through 2026-27, Gallagher said, adding that investors are watching Meta closely because without a server business it serves as an indicator of whether the next wave of AI applications can deliver revenue. "That suggests this is just a routine, healthy correction," he said.

Tema ETF Chief Investment Officer Yuri Khodjamirian put the sell-off down to a "healthy dose of skepticism" as the market realized that the mega-deals announced over summer need to actually be funded somehow. He pointed to OpenAI's "massive announcements of commitments to spending on GPUs, power data centers," and said "the market is starting to realize that this is going to maybe be a slower process than they thought in the summer."  

"There is this kind of balancing going on in the market, and this is what you're seeing in some of these shares. Oracle's share price is back to where it was pre-the OpenAI announcement, so we think it's reasonably healthy. The dynamics continue, these data center build outs, whether you listen to Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, etc, they're all going in the direction of upwards. Nothing's really stopping, so what we're seeing is just a healthy correction, in a way, in the marketplace," Khodjamirian told CNBC's Silvia Amaro.

Some major tech companies such as Alphabet and Meta have turned to debt issuances to fund their sprawling AI ambitions. Amazon, for example, undertook its first bond sale in three years according to a Bloomberg report.

"We're seeing more evidence of vendor financing, of tapping the credit markets, but I think we're still in the relatively early stages," David Groman, global equity strategist at Citi, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

The bond market must adjust and react, "spreads need to get a bit wider, dramatically wider," added Gallagher. "We're not seeing a big blowout phase in corporate bond spreads," he added.

Citi has a "bear market checklist" for whether the conditions needed for a long, sustained sell off in global equities are in place, Groman said. It looks at 18 factors including valuation, sentiment and positioning over a three-year rolling basis.

"What it says to us is that maybe eight out of 18 things are flashing red. In some ways, it looks like the past, in 2000 on a valuation basis, but on many other factors, things like fund flows into equities, M&A activity, IPO activity, the real signs of froth are not necessarily there," he added, stating that it's still "time to buy the dip" as equity inflows are "still pretty subdued on a longer run horizon."

However, Gallagher noted that there is an element of de-risking amid an uncertain macro environment. Investors are uncertain about a previously-expected Fed rate cut in December, he said, adding that the central bank will "probably" now pause in the first quarter of 2026.

"Then, all of a sudden, that kind of driver that's helped risk is no longer there. We've also got the Supreme Court in the U.S. due to judge on Trump's reciprocal tariffs. It's actually a 50-50 call, whether half of them or all of them are stopped, and that then gets us back into April's cycle drama about new types of tariffs," Gallagher said.  

"So there's some things coming over the horizon that make you want to take a bit of risk off the table. So, part of it is just natural pocket taking, part of it is thinking, 'well, is the macro story going to be perfect? No, it's not,'" he added. 

"To get a major sell off, you may need major bad news, and that we haven't actually got to that point yet," Gallagher said. 

There is some exaggeration in cryptocurrencies due to leverage, he added. Bitcoin has shed around 25% since its October high, and Ether has dropped 35% since its August high. Industry experts told CNBC that the sector is facing pressures from both an initial macro-driven sell-off and forced liquidations.   

Khodjamirian is taking a multi-year view. The CIO said one looming problem is access to electricity. "There's a realization from executives around, in the United States and in the world, that you need to provide power to these data centers. That is going to be a big, big problem, and that potentially slows down the build out as more power needs to be built," he said. 

"We think it's the biggest problem and the biggest bottleneck for building out the AI revolution, but also other things like the rebuilding of the industrial base, both in Europe and in the United States, electric vehicles, digital currencies," he added.

Societe Generale has taken a major step in merging
traditional finance with blockchain technology by issuing its first digital
bond in the United States. 

The short-term, floating-rate debt securities were
sold to trading firm DRW and issued on the Canton Network blockchain using
Broadridge's tokenization technology. This move marks one of the earliest
digital securities offerings aimed at U.S. institutional investors.

The bonds were reportedly issued as security tokens

Oops, something went wrong

Vitalik Buterin wants Ethereum to stop changing.

Speaking at the Devconnect conference in Buenos Aires, Buterin openly declared that the blockchain's base layer should ossify — locking down core features to prevent changes that could introduce bugs into the ecosystem.

“More and more ossification over time is good for Ethereum,” Buterin told the packed auditorium. “We have a much lower rate of surprises now.”

Hanging on his every word, the crowd of over 500 listeners murmured at the idea.

That's because Buterin's words are a sharp turn for a protocol built on flexibility and experimentation.

Indeed, for years, Ethereum's ability to change was its main selling point — developers could build anything, and the protocol itself would evolve to support new use cases.

Now, Buterin reckons that stability matters more than adaptability. A locked-down base layer might be less exciting, but it's also less likely to break.

And for a network securing hundreds of billions in value, perhaps boring is a feature, not a bug.

Buterin argued that Ethereum can ossify different layers at different speeds.

The consensus layer could lock down changes while the Ethereum Virtual Machine remains openly flexible. Or vice-versa.

“It's good to maintain some flexibility,” he said.

The goal isn't to stifle or kill innovation but to redirect it away from the base layer and into the surrounding ecosystem. That means layer 2 rollups, wallets, privacy tools, and user-facing applications — not fundamental protocol changes.

Layer 2s already handle most of Ethereum's transaction volume. The more activity that moves there, the more space opens up on layer 1 for settlement and security.

“It's healthy to move attention out of L1 and into the surrounding ecosystem,” Buterin said.

But Buterin admitted the shift comes with tradeoffs.

Ethereum's early days had a “spirit of exploration” that has largely disappeared as the ecosystem took unsavoury turns with the surge of memecoins, and simultaneously maturing with the arrival of institutional players.

“There is too much of the space that has gone in the direction of ‘if you want to succeed, be a fast follower and copy what's already working,'” he said.

“It harms the imagination of the space.”

Towards the end, Buterin issued a stark warning.

Elliptic curve cryptography, the foundation of Ethereum — and Bitcoin's — security, won't last forever.

“Elliptic curves are going to die,” he said, pointing to a prediction that the ability of quantum computing to break Ethereum's underlying security model could come before the next US presidential election in 2028.

That gives Ethereum roughly four years to migrate to quantum-resistant cryptography — a timeline that assumes quantum computers advance on schedule.

It's the kind of existential technical challenge that will require coordination across the entire ecosystem. But if Buterin's vision holds, those changes will happen at the edges — not in Ethereum's increasingly unchangeable core.

AI-powered simulation game Dino Tycoon (TYCOON) just posted a massive 123% overnight gain, leading the entire Play-to-Earn (P2E) sector even as the broader crypto market stumbles. 

But the next project gearing up to take the spotlight is a new crypto mining game that blends P2E mechanics with a fresh mine-to-earn model: PepeNode (PEPENODE).

PepeNode introduces a gamified version of crypto mining, which lets players earn its native PEPENODE token as well as top meme coins like Pepe (PEPE), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and potentially more as the ecosystem expands.

The project has already raised $2.1M in its presale and continues to gather momentum. The current presale round is nearing sellout as investors rush to secure tokens at one of the lowest entry points.

For the next 48 hours, PEPENODE remains priced at $0.0011546 per token; after this period, the next round begins at a higher price.

Dino Tycoon recently held its TGE on November 4 and has already demonstrated impressive momentum, climbing 23% since its launch. But its real breakout came overnight when the BNB Smart Chain–based Web3 game exploded with a 123% gain, making it the top-performing P2E project of the day.

The game features classic tycoon-style gameplay, where players manage assets, resources, and visitor flow – all wrapped in a blockchain layer that lets them earn TYCOON tokens. The project even claims to use AI-driven analytics to refine gameplay and shape an evolving in-game economy.

What makes TYCOON's surge even more surprising is the market backdrop. Crypto is bleeding. 

Bitcoin recently slipped below $90,000 (a level not seen since February) before bouncing to $91,000 as of writing. Sentiment is in extreme fear, with major assets flashing red: Ethereum (ETH) down 4.3%, Solana (SOL) down 2.9%, and similar losses across the board.

So why is a P2E game surging while the rest of the market craters? It is possible that investors are shifting their focus toward projects with higher breakout potential, rather than relying on sluggish top-cap assets. Or perhaps this mirrors 2021, when P2E games helped prop up the industry even as crypto prices fluctuated from time to time.

If that pattern is repeating, then another blockchain game is poised to take the spotlight, and PepeNode is the one many have their eyes on. Still in presale and already raising millions, it carries the hallmarks of a project capable of drawing users back into crypto one player at a time.

PepeNode could attract a new inflow of crypto users because it reimagines mining, which is something familiar to the community yet increasingly inaccessible to everyday investors. This is because competing with today's industrial-scale miners requires massive capital, specialized rigs, and soaring electricity costs. 

PepeNode tosses out this retail-unfriendly approach and replaces it with gamified mechanics that make mining engaging and accessible to all. Every player starts in an empty virtual server room, and from there, they have full control over how their mining operation evolves.



Using PEPENODE tokens, which are currently available only in presale, players can begin building out their mining rigs by purchasing nodes. Each node is unique, which introduces an element of strategy and randomness. Combine the right nodes, and you suddenly have a meme-coin-generating machine.

Players can also expand and upgrade their virtual server room, and every improvement has a direct impact on the performance of their rig, boosting hashrate and, in turn, daily yields.

And for the competitive crowd, the real fun begins on the leaderboards. Climbing the ranks opens the door to earning some of the biggest meme coins in the market, including PEPE and FARTCOIN, which have surged 8,669% and 1,161% from their all-time lows, respectively.

PepeNode isn't repeating the same mistakes that Axie Infinity, StepN, and so many early P2E projects made. Those games collapsed because they ignored the most important element of any Play-to-Earn ecosystem: sound, sustainable tokenomics.

Most P2E tokens lost value over time because players primarily used them for one purpose – cashing out to fiat. Even when games introduced in-game sinks or dual-token systems, the incentives weren't strong enough to keep value circulating within the ecosystem. The “utility token” was constantly sold off, while the “reward token” was hoarded, creating a death spiral.

PepeNode addresses this by making the PEPENODE token the core of the entire game economy. Every upgrade, every node purchase, and every expansion requires PEPENODE, giving players a genuine reason to keep using it instead of dumping it.

And here's the real game-changer (literally) – 70% of all PEPENODE used for upgrades is permanently burned. That means the more players engage, the scarcer the token becomes and the more valuable the remaining supply grows. 

Anyone who wants to ramp up their mining potential and chase top meme-coin rewards will eventually have to buy PEPENODE at a higher price. 

This is what keeps PepeNode's tokenomics healthy. Players are incentivized to spend PEPENODE, not sell it, especially when spending it leads to earning top meme coins like PEPE and FARTCOIN, rather than fiat.

It's no wonder crypto influencer CryptoTV says PEPENODE could be a 100x play once the presale ends.



Now's your chance to get in early as blockchain games start heating up again and secure tokens from a project that's actively avoiding the mistakes of the last P2E cycle. Grab your PEPENODE tokens while the presale is still live.

Head to the PepeNode website to buy PEPENODE using ETH, BNB, USDT (ERC-20 or BEP-20), or even credit/debit cards.

For the best experience, PepeNode recommends connecting through Best Wallet, one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets in the industry. PepeNode is already listed inside Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens feature, making it easy to buy, track, and claim once the game goes live.

PepeNode also offers its own staking protocol, letting holders earn yield even before launch, with a dynamic APY currently at 596%.

The project's smart contract has been audited by Coinsult and SpyWolf, giving early adopters added security and peace of mind.

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market is falling again on Tuesday, following a sell-off that swept Asia and Europe, as Nvidia, bitcoin and other Wall Street stars keep swinging on worries that their prices shot too high.

The S&P 500 dropped 0.7% and pulled further from its all-time high set late last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 458 points, or 1%, as of 12:01 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1% lower.

Other WRAL Top Stories

Technology stocks were the biggest weights on the market. Microsoft fell 3.2% and it was the heaviest force driving the market lower. Amazon.com fell 3.3%.

Nvidia was again one of the heaviest weights on the market, and its drop of 1.9% brought its loss for the month so far to 9.6%. The stock is hovering close to a 10% drop, which is a steep enough fall that Wall Street has a name for it: a correction.

What Nvidia does matters disproportionately to savers' 401(k) accounts because it's the most influential stock on Wall Street due to its immense size. It single-handedly steers the direction of the S&P 500 some days, after fervent demand for its artificial-intelligence chips helped it briefly top $5 trillion in total value. 

The U.S. stock market's recent struggles are a sharp turnaround from a nearly relentless rally since April, when Wall Street last sold off after President Donald Trump shocked the world with stiff tariffs. That rally, though, was so strong that critics said it may have carried prices too high, too fast and left the market at risk of a sharp drop. They pointed in particular to stocks swept up in the AI mania, which have been surging at spectacular speeds for years.

Nvidia's price more than doubled in four of the last five years, for example, while Palantir Technologies' stock more than doubled in the first six and a half months of this year. 

Many big investors still seem to be expecting stock prices to rise further, according to the latest monthly survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Global Research. But when asked what the No. 1 risk for the market is, one with a lower probability of happening but a chance of very big damage, 45% pointed to an AI bubble. That beat out potential trouble in the bond market, inflation and trade wars.

A record percentage of investors is also saying companies are “overinvesting,” according to the survey. The worry is that all the dollars pouring into AI chips and data centers worldwide may not produce the kind of revolution that AI proponents have been predicting, or at least not as profitable a one. 

Other high-flying areas of the market with their own evangelists have also been struggling lately. Bitcoin's price briefly fell below $90,000 in the morning, down from nearly $125,000 last month. It later recovered some of its losses and moved above $93,000. 

Home Depot also helped drag the market lower after falling 4%. It reported a weaker profit for the summer than analysts expected and cited a variety of reasons. Chief among them was a lack of storms, which would have driven customers to buy more home-improvement supplies. But CEO Ted Decker also pointed to “consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing” for preventing an expected increase in demand. 

Reporting stronger profits is one of the ways a company can make its stock price look less expensive, because stock prices tend to track with earnings over the long term. That's raising the stakes for Wednesday's profit report from Nvidia, which could either help halt its stock's slide or worsen it. 

Elsewhere on Wall Street, Cloudflare fell 2.4% after an earlier issue at the internet infrastructure provider had caused global outages for ChatGPT and other services. 

In the bond market, Treasury yields eased. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.12% from 4.13% late Monday. 

The U.S. government reported that the number of workers applying for unemployment benefits in the week through Oct. 18 was roughly where it was a month earlier. It did not fill in data for the prior three weeks, though. The government is just beginning again to report data about the job market and other signals  about the economy following its six-week shutdown. 

The dearth of data has helped raised doubts about whether the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December, something that traders had earlier seen as very likely. What the Fed does is extremely important to the market because stock prices ran to records in part because of expectations for continued cuts to rates. 

The Fed has cut rates twice already this year in hopes of shoring up a slowing job market. But lower interest rates can make inflation worse, and inflation has stubbornly remained  above the Fed's 2% target. 

In stock markets abroad, indexes tumbled across Europe and Asia. 

Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 3.2% after feeling extra pressure from a jump in Japanese government bond yields, reflecting rising risks as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to boost government spending and push back the timetable for bringing down Japan's huge national debt. 

South Korea's Kospi sank 3.3%, and France's CAC 40 fell 1.9% for two of the larger drops worldwide.

Bitcoin's steep sell-off might have finally run its course, according to Geoffrey Kendrick, the head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered, who argues the pullback follows a familiar pattern and is likely nearing exhaustion.

Bitcoin BTC$93,561.27 plunged below $90,000 on Tuesday, extending a drawdown that's erased nearly 30% from the currency's all-time high above $126,000 set in early October. The latest leg lower marks the deepest pullback since last year's introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., and has stirred debate about whether the largest cryptocurrency is entering the bear market phase of its typical four-year cycle.

"I see the recent sell-off as being nothing more than (a fast/painful version of) the third one of the past couple of years, of nearly exactly the same magnitude," Kendrick wrote in a Tuesday note to clients.

As part of his thesis, Kendrick highlighted key sentiment and valuation metrics that have now reset to levels historically associated with market bottoms. One of those is bitcoin treasury firm Strategy's (MSTR) modified net asset value (mNAV) — a gauge of the firm's bitcoin holdings relative to its share price — which has dropped to parity at 1.0.

"A number of other metrics have collapsed to absolute zero levels," he said, suggesting seller exhaustion and capitulation. "This is enough to signify the sell-off is over."

"A rally into year-end is my base case,” he concluded.

His outlook echoed recent commentary from analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex. They noted that the pace of short-term holder realized losses begun to slow with onchain capitulation signals emerging, typical markers of a market bottom forming.

BTC bounced to just shy of $93,000 on Tuesday, up 3.8% from the overnight lows.

Ethereum has extended its decline toward a critical higher-timeframe demand zone around $3K. While the broader trend remains pressured, the current location aligns with major liquidity pools and potential areas of interest for large players.

A decisive reaction here will determine whether ETH enters a relief phase or continues to deepen toward macro demand levels.

By Shayan

Ethereum continues to drift lower within a broad descending structure, steadily approaching the $3K–$3.05K demand block that previously acted as the springboard for the July–August rally. This area also aligns closely with the lower boundary of the falling wedge, a pattern typically associated with late-correction phases rather than trend initiation.

The failure to reclaim the 100-day moving average near $3.8K triggered a sustained selloff, with the 200-day MA now positioned above price for the first time since early summer. This shift reflects weakening medium-term momentum, but the clustering of confluence factors around the $3K zone suggests that sellers may soon face diminishing dominance.

The current daily candle bodies remain compressed, with extended wicks to the downside, indicating absorption near the demand threshold. Should Ethereum stabilise and form a higher low structure within this region, a corrective phase toward $3.4K–$3.55K becomes plausible. However, a daily close below $2.95K would invalidate the wedge support and expose the broader $2.6K–$2.7K macro demand zone.

On the lower timeframe, Ethereum is moving inside a clearly defined descending channel, with each successive lower high showing weakening volatility. The most recent swing low penetrated beneath the mid-channel liquidity cluster before sharply reversing, a classic liquidity sweep that often precedes short-term relief rallies.

The $3K–$3.1K level has now been tested multiple times, forming a near-textbook reaction zone where algorithmic activity is typically concentrated. Above price sits a newly created imbalance window at $3.25K–$3.33K, which may act as a magnet should buyers engineer a corrective push.

Nevertheless, the structure remains firmly bearish until Ethereum can reclaim the channel midline near $3.35K. Failure to do so would maintain the downward drift and increase the probability of probing deeper into the liquidity band closer to $2.9K.



By Shayan

The Ethereum Futures Average Order Size chart reveals an important behavioural shift beneath the surface of the recent decline. During the latest pullback from $4.1K down to the $3K region, the order flow composition transitioned toward a cluster of smaller retail-driven orders, while large-size executions have noticeably thinned.

This configuration appears similar to previous phases where retail capitulation formed near-cycle lows and larger market participants accumulated during structurally discounted price zones. Although there is not yet a clear surge in whale-sized futures orders, the absence of aggressive selling from big hands suggests that the current downturn may reflect forced-liquidation pressure more than deliberate institutional distribution.

This interpretation aligns with the futures liquidation heatmap, which shows a dense band of liquidations absorbed around $3K. Historically, such concentrated wipeouts often precede at least a temporary structural recovery as excess leverage is cleared.

If Ethereum can defend the current demand region and spot flows begin to reflect larger-size orders, the setup would resemble the early formation of a base before a broader corrective upswing. However, if this region breaks decisively, the next meaningful liquidity concentration lies significantly lower, implying that the market has not yet concluded its deleveraging phase.

Obex, a new crypto incubator, has raised $37 million to support building the next generation of yield-generating stablecoins led by Framework Ventures, LayerZero and the Sky ecosystem, the team has told CoinDesk in an interview.

The initiative set out to invest and provide capital to projects that bring real-world asset-backed strategies onchain, bringing institutional-grade risk controls and underwriting practices to the fast-moving sector.

Obex will be the latest capital allocator of Sky, the entity formerly known as MakerDAO behind the DAI and USDS stablecoins with a combined $9 billion market cap, providing funding for projects to scale from the protocol's vast reserves and earn yield from their strategies.

"While we see stablecoins going to a trillion [dollar market], I think yield-bearing stablecoins are moving even faster," Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, told CoinDesk in an interview.

Stablecoins, a group of cryptocurrencies that aim to keep a stable price anchored to an external asset like the U.S. dollar, are rapidly growing asset class. While they are mostly backed by fiat money, government bonds and increasingly used for cross-border payments, an emerging group of tokens seek to offer competitive yield to holders through investment strategies in the backend. Often dubbed synthetic stablecoins, the most notable example among them Ethena's $8 billion token USDE, which generates yield by holding spot cryptos while simultaneously shorting an equal amount of derivatives for a neutral trading position.

However, some backing strategies could turn out to be risky causing the tokens losing their supposed price anchor. A string of synthetic stablecoins, including Stream Finance's USDX and Elixir's deUSD, recently lost their peg following a contagion in DeFi triggered by decentralized protocol Balancer's exploit.

Obex was designed to avoid these stablecoin failures, which highlighted the need for more rigorous oversight and better technical foundations, Spencer said. "We cannot have people creating $500 million stablecoins and blowing them up," he said. "Sky has the infrastructure to scale these safely."

The initiative will focus on stablecoins backed by high-quality, real-world collateral focusing on three key areas: compute credits, such as tokenized GPU infrastructure; energy assets like municipal-scale solar and battery deployments; and loans to large fintechs, which often lack access to credit lines despite their size.

The incubator will run a 12-week program for early-stage teams, offering capital, technical resources and access to Sky's infrastructure.

Teams that pass risk and governance reviews may qualify for additional capital from Sky, which has recently authorized in a governance vote to deploy up to $2.5 billion in USDS into Obex projects.

Spencer described Obex as a "Y Combinator for stablecoins," a reference to the influential Silicon Valley startup accelerator. "You look around San Francisco and see stablecoin ads everywhere. We receive five-to-ten pitches every day," he said. "The energy is there."

"What's missing is infrastructure: to underwrite these ideas properly, to ensure they're safe, and to actually bring them to scale," he added.

Major European fintech firm Revolut is teaming with Ethereum scaling network Polygon to power crypto remittances and stablecoin payments via the Revolut app, the network announced on Tuesday. 

First integrated last December, the network has facilitated more than $690 million in trading volumes via Revolut thus far. 

"This integration with Revolut represents exactly the kind of real-world utility for everyday people we've been building toward," said Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron, in a statement. "By making blockchain payments invisible to the end user, integrated with everyday traditional payment experiences, and delivering superior speed and cost efficiency, we're seeing the future of finance unfold."

Polygon's collaboration with Revolut enables the fintech firm's customers in the UK and European Economic Area (EEA) to make crypto remittances in stablecoins USDC and USDT, as well as POL (formerly MATIC)—the network's native token. 

POL trading is also available via Revolut's app and its sidechain is accessible through Revolut Ramp, allowing users to easily onboard fiat currencies to the network. 

"One key way of judging success is by how well our infrastructure continues to meet new and developing regulations," Aishwary Gupta, Polygon's global head of payments, exchanges, and RWA, told Decrypt. "We want to show lawmakers not only how fintechs and banks can be compliant, but to show them what's possible when payments are made on the blockchain."

The European neobank has more than 65 million users across 160 supported countries and regions, according to its website. It has offered crypto trading to select geographies since 2017, but shuttered that functionality for U.S. users in 2023 due to regulatory uncertainty.

Last month, the firm secured a MiCA license in Cyprus, potentially positioning it to launch its own stablecoin. Sources familiar with the matter told Decrypt in June that the firm was exploring the launch of its own stablecoin just a year after it expanded its crypto services to more than 30 countries with the launch of Revolut X.

Predictors on Myriad give the firm just a 16% chance of announcing such a token by the end of the year. (Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt parent company, Dastan). 

Polygon is home to more than $3.2 billion of stablecoins, or around 1% of the total stablecoin market cap, according to data from DefiLlama. The network has seen a stablecoin decrease of around 0.30% in the last seven days.

In an industry like Bollywood, many faces fall through the cracks in the system. For some the cause is their defiance, and for others, it's just bad luck. Actor Vishal Malhotra is one of those people. Making his debut in the Ken Ghosh directorial Ishq Vishk, alongside Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao, Malhotra has actually made a name for himself during his journey as an entrepreneur. He talked about his exit from Bollywood after filmmakers refused to offer him the sort of work he wanted to do. He said the same people who wanted to cast him in his films only had two words for him when he asked to be cast as more than hero's friend: No.

While appearing as one of the speakers during TEDx, Malhotra shared in-depth stories from his time as an actor, television anchor and businessman. He first started with a story about his first big break and said, “Around 30 years ago, I was bunking a class when a very beautiful girl started walking towards me. She came right up to me and said, ‘We are looking for the face of our channel; would you be interested?' I didn't even know what auditions were, and I just showed up the next day, gave the audition and became the face of Disney in India for the next 10 years.”

Malhotra would then go on to star in films like Jannat and Kismat Konnection before falling out of favour with certain producers and directors. During a separate interview with Hindi Rush, Malhotra had talked about being ostracised from the industry and said, “When I asked for a different role, that big producer took it on his ego. Its side effects were dangerous. I was not prepared for its impact. When a powerful person like that dismisses your capability, you are finished. I had no work for two years. I was very scared after that.”

He also said that early discipline when it came to investing helped him survive the tough phase. “My parents made me start investing money from the time my career started. After I got my first cheque, I went to my mom and she asked me to invest in Reliance Industries shares for Rs 715 and I will be very happy. She said whatever you are giving me today, you will be able to buy a house in five years with this money. They guided me well.”

After a stint as a television anchor, Malhotra finally put his foot down and decided to go into business for himself, a decision that ultimately proved lucrative for his acting career as well.

Recalling his early days in business, Malhotra said, “I opened my own ad agency and made a lot of ad films. Went into business with the biggest retailers in India, like Reliance. I used to sell them all kinds of paper products, from tissue papers to toilet rolls. Later I discovered NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens). It excited me that NFTs gave the rights back to the creator. I never owned any right to the films I was in, it didn't belong to me. That is why I delved into NFTs, and I became the first Indian actor to create and sell an NFT.”

Malhotra talked about his exit from cryptocurrency as well and said, “As Covid ended, many people suggested I sell my NFTs, as there were rumours going around that the Indian government was going to ban cryptocurrency. I listened to their advice and cashed in. What I got back was a good amount of pocket change, and that amount was perfect for a film that I had written. So then I wrote, produced and directed my first feature film, Ilm, which became the world's first film completely funded by an NFT.”

When Val Vavilov cofounded his Bitcoin mining company, Bitfury, in 2011, the original cryptocurrency was worth less than $30, a sliver of its roughly $91,000 price today. Since then, Bitfury's mining ventures spun off into two Nasdaq-listed companies whose combined worth tops $9 billion, while also launching two companies that offer AI infrastructure. Bitfury's next step? It wants to use its money to invest in the next crop of ethical tech innovators. 

The company announced on Tuesday that it would launch a $1 billion investment initiative, where it aims to support mission-driven founders. It aims to spend $200 million in the next year and the rest of the fund in the next several years. 

“We were ourselves mission-driven entrepreneurs that embraced Bitcoin, and we brought the power of Bitcoin to the world,” said George Kikvadze, the executive vice chairman, in an interview with Fortune. “Now we want to take our winnings and enable others to go and win and make the world a better place.”

Bitfury is not the first company to invest in both crypto and AI. Major tech companies like Google, Apple, and X—all racing for superiority in AI—are exploring blockchain technology, as President Donald Trump's administration has loosened regulation of the crypto sector. 

Bitfury says it doesn't have an exact list yet of the companies it hopes to invest in. However, it plans to invest in ethical companies involved in AI, quantum computing, and transparent decentralized systems, among other categories. 

It also aims to invest in self-sovereign identity, which is a way for people to have complete control of their own data using cryptography. Vavilov, Bitfury's CEO, says that this technology will be important as AI avatars become universal, and it becomes ever more difficult to determine who is real and who is fake. Kikvadze added that this might not be the reality for 20 or 30 years, but he stressed the importance of looking far into the future when investing in technology. 

“We're big fans of [the American architect] Buckminster Fuller, who said, ‘You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model completely obsolete,'” Kikvadze said. 

Bitfury made a majority of its money through its mining operations, which include its two spun-off companies, both listed on the Nasdaq. Cipher Mining (CIFR) began operations in the U.S. and is worth about $5.5 billion, and Hut8 (HUT) began in Canada and has a market cap of about $4 billion. Bitfury also established and cofounded two companies that offer AI infrastructure, LiquidStack and Axelera AI, respectively. The former cools data centers, and the latter designs AI software and hardware. 

Vavilov said his company is pivoting into this investment fund because of the recent convergence of AI and crypto. 

“Why now? Because AI is taking over, and we see the big synergy between AI and decentralized systems,” he said. “We believe that the future will be a combination of AI and decentralized systems working together, and we have huge experience in the crypto space and in AI.”

The crypto market showed few, if any signs, of recovery on Tuesday, with bitcoin BTC$93,714.56 trading at $91,400 while ether ETH$3,152.91 traded around $3,060.

The fear and greed index is now flashing 15/100, a low not seen since April, before the bitcoin price defied bearish expectations by surging to over $100,000 from $76,000 in the course of a month.

While there is a reason to expect a bounce given sentiment is resting at cycle lows, bitcoin may want to test the $87,500 level of support to flush out any remnants of leverage before shifting higher.

As Wall Street veteran Warren Buffet once said: "Buy when there is blood in the streets, even if it's you're own." 

That statement could ring true for a number of traders who are prepared to take risks at these levels, although others continue to trade emotionally and lose millions in the process, as seen by Monday's cautionary tale about a trader who lost $5.5 million after shorting the bottom with 30-times leverage.

Spain's development finance institution, the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO), and Garanti BBVA, BBVA's Turkish franchise, signed the first financing agreement aimed at boosting the activity of companies with Spanish interests in Türkiye for up to $100 million.

This agreement marks the beginning of ICO's financing activities in Türkiye under the International Channel Facility, which will support projects with Spanish interests across the Eurasian continent, given Türkiye's strategic geographic location connecting Europe and Asia.

This is the ninth agreement between ICO and the BBVA Group under the ICO International Channel Facility, which seeks to provide comprehensive support for the financing and liquidity needs of companies with Spanish interests. So far, ICO has signed two financing agreements with BBVA Colombia, three with BBVA Peru, and three with BBVA Mexico.

Garanti BBVA, part of the BBVA Group, is the second-largest private bank in Türkiye. The main goal of the agreement signed by the two institutions is to foster the development of sustainability and digitization projects to drive the green, digital transformation of the productive sector, facilitating the expansion of sustainable, innovative and technology-based companies. 

In addition to backing export and commercial business between Spain and Türkiye, this agreement expands the scope of the International Channel Facility to include companies based in the Turkish market with commercial and investment activities connected to Spain.

To mark the signing of this financing agreement, an informative session was held for the business community at Garanti BBVA's headquarters in Istanbul. The event featured opening remarks by Cristina Latorre, the Spanish Ambassador to Türkiye, Mahmut Akten, CEO of Garanti BBVA, and Fernando Salazar, Director General of International Corporate Finance, Intermediation and State Funds at ICO.

During the opening session, Sinem Edige, Head of BBVA Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) in Türkiye, underscored the significance of the collaboration with ICO in providing more favorable financing opportunities for companies with a strong international presence. She stated: “Through this agreement, we will offer new, ICO-backed funding opportunities to companies in Türkiye that have commercial or investment relations with Spain. In doing so, we not only strengthen the economic cooperation between the two countries but also contribute to our clients' growth journey by providing an international source of financing. We see this partnership as an opportunity to leverage the global strength of the BBVA Group to create further value for the Turkish economy, and we are proud to be a trusted financial partner for foreign investors operating in our country.”

Meanwhile, Fernando Salazar, Director General of ICO, emphasized “the satisfaction it brings ICO to begin collaborating with Garanti BBVA through the ICO International Channel Facility. This step enables us to continue supporting Spanish enterprises in their international expansion, and to strengthen our presence in new markets beyond those that have already been established through this program, such as Latin America and the Caribbean, the U.S. and North Africa.”

Dozens of companies from the region attended the event, interested in learning more about the ICO International Channel Facility to support businesses. The event, organized in conjunction with ICEX, featured a roundtable discussion on the topic: “Strengthening the economic alliance between Spain and Türkiye: financing, collaboration and market entry for Spanish investors,” which focused on analyzing investment opportunities in the region.

The ICO International Channel Facility is designed to boost the business activity and project financing of Spanish companies with an international presence in other markets through intermediation with local financial institutions.

This program transfers the operating scheme of ICO Facilities to multilateral, public development or private banks located abroad, simplifying application procedures for companies, and adding the benefit of the financial institution's local market expertise. In addition, it enables Spanish companies with business in other markets to finance their projects in local currency in the countries where they are carried out.

ICO has mobilized €3.72 billion through the International Channel Facility, financing over 570 projects of Spanish companies in other markets, including Latin America and the Caribbean, the U.S., and North Africa.

The relationship between the BBVA Group and ICO in the framework of the International Channel Facility continues to grow stronger, with nine agreements worldwide designed to provide financial support for Spanish companies in their international expansion.

This latest agreement with ICO illustrates BBVA's commitment to supporting its institutional clients, working in close collaboration to promote projects that foster economic development, sustainability and the international expansion of Spanish businesses.

To date, the ICO has signed two financing agreements with BBVA Colombia, three with BBVA Peru and three with BBVA Mexico. These agreements reinforce public-private partnerships, enhancing support for Spanish companies abroad.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Spot bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds in the U.S. reported a combined daily net outflow of $437 million yesterday, extending their recent negative flow trend.

According to SoSoValue data, spot bitcoin ETFs saw $254.5 million worth of outflows on Monday, led by $145.5 million leaving BlackRock's IBIT fund. Other ETFs from Grayscale, Fidelity, Ark & 21Shares, Bitwise and VanEck also posted sizable outflows.

Monday marked the fourth consecutive day of net outflows for the spot bitcoin ETFs, which have shed nearly $1.9 billion over that period.

Spot Ethereum ETFs posted $182.8 million in outflows on Monday, led by $193 million exiting BlackRock's ETHA and another $3 million leaving Fidelity's FETH. These outflows were partially offset by roughly $13 million in inflows into Grayscale's ETHE and ETH funds.

Spot ether ETFs have now logged five straight days of net outflows, with $911.4 million exiting the funds in that period.

"​​The outflow underscores a deepening caution among institutional investors, reflecting broader macroeconomic headwinds like fiscal uncertainty and elevated interest rate expectations that are eroding the 'store of value' narrative for these legacy assets," said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research.



Since late October, bitcoin and ether have been steadily declining as record-length U.S. shutdown drained liquidity from markets, compounded by fading optimism for a December interest rate cut.

Late Monday night, bitcoin had fallen below $90,000 to its seven-month low. It is now trading at $91,253, down 4.44% over the past 24 hours, while Ethereum dropped 4% to $3,056, according to The Block's crypto price page.

"This [outflow] trend signals a maturing yet risk-averse crypto market, where BTC and ETH are increasingly viewed as vulnerable to equity selloffs," Ruck said. "If outflows persist, we could see intensified price pressure pushing bitcoin and Ethereum even further down, potentially triggering a wider altcoin correction and reduced overall market liquidity."

On the other hand, the recently launched spot altcoin ETFs saw positive flows on Monday.

Canary Capital's spot XRP ETF reported $25.41 million in net inflows yesterday, after it drew in $243 million last Friday. Canary's spot Litecoin ETF also saw $2 million in net inflows.

Spot Solana ETFs had $8.26 million in net inflows, with funds going into Bitwise's BSOL and Grayscale's GSOL, while VanEck's newly launched VSOL recorded no flows on its first day.

Meanwhile, two more Solana ETFs are scheduled to launch on Tuesday — SOLC from Canary and FSOL from Fidelity — according to Bloomberg Analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart.

"Positive flows into Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs point to early signs of capital rotation toward altcoins with clearer regulatory paths and potential to gain higher market capitalization, a diversification strategy that could accelerate if altcoin ETF approvals continue in the near future," Ruck told The Block.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Last month, Coinbase bought Echo, an angel investing platform founded by popular crypto trader Jordan "Cobie" Fish, for around $375 million. Then, last week, it launched its own public token sales platform, with a main focus on letting U.S. retail users participate. The back-to-back moves signal a clear shift in Coinbase's business strategy. I spoke with Coinbase, rival platforms, VCs, and founders to break down what's driving the shift and what comes next.

Coinbase's maneuvers raise an obvious question: why now? The company recently told me it sees the current Trump administration as the most pro-crypto the U.S. has had — suggesting a reopening of the ICO door that's effectively been shut since the 2017–18 crackdown. The regulatory backdrop has indeed changed. In July, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said he had asked staff to propose “purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors” for ICOs, airdrops, and network rewards — a sharp break from the post-2017 era when the SEC treated most ICOs as unregistered securities and pushed many projects into shutdowns or settlements.

Other signals also point towards improving regulatory clarity. CoinList president Scott Keto highlighted the recent SEC no-action letter for DoubleZero, which suggested its 2Z token was not a security — something he said he had never seen before. DoubleZero recently conducted a public sale on CoinList, marking the platform's first sale to accredited U.S. users since 2019. Keto added that new legislation moving through Congress, including the Clarity Act crypto market structure bill, now gives companies like Coinbase far more confidence to operate in this space, especially with access to U.S. retail. Echo, notably, has only served accredited U.S. investors — likely one reason Coinbase launched a separate retail-facing platform.

Keto said this regulatory shift benefits all token sale platforms, not just Coinbase. When asked whether CoinList will now enable U.S. retail participation, he said that decision ultimately lies with issuers: “During the [former SEC Chair Gary] Gensler era, it's not that we were unable to offer token sales to U.S. people (even accredited), but the projects themselves decided that it was too risky,” he said. “If projects want to offer their tokens to U.S. retail, then we can be supportive of that.”

Other rival platforms see the same regulatory opening but are taking different paths. Legion co-founder Matt O'Connor said the platform plans to serve U.S. retail as well, arguing that “securities laws should not apply to most tokens” under an updated policy framework. In contrast, BuidlPad founder Erick Zhang said he still does not plan to target U.S. users.

But regulation isn't the only driver. Coinbase's head of trading, Scott Shapiro, said the goal is to support projects “at every stage of their lifecycle” — early raises on Echo groups, crypto-native public sales through Echo Sonar, and then broad distribution to Coinbase's global retail base. Shapiro's pitch is a full-stack, founder-friendly path from inception to liquidity, designed not just for quick sales but “the long-term health of the project.”

Framework Ventures' partner Brandon Potts said Coinbase is simply trying to own more of the user journey as users increasingly want to participate earlier, and issuers want compliant, higher-trust venues. Robot Ventures' partner Anirudh Pai called it vertical integration: if Coinbase wants to dominate both centralized trading and the onchain economy through Base, it needs a direct pipeline for token distribution.

A couple of founders added a competitive lens. Superfluid co-founder and CEO Francesco Renzi said token launches remain one of the highest-volume moments for any exchange — and Coinbase's conservative stance on day-one listings meant it “missed out” on this market. Lluis Bardet Alvarez, co-founder of idOS, said that as decentralized-exchange volumes rise and onchain fees decline, centralized exchanges face an “innovator's dilemma.” He said, “Coinbase is exploring new crypto products that don't cannibalize directly their core product (CEX), while still helping to capture users that are more decentralization-minded.”

Most rivals saw Coinbase's Echo acquisition and the launch of a public token sales platform as both validation and a bit of competition. CoinList's Keto said it confirms the regulatory environment has finally shifted enough for major platforms to re-enter U.S. token launches — something many avoided for years — and added that CoinList is now preparing a more decentralized sale mechanism to give projects alternatives beyond centralized venues.

“We are going in the other direction because that is what I think projects and their users will ultimately care about,” Keto said. “The projects want the users on their own chains and inside their own apps. CoinList is committed and ready to integrate those networks. We have a few deals like that coming up.”

Legion's O'Connor said Coinbase's move increases some competition but doesn't eliminate room for others. He said Legion is positioning itself as more of an ICO underwriter — working closely with projects on structuring, compliance and go-to-market — rather than just a distribution channel. “Tokenization is a powerful technology, and the addressable market is not a handful of altcoins — it's bringing any and every asset and investment opportunity onchain. It's reinventing IPOs. That's why we call Legion the first ICO underwriter,” he said.

BuidlPad's Zhang said his platform will stay focused on non-U.S. markets and has a “highly curated and high touch” approach, spending a couple of months with projects to cultivate community and run pre-launch marketing campaigns. “This means we cannot do token launches very frequently — but that's the path we choose,” he said.

Most people I spoke to said that Coinbase might win a share of premium deals, but not all. Platforms offering more “degen” launch mechanics, less strict compliance, or more favorable founder terms will still compete for strong launches, they said. As Pai put it, “Some [platforms] might build a brand around memecoins and riskier, more speculative tokens.”

Coinbase says it aims to run one token sale per month — although Shapiro said that “isn't a hard and fast rule” as the focus is on quality over quantity. While the pace of strong launches this year has been modest, many I spoke to said the next year could see a meaningful uptick as teams that delayed launches finally step forward.

Framework's Potts said, “There is a real pent-up supply of high-quality projects that have delayed launching, not because they lack conviction, but because the venue landscape has been limited and inconsistent.”

Others expect more activity with Coinbase's entry — though not a 2017-style flood — as teams take advantage of clearer rules and renewed access to U.S. retail. “We've received an increase in inbound from top-tier projects and institutional partners after Coinbase's announcement,” Legion's O'Connor said. “ICO season is back, but it's evolved to be more sustainable and resilient from the 2017 era.”

Vinayak Kurup, head of research and investor at EV3 Ventures, agreed: “We've evolved significantly as an industry since the [early] ICO days,” adding that fundamentals, not hype, will drive the next phase. With institutional capital coming onchain and crypto now treated more seriously as an asset class, “the pure days of market degeneracy, I think, are in the rear-view mirror,” he said.

Another big question is whether Coinbase will eventually use its own platform to launch a Base token. Coinbase's Shapiro said, “Base is in the early stages of exploring a network token, but we have nothing further to share at this time.”

Others I spoke to were split. Some said if Base ever launches a token, it will almost certainly happen on Coinbase's platform. But others warned it could create conflict-of-interest issues and attract regulatory scrutiny — and Coinbase may instead opt for an airdrop-only route.

“Issuing a Base token on their own high-compliance venue would create an issuer-platform conflict and draw regulatory scrutiny,” said Framework's Potts. “A Base token becomes more plausible only once competitive pressures rise and U.S. policy becomes clearer.”

Mathijs van Esch, general partner at Maven 11, said, “We would speculate they would most likely facilitate an airdrop… This way, the Base token would immediately be deemed as a commodity under current regulations.”

The atypical structure of the radium monofluoride molecule allows physicists to search for answers to some of the universe's biggest questions.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Often in physics, if you want to investigate the very small, you need to build something very big. The most famous example—the Large Hadron Collider—is a 17-mile-long tunnel custom-built to explore the subatomic world. However, a new study led by scientists at MIT shows that you don't always need massive mega-machines to explore some of the most foundational mysteries of the universe. 

In this new study, published last month in the journal Science, scientists accurately measured the energy of electrons in a radium atom—when paired with a fluoride atom to form the molecule radium monofluoride—which acted as its own atom-sized particle accelerator. The team also noted a slight shift in electron energy levels, confirming that these electrons briefly penetrated the radium atom's nucleus and providing an incredible opportunity to precisely map radium for the first time.

“When you put this radioactive atom inside of a molecule, the internal electric field that its electrons experience is orders of magnitude larger compared to the fields we can produce and apply in a lab,” Silviu-Marian Udrescu, a co-author of the study and Ph.D. student from MIT, said in a press statement. “In a way, the molecule acts like a giant particle collider and gives us a better chance to probe the radium's nucleus.”

The use of radium in this experiment is immensely important, as the atom's asymmetrical configuration—which most physicists describe as “pear-shaped”—was a part of the reason this entire process was possible. According to physicists, pear-shaped atoms significantly enhance our ability to look for time (T) and charge-parity (CP) symmetry violations that lie beyond the Standard Model. 

In this well-established model, atoms are forbidden to have a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM)—the measurement of two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance—but previous estimates suggest that an EDM signature could be enhanced nearly 1,000 times in a pear-shaped atom, thanks to its asymmetrical charge and mass.  

The exploration of these symmetry violations directly impacts physicists' ongoing search for an answer (or several answers) to the perplexing question of matter-antimatter asymmetry. Simply put, in the early moments of the Big Bang, the Standard Model suggests that matter and antimatter should have annihilated each other, leaving only pure energy. Of course, that didn't happen (you, in fact, are living, breathing proof), and the fact that it didn't remains one of the greatest mysteries of science. 

In this study, researchers measured the energy shift of electrons as they exited the radium's nucleus carrying a nuclear “message” that could reveal information about the atom's internal structure. This technique offers up a new way for scientists to map the atom's “magnetic distribution”—an important step in exploring the deeper mysteries of matter-antimatter asymmetry. 

“Our results lay the groundwork for subsequent studies aiming to measure violations of fundamental symmetries at the nuclear level,” Ronald Fernando Garcia Ruiz, a co-author of the study from MIT, said in a press statement. “This could provide answers to some of the most pressing questions in modern physics.”

Up to this point, Garcia Ruiz and his team have only studied these atoms in random orientations at high temperature. However, a future study will cool molecules of radium monofluouride to control their orientations, so that scientists can accurately map their internal structure. 

“We now have proof that we can sample inside the nucleus,” Garcia Ruiz said in a press statement. “It's like being able to measure a battery's electric field. People can measure its field outside, but to measure inside the battery is far more challenging. And that's what we can do now.”

CRISPR-based genome editing technologies, including nuclease-based editing, base editing and prime editing, have revolutionized biological research and modern medicine by enabling precise, programmable modification of the genome and offering new therapeutic strategies for a wide range of genetic diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning models, is now further advancing the field by accelerating the optimization of gene editors for diverse targets, guiding the engineering of existing tools and supporting the discovery of novel genome-editing enzymes. In this Review, we summarize key AI methodologies underlying these advances and discuss their recent noteworthy applications to genome editing technologies. We also discuss emerging opportunities, such as AI-powered virtual cell models, which can guide genome editing through target selection or prediction of functional outcomes. Finally, we identify key directions where the integration of AI methods is poised to have a substantial impact going forward.

About 110 million years ago, two pterosaurs were probably wandering around the shore when they were snapped up by a hungry predator—one which apparently couldn't hold them down.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Even the most ferocious dinosaurs sometimes bit off more than they could chew (or swallow). In one such instance, what was supposed to be inner came right back up, fossilized for over a hundred million years, and it ended up gathering dust in the back room of a museum—until scientists realized this half-digested mass contained the bones of a pterosaur species that had gone undiscovered.

Fossilized vomit is not usually where anyone expects to identify an unknown species. While a new species of prehistoric beetle was previously found in a coprolite, or fossil feces, nothing has ever been discovered in the vomit equivalent known as a regurgitalite. It was originally unearthed in the Romualdo Formation of the Araripe Basin in northeastern Brazil. When a team of paleontologists examined it up close, they realized they were looking at the crushed remains of several fish and two nameless pterosaurs.

“The co-occurrence of densely packed, semi-articulated, and fragmented pterosaur bones together with a cluster of similarly aligned fish supports the interpretation of the assemblage as a regurgitalite, a mass of indigestible material expelled orally by a predator,” they said in a study recently published in Nature. 

The fossils seem unremarkable at a glance, an almost indistinguishable jumble of bones against yellow-tinged carbonate rock. The petrified vomitus is also full of zooplankton, which was either swallowed with the pterosaurs or already in their mouths. It was when the research team observed two upper jaw and two lower jaw fragments that they realized whatever carnivore was stalking prey that fateful day must have been especially ravenous, because it snapped up two pterosaurs in its jaws before downing four fish. That must have been more than its stomach could handle. 

Both of the unfortunate flying reptiles represent an unusual new species of pterosaur which was a filter feeder. This means it fed by running its snout full of bristle-like teeth through the water like a sieve to catch small crustaceans and other small sea creatures. Bakiribu waridza literally means “comb-mouth” in the Indigenous Kariri language spoken in the region where it was found. While it is not the only known filter-feeing pterosaur, it is now the sole member of an entirely new pterosaur genus.

Bakiribu has features that echo older specimens of closely related species in Germany and younger bones from Argentina. It is closest to Ctenochasmatidae, a diverse and widespread clade of pterosaurs that took to the skies during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. Their remains have been found in sites that are remarkably distant, from China to Europe to South America. Some ctenochasmatids, such as Ctenochasma, Pterodaustro guinazui, Gegepterus changi and Pterofiltrus qiui belonged to a subgroup with elongated snouts and rows of fine teeth that suggest they were filter feeders. 

Evolutionarily falling somewhere between the older Ctenochasma and younger Pterodaustro, Bakiribu suggests a transitional phase in ctenochasmatine pterosaurs. Its snout is more elongated and denser than that of Ctenochasma, with more teeth, but not quite as much as that of Pterodaustro.  

What exactly ate these pterosaurs is unknown, but the researchers suspect it could have been a Spinosaurus. This semi-aquatic monster was already caught hunting pterosaurs millions of years later when one of its teeth was found embedded in the neck vertebra of another pterosaur species. Given the arrangement of the bones, it likely swallowed the pterosaurs first before gorging itself on fish, since their bones are fractured and mostly defleshed while the fish are almost complete. It most likely ended up with skeletal overload in its stomach and was unable to keep the entire meal down.

“Considering body size, feeding ecology, and existing evidence of pterosaur consumption, spinosaurids emerge as the most plausible producers of the regurgitalite described here, providing additional information on the group's dietary behavior and trophic interactions,” the researchers said. 

This goes to show that new discoveries can surface in the unlikeliest of places, and that even the fiercest dinosaurs were prone to puking.

Nature Climate Change

                         (2025)Cite this article


The potential death toll of exceptional extreme heat events is crucial for climate risk analysis and adaptation planning but may not be captured by existing projections. Here we combine machine learning-based projections of five historical European heat waves under present or future global temperatures with empirical exposure–response functions to quantify the potential for extreme heat events to generate mass mortality. For example, if August 2003 meteorological conditions recur at the recent annual global temperature anomaly of 1.5 °C, we project 17,800 excess deaths across Europe in one week, rising to 32,000 at 3 °C. This mortality is comparable to peak COVID-19 mortality in Europe and is not substantially reduced by climate adaptation currently observed across Europe. Our results suggest that while mitigating further global warming can reduce heat mortality, mass mortality events remain plausible at near-future temperatures despite current adaptations to heat.

Climate change is increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme heat events1,2,3,4, threatening human health5. Additional warming is projected to generate more intense heat events than even recent record-breaking events6, with the potential for mass mortality events similar to those witnessed in Europe in the summer of 20037, especially during exceptionally hot years such as 20238,9.

Projections of increased heat-related mortality from climate change are now numerous10,11,12,13,14,15. However, these projections generally focus on the long-term population burden of non-optimal temperatures rather than the death toll of individual high-impact events. Exceptional extreme heat events require distinct management strategies compared with typical population burdens, as they can strain health and emergency services beyond what occurs at milder temperatures16. Preparedness for hospital overcrowding and health system surge capacity should therefore be benchmarked to a plausible extreme scenario rather than an average projection17.

Quantifying plausible scenarios of extreme events under future climate change requires careful methodological treatment, and there are reasons to believe that existing projections do not capture the most extreme mortality events. In particular, the relatively short records of observations and most global climate model (GCM) simulations make it difficult to assess the probabilities of the most extreme events18. While progress has been made using large initial-condition ensembles to quantify very rare heat mortality19, some of the most extreme events may be poorly captured even by ensembles with many members20. Additionally, GCMs underestimate trends in the frequency and persistence of atmospheric circulation patterns that have contributed to recent rapid warming of heat extremes in populous regions such as Europe21,22,23,24,25,26.

To complement existing work, a promising approach is to develop ‘storylines' of heat waves that are physically plausible and dynamically consistent. This conditional approach, which emphasizes plausibility rather than probability27, enables exploration of extreme outcomes28,29 and stress tests of adaptation strategies17,30. Plausible storylines must also account for the documented ability of humans to adapt to repeated heat exposure and to change behaviour following past extreme heat episodes31.

Major heat-mortality events require several ingredients: large-scale physical drivers of elevated temperatures as well as human health responses to the resulting heat stress. Extreme heat events tend to occur when atmospheric high-pressure systems interact with dry soils to produce land–atmosphere feedbacks that amplify heat accumulation6,21,32,33. In turn, prolonged exposure to high ambient temperatures impairs the ability of the body to dissipate heat, leading to elevated core temperature, increased cardiovascular strain and a heightened risk of heat-related illness and death34.

Here we focus on the combination of these geophysical and physiological ingredients in Europe. Hot extremes are increasing more rapidly in Europe than the rest of the hemisphere22,23,26, and tens of thousands of deaths across the continent have been linked to recent summer heat35,36, with climate change causing more than half37. As a result, Europe is a particularly important setting in which to study the risk of mass heat-mortality events.

We combine two existing approaches to quantify the risk of mass heat mortality across Europe (Methods). First, we use a recently developed machine learning framework38. In this framework, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained on an ensemble of GCMs from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) to predict daily temperatures in three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) regions of Europe from (1) the annual global mean temperature (GMT) in the preceding 12 months, (2) the calendar day and (3) modelled daily meteorological conditions. Then, meteorological conditions from ERA5 reanalysis are used as out-of-sample inputs to the trained neural networks to predict ‘counterfactual' versions of historical heat waves at varying annual GMT. Our method learns the representation in the GCMs of the meteorological drivers of individual extreme heat events, allowing us to quantify the intensity of surface temperature extremes conditional on historical meteorological patterns, independent of projected changes in the frequency or persistence of those patterns. We predict counterfactual events at varying annual GMT from the preceding 12 months, rather than long-term mean GMT, because individual hot years are plausible before long-term climate targets are reached39, these years pose substantial regional climate risks40 and GMT in the previous 12 months is directly detectable in observations41.

For this study, we produce counterfactual estimates of five multiweek periods of extreme heat that occurred in July 1994, August 2003, July 2006, June 2019 and August 2023 (Fig. 1). We choose these illustrative events, which had differing durations and spatial extents, because each corresponds to a continuous period of Europe-wide temperature anomalies (date ranges shown in Extended Data Fig. 1), shows spatial patterns of anomalous atmospheric pressure and soil moisture (Fig. 1g) and spans a wide range of human influence on the climate (for example, annual GMT anomaly in the preceding 12 months of 0.5 °C in July 1994 versus 1.3 °C in August 2023).

Second, we use longitudinal data on temperature and weekly mortality over 2015–2019 from 924 subnational regions of Europe to estimate exposure–response functions that relate ambient temperature to mortality risk (Methods). We control for location-specific seasonal and trending factors, isolating plausibly exogenous variation in daily temperature to measure the causal effect of temperature on mortality. We then calculate mortality from each event at each annual GMT anomaly and compare it to a long-term average baseline without global warming. We estimate and propagate uncertainty throughout the calculation, resulting in mortality projections that incorporate variation in both the counterfactual event predictions and exposure–response function (Methods).

These tools allow us to explicitly separate the effects of climate change and weather variability on mortality. We can leverage the diverse library of weather patterns simulated by GCMs to learn nonlinear relationships between meteorological patterns and surface heat extremes, along with the heterogeneity of responses to global warming across those patterns38. Whereas previous studies of climate change and mortality in Europe have been limited to linear scaling to capture multiple events37 or computationally intensive custom simulations for an individual event42, our approach allows us to leverage an ensemble of CMIP6 simulations to predict temperature profiles resulting from different historical meteorological conditions at different annual GMTs. In this way, our out-of-sample application of these learned relationships to actual meteorological patterns grounds our analysis in weather systems that have historically produced extreme heat.

After training on GCMs, our machine learning predictions compare well with summer daily temperatures in ERA5 across Europe when using ERA5 meteorological fields as out-of-sample inputs (Fig. 1a–c; out-of-sample R2 ≥ 0.92 across regions). They also specifically predict variation in the temperature of the hottest week in each region (Fig. 1d–f; out-of-sample R2 ≥ 0.85). We observe a small cold bias in Northern Europe (Fig. 1f), potentially because the most extreme days in the GCM training data are slightly cooler than the tail of the ERA5 distribution in this region (Supplementary Fig. 1). In the construction of counterfactual events, we use a ‘delta' method that bias-corrects the predictions (Methods). Finally, we find close correspondence between predicted and true temperatures when evaluating on held-out GCM data across a wide range of annual GMT anomalies (Supplementary Fig. 2; out-of-sample R2 ≥ 0.98).

Together, these results indicate that our approach is capable of closely reproducing sequences of hot days at a range of annual GMT values when provided with particular historical meteorological patterns, despite not seeing those precise patterns in training.

Turning to our illustrative heat waves, while the weather patterns associated with each event vary, they share common characteristics: anomalous high-pressure systems and dry soils across the continent, resulting in elevated temperatures in many countries (Fig. 1g). Without global warming, each event would have been cooler (Extended Data Fig. 2); likewise, with additional warming, a given meteorological pattern produces steadily larger temperature anomalies (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 2). The difference between the actual event magnitude and the magnitude at different annual GMT varies by event, both because the actual events occurred at different GMT and because the machine learning approach learns different responses to global warming conditioned on the particular meteorological pattern38. Across annual GMT of 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C, the August 2003 conditions yield the highest temperatures of all events, emphasizing the severity of the weather conditions during that event (Fig. 1h). Similarly, July 1994, for which historical temperature anomalies were relatively moderate among the illustrative events, produces among the most severe anomalies at standardized GMTs.

High temperatures are empirically associated with increased mortality risk across Europe (Fig. 2). We specifically find that the temperature–mortality relationship is moderated by the long-term mean temperature of a region, as found elsewhere11; for example, the minimum mortality temperature (MMT) is 14.5 °C in the coolest third of regions and 19.7 °C in the warmest third of regions. This heterogeneity may reflect the greater return on adaptation investments such as air conditioning in warmer regions. However, the slope of the exposure–response curve is steeper for warmer areas despite their higher MMT, potentially reflecting limits to adaptation to the hottest conditions. For all regions, the nonlinear increase in mortality risk above the MMT means that greater extreme heat intensity is expected to increase mortality across the continent (Fig. 2, lower inset points).

Each extreme heat event is projected to generate thousands of weekly excess deaths across Europe at the recent annual GMT of 1.5 °C (ref. 43), with increasing impacts in response to higher annual GMT (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1). The largest death tolls are associated with the 1994 and 2003 conditions, with 26,500 (95% confidence interval (CI) 22,400–31,100) and 32,000 (CI 26,700–38,800) weekly excess deaths following 12-month mean GMT of 3 °C, respectively (Fig. 3a,b). While less likely than more moderate temperatures given current emissions trends, 12-month periods with mean GMT of 4 °C are still plausible under gradual decarbonization40 and would generate 37,500 (CI 29,500–46,400) and 45,100 (CI 37,000–55,600) excess deaths in a single week across Europe if 1994 or 2003 meteorological conditions recurred, respectively. The other three events are associated with weekly peaks of 25,600 (CI 21,000–30,700), 18,800 (CI 16,100–22,100) and 20,900 (CI 16,700–25,800) excess deaths, respectively, following 12-month mean GMT of 3 °C. Excess mortality is slightly negative in the weeks following the event, consistent with mortality displacement (Methods), although not enough to offset the peak of the event.

Solid line shows average projection and shading shows 95% range in a year with GMT 3 °C above the pre-industrial baseline. Grey shading shows mortality at 0 °C, meaning the mortality that would have occurred without global warming. The x axis spans 2 weeks before the event begins to 3 weeks after it ends to illustrate the lagged effects of the event on mortality (Methods). f–j, Sources of uncertainty in the peak death toll from the July 1994 (f), August 2003 (g), July 2006 (h), June 2019 (i) and August 2023 (j) events. For each uncertainty source, the other dimensions are held at their average values and lines show variation across each value of the relevant dimension.

Source data

These death tolls reflect the underlying effect of hot temperatures without climate change, combined with the influence of climate change in intensifying these events. Comparing each event to its counterfactual at 0 °C allows us to isolate the contribution of climate change to event mortality (red lines versus grey shading in Fig. 3). For example, at the peak of a 2003-like event at 3 °C, we project climate change to produce an additional 23,000 excess deaths on top of 9,000 that would have occurred without warming, making anthropogenic warming responsible for 72% of the death toll (Supplementary Table 2).

Uncertainty in mortality from each event (shading in Fig. 3a–e) results from differences across GCMs used for machine learning training, uncertainty in the machine learning training process and sampling uncertainty in the exposure–response function (Methods). Examining the contribution of each source of uncertainty while holding the others constant reveals that sampling uncertainty in the exposure–response function (‘regression uncertainty') is the dominant source across all five illustrative events (Fig. 3f–j). While the GCMs we use for training do not span the full CMIP6 ensemble (Methods), our subset does include both high- and low-sensitivity GCMs. The higher-sensitivity GCMs have lower mortality projections than the lower-sensitivity GCMs (Supplementary Fig. 3), making it unlikely that global climate sensitivity is the primary driver of GCM uncertainty in the mortality response to increasing GMT.

The spatial distribution of mortality during each event differs, governed by the location of temperature anomalies (Fig. 1), variation in exposure–response functions (Fig. 2) and spatial variation in the effect of global warming (Supplementary Fig. 4). For example, under 1994-like conditions, the greatest mortality occurs in Germany, Poland and Eastern Europe, whereas under 2023-like conditions, mortality is highest in Spain, Italy and the Balkans (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Given that European countries undertook adaptation to heat following previous events such as 200331 and we observe heterogeneity in exposure–response functions that may indicate adaptation (Fig. 2), we explore the potential for additional future adaptation to mitigate mortality from these events. Specifically, we allow the mean temperature of each region to evolve in the future according to pattern scaling coefficients derived from CMIP6 GCMs (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6) and adjust the exposure–response function accordingly (Methods). Following other work11, our approach to estimating adaptation thus relies on extrapolating current heterogeneity in exposure–response functions and assumes that future societies will continue to adapt with the same pattern as has been recently observed.

Across the five illustrative events we study, incorporating adaptation reduces peak mortality by only 10% on average (Fig. 4). For example, peak mortality during 2003 meteorological conditions following 12 months with mean GMT of 3 °C is projected to be 32,000 in our main projections and 28,800 (CI 21,300–36,200) when allowing additional adaptation. The with-adaptation peak mortality from the 2003 event remains larger even than the no-adaptation peak of the other events. These results imply that there is limited potential for currently deployed adaptation approaches to reduce the mortality impacts of these extreme climate events.

Each bar shows the peak weekly mortality at 3 °C for each set of meteorological conditions. The yellow bars show our main calculation (that is, the peak of the 3 °C curve in Fig. 3), which incorporates existing adaptation through spatial heterogeneity in exposure–response functions. The blue bars show the same calculation after accounting for additional future climate adaptation by allowing exposure–response curves to evolve with future climate change (Methods). Bar heights show average projections and error bars show 95% range across each combination of GCM, random seed and regression bootstrap (n = 12,500). Grey text denotes the percentage reduction in mortality from additional future adaptation.

Source data

Several caveats and analytical choices should be considered when evaluating these results. For instance, we use all-age mortality rather than age-stratified rates to maximize data coverage (Methods), meaning we do not account for future shifts in age structure. However, we find an extremely similar exposure–response function for the over-65 years population as for all ages (Supplementary Fig. 7), meaning that our main response is probably already driven primarily by mortality among the elderly. Additionally, previous work has projected that changes in age structure are likely to increase heat-related mortality in Europe by 1–3%, implying that such changes would only slightly affect our results44.

Our use of annual GMT as a predictor differs from other work defining global warming as a multidecade smoothed value45. Our goal is to quantify the mortality risks associated with the possibility that historical meteorological conditions recur in years that are globally hotter than the historical years in which those conditions occurred. While smoothed GMT isolates long-term global warming, realized climate risks reflect the combination of the forced response and internal variability, and individual extreme years such as 2023 have seen dangerous local heat conditions as a result of this combination8,9. Quantifying the intensity of plausible heat waves at specific annual GMTs thus provides critical information for risk assessment.

Additionally, our projections are conditional on weather patterns that are rare by definition. It is possible that these mortality events would not take place even with substantial warming if the corresponding meteorological conditions do not occur again. Conversely, even more severe events could be produced if weather patterns occur that were not witnessed in the short observational record. Further, our results reveal a latent potential for meteorological patterns that did not cause substantial excess mortality in the past to do so in the future if they occur at higher annual GMTs. For example, at equivalent annual GMT, the July 1994 meteorological conditions produce the highest cumulative mortality and second highest peak mortality of any of the illustrative events (Supplementary Table 1).

This finding also illustrates the reason that we avoid calculating ‘observed' mortality from each event at the time it actually occurred. Each event occurred at a different level of warming and potentially a different degree of human adaptation to heat. Indeed, in other recent work, we show that the temperature–mortality relationship in France is very different before 2003, meaning that calculating ‘observed' heat mortality in 2003 may require a more sophisticated exposure–response function46. Our forward-looking approach allows us to analyse a range of known meteorological conditions at the same GMT levels, permitting standardized comparisons between historically different events with a single exposure–response function that reflects recent adaptation.

To further contextualize the magnitude of the death tolls we calculate, we compare them to weekly confirmed COVID-19 deaths across the same regions of Europe for which we have mortality data (Fig. 2, inset map). For example, the most severe 10% of weeks of COVID-19 had between 27,900 and 34,100 confirmed deaths. For an annual GMT of 3 °C, the weekly death toll from 2003-like conditions is comparable to these peak weeks of COVID-19, and for an annual GMT of 4 °C, the weekly death tolls of 1994-, 2003- and 2006-like conditions would exceed even the single worst week of COVID-19 in Europe (Extended Data Fig. 4).

It is notable that our results suggest limited potential for existing patterns of adaptation to mitigate these mass mortality events. This result may occur because, although warmer regions in Europe have higher MMTs, they also have steeper exposure–response curves above those MMTs (Fig. 2). However, our approach to adaptation is based solely on extrapolating observed spatial heterogeneity as a function of mean temperature. If other factors, such as income, change in the future, this could further affect the exposure–response function. To explore this issue, we run an additional regression where temperature is simultaneously interacted with both mean temperature and mean income11, and we find that mean temperature generates much greater heterogeneity than income, providing confidence that our main findings capture the most important axis of heterogeneity at present (Supplementary Fig. 8). More broadly, our results are consistent with other work emphasizing that heat still poses a major public health threat despite putative progress since the deadly 2003 summer47,48,49, and point to the need for new approaches to emerge if adaptation is to be more effective.

Our results reveal a substantial death toll from potential future extreme heat events in Europe. These results are based on historically observed meteorological patterns combined with plausible twenty-first-century global temperature anomalies, making them physically realistic storylines of high-magnitude heat events. We specifically distinguish between the contributions of climate change and natural variability conditional upon these realistic patterns, revealing that climate change is already a dominant contributor to mortality during extreme heat events, and its contribution could reach 70–80% of deaths at higher global temperature anomalies.

Our characterization of specific, plausible high-magnitude outcomes is an important complement to existing heat-mortality projections and can help inform health system preparedness and planning. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that even if global temperatures are stabilized, substantial and new adaptation measures may be required to reduce the continent-wide threat of extreme heat to population health.

We draw weekly mortality data from the Eurostat database (data code ‘demo_r_mweek3'). Different regions make data available over different time periods; we limit our analysis to 2015–2019 to match the most common period of data availability, following other work35. Where possible, we use all-age, all-sex mortality rates from NUTS3 (third administrative level below country) regions, except in Germany, where we only have these data at the NUTS1 level. This yields a total of 924 regions with continuous mortality rate data over 2015–2019. Age-group-specific rates (for example, over 65 years) are available for only a slightly smaller number of regions (n = 908), so we use all-age rates to maximize coverage in our preferred specification.

Our historical climate data come from the E-OBS station-based dataset50 and the ERA5 reanalysis51. We use E-OBS daily surface temperature when possible, including for the initial definitions of each extreme event and the mortality calculations. E-OBS data are spatially averaged to the appropriate NUTS regions, weighting grid cells within regions by the population of each grid cell. We use ERA5 for the out-of-sample machine learning predictions (Fig. 1) and maps of historical meteorological conditions (Fig. 1).

We use a machine learning architecture recently developed and validated by ref. 38 to produce counterfactual versions of historical extreme heat events. Following this approach, we train CNNs on an ensemble of GCM realizations, with the goal of predicting daily mean temperature anomalies over a specified region given daily meteorological conditions and the annual GMT anomaly.

The predictors for each day are daily sea level pressure (SLP), daily GPH fields at the 700-mb, 500-mb and 250-mb levels, daily soil moisture between 0 cm and 10 cm, the calendar day, an indicator variable for each GCM and the GMT anomaly over the previous 12 months. Before training, the meteorological predictors are detrended with respect to the grid cell, calendar day and GMT and then standardized by subtracting the grid-cell calendar-day mean and dividing by the grid-cell calendar-day standard deviation38. The detrended and standardized surface pressure, GPH and soil moisture are the factors we refer to as ‘meteorological conditions' throughout the text. Using detrended and standardized anomalies in this process means that these meteorological conditions explain day-to-day variation in temperature, but do not contain the signal of global warming. Daily mean temperature anomalies (the predictands) are referenced to the 1979–2023 period, with GMT anomalies relative to the same period when used in training. However, we note that throughout the text we refer to GMT anomalies relative to 1850–1900.

In our experimental setup, we train the CNN on a pooled set of CMIP6 simulations: three realizations each of five GCMs (CanESM5, HadGEM3-GC31-LL, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-LR and UKESM1-0-LL). We combine the historical and shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 5-8.5 simulations to create a 1850–2100 dataset for each realization. These five GCMs are chosen because they each archive three-dimensional daily atmospheric fields of each input variable from several realizations of the GCM. While these data requirements prevent us from using a wider range of CMIP6 models, these five GCMs are representative of the range of climate sensitivities in the CMIP6 ensemble52. Since this analysis focuses on summer heat waves, we train each CNN on CMIP6 data from May through September.

We then apply the model to predict daily temperature anomalies using predictor data from ERA5. One set of predictions uses the observed GMT time series, whereas the other sets use counterfactual GMT values but maintain the other daily predictors from the reanalysis. The result is a set of counterfactual temperature time series that maintain realistic day-to-day weather conditions but vary according to the annual GMT anomaly. While we train the CNN on a pooled set of realizations, we include an indicator variable for each GCM which allows the CNN to make separate predictions based on differences between individual GCMs. This indicator variable is one-hot encoded and provided to the neural network after the convolutional layers along with the calendar day and GMT inputs (similar to ref. 38). In training, we also vary the random seed five times to account for random differences in model training. This procedure yields 25 total predictions for each counterfactual event and GMT anomaly, five random seeds each for five GCMs.

We use a ‘delta' method to apply the CNN predictions to E-OBS gridded observations. For each day in the event of interest, we take the difference between the counterfactual CNN predictions on that day and the original CNN predictions for that day using the actual GMT. We then apply these deltas to the E-OBS observed data for that day to calculate counterfactual daily time series. Finally, we aggregate these counterfactual gridded daily temperature data into averages at the NUTS region level as with the original observations.

In ref. 38, the CNNs were trained to predict temperature in regions chosen for their relevance to specific historical extremes. In our application, we would like to apply these predictions to a set of events, each with slightly different spatial footprints. We therefore train the CNNs to predict temperature change on land in each of three regions as defined by the IPCC: the Mediterranean, Western and Central Europe and Northern Europe53. The events manifest differently in each of these regions, with temperatures generally highest in the Mediterranean region and lowest in Northern Europe (Supplementary Fig. 4). We then apply the deltas for each region uniformly to the grid cells within each region. When training the CNNs, the input SLP, GPH and soil moisture fields are defined by broader regions of approximately 35° latitude and 85° longitude centred on the IPCC regions38.

We use panel regression with fixed effects to measure the causal effect of temperature on mortality across Europe. This widely used approach11,12,54,55,56 involves regressing mortality rates on a nonlinear function of temperature, along with vectors of intercepts (fixed effects) that non-parametrically remove seasonal or annual average factors separately for each region.

We also account for heterogeneity across regions by interacting temperature with the 2000–2019 average temperature of each region, allowing the temperature exposure–response curve to vary on the basis of the long-term climate of a region. This approach leverages cross-sectional variation in temperature to assess societal adaptation to extreme heat, in effect asking whether the same temperature level has a different effect in a region that is warmer on average than a region that is cooler on average. Cross-sectional variation is less amenable to causal identification since there may be other factors (for example, income and demographics) that are correlated with both average temperature and heat sensitivity. Nevertheless, assessing heterogeneity by mean temperature is a well-established strategy for identifying present and future climate adaptation11,57,58,59,60, so we adopt it here while acknowledging the potential for additional relevant axes of heterogeneity. Our approach is also similar to multistage methods that have been used in other recent papers to estimate variation in exposure–response functions (for example, refs. 13,61,62), although we run a single regression that accommodates variations across regions rather than pooling time-series regressions from separate regions.

Specifically, we estimate the following regression relating contemporaneous and lagged temperature T to log mortality rates M in region i, week w and year y with ordinary least squares:

The region–year fixed effects \({\mu }_{{iy}}\) and region–week fixed effects \({\delta }_{{iw}}\) remove the influence of long-term trends and seasonal cycles that could confound the temperature–mortality relationship and do so separately for each region. The \({\bar{T}}_{i}\) term denotes the 2000–2019 mean temperature in each region i. We estimate distributed lag models that sum the impact on mortality of contemporaneous and lagged temperature exposure, with j indexing weekly lags. As discussed below, our main model uses 3 weeks of lagged temperatures. Regressions are weighted by the population of each region.

A key consideration is that mortality rates are provided at the weekly scale but temperature extremes can impact mortality rates on daily timescales. We require a strategy that preserves daily nonlinearities while matching the weekly scale of the mortality data. We thus follow previous work11 and sum the daily mean temperature from each day d within week w after a fourth-order polynomial transformation has been applied to the temperature of each day:

We estimate independent coefficients for each of the summed polynomial terms in equation (2). Because weekly mortality rates are the sum of daily mortality rates (given constant population), calculating the effects of daily sums preserves the nonlinear effect of each individual day on weekly mortality rates. We use daily mean temperature following earlier work11, but using daily maximum or daily minimum temperatures yields only small differences in exposure–response functions (Supplementary Fig. 7).

We use lags in the regression to incorporate delayed effects of temperature. These delayed effects could arise simply as a result of additional mortality if people die several days after heat exposure. They could also manifest as ‘displacement' or ‘harvesting,' where mortality is abnormally low after heat waves since the heat accelerated the deaths of people who would have died soon regardless of the heat. Indeed, we do observe some displacement following the events (Fig. 3), as the lag-2 and lag-3 regression coefficients are negative (Supplementary Fig. 9). We use three lags in our main analysis following earlier work35, but re-estimating the model using six lags yields similar results, with potentially slightly more displacement in additional weeks (Supplementary Fig. 9).

Our main regression is estimated over 2015–2019, as the period over which the greatest number of regions have continuous mortality data. Alternatively, we estimate the regression using all observations from 2000–2019, although different regions have different numbers of observations over this period. We find a very similar response, although the mortality response to high temperatures is slightly stronger when including data further back in time (Supplementary Fig. 7), consistent with other evidence of moderate adaptation to heat over this period31,49. Because the 2015–2019 sample uses a balanced set of regions with continuous data and accounts for previous adaptation to heat, we use it in our main analysis.

When we test an additional interaction with income (Supplementary Fig. 8), we calculate income as the 2000–2019 mean of log annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. GDP per capita is defined in Euros, GDP-deflated to account for inflation and purchasing-power-parity adjusted.

Our central calculation compares a series of abnormally hot days at a given GMT level to a long-term mean baseline without global warming (Extended Data Fig. 2). We perform this calculation by applying the exposure–response function (Fig. 2) to the temperature time series in each region and comparing it to the same prediction when applied to the baseline time series. Because our outcome is log mortality, the difference between each prediction yields a percentage change in mortality due to experiencing the temperature at each GMT instead of the baseline temperature. We then multiply this percentage change by the average number of deaths in each region observed over 2015–2019 to calculate the additional mortality from each event. Because these deaths are relative to an underlying baseline number of deaths, we refer to them as ‘excess deaths' or ‘excess mortality.'

Note that we generally refer to the events predicted by the machine learning method for different GMT anomalies as ‘counterfactual' events, whereas we use ‘baseline' to refer to a long-term average without the event.

One key methodological question in this procedure is the construction of the baseline temperature from which excess deaths are calculated. We are interested in the total number of excess deaths associated with each event, not just those caused by climate change. We therefore construct a baseline which does not include either climate change or extreme heat events. This is done in two steps:

We use the machine learning approach described above to construct counterfactual estimates for every summer day between 1980 and 2023 at 0 °C GMT. We subtract the ‘delta' from this procedure from the E-OBS observations to construct a counterfactual dataset at 0 °C over the entire observational time period (that is, not just for each event). This yields a 44-year counterfactual temperature time series for each region that includes daily weather variability and extreme heat events, but not the influence of climate change.

We then take the long-term average across 1980–2023 from this counterfactual time series for each calendar day in each region.

The result of this calculation is an estimate of the average seasonal cycle in each region at an annual GMT anomaly of 0 °C. Because the influence of climate change was removed from these observed temperatures, this baseline does not include global warming, and because it was averaged over all years for each calendar day, it does not include deviations from the seasonal cycle (that is, it does not include extreme heat events). The black dashed line in Extended Data Fig. 2 shows the Europe-wide average of these baseline temperatures over the time period of each event.

Our regression approach (equation (1)) accounts for current adaptation to heat by allowing exposure–response functions to vary according to the 2000–2019 mean temperature of the region. This approach assumes that vulnerability to temperature during the 2015–2019 data period fully reflects efficient levels of adaptation investment (such as installing air conditioning, taking indoor jobs rather than working outdoors or implementing heat action plans in cities), justifiable on the basis of longer-term (2000–2019) exposures. In the future, especially in light of rising incomes, we might expect additional such actions, which could reduce the death toll that we project.

We project future adaptation under the assumption that changes in the long-run mean temperatures of regions directly translate into additional adaptation actions. We thus require an estimate of future long-run (20-year) mean temperature in each region, with which to adjust the exposure–response functions (Fig. 2). However, our approach predicts event intensity using annual global temperature, a quantity which does not directly translate into local mean temperatures over the previous 20 years. Therefore, we adopt a pattern scaling approach, following the IPCC Sixth Assessment report63, to simulate increased 20-year mean temperatures in each European subnational district depending on a given annual GMT. We use 27 models from the CMIP6 (ref. 64), spanning the historical and SSP3-7.0 experiments65. For each year, we calculate GMT anomalies (relative to 1850–1900) and local mean temperature anomalies over the previous 20 years for each European region (relative to 2000–2019). For example, for 2069 in the region that encompasses Berlin, we have the GMT change in 2069 and the regional mean temperature change over 2049–2068. The relationship between these two quantities yields a coherent spatial pattern across Europe (Supplementary Fig. 6) that is reflective of the forced response63. We note that extreme temperatures in Europe are rising faster than both local and global averages and CMIP6 models generally underestimate this higher scaling23,24, but changes in local 20-year mean temperatures in CMIP6 models scale with GMT quite similarly to their scaling in E-OBS observations (Supplementary Fig. 5).

In each calculation of event mortality at each annual GMT, we predict the additional mean temperature change (relative to 2000–2019) of each region given the GMT, slope and intercept, and add this additional temperature change to the 2000–2019 mean temperature of the region. This new mean temperature value is then used in the calculation of the mortality of each region from their exposure–response functions (Fig. 2), allowing the exposure–response functions to evolve in the future given a projection of changing local mean temperatures.

Finally, we implement two sensitivity tests of this adaptation approach. In the first test, we calculate analogous scaling factors from observations rather than GCMs, by regressing regional 20-year-running-mean temperature change from E-OBS against HadCRUT global mean temperature anomalies. We then assume that the rate of local mean warming of each region continues linearly into the future. In the second test, we simply assume that the mean temperature of each European region changes by the same amount as the GMT level (that is, we assume a one-to-one scaling between global and local mean temperature). In both cases, we find effects of adaptation that are very similar to our main analysis (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Our analysis incorporates uncertainty from each step in the calculation. First, when estimating the empirical exposure–response functions, we estimate uncertainty by bootstrap resampling 500 times (‘Exposure–response functions' section). We block-bootstrap by country, meaning we preserve temporal correlation within NUTS regions and spatial correlation across regions within countries (akin to clustering standard errors by country). Second, when making counterfactual temperature predictions for historical weather patterns using the machine learning architecture (‘Counterfactual extreme heat events' section), we make 25 different counterfactual event predictions for each extreme heat event at each annual GMT anomaly (making a different prediction for each of five random seeds within each of five different GCMs).

We calculate each final mortality projection 12,500 times (5 × 5 × 500), once for each combination of regression bootstraps, random seeds and GCMs. In the uncertainty decomposition in Fig. 3, we hold two dimensions of uncertainty at their mean values and show all values across the remaining dimension (for example, each of 500 different results for each regression bootstrap while averaging across GCMs and random seeds).

When we incorporate adaptation (‘Adaptation to climate change' section), we pool all model-years and calculate a random sample of 100 pattern scaling coefficients from this pooled sample. Then, in each of the 12,500 mortality calculations, we randomly sample one of these sets of pattern scaling coefficients.

Given the multiple dimensions of uncertainty that we account for, we round each value in the main text to three significant figures to avoid reporting overly precise results.

Anomalies are calculated with respect to each region and day of year. Gray shading shows the periods that we define as each event. Panel (a) shows the July 1994 event, panel (b) shows the August 2003 event, panel (c) shows the July 2006 event, panel (d) shows the June 2019 event, and panel (e) shows the August 2023 event.

Time series of observed (from E-OBS; black solid line), baseline without warming or heat waves (black dashed line), and counterfactual event (red colored lines) temperatures across Europe. Europe-wide temperatures are calculated as the population-weighted average across all subnational regions for which we have temperature data. Gray shading denotes the periods we define as the ‘events'; these dates are originally defined using Europe-wide temperature anomalies (Extended Data Fig. 1) but are shown here for clarity. Panel (a) shows the July 1994 event, panel (b) shows the August 2003 event, panel (c) shows the July 2006 event, panel (d) shows the June 2019 event, and panel (e) shows the August 2023 event. Colored lines show average counterfactuals and shading shows 95% confidence intervals across 25 combinations of GCMs and random seeds.

Each panel shows the regional mortality rate, in deaths per 100,000 population, in the peak week of each counterfactual heat wave at 3 °C. Peak weeks are defined as the week of maximum Europe-wide excess deaths (that is, maximum point in Fig. 3). White regions are those for which we do not have population or mortality data.

Red bars show peak weekly mortality from each set of meteorological conditions (that is, the peaks of the curves in Fig. 3). Bar widths show mean projection and error bars show 95% range. Gray shading shows the deciles of Europe-wide weekly confirmed COVID-19 deaths. For example, the darkest gray shading shows the range of the top 10% of weeks of COVID-19 deaths, the second-to-darkest shading shows the range of the top 10–20% of weeks, and so on.

More than half a century ago, information scientist Derek De Solla Price observed that the scientific literature was growing exponentially, doubling every 10–15 years1. Little did he know that this observation would spawn not just a field of study, but an entire industry devoted to counting, measuring, weighing and indexing every aspect of academic output2. Today, the modern academic doesn't just publish — they generate metrics. They don't just research — they optimize their h-indices. And they certainly don't just think up new ideas — they maximize citation counts while maintaining a favourable paper output.

Ultimately, they produce ‘units of assessment', according to the UK Research Assessment Framework (REF), which the United Kingdom uses to allocate £2 billion (US$2.7 billion) in public research funding across its universities. They don't collaborate; they strategically co-author, to maximize citation networks. And they certainly don't read any more — who has time when there are metrics to massage? 

It began innocently enough. Twenty years ago, physicist Jorge Hirsch at the University of California, San Diego, proposed the h-index. It was elegantly simple: a scholar with an h-index of n has published n papers that have each been cited at least n times3. Hirsch's original paper suggested that “for physics, a value for h of about 10–12 might be a useful guideline for tenure decisions at major research universities”.

Oh, sweet summer child, to quote a popular line from Game of Thrones.

What Hirsch had unleashed was not merely a metric, but a compulsion. Within a decade, the h-index had metastasized across disciplines. And very quickly, rather than a metric, it became a target. Search committees began sorting candidates by h-index; promotion committees set h-index thresholds; graduate students started checking their h-indices with the frequency and anxiety typically reserved for checking a dating app.

But why stop at one number when you could have dozens? The h-index begat the g-index (which gives more weight to highly cited articles)4, which begat the e-index (to account for citations beyond those considered in the h-index), the a-index (to measure the average number of citations in a researcher's top papers) and the m-index (which takes career length into account). There is now the i10-index (the number of publications with at least ten citations), the h-core (the core set of papers considered by the h-index) and the contemporary h-index (which adds a decay function, because apparently citations should have a half-life).

Each new metric arrived with its own justification, its own formula and its own promise to finally capture the true essence of scholarly impact.

To me, metrics are like trying to measure the ocean by counting waves, each new metric promising to quantify them more accurately than the last. The REF, for example, gave us ‘impact case studies' — documents that describe research impact beyond academia. Australia's Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) introduced ‘research quality indicators' to assess research quality across disciplines. The Leiden Manifesto5 actually had to remind us that “quantitative evaluation should support qualitative, expert assessment” — a bit like reminding people that food should be chewed before swallowing. Naturally, these metrics are justified as ensuring accountability to taxpayers, who surely lie awake at night wondering about h-indices rather than, say, whether scientists have cured cancer or explained consciousness.

Meanwhile, the publishers watched and learnt. We now have a panopticon of productivity, in which every citation is counted, every self-citation scrutinized and every collaboration strategically calculated for maximum metric optimization.

I humbly propose a new, maybe-slightly-ironic, metric. This captures what truly matters in academic work: physical heft. I call it the j-index, and its calculation is refreshingly straightforward:

J = W ÷ Y

Where W is the total weight (in kilograms) of all books a scientist has authored, and Y is the number of years since the author earned their doctorate.

Consider the elegant simplicity. No longer must we worry about citation cartels (in which authors cite each others' publications to boost citation counts) or gaming the system through self-citation. The j-index is immune to such manipulation — unless the books are printed on heavy paper stock, which should be discouraged through strict guidelines on acceptable paper weights. On the plus side, no longer will scholars insist on softcover editions: just think how many trees we can save!

No one could accuse Demis Hassabis of dreaming small.

In 2016, the company he co-founded, DeepMind, shocked the world when an artificial intelligence model it created beat the best human player of the strategy game Go. Then Hassabis set his sights even higher: in 2019, he told colleagues that his goal was to win Nobel prizes with the company's AI tools.

Chemistry Nobel goes to developers of AlphaFold AI that predicts protein structures

Chemistry Nobel goes to developers of AlphaFold AI that predicts protein structures

It took only five years for Hassabis and DeepMind's John Jumper to do so, collecting a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for creating AlphaFold, the AI that revolutionized the prediction of protein structures.

AlphaFold is just one in a string of science successes that DeepMind has achieved over the past decade. When he co-founded the company in 2010, Hassabis, a neuroscientist and game developer, says his aim was to make “a world-class scientific research lab, but in industry”. In that quest, the company sought to apply the scientific method to the development of AI, and to do so ethically and responsibly by anticipating risks and reducing potential harms. Establishing an AI ethics board was a condition of the firm's agreement to be acquired by Google in 2014 for around US$400 million, according to media reports.

Now Google DeepMind is trying to replicate the success of AlphaFold in other fields of science. “We're applying AI to nearly every other scientific discipline now,” says Hassabis.

But the climate for this marriage of science and industry has changed drastically since the release of ChatGPT in 2022 — an event that Hassabis calls a “wake-up moment”. The arrival of chatbots and the large language models (LLMs) that power them led to an explosion in AI usage across society, as well as a scramble by a growing number of well-funded competitors to achieve human-level artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Google DeepMind is now racing to release commercial products — including iterations of the firm's Gemini LLMs — almost weekly, while continuing its machine-learning research and producing science-specific models. The acceleration has made doing responsible AI harder, and some staff are unhappy with the firm's more commercial outlook, say several former employees.

All of this raises questions about where DeepMind is headed, and whether it can achieve blockbuster successes in other fields of science.

At Google DeepMind's slick headquarters in London's King's Cross technology hub, gleaming geometric sculptures and the smell of espresso hang in the reception hall. Time is so precious that staff members — thought to number between 500 and 1,000 worldwide — can pick up a scooter to race the few hundred metres from one office to another.

It's a far cry from the humble origins of the company, which sought to build general AI systems by melding ideas from neuroscience and machine learning. “They were absolutely just super geniuses,” says Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist and researcher in AI ethics at the Hertie School in Berlin. “They were these 12 guys that everybody wanted.”

The laboratory pioneered the deep-learning AI technique, which uses simulated neurons to learn associations in data after studying real-world examples, as well as reinforcement learning, in which a model learns by trial, error and reward. After applying these to teach models how to play arcade games1 in 2015 and master the ancient game of Go2 in 2016, DeepMind turned its sights to its first scientific problem — predicting the 3D structure of proteins3 from their constituent amino acids.

Hassabis first came across the puzzle of protein structure as an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, UK, in the 1990s and noted it as being a problem that AI might one day help to solve. AI learning techniques require a database of examples as well as clear metrics of success that guide the model's progress. Thanks to a long-standing database of known structures and an established competition that judged the accuracy of the predictions, proteins had both.

Protein folding ticked a crucial box for Hassabis: it is a ‘root node' problem that, once solved, opens up branches of downstream research and applications. Those kinds of problem “are worth spending five years or ten years on, and loads of computers and researchers”, he says.

What's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution

What's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution

DeepMind released its first iteration of AlphaFold in 2018, and by 2020, its performance far outstripped that of tools from any other team. Today, a spin-off from DeepMind, Isomorphic Labs, is seeking to use AlphaFold in drug discovery. And DeepMind's AlphaFold database of more than 200 million protein-structure predictions has been used in a range of research efforts, from improving bee immunity to disease in the face of global population declines to screening for antiparasitic compounds to treat Chagas disease, a potentially life-threatening parasitic infection4.

Science is not just a source of problems to solve; the firm tries to approach all of its AI development in a scientific way, says Pushmeet Kohli, who leads the company's science efforts. Researchers tend to go back to first principles for each problem and try fresh techniques, he says. Staff members at many other AI firms are more like engineers, applying ingenuity but not doing basic discovery, says Jonathan Godwin, chief executive of the AI firm Orbital Materials in London, who was a researcher at Google DeepMind until the end of 2022.

But replicating the success of AlphaFold will be tough: “Not many scientific endeavours work like that,” says Godwin.

Google DeepMind is throwing its resources at several problems for which it thinks AI could speed development, and which could have “transformative impact”, says Kohli. These include weather forecasting5 and nuclear fusion, which has the potential to become a clean, abundant energy source. The company picks projects through a strict selection process, but individual researchers can choose which to work on and how to tackle a problem, he says. AI models that work on such problems often require specialized data and researchers to program knowledge into them.

One project that shows promise, says Kohli, is AlphaGenome, which launched in June as an attempt to decipher long stretches of human non-coding DNA and predict their possible functions6. But the challenge is harder than for AlphaFold, because each sequence yields multiple valid functions.

Materials science is another area in which the company hopes that AI could be revolutionary. Materials are hard to model because the complex interactions of atomic nuclei and electrons can only be approximated. Learning from a database of simulated structures, DeepMind developed its GNoME model, which in 2023 predicted 400,000 potential new substances7. Now, Kohli says, the team is using machine learning to develop better ways to simulate electron behaviour, ones that are learnt from example interactions rather than by relying on the principles of physics. The end goal is to predict materials with specific properties, such as magnetism or superconductivity, he says. “We want to see the era where AI can basically design any material with any sort of magical property that you want, if it is possible,” he says.

AI models have a variety of known safety issues, from the risk of being used to create bioweapons to the perpetuation of racial and gender-based biases, and these come to the fore when releasing models into the world. Google DeepMind has a dedicated committee on responsibility and safety that works across the company and is consulted at each major stage of development, says Anna Koivuniemi, who runs its ‘impact accelerator', an effort to scour society for areas in which AI could make a difference. Committee members stress-test the idea to see what could go wrong, including by consulting externally. “We take it very, very seriously,” she says.

Another advantage the firm has is that its researchers are pursuing the kind of AI that the world ultimately wants, says Godwin. “People don't really want random videos of themselves being generated and put on a social-media network; they want limitless energy or diseases being cured,” he says.

But DeepMind now has company in the quest to use AI for science. Some firms that started out making LLMs seem to be coming around to Hassabis' vision of AI for science. In the past two months, both OpenAI and the Paris-based AI firm Mistral have created teams dedicated to scientific discovery.

For AI companies and researchers, OpenAI's 2022 release of ChatGPT changed everything. Its success was “pretty surprising to everyone”, says Hassabis.

Heart Rate Irregularity Sounds Bad, but Here's Why You Want a Bit of It

Milliseconds of variability, now detected by fitness watches, can improve well-being

By Lydia Denworth edited by Josh Fischman

Jay Bendt

Earlier this year I got an Oura ring to track the state of my health. Soon I was obsessing over my sleep and activity scores. The reports were generally positive except for one: heart rate variability, or HRV. That's a measure of how much the time between heartbeats changes. Every morning, in bright red, my ring's app singled out HRV and told me: “Pay attention.”

That didn't sound good, although I had no idea why. Before wearable fitness watches, rings and bracelets became so common and started including HRV as a data point, I had never heard of it. Even among heart doctors, its use has been limited. “I don't think HRV is used in day-to-day clinical medical practice,” says Bryan Wilner, an electrophysiologist at the Baptist Health Miami Cardiac and Vascular Institute. “But it's gained a lot more popularity in regular consumers with these noninvasive monitors.”

Suddenly, we are all paying attention to HRV. And as reams of data are collected from hundreds of thousands of people like me, the measure has the potential to become a far more significant tool for diagnosis and therapy, although it isn't there yet.

The average person's heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute when they're at rest, but it fluctuates all day long. Standing up after lying down changes your heart rate, as does jogging or fielding stressful questions at work. The time between beats changes, too, and that's what HRV captures. Unlike arrhythmias, which are potentially dangerous disruptions in the heart's electrical activity, HRV measures the very slight variation in periods—a matter of milliseconds—between consecutive heartbeats, tracked over a few minutes or longer.

“There is no specific [HRV] number for what's bad, what's good.” —Attila Roka, electrophysiologist

Both heart rate and HRV reflect the differing effects of the two branches of the autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system, colloquially known as “fight or flight,” increases heart rate; the parasympathetic, or “rest and digest,” slows it down. Generally, the lower a person's heart rate, the higher their HRV. A high HRV indicates a body that adapts to stressors and can recover more quickly. It's a sign of a balanced autonomic nervous system and a higher level of cardiovascular fitness. Low HRV signals the opposite—that the body is less able to adjust to the ups and downs of life. Stress, anxiety, high blood pressure, inadequate sleep, dehydration and new medicines are among the many things that can lower HRV. Disease can reduce it, too. In people recovering from heart attacks or living with heart failure, low HRV is associated with a higher risk of death and further illness. “HRV is a window into how the autonomic nervous system is interacting with our heart,” Wilner says. Oura states on its app that it flags HRV because it is a sign of stress and recovery.

“There is no specific number for what's bad, what's good,” says Attila Roka, an electrophysiologist at the CHI Health Clinic Heart Institute and an assistant professor at Creighton University in Omaha. Anywhere from roughly 20 to 70 milliseconds is considered within normal range. The measure is highly individual, although it generally goes down with age. Mine hovered around an unusual 14 for weeks, and that's why my ring alerted me.

An electrocardiogram is the gold standard for measuring HRV. Cutting-edge pacemakers and defibrillators monitor it, too, and experts are investigating the use of HRV with heart disease patients to predict the onset of atrial fibrillation (Afib) in time to prevent it, says Pamela Mason, chief of cardiac electrophysiology at UVA Health in Virginia. Afib is an irregular, rapid heart rhythm that can lead to blood clots and other problems. Physicians also use Holter monitors, small devices that patients wear on their chests for a few days, to capture a full picture of cardiac activity, including HRV.

Devices like Apple watches and Oura rings work by looking at pulse fluctuations rather than electrical heart signals. Few studies have examined how accurate these devices are. But what's more important for the average person, experts say, is the relative change over time. “You need to get a baseline HRV,” Wilner says. “HRV is most powerful when you're measuring it over several weeks and can see a graphic trend on how it's being affected by everything that's going on in your life.”

HRV might one day be used to assess mental health. “If you're in a constant fight-or-flight kind of state mentally, you're going to lose heart rate variability,” Mason says. Conditions such as depression and bipolar disorder are likely to be associated with dysregulated nervous system activity. Even among people without medical or psychiatric disorders, studies have found a link between decreasing parasympathetic activity and emotional upset, suggesting HRV tracks psychological states.

Low HRV, in relatively healthy people, does have some remedies. “The best way to improve heart rate variability is exercise,” Mason says, “and it's going to need to be more strenuous than gentle walks.” Pick up the pace to pick up your HRV. Drinking more fluids—water is good—also helps.

For people like me, Mason's advice is to not obsess. Instead consider what you could do to take better care of yourself. Prodded by red HRV alerts, I drank more water and consumed less caffeine, went to bed earlier, and engaged in vigorous exercise more regularly. Since then, my HRV has been higher than 30! Not that I'm obsessing over it.

Gross domestic product (GDP) was never designed to be a measure of societal well-being. It tracks only market transactions, conflates costs and benefits, and ignores the distribution of income, the contributions of household labour and volunteer work, and social and environmental costs and benefits.

In the decades after the Second World War, GDP growth functioned as a reasonable proxy for well-being when rebuilding economies and increasing production and consumption were the main priorities. However, since about 1950, which some call the Anthropocene era, ecological limits, inequality and declining social cohesion have restricted further improvements in well-being. At the same time, the rapid development of artificial intelligence promises fresh opportunities and challenges.

Degrowth can work — here's how science can help

Measuring and modelling what truly matters, not just market transactions, is now essential. Processes are under way to develop indicators that move beyond GDP. In May, the United Nations secretary-general António Guterres appointed a High-Level Expert Group to develop such measures, with a focus on balancing economic, social and environmental dimensions of well-being. This initiative builds on the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): target 19 of SDG17 commits governments to adopt beyond-GDP metrics by 2030.

Yet progress remains slow. Overcoming decades of structures built around GDP is difficult. Nonetheless, several governments, including those of New Zealand, Scotland, Wales and Bhutan, have experimented with alternatives to GDP1 (see also go.nature.com/3ktuvhv). Others should follow suit, but it will be a steep climb.

Shifting all societies from a narrow focus on GDP growth to a comprehensive understanding of the multiple factors that support well-being and prosperity, and of how these factors interact over space and time, demands consensus on another approach2. Over the past seven decades, researchers and institutions have proposed hundreds of alternatives to GDP.

Paradoxically, this proliferation has helped GDP to keep its privileged status, by creating the impression that there is little agreement on what sustainable and inclusive well-being means or how to measure it. In fact, there is much that these approaches do agree on.

Here, we identify areas of common ground and propose four ways forward: universally adopting the goal of sustainable and inclusive well-being; establishing agreed metrics to evaluate progress towards this goal; developing models that incorporate the drivers and dynamics of well-being; and addressing institutionalized societal ‘addictions' that reinforce unsustainable behaviours.

The concept of sustainable and inclusive well-being — encompassing the well-being of all people and of the ecosystems that sustain life — is emerging as a widely accepted overarching policy goal that can provide common ground for beyond-GDP metrics, models and policies.

By assigning a central role to natural ecosystems and planetary boundaries, the concept acknowledges that human prosperity depends on healthy ecological systems. Respecting ecological limits by constraining the material scale of the economy is therefore a precondition for lasting well-being. It also demands that human societies prevent significant harm to other species, protect the rights of future generations and guarantee that all people today have access to essential resources, services and participatory forms of decision-making.

A 2009 report on the measurement of economic performance and social progress, chaired by economist Joseph Stiglitz, laid the groundwork for moving beyond GDP3. Since then, international bodies, including the UN, the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), have progressively adopted this conceptual foundation. Full international enforcement should follow; however, this might depend on a more-receptive US administration and stronger demand from civil society.

Converging on an approach to evaluating sustainable and inclusive well-being is important if policymakers and organizations such as the UN are to embed these measures into official reporting and budgetary processes. Studies suggest that this is possible.

Although more than 200 beyond-GDP indicators have been proposed, they share many similarities. These indicators often use different terminology to describe contributors to sustainable and inclusive well-being4. For example, ‘health' might refer to mental health, physical health, health care, child welfare or any of more than 400 variants. Semantic modelling of the components of each indicator, which looks at the similarity between them, nevertheless reveals a high degree of agreement5. Nineteen key components capture a large proportion of the similarity (see ‘Well-being components').

These 19 core factors are common to most beyond-GDP indicators5.

Researchers and policymakers, led by an international convening body such as the UN, should now establish a core set of around 20 components to serve as the backbone of national statistical reporting and UN frameworks. The UN High-Level Expert Group and the ongoing update of the SDGs are already advancing the agenda. The expert group has committed to an inclusive process that invites contributions from all stakeholders.

Interested parties are encouraged to submit ideas and insights to help strengthen the emerging global consensus (see go.nature.com/4gcebvr). This month, the expert group launched an online consultation about its progress, and is expected to present its recommendations in the first half of 2026, which falls within the 80th session of the UN General Assembly. After this, intergovernmental processes will consider their recommendations.

Other efforts include the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting and the UN System of National Accounts 2025 initiative, which are revising economic accounts to include more well-being components. The 2024 UN Pact for the Future and recommendations from the secretary-general's Our Common Agenda report call for measures of progress that complement GDP. But these efforts need help from researchers and the consensus recommendations of the High-Level Expert Group.

The UN can also play a central part in strengthening institutional capacity and securing stable funding to support the regular production of national estimates. Advances in citizen science, social-media analytics and remote sensing offer opportunities to reduce costs and improve data reliability. The world is awash with big data, so directing even a fraction of these resources towards measuring sustainable and inclusive well-being would enhance global monitoring and policy effectiveness.

GDP has retained its dominance partly because it is embedded in the models that underpin national accounts and policy analyses. For example, the input–output model developed by economist Wassily Leontief6 tracks monetary flows across sectors and into ‘final demand', defined as GDP.

Mainstream macroeconomic models also place growth at the centre of policy evaluation. For example, standard computable general equilibrium models assume a high degree of substitutability among factors of production, implying that labour or technology can largely replace natural resources. They neglect environmental limits and exclude well-being, equity and ecological integrity. Most importantly, they are optimization models that are intended to maximize a single objective — GDP — rather than being designed to evaluate policies against multiple goals, as is required for sustainable and inclusive well-being.

New models are needed. These must be dynamic, nonlinear and represent the economy as a subsystem of society embedded in the biosphere. Such models must be able to compare resource use and pollution to environmental limits, and social outcomes to the thresholds required to meet human needs7. They must track both stocks (natural, human, social and built capital) and flows (including monetary transactions, ecosystem services and social benefits) and capture their interactions, including feedbacks from transgressing environmental limits. Ecological macroeconomic models, rooted in the field of ecological economics, are one promising approach8.

Atmospheric water harvesting technology, which extracts moisture from ambient air to generate water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water production. However, the prohibitively high energy consumption of heat-induced evaporation process of water extraction hinders the technology deployment. Here we demonstrate that vibrational mechanical actuation can be used instead of heat to extract water from moisture harvesting materials, offering about forty-five-fold increase in the extraction energy efficiency. We report the energy consumption for water extraction below the enthalpy of water evaporation, thus breaking the thermal limit of the energy efficiency inherent to the state-of-the-art thermal evaporation and making atmospheric water harvesting technology economically feasible for adoption on scale.

Many communities worldwide are located in arid climate zones and experience a shortage of fresh water resources, which severely inhibits their land development and creates harsh humanitarian conditions for their populations1. More than half of Mexico's national territory lies in the arid and semi-arid climate zones, including the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts, which extend northward into the United States. The Colorado River is drying up at an alarming rate, putting these areas at even higher risk of freshwater shortages. Similarly, in southern Ukraine, desertification of thousands of hectares of fertile steppe land may occur following the breach of the Kakhovka Dam by the Russian army in 2023, with potentially grave consequences for the world food supply. The situation is even more dire in the Middle East, where only three major rivers supply the vast region with fresh water, and where most land areas are arid. In many cases, the climate problems are exacerbated by the economic and security-related ones, which make the costs of the industrial installations for water purification prohibitive for communities in need2,3.

Fortunately, the Earth's atmosphere provides a vast resource of fresh water. Fog harvesting has been ubiquitously practiced by plants, animals, and humans throughout history4,5,6,7,8,9,10. However, the majority of the 12,900 billion tons of fresh water stored in the atmosphere11 is not available as fog, which only forms when the relative humidity (RH) of air approaches 100%. Accordingly, there is a need for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technologies that can operate in arid or semi-arid climates or in regions where large-scale installations are impractical due to economic or security reasons12,13,14,15,16,17,18. These typically fall into two major categories, including (i) active refrigeration technology19,20 to cool air below the dew point and promote condensation20,21,22,23, and (ii) sorption-desorption technology that employs porous hydrophilic sorbents to collect moisture from air, followed by water extraction via the heating-induced evaporation-condensation process12,21,24,25.

However, the former technology is hard to scale down to realize affordable decentralized water production, while the latter one, in its current state of development, exhibits prohibitively high energy consumption associated with the heat-driven process of water desorption from AWH materials. The temperature needed to release the captured water from a sorbent can be as high as 160 °C for conventional desiccants such as silica gel, zeolite, and activated alumina26,27,28. Desorption temperatures of other recently-developed sorbents, including hydrogels15, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)12,21, and anhydrous and hydrated salt couples13 are in the 60 °C–80 °C range, which makes water release an energy-intensive process29,30. Furthermore, all the AWH prototypes demonstrated to date exhibit at least an order of magnitude higher energy consumption than the predicted thermodynamic limit of about 2MJ/kg at 30% RH29. This is a major bottleneck of the sorption-desorption AWH technology, which limits its contribution to the United Nations' 6th Sustainable Development Goals (SDG6)31.

The ongoing efforts to increase water harvesting capability and reduce the energy consumption mostly focus either on engineering more efficient sorbents (i.e., capable of sorbing higher weight of water per gram of material)32,33 or/and on designing autonomous AWH systems that can utilize solar energy12,13,21,33. Since the energy consumption occurs during the desorption process, finding alternative technologies to replace heat-driven evaporation is the key to achieving a breakthrough in the AWH technology feasibility. Recent studies showed that re-engineering the sorbent structure to facilitate water evaporation at lower temperatures, e.g., by incorporating a secondary network of reconfigurable phase-change polymers30, or by combining heating with other external stimuli, such as sunlight or laser illumination can increase the evaporation efficiency, even beyond the thermodynamic limit34.

Here, we propose an alternative method of moisture extraction, which uses vibrational mechanical actuation enabled by piezoelectric materials (Fig. 1, Supplementary Movie 1, Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. S1) to extract water from AWH sorbents. We draw inspiration from prior studies that used piezoelectric actuators35 and Si-based Micro-Electro-Mechanical-system (MEMS)36 for atomization of liquids. We show that this method offers at least a forty-five-fold reduction of the energy needed to extract the same mass of water as the standard evaporation-condensation technique. While demonstrated here for hydrogels, the technique is very general and may be used with other sorbents, including MOFs, superabsorbent fibers and textiles, salts, and desiccants. Since the alternative technology is not based on the heating-induced evaporation, its efficiency is not bound by the thermal limit derived for the conventional desorption process, offering promise for further efficiency improvements.

The black dashed box shows the transducer structure, including an Ag-coated PZT ring topped with a thin layer of water-resistant resin attached to the SS membrane and encased in a silicone elastomeric ring.

Figure 1a illustrates a piezoelectric-ceramic-based single-head ultrasonic actuator used in this study for water extraction from several AWH hydrogels (AWH-Hs). High-voltage-driven lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ring converts applied electrical power into the in-plane displacement of the ring, which in turn causes out-of-plane mechanical oscillation of the steel mesh membrane clamped to the ring. Mechanical oscillation of the membrane is accompanied by the Joule heating caused by ferroelectric hysteresis loss of the PZT material when driven at high frequency37, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. Here, we show that a synergetic impact of the mechanical actuation and device heating facilitates moisture extraction from AWH-Hs, reduces the extraction time, and increases the system energy efficiency. The first prototype device utilizing this water extraction method is shown in Fig. 1c, d.

In Fig. 1e, we plot the energy efficiency of water extraction \(\eta\), which is defined as a ratio of the enthalpy of water vaporization \({h}_{{lv}}\) (\({h}_{{lv}}=2.257{M}{\rm{J}}/{\rm{kg}}\) at 100 °C) and the energy consumption of the device needed for the extraction of a unit mass of water from a sorbent, \(E\) [MJ/kg]: \(\eta={h}_{{lv}}/E\)29,38,39 (see Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Table 4). In an ideal thermal process, where the enthalpy of desorption is identical to the enthalpy of vaporization of water, all the heat provided to the system is used for water evaporation, i.e., \(E={h}_{{lv}}\). In this work, we refer to this ideal thermal process with \(\eta=100\%\) as the thermal limit. In any real thermal water release process, the heat provided is used not only to evaporate water, but also to sensibly heat the system and sorbent, and is partially lost to the ambient, leading to \(\eta < 100\%\). Conversely, an efficient non-thermal extraction method (such as, e.g., vibrational actuation) can have a specific energy consumption lower than the enthalpy of vaporization of water, \({h}_{{lv}}\). Then, the energy efficiency of the water release process can in principle exceed 100%.

Figure 1e compares the efficiency of our device operated with a polyacrylamide and lithium chloride (PAM-LiCl) hydrogel sorbent with that of the-state-of-the-art AWH devices40,41,42,43,44. The extraction efficiency values plotted in Fig. 1e for different systems account for the specific heat of both water and other solids used in the system (i.e., sorbent materials, heaters, enclosures, etc.) as well as heat dissipation losses. Each of the devices in Fig. 1e represents a single-stage system without heat recovery, and thus these efficiency values are all less than 100%. Our device shown in Fig. 1a–d demonstrated energy efficiency of almost 428%, exceeding the state-of-the-art efficiency of 9.5%39,45 by a factor of ~45 (Fig. 1e). In the following, we analyze the performance of the system operated with hydrogel-based sorbents, but the concept is much broader, encompassing a variety of AWH materials and actuator types, and showing a potential to further increase the efficiency.

We synthesized three types of PAM-LiCl AWH hydrogels (see Methods), which incorporate lithium (Li⁺) and chloride ions (Cl⁻) as essential elements for their ability to adsorb water molecules from atmosphere (Fig. 2a)46. Hydrogels had the same salt and polymer content, but different amounts of N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) crosslinker, and thus exhibited different crosslinking densities. Hydrogels labeled HG-A, HG-B, and HG-C had crosslinker-to-monomer mass ratios of 0.1, 0.5, and 10 mg/g, respectively. HG-A had very low rigidity, while HG-C could stand on its own outside a Petri dish without collapsing (Fig. 2b). As a result, HG-A hydrogel demonstrated greater resistance to tearing when manually stretched, in contrast to the more rigid HG-C, which can be torn easily (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Movie 2). The differences in the hydrogels micro-structure and surface morphology are revealed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, with HG-A exhibiting a low-density structure (Fig. 2d) and HG-C (Fig. 2e)—a more compact one. We also included in our study a commercial hydrogel (a cross-linked glycerol- 2-Acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid sodium salt hydrogel), and labeled it HG-M.

Scale bars: 12 mm (b); 24 mm (c), 200 µm (d); 300 µm (e).

The four types of AWH-Hs were compared by their elastic storage moduli (see Methods), which provide a measure of how much energy is stored in the material when it is subjected to a periodically oscillating load, and their loss moduli, which measure the material's ability to dissipate applied stress through heat (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Figs. S2-S3). The progressively higher storage moduli of hydrogels with higher MBA content validate the strategy of engineering sorbents with desired mechanical properties by varying the density of chemical crosslinks47. All the PAM-LiCl sorbents exhibited loss moduli lower than their storage moduli, and thus the resultant phase shift between the mechanical deformation and the sorbent material response, \(\tan \delta=G{\prime} {\prime} /G{\prime} < 1\). This indicates the elasticity and ability of these materials to bounce back to their original shape as long as the applied deformation is below their yield point48. These data are similar to those previously reported for salt-free PAM hydrogels49, suggesting that the high salt content does not play a major role in their mechanical properties, which are mostly controlled by the polymer crosslinking density. In turn, the commercial hydrogel (HG-M) exhibited higher values of storage and loss moduli as well as \(\tan \delta\) value, thus demonstrating higher mechanical strength than PAM-LiCl AWH-Hs, but slightly lower elasticity.

Figure 2g shows that all three PAM-LiCl AWH-Hs exhibit high water uptake in different environments, from arid to very humid, between 15 and 85% RH (see Supplementary Movie 3 for water harvesting at ~15% RH). This is consistent with recent reports on PAM-based hydrogels and hygroscopic PAM-LiCl composite hydrogels exhibiting a large capability to capture moisture30,32. Water harvesting capacity at the same RH level is similar for all the PAM-LiCl AWH-Hs regardless of their crosslinking density32,50,51. In contrast, the commercial HG-M did not demonstrate any water sorption capability at low RH (15 and 30%).

The goal of the study is to use a piezoelectric actuator to generate and transmit a pressure wave into the AWH hydrogels to facilitate water extraction. To optimize the actuator geometry and performance, several candidate devices were evaluated. Based on prior literature for water atomization, we targeted a resonance frequency in the 100-160 kHz range35,36,52,53. Four piezoelectric ultrasound transducers with resonance frequencies ranging from ~107–115 kHz to ~165 KHz were designed and analyzed (Supplementary Fig. S4). Three devices had similar geometry but differed by the size of micro-nozzles perforated in their metallic membranes. The fourth device (PZ-D) had a comparatively lower diameter to thickness aspect ratio, ensuring higher ( ~ 165KHz) resonance frequency (see Supplementary Table 1). All the four devices demonstrated comparable piezoelectric coefficients (\({d}_{33}=\sim 435-440{\rm{pC}}/{\rm{N}}\)), which were measured using “quasi-static” or “Berlincourt” method, employing a static force sensor and piezoelectric meter (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. S5). The piezoelectric charge coefficient, denoted as \({d}_{33}\), is determined by applying a unit stress in the direction 3 (i.e., z-axis) that induces polarization in direction 3 (i.e., in the same direction as the polarization of the ceramic element).

All four devices were designed such that the diameter of the piezoelectric ceramic ring was at least ten times larger than its thickness (\(d > 10t\)) to maximize their displacement amplitude54. The efficiency of the piezoelectric devices in converting electric energy into mechanical energy was evaluated by their effective electromechanical coupling coefficients (\({k}_{{\rm{eff}}}\))55,56, which were found to be around 0.19 for the low-frequency devices and 0.17 for the high-frequency device (Supplementary Fig. S6). The rest of the electrical power is dissipated as heat, leading to some temperature increase of the actuator and AWH-H sorbents.

First, the nozzle size was varied to improve water extraction through the membrane without degrading the resonant behavior of the actuator, as resonance frequencies of piezoelectric devices are sensitive to variations in the membrane mass and stiffness57. PZ-A, PZ-B, and PZ-C devices were designed to each have 1000 nozzles with diameters of 10, 70, and 100 µm, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7). Figure 3a compares the water conductance through the membranes with different nozzle sizes measured using a forward-osmosis (FO) configuration (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. S8). The water transport rate through the PZ-C membrane was found to be the highest, owing to its larger nozzle size.

Here and in (b,c), the data for membranes in PZ-A, PZ-B, and PZ-C transducers with nozzle sizes of 10, 70, and 100 µm are color-coded as orange, pink, and blue, respectively. PZ-D actuator had the same nozzles as PZ-A. b,c Deflection amplitudes (b) and corresponding RMS velocities (c) of the four transducers subjected to a sinusoidal input signal at 1 Vpp measured at resonant frequencies of ~110 KHz for PZs A, B, and C, and ~165 kHz for PZ-D. d Experimental modal analysis of the porous membrane attached to the ring of PZ-C transducer at 1 Vpp actuation. e–g The deflection maps across the PZ-C membrane at frequencies of 110 KHz (e), 89 (f), and 115 KHz (g) measured by a PICOSCALE vibrometer under 1 Vpp (0.35 Vrms) sinusoidal signal input. h Simulated (COMSOL Multiphysics®) displacement and velocities of the PZ-C membrane plate under higher voltages. i,j The simulated (i) and measured (j) impedance spectra of the PZ-C actuator.

AWH-Hs are actuated by the motion of the free-standing portion of the membrane that is not clamped to the PZT ring (Fig. 1a), and both the magnitude and velocity of its movement need to be maximized for efficient extraction. The diameters of these areas measured 7.8 mm for PZ-A, B, C actuators, and 5 mm for the PZ-D device. Figure 3b compares the maximum displacement amplitudes measured within the nozzle areas (M) of the membranes and the peripheral nozzle-free (P) areas, while Fig. 3c shows the corresponding RMS values of the deflection velocity. The transducers operating at lower frequencies (PZs-A, B, C) exhibit larger amplitude and velocity, both within the nozzle area and the periphery, compared to the higher-frequency device (PZ-D). For all the devices, the displacement amplitudes and velocities are higher in the center than on the periphery, as expected. PZ-C actuator membrane exhibited the largest displacements and RMS velocities. We attribute this to the larger nozzle diameter, which reduced the weight of the membrane, lowered its inertia, and modified its vibrational modes spectrum, leading to better coupling between the piezo oscillations and the membrane vibrations.

The resonant spectra of the membranes integrated in the actuators were measured by using a vibrometer at 1 Vpp (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Figs. S9-S10). Experimentally mapped vibrational mode profiles of the PZ-C membrane at its three dominant frequencies (89, 110, and 115 KHz) are shown in Fig. 3e–g. Supplementary Movies 4-5 and Supplementary Figs. S11-S12 visualize spatial amplitude and phase distributions of these vibrational modes. The actuation voltage of 1 Vpp was used for the above measurements to prevent the displacement amplitude over-range, as the vibrometer is not capable of detecting displacements larger than half-wavelength in magnitude (\(\lambda /2=775{\rm{nm}}\)). However, during the desorption process, the device is actuated by a much larger voltage of ~114 Vpp using an amplifier with a high gain to boost the signal strength. To evaluate the displacement and velocity of the PZ-C actuator membrane at its operational voltage, we simulated the device performance via finite-element modeling with the COMSOL Multiphysics software (Fig. 3h). Modeling predicts that both the membrane displacement and the speed grow linearly with applied voltage, reaching the values of 111 µm and 77 m/s, respectively, at 70 V.

The simulated spectrum of the PZ-C device (Fig. 3i) exhibits a characteristic Fano feature with the resonance (107 KHz) and anti-resonance (109 KHz) frequencies, which is in good agreement with the corresponding spectrum measured experimentally in the fabricated PZ-C device (Fig. 3j). The measured spectra for devices PZ-A, PZ-B and PZ-D are shown in Supplementary Fig. S13. The resonance frequency of device PZ-D was measured to be around 170 ± 5 KHz.

Finally, our finite-element simulations of the PZ-C membrane oscillations (see Methods) reveal the vibrational mode pattern forming under the piezo actuation and predict the values of M displacement (790 nm) (Supplementary Fig. S14) and corresponding velocity (0.54 m/s) (Supplementary Fig. S15) at 1 Vpp, which is in reasonable agreement (within the order of magnitude) with their experimentally measured counterparts (i.e., 373 nm and 0.18 m/s, respectively).

Figure 4a illustrates an actuator, which includes a PZT ring and a membrane and acts both as a mechanical transducer and as a Joule heater. To analyze and optimize the extraction process, the AWH-H samples were soaked in the DI water and placed on top of the membrane (Fig. 4b, c and Supplementary Fig. S16). We first used a commercial hydrogel (HG-M) to evaluate the efficiency of water extraction and to establish an optimum experimental protocol of sorbent actuation. To visually capture the water extraction process, a green laser was focused across the path of the ejected water droplets, and photographs were captured using the burst mode of a digital camera with the shutter speed of 1/30th of a second (Fig. 4b, c). These experiments revealed that—differently from the conventional evaporation-driven extraction process—water is released in the liquid form, although droplets large enough to be captured by our camera are visually observable for only a few seconds after the onset of piezo actuation.

The energy consumption is calculated and listed for each curve in (d–f) and (h,i).

We conducted four series of experiments to evaluate the role of the sorbent size, weight, moisture content, and nozzle size as well as the actuation frequency on the water extraction efficiency (Fig. 4d–f and Supplementary Fig. S17). First, HG-M samples of 3 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness were submerged in DI water for of 30, 60, and 120 s, respectively. The samples were weighed before being positioned in the center of the mesh membrane of a PZ-A actuator (7.8 mm diameter and 10 µm nozzle size). The wet samples having initial weights of 0.06, 0.07 and 0.11 g, respectively, were exposed to piezoelectric stimulation for 10 minutes, and their weight loss is reported in Fig. 4d as a function of time. The heaviest sample exhibited the best performance in terms of energy consumption (9.8 MJ/kg), about 35% lower than 15 MJ/kg value measured for the samples with lower moisture content. We attribute the observed improvement to the better contact between the vibrating mesh membrane and a heavier specimen.

Second, we studied the effects of both sorbent mass and geometry by testing specimens of varying sizes under the same actuation protocol. Samples with diameters of 3, 6, and 9 mm and thicknesses of 1 mm were submerged in DI water for 120 s each, and their weight loss kinetics under actuation are reported in Fig. 4e. The largest and heaviest ( ~ 0.4 g loaded weight) sample exhibited the lowest energy consumption of 4.8 MJ/kg. The plots in Fig. 4d, e indicate that (i) the energy consumption per unit mass of extracted water does not always correlate positively with the percentage of the sample weight loss under actuation, (ii) higher efficiency is achieved when the sample fully covers the actuator membrane, and (iii) heavier samples with higher moisture content exhibit higher energy efficiency. This suggests that the optimum sample weight (achieved for a certain geometry and moisture content) needs to be found to minimize the energy consumption, as extra-heavy samples can dampen the membrane vibrations, reducing extraction efficiency.

Third, we compared the extraction efficiency achieved by using different actuator membrane geometries (Supplementary Fig. S17). As expected, the PZ-C actuator with the nozzle size of ~100 µm demonstrated lower energy consumption (7.7 MJ/kg) than PZ-A (16.6 MJ/kg), while PZ-B actuator with the nozzle size of ~70 µm had performance similar to that of PZ-C. The increased energy efficiency of PZ-C actuator can likely be attributed not only to the higher diffusion rates (Fig. 3a) but also to the larger membrane displacement and higher velocity (Fig. 3b, c).

Finally, piezo actuators operating at different frequencies, PZ-C (107 KHz) and PZ-D (165 KHz) with similar nozzle numbers and sizes, were used to extract moisture from HG-M samples of 3 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness, after they were submerged in DI water for 60 s. PZ-D actuator exhibited the highest energy consumption of 25.2 MJ/kg, indicating that the operating frequency plays a very important role in the water release process.

For all the experiments in Fig. 4d–i, the piezo actuator was driven by using a miniaturized and portable printed circuit board (PCB) electronic driver system at a constant ~70% duty cycle (defined as the ratio of the time during which the system is in an activated state (ON) and the overall duration of each cycle that comprises a series of ON-OFF cycles). Our modeling predicts that the axisymmetric displacement and velocity in the out-of-plane vibrations of the membrane at an applied voltage of 40 Vrms or ~114 Vpp reach ~60 µm and ~45 m/s, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S18). At the same time, infrared imaging (see Methods) reveals that the actuator can exhibit a temperature rise of >20 °C within 60 s while working at 70% duty cycle and 1.5 W supplied power applying ~114 Vpp (Fig. 4g). It returns to the ambient temperature within a comparable time frame after actuation stops (Supplementary Fig. S19). This fast increase in temperature facilitates desorption of water from hydrogels50, and the combined effect of fast temperature rise and hydrogel vibration synergistically drive quick and efficient water release.

The rate of water extraction and the energy consumption of the piezo-actuation and Joule heating methods are compared in Fig. 4h, i. Both the Joule heater (a bare stainless-steel membrane) and the piezo actuator were powered with 1.5 W, and the weight loss process of DI water-loaded HG-Ms was measured for a period of 10 min. The samples were actuated for 1 min-long intervals and weighed after each minute, with both the weight loss and its derivative plotted in Fig. 4h, i. The bottom panels of Fig. 4h, i show the temperatures of the membranes measured by K-type thermocouple sensors, which were deliberately kept at the same level by choosing the 1 min-long actuation periods (see Methods). The piezo-actuated specimen regained its original weight within a span of 7 minutes under piezo actuation at 42 °C (Fig. 4h). In contrast, the sample subjected to water evaporation via Joule heating did not regain its initial dry weight even after 10 min at 41 °C (Fig. 4i). These data also revealed that the piezo-driven extraction consumed a significantly lower amount of energy (7 MJ/kg), a reduction of approximately 74% compared to the Joule-heater-induced evaporation (28 MJ/kg). A piezo actuation duty cycle can be further optimized to mitigate the generation of heat and increase efficiency58.

It is important to ensure that the sorbent maintains its structural integrity under a combination of mechanical and heat stimuli during the water extraction process. The inspection of HG-M specimens and the piezo membrane after multiple tests showed no visible damage on the hydrogel and no significant material residue left on the membrane, as evidenced by the SEM image (Supplementary Fig. S20). The very few nozzles that appeared jammed were easily cleared by rinsing the membrane with DI water, thereby enabling its repetitive utilization. Surface topography scans of the membrane also revealed a relatively even terrain (Supplementary Figs. S21-S22).

We used a hydrophone to measure the transmittance and attenuation of the ultrasound wave emitted from the actuator (see Supplementary Fig. S23) and passing through the hydrogel55 (Fig. 5a). Figure 5b illustrates the signal captured by the hydrophone while it is in contact with the hydrogel when the actuator is driven periodically, ON for 10 s, OFF for 5 s (see also Supplementary Movie 6). These measurements revealed increased acoustic wave attenuation in thicker hydrogel samples (as expected59) and for hydrogels with higher storage moduli (Fig. 5c). The HG-C hydrogel, with 100 times higher crosslinker content than HG-A, exhibits a much higher storage modulus and about the same loss modulus (\({G}_{A}^{{\prime} }=1098,{G}_{A}^{{\prime} {\prime} }=240;{G}_{C}^{{\prime} }=2855,{G}_{C}^{{\prime} {\prime} }=241\)), translating into higher attenuation of the ultrasound wave (Fig. 5c). HG-M hydrogel demonstrated a similar trend of the output voltage decrease with the increased thickness and stiffness (Supplementary Fig. S24). The COMSOL-simulated 2D image of the actuator-hydrogel system is shown in the inset for HG-A. It shows the high-intensity sound pressure level at the hydrogel-actuator interface, which attenuates away from the actuator surface. These observations are in agreement with prior studies of medical-grade hydrogels60.

Scale bar: 16 mm.

Next, we compared the extraction efficiency of HG-A and HG-C samples with comparable weight (0.2 and 0.19 g, respectively) and equal moisture content equilibrated at ~80% RH (Fig. 5d, e). HG-A exhibited a higher weight loss of ~22% and energy consumption of ~12 MJ/kg under the 10-minute-long stimulation by the PZ-C actuator with ~114 Vpp and 70% duty cycle, while HG-C lost only ~12% of its weight and exhibited a much higher energy consumption of 21 MJ/kg under the same conditions. We fit the experimental data by using the Korsmeyer-Peppas (K-P) kinetic model, which establishes an exponential dependence of the fractional mass release on time \(t\) (see Methods): \(m(t)/{m}_{0}=k{{\rm{e}}}^{{nt}}\)61,62 (Fig. 5f). This model is commonly employed to analyze the release mechanism of pharmaceutical drugs from polymers, when more than one release phenomena are involved (\(k\) is a constant incorporating the sample structural and geometric characteristics, and the value of release exponent \(n\) quantifies the release process). The fitted values of the release exponent \(n\) were \(0.65\pm 0.1\) for HG-A \(0.82\pm 0.1\) for HG-C, indicating a swelling-controlled diffusion mechanism, rather than the Fickian (static) diffusion with \(n=0.45\)63.

The non-Fickian (dynamic) behavior observed in our experimental data can be characterized as an anomalous diffusion, and indicates the presence of an additional molecular relaxation process under a combined action of ultrasound, mechanical pressure, and heat64. A similar anomalous diffusion is observed for the ultrasound-triggered release of antibiotics from hydrogel carriers65. The ANOVA tests indicate that there is no statistically significant variance (\(p > \alpha=0.05\)) between the \(n\)-values of the K-P model fitting for HG-A and HG-C samples (Supplementary Fig. S25). However, a higher fitted n value for HG-C suggests that, owing to its high modulus, the water release mechanism in this hydrogel deviates further from the Fickian behavior than that in HG-A, translating into higher energy consumption. Supplementary Fig. S26 reveals the differences in the evolution of vibrational modes associated with both water molecules and polymer functional groups like methylene (-CH2-) and amino group (-NH2) during the sorption-desorption cycle, which underlie the differences in the relaxation process dynamics of hydrogels of varying stiffness.

To quantify synergistic and separate impacts of Joule heating and mechanical actuation on moisture extraction, we measured the moisture extraction rate in a cycle of periodic activation and deactivation of the PZ-C piezo-actuator (Fig. 5g, h). The plots reveal a persistent reduction of AWH-H weight even during the actuator off time periods, which indicates a temperature-driven water vapor release due to the high vapor pressure of the water in the hydrogel51. With this hybrid approach, we further increased extraction efficiency and reduced the energy consumption (to 10.2 MJ/kg and 12.4 MJ/kg for HG-A and HG-B, respectively). These data also reveal that increased mechanical rigidity of hydrogels reduces the rate of water release not only during the ultrasonic actuation but also by evaporation. The thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that when exposed to the same heating under the same environmental conditions, the stiffer HG-B and HG-C specimens released less moisture than HG-A (Supplementary Fig. S27). Despite the differences in the extraction efficiency, both HG-A and HG-C hydrogel samples exhibited consistent absorption and desorption cycles, indicating cyclic stability (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Fig. S28), while the intermediate-stiffness HG-B samples exhibited unstable performance (Supplementary Fig. S29) and were excluded from further analysis.

Comparative analysis of the data in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5d–i suggests that the water extraction process can be further improved by the duty cycle and sample size optimization. We used our complete assembled system shown in Fig. 1c-d (see also Supplementary Fig. S30 and Supplementary Movie 7) to probe extraction efficiency from HG-A and HG-C specimens of varying moisture content. HG-A specimens were equilibrated at 77% RH, and then actuated for 25 min with a duty cycle of ~30–32%, equivalent to 8.75 min of piezo actuation time. These experiments revealed the reduction of energy consumption down to 5.25 MJ/kg for a medium-heavy ( ~ 1.73 g) sample, which covers the entire surface of the membrane. Similarly, for HG-C hydrogel, the optimized energy consumption of 6.2 MJ/kg was achieved with a ~ 1.65 g specimen (Supplementary Figs. S31-32 and Supplementary Movie 7). Accordingly, the duty cycle needs to be optimized for environmental conditions, to compromise between the water harvesting amount per day and the corresponding energy consumption per unit mass of water.

To further optimize the system performance, we (i) reduced the actuation time to 2 min, (ii) performed a test using three identical actuators and samples simultaneously under 2 min extraction cycles (Supplementary Figs. S33-35), and (iii) tested a single large HG-A sample with a diameter of 34 mm under multiple consecutive 2 min extraction cycles (Fig. 6a, b). Under these optimized conditions, during each 2-minute-long extraction cycle in each of the tests, energy consumption was recorded to be below the thermal limit of 2.25 MJ/kg66, thus yielding extraction efficiency in excess of 100% (see Supplementary Note 5 for detail). Average energy consumption of 0.535 MJ/kg (corresponding to 428% efficiency) has been measured over ten 1 h-long sorption cycles run at 75% RH, separated by eleven 2 min-long ultrasonic extraction cycles (Fig. 6a). Figure 6a shows the extracted water mass and energy consumption for each extraction cycle. The lowest energy consumption of 0.47 MJ/kg (corresponding to 481% efficiency) was recorded during several cycles shown in Fig. 6a.

a, b Comparison of two strategies for water extraction from a large HG-A specimen ( >16 mm diameter): ten 1 h sorption cycles separated by 2 min- extraction periods (a) and 25 cycles of repeated 2 min extraction periods following one 24 h-long sorption cycle (b).c A comparative analysis of energy consumption between actuator-enabled water extraction and the state-of-the-art thermally driven evaporation process42. Here, si_l = a single device actuated over a long period; ar_l = an array device actuated over a long period; si_s = a single device actuated over a short period; ar_s = an array device actuated over a short period; si_s_m = a single device actuated over multiple short periods. d A comparative analysis of the daily water yield between the current work and previously reported state-of-the art AWH devices (the data is summarized in Supplementary Table 7). e, f Dynamic changes of HG-A (e) and HG-C (f) samples monitored in-situ through impedance-phase angle spectroscopy. g A schematic illustration of the machine learning model training on the measured impedance and phase angle data. The model uses a deep neural network for classification, which is shown in the confusion matrix.

In contrast, when the 2 min actuation cycles have been run consecutively, without allowing for the sorption period in between, the energy consumption progressively increased with the cycle number, while the amount of the extracted water reduced. The lowest average energy consumption of 0.336 MJ/kg (corresponding to 671.1% efficiency) has been recorded for the first extraction cycle from the largest 34 mm-diameter sample (Fig. 6b). Both, energy consumption and extracted water mass values plateaued after about 20 extraction cycles equivalent to 40 min of continued actuation (Fig. 6b).

Figure 6c summarizes the extraction efficiencies recorded under different actuating cycles and with different sorbent samples described above and compares these values to those of the highest-efficiency AWH setups reported in prior literature. Recent thermodynamic models of thermally-driven atmospheric water extraction predict the highest realistic thermal efficiency of 60%, corresponding to thermal energy consumption to 3.75 MJ/kg45. Real-world devices demonstrate even lower efficiencies, with the highest recorded efficiency of 10%67, and the currently achieved minimum energy consumption of 22.5 MJ/kg. In stark contrast, the average energy consumption and efficiency over ten sorption-extraction cycles were measured to be 0.535 MJ/kg and 428%, respectively (Fig. 6c), because the ultrasonic extraction process is not fundamentally restricted by the thermal limit inherent to evaporation-driven techniques.

The data in Fig. 6a shows that by using ultrasound desorption mechanism, the total daily water yield is almost entirely constrained by the sorption rate. PAM-LiCl hydrogels used in this work adsorb the same amount of moisture from air with 75% RH in 40 min as can be extracted by piezo actuation in 2 min. We can estimate the daily yield of water that can be harvested from a scaled-up system with a 1-m2 sorbent area [L/m²/day] by extrapolating the results of cyclic sorption-desorption testing of a single prototype device with a large sorbent over 10 h at 75% RH, i.e., by using the data shown in Fig. 6a. This simple scaling strategy assumes that multiple identical actuators with hydrogel samples identical to those used in our study are deployed in the form of a two-dimensional (2D) horizontal array with the total area of the sample surface equal to 1 m2. We further assumed that each actuator is powered separately and the energy consumption per device is the same as measured in our experiments. Under such assumptions, the average daily productivity value is predicted to be ~3.25 L/m²/day and an average energy consumption of 0.576 MJ/kg (Supplementary Note 5).

It should be emphasized that ultrasonic extraction does not require exposing sorbent surface to sunlight. Accordingly, AWH devices can be stacked vertically on top of each other with no limitation in principle to the number of vertical rows. Adding more 2D device arrays by stacking them vertically will increase the yield by 3.25 L day⁻¹ per each row without increasing the installation horizontal footprint. For instance, using an installation with 5 vertical rows of devices, the productivity of our system can be increased fivefold to 16.25 L day⁻¹ per m2 of land footprint. Figure 6d and Supplementary Table 7 compare the estimated productivity of our system with those of previously reported AWH materials and systems. Replacing PAM-LiCl hydrogels with sorbents exhibiting higher sorption rate (such as e.g., a hygroscopic interconnected porous gel68) can further increase daily yield.

Vertical stacking or vertical arrangement of sorbents have already been used in the state-of-the-art AWH systems with thermal extraction to increase per-m2 yield68,69. However, except for the vertically oriented sorbent setup employing integrated Joule heaters69, such installations require either manual batch processing of sorbent layers or conveyor-belt-like rotating sorbents to achieve solar exposure for thermal extraction.

Remarkably, the lowest energy consumption of 0.336 MJ/kg (0.09 kWh/kg) per a single cycle measured in this work (Fig. 6b) is not only below the ideal thermal limit, but also below the dewing limit at 75% RH. Dewing limit defines the ideal minimum energy consumption of conventional dehumidification technologies, which cool air to its dewing point to promote water condensation (Supplementary Note 6). At 75% RH and ambient temperature of 25 °C, the minimum energy required for dewing is 0.58 MJ/kg (0.16 kWh/kg).

Our preliminary technoeconomic analysis of the scaled-up system performance indicates the viability of commercializing our system. The estimated cost of water extracted from air at 75% RH is 0.19 $/L, which is lower than the cost of bottled water in various countries worldwide, including USA, UK, Canada and Australia (see Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Figs. S36-37). Supplementary Fig. 37a illustrates that—owing to the low cost of hydrogel—its lifespan does not have a noticeable effect on the water costs, while Supplementary Fig. 37b shows the estimated water costs as a function of the device lifespan in the range from 1 to 45 years.

Given the observed dependence of the extraction energy efficiency on the sample moisture content, in-situ monitoring and dynamic optimization of the sorption-extraction cycle under variable environmental conditions could help to improve the system performance during the field operation. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) may be used to monitor the changes in the sorbent properties (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. S26, and Supplementary Table 3), but it cannot be deployed for continuous in-situ monitoring. Fortunately, the piezoelectric actuator itself can be used not only for moisture extraction but also for real-time process monitoring. Piezoelectric materials exhibit both direct and inverse piezoelectric effects, translating into their ability to either convert applied force into measurable electric quantity or convert electric potential into quantifiable displacement, respectively70. By taking advantage of the direct piezoelectric effect, the actuator can be used as an in-situ sensor71,72. This sensing capability is illustrated in Fig. 6e, f, which show changes in the impedance ( | Z | , Ω) and phase angle ( | θ | , o) of a PZ-C actuator loaded with either HG-A or HG-C hydrogel during the process of atmospheric moisture adsorption at ~20% RH and 20 °C.

To evaluate the potential of using this sensing modality for continuous in-situ monitoring and control of the sorption process, we developed a deep learning model and demonstrated its capability to recognize absorption patterns of different hydrogels (Fig. 6g). Impedance variations datasets were collected during atmospheric moisture absorption cycles at ~20% RH and 20 °C. We used 77% of all the datasets for training and the rest 23% for testing. Following 200 epochs of training, the model successfully classified the impedance data and was able to distinguish between absorption patterns of HG-A and HG-C hydrogels, achieving an impressive prediction accuracy of 100% as shown in the confusion matrix (Fig. 6g). This monitoring and classification capability shows promise in designing fully automated systems that can switch from sorption to extraction once the optimum conditions are reached. Combining embedded sensing capability with deep learning tools for real-time data classification will allow for identifying abnormalities in the system performance and adjusting the system operation to the changes in the environment.

This study demonstrated moisture extraction by vibrational actuation with high efficiency from two different hydrogel systems. These results give reason to expect that ultrasound actuation can facilitate moisture extraction from other sorbents. This hypothesis is independently supported by literature evidence on increased drying rate of textiles73, seaweed74, and zeolite75 under ultrasonic actuation. Each material system would need to be evaluated separately under optimized actuation conditions, moisture content, and sorbent geometry, which will be the subject of our future work. Under this non-thermal extraction scenario, the kinetics of both the sorption and desorption processes under the optimized vibrational actuation for each type of sorbent will play an important role.

Accordingly, the known sorbents, including various types of hydrogels, metal-organic frameworks, micro- and nano-fiber mats, and combinations thereof, will need to be re-evaluated and re-engineered to enhance their compatibility with the alternative extraction method. Internal nano- and micro-scale structure of sorbents will further play an important role in the efficiency of this process and needs to be investigated (e.g., size and shape of the pores, surface-to-volume ratio, stiffness, etc). The overall shape of the sorbent sample can be engineered to provide acoustic resonances matched to the actuator driving frequencies. Finally, each sorbent may exhibit its overall highest efficiency when actuated not only by a different frequency but also around a different point in its sorption curve, calling for further fundamental studies and optimization efforts.

Scaling up this alternative extraction technology will necessitate further research into ultrasound-induced degradation of various sorbent materials. The robustness, cyclic stability, and efficacy for long term water harvesting capability of PAM-LiCl HG-A hydrogel composites have been previously demonstrated in numerous works30,32,46. Our initial lab-scale testing confirms that these sorbents maintain structural integrity after multiple piezo actuation cycles, as evidenced by absence of any traces of polymer residue in collected water filtered by a VWR filter paper (see Supplementary Notes 5,8). Our observations and spectroscopic analyses (Supplementary Fig. S26) also agree with prior independent studies of polymers and hydrogels subjected to piezo actuation, which have demonstrated resilience to vibrational deformations76,77 and self-healing performance78. Similarly, in this work, we did not observe any material degradation or performance loss of either HG-A or HG-M hydrogels during multiple actuation cycles (Fig. 6a, b and Supplementary Figs. S28 and S35). The degradation resistance of other sorbents will need to be evaluated separately. Some may prove incompatible with this method of extraction, others may need to be re-engineered to improve their mechanical properties so they can withstand vibrational forces over many regeneration cycles.

It should also be noted that a traditional photothermal method of moisture extraction from sorbents also causes their accelerated degradation. For example, solar radiation causes rapid UV-triggered photooxidative degradation of polymers via chain scission and formation of free radicals79,80, which for some polymers is further accelerated in the presence of moisture and at higher temperatures81,82,83. Prior studies demonstrated that 368 nm UV irradiation can effectively degrade hydrogels84. Likewise, MOFs may also deteriorate under UV and sunshine exposure85. Even when the sorbents themselves are not directly exposed to sunlight during the moisture extraction process, long exposure of solar absorbers and constructional elements of the AWH system to sunlight, high temperatures, and moisture accelerate their ageing. Long-term studies of sorbent degradation under various stimuli (sunlight, moisture swings, temperature swings, and ultrasound signals) will need to be done for any sorbent considered for outdoor AWH operation to evaluate their lifetimes under different operational scenarios in real-life applications.

The manufacturer-indicated lifespan of piezoelectric actuators used in this study86 is 45 years. In prior studies, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory conducted life testing on commercial piezoelectric PZT actuators, pre-stressed to 18 MPa, for up to 100 billion cycles over 580 days, revealing no discernible damage or substantial performance decline87. Several strategies can be additionally implemented to preserve long lifespans of actuators used in AWH systems. A waterproof silicon-based membrane may replace the metal membrane in the actuator used in this study, maintaining a comparable displacement and velocity profile52. Silicon coating over metallic or other corrosion-prone elements can be used to enhance corrosion resistance88. Alternatively, corrosion-resistant ultrasonic transducers can be used, e.g., those based on monocrystal fibers89,90 or on hydrophobic polymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)91.

Salt-containing sorbents like the LiCl-infused hydrogels HG-A,B, and C used in this work may present additional challenges associated with water extraction in the liquid form under ultrasonic actuation. Measured Li ion concentration in the extracted water varied between 1.5 and 15.2 ppm (or mg/L), comparable to the concentrations measured a recent study of bottled water in multiple countries (see Supplementary Note 7). While there are no regulatory thresholds for lithium either in the USA or globally, our future work will focus on the synthesis and testing of Li-free sorbents with high water uptake to limit the risk of water contamination and to reduce the cost of the technology. It is important to emphasize that the alternative extraction methodology is equally applicable to Li-free hydrogels (such as e.g., HG-M gels shown in this work) and is expected to be fully compatible with other previously demonstrated sorbents that do not contain salts.

In our devices, we estimate the energy consumption to be roughly equally divided between the mechanical actuation (49%) and heating (51%), see Supplementary Note 10. The parasitic heat generated by a piezo actuator is used to heat a sorbent, and still contributes to the water extraction, but with lower efficiency than mechanical actuation. The effective electromechanical coupling coefficients of our prototype actuators was quite low, ranging from 17 to 19%. By designing a 1-3 composite piezoelectric transducer array device instead of a single ring-shaped actuator, an electromechanical coupling coefficient of 35% can be achieved92. High-efficiency single-crystal piezoelectric materials exhibit even significantly higher electromechanical coupling factors, which can be complemented by the optimized transducer array design, promising further efficiency enhancement.

Furthermore, arraying small devices is not the most efficient way of scaling the system up, which likely overestimates the daily energy consumption while underestimating the energy efficiency of extraction. The effectiveness of large-area PZT-based ultrasound transduction has been demonstrated in various unrelated studies. For example, an interconnected network comprising hundreds of miniaturized PZT actuators has been employed over a 20 cm x 20 cm area, utilizing only 6 W of electric power, resulting in efficient transduction intensity at a depth up to 8mm93. Similarly, larger piezoelectric components could be utilized in arrays, akin to those employed in sonar applications for underwater wireless communication, which are inherently designed with a larger footprint area extending up to several sq. feet94. Future research could implement these strategies to test the AWH sorbents with a custom-made actuator array over a large surface area and associated electronic circuits for optimum power supply to the array, which may yield higher energy efficiency than we predict based on the simple approach described above.

The vibrational extraction requires the use of a photovoltaic (PV) cell—or another solar-to-electricity energy converter—to generate electric power to drive a piezo actuator if operated autonomously without access to the electric grid. While solar power can be used to directly heat a sorbent material, there are multiple arguments for the use of a PV cell to convert and store solar energy to power an outdoor AWH system (even if ultrasonic extraction is not used). First, conversion of solar energy into low-grade heat in a solar-thermal absorber is a less efficient process than conversion of solar energy to electricity with a PV cell (see Supplementary Note 11)95,96,97. Second, the daily water yield per land area can be maximized by designing vertically-oriented systems68,69 integrated with ultrasonic actuators or Joule heaters for extraction, and by optimizing the sorption-desorption cycle duration to operate around the clock. Third, other auxiliary devices can be powered by the PV-generated electricity, including sensors to monitor environmental conditions and fans to promote air convection to improve vapor diffusion68,98. Finally, AWH systems with vibrational extraction can be designed to run autonomously, avoiding manual batch-drying process98 and adapting their sorption/extraction cycles to varying environmental conditions.

To summarize, our work offers the experimental demonstration of the energy consumption of moisture extraction from AWH sorbents below both the thermal limit and the dewing limit. This major improvement in energy efficiency may promote AWH technology commercialization.

We synthesized polyacrylamide hydrogels based on a simple, one-pot approach, where polymer, salt, initiator, crosslinker, and accelerator, were all mixed in water. For all hydrogels, we first dissolved the 16.72 g lithium chloride ( ≥99%) salt in a beaker with 50 mL deionized (DI) water. The solution was continuously mixed with a magnetic stirring bar, covered to prevent evaporation, and then left to cool down to room temperature. We added sequentially 4.18 g of acrylamide ( ≥ 99%), the N,N'-MBA (99%) as crosslinker (50 mg for HG-C, 2.5 mg for HG-B and 0.5 mg for the HG-A) and 14.2 mg of ammonium persulfate (APS) ( ≥ 98%) as initiator. We degassed the mixed solution for 10 min under vacuum in a dessicator. Finally, we added 12 μL of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylendiamin (TEMED) ( ≥ 99%) as accelerator. 4 mL of solution were poured into a petri dish, covered with the lid, and left to gelate at room temperature overnight. All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

The dynamic vapor sorption isotherms were characterized using an environmental simulation chamber (BINDER GmbH). Initially, the samples were dried at a temperature of 95 °C, for a duration of 24 hours using a gravity convection oven (MTI Corporation). Subsequently, the weight of the samples that had been dried in the oven was measured using an analytical balance (OHAUS Corporation). Next, the oven-dried samples were treated inside the environmental chamber under varying RHs (15, 30, 55, 85%) at a constant 25 °C temperature and at a maximum stage time of 720 min, ensuring that the specimen weight reached an equilibrium state. In addition to our designed hydrogel, we also used a commercially available hydrogel (HG-M) (a cross-linked glycerol- 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid sodium salt hydrogel, Medela). Finally, the water uptake was quantified by calculating the ratio of the water content in the sample at equilibrium to its oven-dried weight. The findings are shown as the mean ± standard deviation.

Rheological experiments were conducted using a rheometer (HR-20, TA Instruments). For all the experiments, a 25 mm parallel plate geometry was employed to ensure accurate loading on the hydrogel specimens. A circular mold was used to fabricate gelled disks, which were formed into a diameter of 25 mm for utilization underneath the parallel plate. Before conducting the tests, the samples were given a five-minute period to reach a state of equilibrium, ensuring that both mechanical and thermal factors were balanced. The temperature was controlled using a built-in Peltier system. The experiments involving the oscillatory frequency and strain/amplitude sweeps were carried out at 25 °C. Temperature sweep experiments were conducted at an angular frequency of 6.28 rad/s and 0.1% strain.

Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted to evaluate the desorption behavior and thermal stability of the hydrogels using a thermal analysis system (TGA 5500, TA Instruments). Approximately 10 mg of samples were put into a titanium pan in the presence of nitrogen gas and were heated gradually at a rate of 1 °C/min until they reached a temperature of 50 °C.

The surface morphology of the hydrogel specimens was examined using an SEM (Zeiss Sigma 300 VP). Hydrogels were completely dehydrated to prevent off-gassing during sputtering and SEM imaging. To prepare the samples and visualize them under the SEM, they were stuck to aluminum stubs with double-sided carbon tape. Next, a sputter coater (Desk V, Denton) was used to apply a 10 nm thin film coating of gold/palladium (Au/Pd) (60:40) in presence of argon gas.

A conventional diffusion cell was used to conduct the forward osmosis test and assess the efficacy of water penetration through the porous stainless-steel membranes employed in this investigation. The experimental configuration closely resembled a recent study99. The porous membrane was installed between two glass cells, each having a capacity of 7 ml. The left cell is referred as the NaCl-solution cell, and the right one is the DI-water solution cell, (see Supplementary Fig. S8). A 2 M NaCl solution was made by dissolving 0.81 g of NaCl in 7 ml of DI water. The right cell contained 7 ml of DI-water with conductivity in the µS (micro-siemens) range. As the water conductivity increased, reaching the mS (milli-siemens) range, the ion mass began to transport through the membrane from the ion-cell to the DI-cell. This occurred under vigorous mixing at a speed of 1350 RPM at room temperature, driven by the concentration gradient. The conductance measurements were conducted using a conductivity probe (SevenCompact, Mettler Toledo) for a duration of 10 minutes for each of the three SS membranes.

The solid housing for the piezoelectric transducer was modeled in SOLIDWORKS and parts were printed using a Bambu Lab X1-Carbon Combo 3D printer. Aside from the glass domes, all parts within the assembly have a hole with a 12 mm diameter in the center to allow droplets to fall into the bottom dome since water can be harvested from the hydrogel on both sides (top and bottom) of the piezoelectric transducer. Two-ring structures, top and bottom insulators, are used to hold two glass domes in place. Cuts are made into the assembly to allow the domes to slide into the case. The top insulator is 8 mm tall, has an outer diameter of 33 mm, and an inner diameter of 25 mm, allowing for a perfect fit of the glass dome, which had an outer diameter of slightly below 25 mm. The wire track that houses the piezoelectric device is 8 mm tall and has an outer diameter of 20 mm and an inner diameter of 17 mm. Also, it has a cut that is 2 mm deep to hold the piezoelectric ring and provides a cavity to allow wiring and ambient moisture access into the case. The support platform connects the top and bottom insulators. The bottom insulator and the tripod together host the bottom glass dome. Each leg of the tripod is 38 mm long.

The piezoelectric transducer used in our system was circular in shape (see Supplementary Table 1-2 for detail), where a piezoelectric ring made of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) polycrystal was affixed to a porous stainless-steel membrane. To fabricate the transducer for our system, the membrane and the PZT rings were purchased from Dongguan Norvis Electronic Corporation and securely fastened. The PZT was affixed to the porous membrane by clamping one side, while the other side was covered with a hydrophobic epoxy resin. Porous membranes with three different nozzle sizes (10, 70, and 100 µm) were used with PZT crystals of two different frequencies to build the low ( ~ 110 kHz) and high ( ~ 165 kHz) frequency actuators. Piezo drivers were used to actuate the transducer at two different duty cycles of 70 ± 3% and 30 ± 3%, operating at RMS voltages of 40 and 30 V, respectively. The driver boards were powered at 1.5 W using a DC power supply to drive the piezoelectric transducers.

A Berlincourt meter was employed to measure the piezoelectric coefficients, d33 (pC/N), of the PZT crystals used in fabricating the four transducers. During the measurement of the coefficients, both a static force and a dynamic force are exerted on the sample. The tool controls and maintains a constant dynamic force of 0.25 N/110 Hz, while the static force of around ~1 N was manually controlled. The static force is measured using a static force sensor to assure consistent measurements (see Supplementary Fig. S41 for experimental setup).

The electrical phase-impedance spectrum of the transducer devices was measured using an impedance spectroscopy (Solartron SI 1260, AMETEK). The impedance spectrum was screened to obtain two key parameters, the anti-resonance (fa) and resonance (fr) frequencies. The evaluation of the effectiveness of piezoelectric devices in converting electric energy into mechanical energy was conducted based on their effective electromechanical coupling coefficient (keff)56,92 using the following equation: \({k}_{{eff}}=\sqrt{({f}_{a}^{2}-{f}_{r}^{2})/{f}_{a}^{2}}\).

The vibrational modes of the steel membrane and PZT ring were analyzed using a PICOSCALE Vibrometer (SmarAct Metrology GmbH & Co. KG), which is a laser scanning vibrometer employing confocal optics and Michelson interferometry. The sample was actuated using the built-in signal generator of the vibrometer. In this case, the device was connected to a general-purpose input/output (GPIO1 from the vibrometer controller), which is used to output an electrical signal and directly feed it to the device using an adapted BNC cable.

First, microscopic imaging was used to identify the specific area of interest on the membrane and PZT ring for the modal analysis (see Supplementary Fig. S42). The membrane was analyzed at two distinct locations: the core and the periphery. Measurements on the periphery of the membrane and PZT were consistently conducted at a significant distance from the electrode cable. To uncover the local resonances, a linear sweep excitation ranging from 1 Hz to 500 kHz, with a duration of 0.01 s and an amplitude of 1 Vpp was generated and output via the GPIO1. For each identified local resonance, a 2D modal analysis was performed. During this analysis, the interferometric laser beam is raster-scanned over the sample while the amplitude and phase of the vibrations are extracted using dual-phase lock-in demodulation.

For this application, a single-frequency sinusoid is output at GPIO1, which is also used as the reference signal for the lock-in amplifier. The recorded time series is post-processed using the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm to convert the signal from time domain into frequency domain in the form \(x\left(t\right)=A\sin (\omega t)\) to reduce the noise and reveal the resonances. The velocity (\(v\)) of the device at its resonance frequency (\({f}_{d}\)) was then calculated as \(v={dx}/{dt}=\omega \cdot A\cdot \cos (\omega t)\), where \(x\) is the displacement signal and \(\omega\) is the angular frequency. Maximum velocity value is then estimated as \({v}_{\max }=\omega \cdot A=2\pi {f}_{d}A.\) The amplitude A of the signal can be easily retrieved by performing the Fourier analysis of the recorded time-series, and the RMS value of the velocity at the peak amplitude value is calculated as \({v}_{{RMS}}=0.7{v}_{\max }.\)

In the case of a linear sweep excitation, the energy of the signal is spread over a large bandwidth. In order to retrieve the real amplitude of the motion, a correction factor is applied: \(k=\sqrt{({f}_{1}-{f}_{0}){dt}}\), where \({f}_{1}\) and \({f}_{0}\) are the highest and the lowest frequencies, respectively, and \({dt}\) is the duration of the sweep. In our calculations, a correction factor of \(k=70.71\) was used. During the experimental analysis and 2D imaging of vibrational modes, the displacement signal is demodulated on-the-fly using a digital dual-phase lock-in amplifier, and no correction factor to retrieve the actual amplitude is needed. The resulting 2D image of the sample deflection is post-processed to retrieve the maximum displacement value.

Elemental mapping, surface roughness imaging, and atomization photography Zeiss Sigma 300 VP was used to capture SEM images of the membrane nozzles and PZT material. The tool also employed Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) technology for elemental mapping of the PZT devices and provides precise information about their composition. A laser scanning confocal microscope (VK-X250, Keyence) was used to do non-contact surface profiling and roughness assessment of the membrane after the extraction cycle. The Nikon D5300 DSLR camera was used to capture the atomization process of water as it was expelled from the hydrogel and funneled through the nozzles of the porous membrane incorporated into the transducer. A green crossline was generated using a 520 nm green laser module (OXLasers), with the focal point positioned below the nozzle axis. This improved the process of envisioning for photography. T-slotted aluminum extrusions were used to build a platform for mounting the transducer between two L-shaped joint brackets to perform imaging experiments.

To monitor and visualize hydrogel heating caused by the PZT transducer heat generation, an infrared (IR) thermal camera (FLIR ETS320, Teledyne FLIR LLC) was utilized. IR imaging was also used to monitor the process of hydrogel cooling to ambient temperature after the actuation process. Due to the challenge of IR-imaging a highly polished surface such as a metallic stainless-steel membrane in our device, we used Dr. Scholl's™ spray to deposit a thick opaque layer onto the membrane, and during imaging, emissivity (ε) value of 0.95 was set in the IR camera.

We used an acoustic sensor hydrophone (H Instruments) to measure and quantify the force exerted by a piezoelectric transducer as a function of voltage (V). To conduct the acoustic experiment, the transducer was placed within a petri dish and the hydrogel samples were attached to the device. The acoustic sensor was linked to its amplifier board operating at 9 V that had a gain of 25 dB with bandwidth up to 120 kHz and placed on the hydrogel surface. The transmitted and received waveforms were recorded. Our device served as the transmitter, while the acoustic sensor functioned as the receiver. The resulting output voltage was measured for hydrogel samples of varying thickness.

We used a multi-channel calibrated commercial K-type thermocouple (HT-9815, RISE PRO) to measure the temperature of a free-standing (i.e., not clamped to the PZT) stainless steel membrane used as the Joule heater. The transducer device received a power supply of 1.5 W in order to maintain a consistent temperature for a comparative analysis. Throughout the experiment, either Joule heating or ultrasonic actuation were applied for 1 min each, followed by a subsequent short deactivation period to weigh the amount of weight loss. The weight loss (%) of the hydrogel was calculated by comparing the extracted mass to the initial mass of the sample.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to investigate the changes in the vibrational spectra of hydrogels with different level of cross-linking and varying moisture content. FTIR with a built-in attenuated total internal reflectance (ATR) capability was used (iS50, ThermoFisher). The raw FITR spectra were deconvoluted into distinct Gaussian peaks corresponding to individual vibrational modes of polymer and trapped water molecules.

The energy consumption, E [MJ/kg], required for moisture extraction was calculated as follows: \(E=P/m=(({\rm{power}},{kWh})\cdot ({duty\; cycle},\%) \cdot 3.6\cdot {10}^{6}\cdot {10}^{-6})/{10}^{-3}\left[\right.{MJ}\cdot {{kg}}^{-1} > \), where \(P\) is input energy [MJ], and \(m\) [kg] is the extracted mass. Using the energy consumption (E), the efficiency of the water release process of our device, \(\eta > \), is calculated as \(\eta={h}_{{lv}}/E\), where \({h}_{{lv}}=2.257\left[\right.{\rm{MJ}}/{\rm{kg}}\) is the enthalpy of vaporization of water (see Supplementary Note 4).

Agilent 5100 DVD was used to test the quality of the ultrasonically-extracted water from PAM-LiCl hydrogels via a coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) elemental analysis, similar to the test methods reported in recent studies of AWH hygroscopic gels30. Prior to testing with the Agilent 5100 DVD, the extracted water was collected using VWR sterile syringe filters. Multiple desorbed specimens were tested.

COMSOL Multiphysics® was used to simulate vibrational modes of the transducer device consisting of a PZT ring clamped to a steel membrane with nozzles100. Solid Mechanics and Electrostatics modules were used to study the deformation dynamics, and a 3D asymmetrical model was constructed to facilitate visualization (see also Supplementary Note 2). Using a voltage sweep, the displacement and velocity were studied, and the phase-impedance spectrum was analyzed employing a frequency sweep. Simulating the nozzle dispersion pattern akin to the manufactured membrane proved challenging in COMSOL. Consequently, all the nozzles were uniformly distributed, and a diameter of 50 μm was used to accommodate around 800 nozzles. The simulation results for impedance, velocity, and displacement exhibited a high degree of agreement with the experimental data, without significant deviation. This simulation technique was also employed to visualize the behavior of ultrasonic radiation in hydrogel. For this study purpose, the Young's modulus (E) was determined from the storage modulus of our hydrogel utilizing the formula \(E=2G(1+\mu )\), where \(\mu\) represents the Poisson ratio and storage modulus was used as the magnitude for \(G\). The density was estimated at approximately 1200 kg/m3 according to literature101, and a Poisson's ratio of 0.5 is often employed for hydrogels. Following the calculation, the inputs were entered into COMSOL to simulate the sound pressure induced by the actuator in the hydrogel volume.

We used Edge Impulse machine learning platform102 to build a deep neural network, which was used to categorize and distinguish between different types of hydrogels during the sorption process. The neural network was trained using the measured dynamic changes in the phase angle and impedance of the transducer loaded with hydrogel samples, which were continuously sorbing moisture at ~20% RH and ~19 °C. The trained model has three hidden layers, with a total of 100 neurons, and exhibited accuracy of 100%. The training phase used 77% of the datasets, while the remaining 23% were allocated for testing the model.

DNA methylation is a key regulator of eukaryotic genomes, most commonly through 5-methylcytosine (5mC). In contrast, the existence and function of N6-methyladenine (6mA) in eukaryotes have been controversial, with conflicting reports resulting from methodological artifacts. Nevertheless, some unicellular lineages, including ciliates, early-branching fungi and the alga Chlamydomonas, show robust 6mA signals, raising questions about their origin and evolutionary role. Here we apply Oxford Nanopore sequencing to profile 6mA at base-pair resolution across 18 unicellular eukaryotes representing all major supergroups. We find that robust 6mA patterns occur only in species that encode the adenine methyltransferase AMT1. Notably, 6mA consistently accumulates downstream of transcriptional start sites, positioned between H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes, indicating a conserved association with transcriptional activation. Our results support the idea that the last eukaryotic common ancestor had a dual methylation system, with transcription-linked 6mA and repressive 5mC, which has been repeatedly simplified in both multicellular and unicellular lineages through the loss of the AMT1 pathway.

Modified bases can change the way DNA is interpreted. The best studied modification is 5-methylcytosine (5mC), a widespread eukaryotic mark deposited by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)1,2,3, with functions ranging from transposable element (TE) control to gene regulation4,5,6. Other types of base modifications, like hydroxymethyluracil in dinoflagellates or the ‘base J' in kinetoplastids, are lineage-restricted but abundant in some species7,8. In contrast, N6-methyladenine (6mA) has been reported across various lineages, including animals9,10,11,12, plants13, early-diverging fungi14,15, algae16 and ciliates17,18. However, global 6mA levels are often close to detection limits, with reports questioning its presence in animals, plants or yeast19,20,21,22,23. Challenges in 6mA quantification include antibody pull-down specificity issues, bacterial DNA contamination, RNA contamination and sequencing data artifacts24,25. Despite this, ciliates, early-diverging fungi and the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibit high and orthogonally confirmed 6mA levels14,19. Thus, inadequate taxon sampling and conflicting results have limited our understanding of 6mA evolution.

A mechanistic understanding of genomic 6mA in eukaryotes comes from research in ciliates. In ciliates, the 6mA methyltransferases belong to the MT-A70 family, unrelated to DNMTs but sharing structural homology with the m6A RNA methyltransferases, METTL3 and METTL14 (refs. 26,27,28). AMT1 (known as MTA1 in Oxytricha trifallax) is the main 6mA writer in ciliates, while accessory enzymes from families AMT6/7 (MTA9 in O. trifallax) are dispensable and lack catalytic activity18,29. However, AMT6/7 forms a heterodimer with AMT1 during DNA engagement, akin to the METTL3 and METTL14 heterodimer (Fig. 1a)30. Additionally, DNA-binding proteins p1 and p2 have a role in targeting genomic DNA by forming a multimeric complex with AMT1 (refs. 18,29). In ciliates, early-diverging fungi and the alga C. reinhardtii, 6mA is confined to ApT dinucleotides14,16,17,18,28. It is suggested that AMT1 binds hemimethylated ApT sites, as does DNMT1, thereby maintaining 5mC on CpG dinucleotides31. In ciliates and C. reinhardtii, 6mA is found in internucleosomal linker DNA16,17,18,32, particularly enriched downstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of active genes. This association with transcription contrasts the proposed role of 6mA in silencing TE in animals11,12,22. Here 6mA may be evolutionarily flexible, like 5mC, which in different eukaryotes is restricted to transposon silencing or gene bodies4,5,6. However, the lack of data from many eukaryotic lineages limits our ability to reconstruct 6mA evolution and function.

For some lineages, the presence suggests that at least some species within the clade contain them. Dark triangles depict species for which 6mApT levels were reported previously, and pale blue triangles are species covered in this study. Phylogenetic relationships across these species are based on consensus in the field35,82.

To clarify these uncertainties, in this work, we study the evolutionary history of MT-A70 methyltransferases and we find that the AMT1 pathway can be traced back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). Then, using Oxford Nanopore modified base calling, previously validated for identifying this base modification in eukaryotes33, we detect consistent 6mA patterns in representatives from the major eukaryotic supergroups.

To clarify the origins and evolution of MT-A70 methyltransferases, we examined 231 eukaryotic genomes and transcriptomes (Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, we searched for noneukaryotic MT-A70 homologs, whose origins remain unclear1,26. The resulting MT-A70 phylogenetic tree mirrors the following six established eukaryotic families: AMT1, AMT6/7, AMT2/5, METTL3, METTL14 and METTL4 (Fig. 1b)26,28. Notably, prokaryotic sequences form a distinct clade, suggesting a bacterial origin for MT-A70 inherited early in eukaryotic evolution (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). MT-A70 presence in prokaryotes is confined to select eubacterial phyla, with few archean genomes harboring it, typically in a single copy per species (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Asgardarchaeota sequences cluster within prokaryotes rather than as sister to eukaryotes, arguing against an archaeal donor. Only one Asgardarchaeota of the 302 genomes searched contains a METTL3-like sequence, likely from metagenomic assembly contamination (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Unlike the more widespread bacterial-type Dam 6mA methyltransferase, MunI-like 6mA MT-A70 in bacteria is less diverse1. The monophyletic clustering of bacterial sequences supports a single origin of eukaryotic MT-A70 from an unidentified bacterial donor, or, alternatively, an eukaryotic origin followed by a single lateral gene transfer to prokaryotes, which is less parsimonious. This rules out recurrent transfers from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.

We found that all six MT-A70 families are present in most eukaryotic supergroups (Fig. 1c), suggesting that they duplicated before LECA. The RNA-associated METTL3 and METTL14 co-occur across the species phylogeny, in a pattern similar to the DNA-associated AMT1 and AMT6/7, suggesting that both enzymatic pairs have conserved heterodimer associations across eukaryotes (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1c). AMT2/5 is less common, often co-occurring with AMT1, hinting at a potential partnership but one in which AMT2/5 is dispensable. Notably, AMT2/5 is exceptional as it possesses C-terminal ZZ zinc finger domains of unknown function (Extended Data Fig. 1d)26,28. In contrast, METTL4 does not co-occur with any MT-A70 families, suggesting that it does not form heterodimers (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1c). METTL4 is believed to methylate mitochondrial DNA or small RNAs, but its role is currently not well understood22,34. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans METTL4 ortholog (known as DAMT-1) has been suggested as a genomic DNMT10, yet this is contested20. Beyond the MT-A70 methyltransferases, the proteins p1 and p2 exclusively co-occur with AMT1 (Fig. 1c), indicating an ancestral link with the AMT1 pathway18.

Hence, the enzymes responsible for RNA and DNA 6mA exhibit ancient origins, yet their evolution appears largely decoupled to each other in eukaryotes. Notably, AMT1 is consistently found in species with documented robust 6mA levels, such as ciliates, C. reinhardtii and early fungi14,16,17,18. Although exceptions exist, AMT1 co-occurs with AMT6/7 and p1/p2 partners (for example, Trichomonas vaginalis).

Based on the AMT1 distribution, we searched for eukaryotic lineages with detectable genomic 6mA. To avoid bacterial contamination, we focused on species grown axenically. Our selection included 15 species encoding AMT1 and three species lacking AMT1 orthologs as negative controls. Our sampling of ichthyosporeans, Corallochytrium limacisporum, a chytrid fungus, amoebozoans, chlorophytes, a glaucophyte, stramenopiles, heteroloboseans and a metamonada spans major eukaryotic branching groups35. Genomic DNA was sequenced using Oxford Nanopore R9.4.1 technology for 15 species, while equivalent public data were used for three more36,37,38. Using the Guppy software with the ‘all-context' Rerio model, we obtained maps for 6mA and 5mC in all species. Global methylation levels varied substantially across species, with the lowest levels observed in species lacking AMT1 (Fig. 2a).

Because AMT1 preferentially methylates ApT dinucleotides in ciliates14,16,17, we assessed global 6mA levels across various sequence contexts. In all AMT1-encoding species, AT was the main methylated context, although AA also showed appreciable levels (Fig. 2a). ApT sites displayed symmetric methylation across all AMT1-encoding species (Extended Data Fig. 2a). In contrast, AMT1-lacking species had negligible difference among dinucleotide contexts, with the AA dinucleotide being the most highly enriched (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Notably, C. reinhardtii and early-diverging fungi exhibit higher methylation in the VATB context (V = C/G/A, B = C/G/T)14,19, whereas in fungi the TAT trinucleotide showed the lowest methylation14. Thus, we calculated global levels for three 4-mer combinations and the TAT trinucleotide to discern AT flanking specificity. Across all AMT1-containing species SATS (S = C or G) exhibited the highest methylation, while TAT and WATW (W = A or T) showed the lowest (Fig. 2a). The VATB context displayed intermediate levels, suggesting that cytosine and guanine flanking dictate methyltransferase specificity (Fig. 2a). An exception was the metamonad T. vaginalis, which encodes four AMT1 paralogues but lacks AMT6/7, p1 or p2 (Fig. 1c). In Trichomonas, WATW and TAT were more enriched than SATS (Fig. 2a), indicating the signal reflects distinct methyltransferase preferences and showing that these patterns are not due to Oxford Nanopore base-calling bias.

We then examined the genomic distribution of 6mA. In species without AMT1, 6mA appeared uniformly across genes and TEs (Extended Data Fig. 2b), consistent with the background noise. Conversely, in AMT1-encoding species, a peak of AT methylation emerged proximal to the TSS (Fig. 2b,c). AA methylation mirrored these patterns, suggesting that AA methylation might be an off-target substrate of AMT1 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Some species displayed a subtle 6mA enrichment in promoter regions (upstream of the TSS; Fig. 2c)16, which proved to be an artifact arising from the head-to-head orientation of upstream genes (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Neither transcriptional end sites nor TEs exhibited enrichment in 6mA (Fig. 2c). Genic 6mA correlated with gene transcriptional activity (Fig. 2c). Across all species, silent genes presented lower 6mA levels compared to highly expressed genes, which also harbored more methylated ApT sites (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). The association with transcription was quite variable; for instance, Acanthamoeba castellanii exhibited a gradual link with transcriptional levels, while in ichthyosporeans or prasinophytes all genes above a specific transcriptional threshold presented uniform 6mA levels (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). This diversity was also evident in the total number of genes displaying methylation in each genome (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2). The ichthyosporean Chromosphaera perkinsii exhibited 92% of genes with 6mA, whereas both Naegleria species displayed detectable methylation in only 3% genes (Fig. 2d). Notably, most amino acid positions on the AMT1 sequences were under strong purifying selection (Supplementary Table 3), suggesting that the variation in targeting mechanisms rather than in the AMT1 protein itself is responsible for its differential usage, perhaps underlying distinct promoter architectures39.

We then tested how variable 6mA is upon transcriptional changes. We chose the amoebozoan A. castellannii, the fungus Spizellomyces punctatus, the ichthyosporeans Creolimax fragrantissima and C. perkinsii because these have different cell stages that can be isolated in culture40,41,42,43 (Fig. 3a), high 6mA levels and distinct associations between 6mA and transcriptional level in the steady state (Extended Data Fig. 3). We also collected matched transcriptomic and DNA samples for Naegleria gruberi grown at 23 °C and 30 °C. All species presented static 6mA methylomes at ApT and gene-level resolution, where most genes displayed minimal 6mA differences (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5a,c). In N. gruberi, the 644 genes called methylated using R9 nanopore chemistry, showed comparable 6mA levels at 23 °C and 30 °C, despite using R10 chemistry and a distinct analytical pipeline (Extended Data Fig. 5c). When we computed the total number of differentially expressed genes across stages and overlapped these with genes exhibiting >1% change in 6mApT levels along the gene body, we observed that thousands of genes change expression without any detectable 6mA alterations (Fig. 3d). In A. castellanii, 24% of the trophozoite upregulated genes were also hypermethylated in this stage, following a positive correlation with transcriptional change, yet the rest of trophozoite upregulated genes did not show methylation changes and 5.57% were hypomethylated, implying a limited link between 6mA and transcriptional change. In the S. punctatus zoospore, some genes were almost completely silenced in one stage yet retained high 6mA levels as in the transcribed stage (Fig. 3e). Further analysis of genes with variable 6mA (>1.5%) showed no correlation with transcriptional changes (Extended Data Fig. 5b,d). Although 6mA is associated with steady-state transcription in all AMT1-encoding eukaryotes, its link to dynamic transcription is weak, suggesting that 6mA reprogramming is dispensable for transcriptional change.

As 5mC is the other widespread form of DNA methylation in eukaryotes, we examined its relationship with 6mA within our species set (Fig. 4a). We found diverse scenarios—species exhibited nondetectable 5mC levels alongside high 6mA (for example, C. limacisporum), while others exclusively harbored 5mC (Phaeodactylum tricornutum). Some species presented both modifications, and Dictyostelium discoideum displayed neither (Fig. 4a). Negligible 5mC levels and the absence of CpG symmetry detected with nanopore matched previous results from enzymatic methyl-sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in these species44,45 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). This variation suggests that 6mA is not evolutionarily linked to 5mC, corroborating observations in early-diverging fungal lineages14.

For C. variabilis, 6mA and 5mC axes are shown separately. For M. pusilla, MNase data are shown to highlight the anticorrelation with both 5mC and 6mA peaks, as CPM. MNase, micrococcal nuclease.

The recurrent loss of 5mC in eukaryotes is partly attributed to its mutagenic effects46. Species with elevated 5mC levels, like vertebrates, often have fewer CpG dinucleotides than expected by chance, because deamination of 5mC into thymine depletes CpGs over evolution47. In contrast, animals with low or no 5mC lack this compositional bias48. Using a similar approach, we calculated observed-to-expected ApT ratios across our species. Global 6mAT levels did not correlate with ApT dinucleotide depletion, with a relatively constant ratio across species (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Notably, CpG depletion was observed in species with very low 5mCG levels (for example, Naegleria), while prasinophytes exhibited the opposite trend, with high 5mCG levels and enriched CpG composition (Extended Data Fig. 6b) as previously reported3. These findings suggest that neither 5mC nor 6mA substantially shapes genomic base composition across the vast diversity of eukaryotes, in contrast with prior observations for 5mC in animals and plants.

One possibility is that 6mA mutagenic effects are most evident in regions where it is enriched, particularly post-TSS. Similarly, in invertebrates with 5mC in gene bodies, methylated genes show lower CpG ratios than unmethylated ones49,50. We grouped genes by the presence or absence of methylated ApTs and compared local ApT density. In most species, 6mA showed no clear association with ApT composition (Extended Data Fig. 7). In some species, methylated genes had higher ApT density than unmethylated ones, opposite to patterns seen with 5mC. In early-diverging fungi, 6mA-methylated genes are depleted for TAT motifs. We confirm this in the fungus S. punctatus, but not across other eukaryotes (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, the recurrent loss of 6mA in eukaryotes is unlikely to be driven by mutagenic effects, which appear limited.

In species with both 6mA and 5mC, we observe two main patterns. In Acanthamoeba, Naegleria, Spizellomyces or Chlamydomonas, as in the previously reported early-branching fungi14,51, 5mC is confined to transposons while 6mA marks expressed genes (Fig. 4b), suggesting opposing links to transcription. Nevertheless, in several eukaryotes, 5mC is also found within gene bodies, including animals and plants52,53, but also the chlorophytes and the ichthyosporean Amoebidium appalachense in our dataset3,45. In this second pattern, 6mA predominantly occupies the five prime ends of the gene body, while 5mC peaks when 6mA diminishes (Fig. 4c). In all four species, there is a distinct periodic 6mA pattern suggestive of internucleosomal positioning (Fig. 4c). We used micrococcal nuclease sequencing data for Micromonas pusilla to confirm that 6mA peaks are anticorrelated with nucleosome positioning (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 8)3. In Amoebidium, both modifications coexist in the first three or four nucleosome territories downstream of the TSS (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 8). In the case of Micromonas and Ostreococcus, nanopore data align with the reported pattern of internucleosomal 5mC distribution along the gene bodies of prasinophytes3. The original study noted that 5mC is weakly linked to transcription in prasinophytes, suggesting a compaction role in these microalgae with very small genomes (for example, Ostreococcus tauri, 12.6 Mb)3. Notably, 6mA replaces 5mC in the first nucleosomes downstream of the TSS of active genes, suggesting a role in maintaining transcriptional permissiveness, as inactive genes show less 6mA (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4).

Our findings align with prior reports indicating an enrichment of 6mA in nucleosomal linker DNA16,17,18,32. In ciliates, the deletion of AMT1 disrupts 6mA patterns, resulting in more diffuse nucleosome positioning around the TSS18,28. Most species in our dataset also exhibit a periodic 6mA pattern. However, Naegleria, Acanthamoeba or Chromosphaera lack a discernible periodic 6mA pattern (Extended Data Fig. 7). The absence of periodicity might be attributed to irregular nucleosome positioning in these species or potential issues with TSS annotations. However, we could not detect periodic patterns over individual genes, unlike in species that display periodicity (Fig. 4b). Moreover, there is a considerable variation in the average number of nucleosomes covered in 6mA territories across species. For instance, the stramenopile Aurantiochytrium limacinum displays only three 6mA peaks, while the metamonad T. vaginalis exhibits periodic 6mA peaks across entire gene bodies, albeit with decreasing intensity (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 7). Thus, the 6mA–nucleosome linker association is consistent across AMT1-encoding eukaryotes, although with lineage-specific variations.

To probe what shapes 6mA patterns and their link to nucleosomes, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP–seq) for two TSS-associated and transcriptionally active histone marks—histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac)28,54. We generated data for four species and reanalyzed datasets for two additional species55, covering most divergent eukaryotic groups with comparable ChIP–seq quality (Extended Data Fig. 9a and Supplementary Fig. 4). Both histone marks showed expected enrichments post-TSS with peak widths under 1,000 bp (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 9b,c)28,56. We then grouped genes by H3K4me3 signal and found that 6mA closely overlaps with this histone mark (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 9d). In contrast, genomic regions beyond H3K4me3 peaks have substantially lower 6mA levels across all species (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Notably, 6mA aligns with H3K4me3 not only in intensity but also in deposition width.

Average 6mA (on ApT context), H3K4me3 and H3K27ac across five eukaryotic lineages. For each species, genes have been clustered using the H3K4me3 signal, forming the following four clusters: high, middle, low and no signal. For N. gruberi, because the amount of methylated genes is small, the classification was done independently, dark blue corresponds to 6mA-methylated genes, pale blue corresponds to genes with H3K4me3 with no 6mA and orange for genes that lack both H3K4me3 and 6mA. H3K4me3 and H3K27ac are shown as CPM.

In the ichthyosporean C. fragrantissima, some genes were fully covered by H3K4me3, extending beyond typical post-TSS patterns (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 9d). These broad H3K4me3 peaks cannot be explained solely by head-to-head gene arrangements (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d), and have been associated with low transcriptional levels57. Within these H3K4me3 domains, 6mA is present throughout (Extended Data Fig. 10a), supporting a tight link between their deposition in Creolimax. Interestingly, in ichthyosporeans, the DNA-binding partner of AMT1—the p1 subunit—contains a PHD domain, which is known to read histone tail methylations58 (Supplementary Fig. 5).

The other two species displaying divergent 6mA and H3K4me3 patterns are the heterolobosean N. gruberi and the metamonad T. vaginalis. In Naegleria, only 644 genes show 6mA, so we categorized genes based on the presence or absence of 6mA and/or H3K4me3. Genes with 6mA showed the highest H3K4me3 signal (Figs. 4b and 5). However, most genes displayed H3K4me3 without 6mA, suggesting independent deposition (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 9d). In contrast, H3K27ac was comparable between genes with 6mA and those with only H3K4me3. In Naegleria, as in most eukaryotes, the p1 subunit lacks a PHD domain, so colocalization with H3K4me3 would require intermediate proteins.

T. vaginalis exhibits an opposite pattern; H3K4me3 and H3K27ac correlate with 6mA intensity, but 6mA extends beyond the modified nucleosomes (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Figs. 9d and 10a). In Trichomonas, both 6mA and H3K4me3 may depend on transcriptional initiation, but 6mA extends further, spanning broader domains. Trichomonas is exceptional as it lacks p1, p2 and AMT6/7 orthologs that could explain this divergent pattern (Fig. 1c).

To directly test whether the H3K4me3 deposition influences 6mA presence, we treated A. castellanii with H3K4me3 inhibitors. We used OICR-9429 and Piribedil, which block WDR5 interactions with histone methyltransferases59,60. Both inhibitors resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in H3K4me3 levels while leaving overall H3 levels unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 10b). At the highest inhibitor concentrations, we profiled the 6mA methylome in treated and DMSO control samples. Furthermore, 6mA levels showed minimal differences between inhibitor and control groups, both globally and at H3K4me3 peaks (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d), suggesting that H3K4me3 does not directly determine 6mA deposition in these species.

Overall, our data suggest that AMT1-dependent 6mA is tied to nucleosome positioning across eukaryotes, especially with transcription-permissive marks. The hierarchy between these components appears lineage-specific and may be simplified in some lineages.

We show that 6mA is widespread across eukaryotes and trace its origin to the LECA. Our broad sampling supports an ancestral AMT1 pathway, irrespective of the debated root positions of the eukaryotic tree of life61,62,63. Unlike 5mC DNMTs acquired by LECA through independent bacterial transfers64, the 6mA MT-A70 methyltransferases were likely inherited in a single event from a bacterial donor (Fig. 6a). Pre-LECA, MT-A70 underwent duplications into six families, undergoing subfunctionalisation in heterodimeric partnerships and RNA or DNA substrates. Postdiversification, MT-A70 families remained relatively static in eukaryotic evolution, contrasting with DNMT families, which underwent lineage-specific duplications and expansions (Dim-2/RID in fungi, CMT and DRM in plants)3,4,65. Concurrently, 6mA patterns remained relatively constant across AMT1-encoding eukaryotes, consistently enriching ApT dinucleotides at TSS. Conversely, 5mC is variable, ranging from gene-body methylation to TE silencing, and methylates sequence contexts beyond CpGs4,5,6. As 5mC is presumed to ancestrally silence TEs4,6,53, its faster evolutionary dynamics may result from adaptations to track recurrent transposon invasions, in contrast to the slower concerted co-evolution of the 6mA–AMT1 pathway targeting endogenous genes. Similarly, the targeting of silencing histone modifications appears to evolve more dynamically than those of transcriptionally associated modifications57. Our survey suggests that LECA had a dual methylation system, with transcriptionally associated 6mA and repressively associated 5mC (Fig. 6a).

a, Diagram showcasing the distinct evolutionary origins of 6mA (MT-A70) and 5mC (DNMTs) enzymes in the advent of the LECA, and the inferred ancestral epigenome based on distribution and proposed roots of the eukaryotic taxa. Species genus represents examples of extant eukaryotes that still exhibit the inferred ancestral patterns. The question mark symbol indicates that potentially prokaryotes might have acquired MT-A70 sequences from a pre-eukaryotic lineage. b, Derived epigenome patterns in modern eukaryotes associated with simplification in methyltransferase repertoires, with example species/lineages for each pattern. Crossed rectangles or hexagons indicate enzyme losses, which are color coded and shaped as in a. The presence of DNMTs does not imply co-occurrence of all three enzymes, but any of them.

Our study confirms Oxford Nanopore as a reliable platform for 6mA detection33,66, showcasing robust and reproducible patterns across species with diverse genome compositions. Long-read base-pair resolution maps avoid pitfalls of other methods24. As an example, in T. vaginalis, antibody-based pull-downs suggested 6mA enrichment in TE67, but this genome is dominated by recently duplicated Maverick retrotransposons68, where short-read mapping artifacts are common25,69. By contrast, our nanopore data show a strong periodic 6mA pattern on transcribed genes in Trichomonas, without enrichment in TEs, consistent with patterns across other eukaryotes16,17,18. Nanopore can provide independent confirmation of conflicting PacBio CLR results, as in C. elegans, where 6mA presence remains debated10,20,70,71. In C. elegans, the proposed 6mA methyltransferase METL-9 belongs to a different family than MT-A70, targeting GGAG rather than ApT70,71. Alternative 6mA DNA pathways may exist in eukaryotes, such as the fungal MetB asymmetric methyltransferase15, acquired through lateral gene transfer from bacteria. However, in nematodes, the few thousand 6mA sites detected are poorly reproducible across samples and lack the clustered patterns of AMT1-encoding species, likely reflecting the absence of a maintenance methyltransferase71. Alternatively, nucleotide salvage pathways incorporating m6A from RNA and mitochondrial DNA into nuclear DNA, or RNA:DNA hybrids, might explain contentious previous reports22,23,24,72,73. By contrast, robust and reproducible ApT methylation in AMT1-encoding eukaryotes suggests a stable, functionally important chromatin component.

Our finding of recurrent AMT1 pathway loss challenges assumptions about the evolution of DNA methylation. Similar to DNMTs and the RNA m6A METTL3/METTL14 pathway, the 6mA–AMT1 pathway is frequently lost across eukaryotes4,45. As 6mA shows no obvious mutagenic effect, these losses may reflect evolutionary contingency, with 6mA role compensated by alternative mechanisms. This has produced diverse combinations of 6mA and 5mC across extant eukaryotes (Fig. 6b).

Thus, 6mA strongly correlates with transcription, is enriched with highly expressed genes, yet its dynamics appear limited. Across five species in our dataset, 6mA shows little change under transcriptional perturbations. In another recently published example, the fungi Phycomyces blakesleeanus and Mucor lusitanicus also displayed modest 6mA dynamics despite treatment-specific transcriptional changes15. Similarly, AMT1 knockouts in ciliates and M. lusitanicus result in limited transcriptional changes18,74. This resembles gene-body 5mC in plants and invertebrates, stably expressed genes are usually methylated, yet developmental transcriptional changes rarely alter 5mC patterns4,75,76. Likewise, while H3K4me3 is closely associated with transcription, its direct role in initiating transcription remains debated77. For instance, depleting H3K4me3 can increase RNA polymerase II pausing without affecting transcriptional initiation78. Overall, chromatin features such as 6mA, gene-body 5mC and H3K4me3 mark transcriptionally active regions but likely act in permissive or downstream roles rather than directly regulating transcription.

The function of 6mA in nucleosome positioning remains unclear, as ciliates with mutated AMT1 exhibit disordered nucleosomes yet remain generally viable18,28, primarily only lethally affected in sexual reproduction. In ciliates, the effect on nucleosome positioning is also stronger in vitro than in vivo18,28,32. Some of our surveyed species lack a periodic 6mA pattern, questioning the importance of 6mA in nucleosome positioning. In contrast, our data suggest an ancient link between 6mA and H3K4me3, perhaps also with H2A.Z28,74. Given the widespread presence of H3K4me3 as a post-TSS marker54, even in species lacking 6mA, the latter may be nonessential or readily substituted in this region. Notably, H3K4me3 and H2A.Z usually anticorrelate with 5mC across eukaryotes53,79,80, so the H3K4me3–6mA link may further contribute to chromatin compartmentalization. Our inhibitor experiments in A. castellanii show that H3K4me3 is not required for 6mA deposition. In ichthyosporeans, the p1 PHD domain suggests possible H3K4me3 recognition. Thus, the hierarchical relationship between H3K4me3–6mA may have evolved independently, or their co-occurrence may simply reflect a downstream consequence of transcription rather than a direct causal link. Biophysically, 6mA is believed to decrease double-strand DNA stability, an effect potentially advantageous for transcription at the start of highly expressed genes22,27. Yet to understand the 6mA role as an epigenetic mark, identifying potential readers is key. Similarly, although 5mC stiffens DNA22, its function across eukaryotes depends more on associated readers or inhibiting transcription factor binding than on intrinsic biophysical properties81.

Intriguingly, 5mC is predominantly retained in major multicellular eukaryotic lineages (plants, animals and Dikarya fungi), whereas the AMT1–6mA pathway was lost in these lineages. In plants and animals, 5mC evolved to methylate gene bodies (Fig. 6b)4,5,53, replacing 6mA in the post-TSS region, yet this substitution is unlikely to be the sole cause of 6mA loss. The unicellular relatives of plants and animals have gene-body 5mC coexisting with 6mA, suggesting 6mA and 5mC have distinct roles even if found in the same regions (Fig. 6b). In conclusion, our data reshape the understanding of 6mA function and evolution, highlighting that both 6mA and 5mC were integral to the original eukaryotic chromatin toolkit. Although ciliates have spearheaded our understanding of 6mA in eukaryotes, their drastically unusual genome organization, with a micronucleus and a macronucleus, and a lineage-specific expansion of MT-A70s18,28, will benefit from complementary insights from alternative lineages. By expanding taxon sampling to tractable species with canonical genomes, our work sets the stage to clarify 6mA functions and to understand why this pathway was lost in major multicellular lineages.

Experiments within this study did not require ethics board approval.

A collection of eukaryotic proteomes spanning the broadest diversity of lineages was scanned using HMMER3 (v3.3.1) with the PFAM domain for MT-A70 (ref. 83), using an e value of 0.0001 as a threshold. Additionally, AMT6/7 sequence from Tetrahymena termophila was used as a query against the same database using BLASTP (2.9.0+), to obtain divergent orthologs that were filtered out with the hmmsearch approach. In parallel, T. termophila MT-A70 AMT1 and AMT7 sequences were used to BLASTP against NCBI ‘nr' databases, excluding eukaryotes as taxonomic hits. The resulting proteins were merged into a multisequence alignment using MAFFT L-INS-i mode84 (v7.475). The alignment was trimmed with trimAl -gappyout parameter85 (v1.4.rev15), and a maximum-likelihood phylogeny was obtained using IQ-TREE86 (v2.1.2), with automatic model selection, computing 1,000 ultrafast bootstraps and ALRT replicates as nodal supports. The distribution of MT-A70 hits across our dataset can be found in Supplementary Table 1. To determine the distribution of MT-A70 in prokaryotes, the same BLASTP approach was used, allowing 250 hits against the NCBI ‘refseq_select' database, specifying bacteria and archaea (separately). The 302 Asgardarchaeota genomes were downloaded from NCBI (January 2025) and searched using HMMER3, as for eukaryotes. Another phylogeny was constructed from a subset of the original tree, selecting a few representative eukaryotic species and all prokaryotic outgroups, using the same methods as for the larger tree. To determine the presence of p1 and p2 orthologs, we used BLASTP against the custom eukaryotic proteome database, requiring an e value of <0.0001.

C. fragrantissima, Abeoforma whisleri and C. limacisporum cells were grown axenically in marine broth liquid medium (Difco, 2216) at 17 °C, 17 °C and 23 °C, respectively. C. perkinsii cells were grown axenically at 23 °C in liquid medium (containing 3 g of yeast extract, 3 g of malt extract, 5 g of peptone, 10 g of glucose and 20 g on NaCl per liter of distilled water). A. castellanii Neff cells were grown axenically at 23 °C in ATCC medium 712. N. gruberi cells were grown axenically at 23 °C and 30 °C in ATCC medium 1034. A. limacinum cells were grown axenically at 19 °C in ATCC medium 790. S. punctatus cells were grown axenically at 17 °C in liquid medium (containing 2.5 g of yeast extract, 0.5 g of K2HPO4, 2.5 ml of ethanol, 15 ml of glycerol and 485 ml of Milli-Q water). D. discoideum was grown axenically at 23 °C in liquid HL5-C medium (Formedium). C. reinhardtii CC-503 was grown on TAP growth media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1379801) at room temperature.

We performed DNA extractions for N. gruberi, D. discoideum, C. reindhardtii, C. perkinsii, A. whisleri and S. punctatus from confluent cultures grown into 25-ml flasks for 7 days, and 4 days for C. limacisporum. For A.limacinum, cells were grown for 7 days and then 1 ml was passed into two 25-ml flasks with fresh medium to enrich for zoospores and then collected 2 days later. In all cases, cells were centrifuged at 3,000g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded before DNA extraction.

For A. castellani trophozoite DNA, we obtained cells from a confluent 7-day culture. For the cystic stage, cells were grown for 5 days in 25-ml flasks and then media was removed and replaced by 5 ml of encystment medium (containing 3.728 g of KCl, 1.68-g NaHCO3, 0.986 g of MgSO4 × 7H2O, 0.03 g of CaCl2 × 2H20 and 0.017 g of 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol per 500 ml of distilled water)87; after 3 days of incubation at 23 °C, A. castellani cysts were collected for DNA extraction.

C. fragrantissima cells were grown until confluency for 5 days in 25-ml flask, and then cells were scratched and passed into 250-ml flask with 25 ml of fresh medium. These new flasks were grown for 48 h under gentle agitation at 17 °C and then were filtered using a 20-μm cell strainer (pluriSelect) and collected into a 50-ml Falcon tube to separate the amebas from the mature coenocytes, as described previously41. Both amebas and coenocytes were collected for independent DNA extraction.

For C. perkinsii synchronization, we filtered a 6-day-old culture using a 5-µm filter (puriSelect) to obtain a small-celled population that was then diluted 1:100 in liquid media to grow at 23°C, as described before42. Cells were visually inspected and collected after 54 h and 96 h, and then snap-frozen in liquid N2 for later DNA extractions.

For S. punctatus, zoospore cells were grown until confluency for 7 days in 25-ml flask, and then 1 ml of the culture was spread onto Spicellomyces-agar plates (S. punctatus liquid medium + 15 g l−1 of agar) and incubated for 48 h at 30 °C. After that, the active Spizellomyces plates were flooded with 1 ml of dilute salt (DS) solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h to induce the release of zoospores. After the release, the DS solution containing the zoospores was retrieved and filtered using a 10-μm syringe strainer (pluriSelect) as described previously43. At that moment, zoospores were collected and frozen in liquid N2 for later DNA and RNA extractions. For the multinucleated colonies, zoospores obtained as described before grown in liquid media for 24 h at 30 °C, multinucleated cells were collected by scraping the flask and snap-frozen in liquid N2 for later DNA and RNA extractions.

Before DNA extraction, to break the cell wall of S. punctatus, C. fragrantisiima and synchronized C. perkinsii samples, heat shock was applied, the cells were frozen with liquid N2 and then thawed at 60 °C, repeating this thrice. For C. perkinsii unsynchronized samples and A. castellanii cysts, we immersed the pellets in liquid N2 and then ground them with a pestle and mortar.

The resulting cell pellets for N. gruberi, A. castellanii amebas, cysts and Piribedil-treated samples, D. discoideum, C. perkinsii unsynchronized samples, C. limacisporum and A. limacinum were used for DNA extraction using the Qiagen MagAttract HMW DNA kit following the manufacturer's whole blood protocol. For S. punctatus, C. fragrantissima, C. perkinsii synchronized samples, A. castellanii OICR-9429 treated samples and C. reindhartii NEB Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit were used following the animal tissue protocol. For A. whisleri, we used a phenol/chloroform genomic DNA extraction method.

Total RNA was extracted in biological duplicates from N. gruberi cultures grown at 23 °C and 30 °C, as well as from S. punctatus zoospores and multinucleate colonies, following NEB Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit tough-to-lyse samples protocol after snap-freezing the samples in liquid N2.

The genomic DNA of T. vaginalis strain G3 was obtained from ATCC, and the DNA of M. pusilla Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (CCAP) 1965/4, Chlorella variabilis NC64A and Cyanophora paradoxa CCAP 981/1 were obtained from CCAP (Oban).

We quantified genomic DNA using a Qubit 3 Fluorometer with the dsDNA BR Assay Kit and assessed DNA size with a TapeStation 2200 using the Genomic DNA ScreenTape Assay. We then started with 1−1.5 μg of high molecular weight genomic DNA that was ligated with nanopore SQK-LSK110 ligation kit following the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced later in MinION R9.4.1 flow cells (see Supplementary Table 3 for details).

The resulting fast5 files were then used as input for Guppy (v6.5.7), and the Rerio modified base-calling model ‘res_dna_r941_min_modbases-all-context_v001' was specified, aligning the reads to the reference genome (--align_ref) parameter. The list of reference genomes is provided in Supplementary Table 4 (refs. 41,45,88,89,90,91). The resulting BAM files were then merged and sorted using samtools, and then the Oxford Nanopore ‘modbam2bed' (v0.9.1) was used to obtain either 6mA (-m 6mA) or 5mC (-m 5mC) basecalls. The resulting bedMethyl files were then used to extract the neighboring bases for each A position, gathering one base upstream and two downstreams using BEDTools92, and the stranded (5′ to 3′) four-nucleotide context was included for each position. Dinucleotide contexts were divided into AT, AA, AC and AG, and bigwig files were generated using the UCSC bedGraphToBigWig tool (v4). Visualization of average methylation levels on genes, TSS and TEs was obtained using DeepTools2 (v3.5.0)93.

For N. gruberi temperature-treated DNA samples, we generated libraries using the SQK-LSK114 ligation kit and sequenced them using the PromethION R10.4.1 flow cells. Because there is no compatible R10.4.1 model for Guppy, we switched to Dorado (v0.7.2) for 6mA base calling, using 6mA in sup mode. The 6mA calls were obtained using the Oxford Nanopore Modkit (v0.4.2) pileup function, testing several thresholds for calling a modified base, inspecting them in the browser and finding that 0.995 showed the lowest false positive rate when compared to R9.4.1 for N. gruberi (--motif AN 0 --mod-thresholds a:0.995).

Global methylation levels were computed in R, and the regional average levels of 6mA were computed using the Bioconductor bsseq package94, treating the ApT dinucleotides as if they were CpGs. To call an ApT site methylated, we required at least 10× coverage and >10% 6mA, with lower coverage thresholds in M. pusilla and A. whisleri (5×) and in C. limacisporum and C. variabilis (3×). To call methylated genes, we required that each gene contain at least three methylated ApT sites. To compute stage-specific methylation differences in gene bodies, we computed the weighted average of 6mApT methylation across the whole gene bodies and subtracted those values. Genes with a difference of >1.5% 6mApT in both directions were selected as the most highly distinct.

To assess selective pressure acting on AMT1 gene sequences from the species sequenced in this study, a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was inferred using IQ-TREE, as described in the phylogenetic methods section. A codon-based alignment was generated by combining the protein sequence alignment obtained with MAFFT with the corresponding nucleotide sequences using PAL2NAL (v14). Tests for positive selection were performed using the CodeML implemented in EasyCodeML software (v1.41)95, applying the preset Site Model to detect the variation in selective pressure across codon sites.

We used 0.8–1 μg of total RNA from N. gruberi cultures grown at 23 °C and 30 °C and S. punctatus cell stages to select poly-A tails with the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module kit; then libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina in duplicate, following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq 2000 (NovoGene), yielding 20–30 million paired-end reads per replicate.

Furthermore, publicly available RNA-seq datasets for all species were downloaded from ENA from various studies (Supplementary Table 5)40,41,42. The data were mapped to the reference genomes using HISAT2 (v2.2.1)96, restricting intron size to 40,000 bp. To calculate steady-state transcription levels across all species, StringTie was used to obtain the Transcripts per Million measure for all gene models, and bigwig files were generated using DeepTools2, specifying the stranded information when the original libraries had strand-specific information97. For the differential expression analysis, Kallisto (0.46) was used to obtain the counts (est_counts) by aligning reads to reference transcriptomes98. The estimated counts were read into R and DESeq2 was used to compute the differential expression, using a P-adjusted value of <0.01 as a significant threshold.

ChIP–seq was performed as previously described99 with modifications. Briefly, 100-ng chromatin per species was pooled per ChIP. Pooled chromatin was incubated at 4 °C for 12–14 h with rotation with 2.5-µg anti-H3K27ac (Abcam, ab4729) or 2.5-µg anti-H3K4me3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 07-473). Immunoprecipitated complexes were captured using a mix of Protein A (Sigma-Aldrich, 16-661) and Protein G magnetic beads (Sigma-Aldrich, 16-662), washed and reverse crosslinked for 30 min at 55 °C followed by an hour at 68 °C. Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using solid-phase reversible immobilization beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881). The NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England BioLabs) was used to produce the resulting ChIP libraries according to the manufacturer's protocol.

The data for C. reinhardtii and T. vaginalis were downloaded from ENA, belonging to previous studies55,100 (Supplementary Table 6, SRR numbers).

All ChIP–seq data were analyzed using fastp to trim reads, and the reads were mapped to the genomes using bowtie2 (v1.2), allowing a maximum insert size of 2,000 bp (-I 2000). Duplicate reads were removed using Sambamba (v0.6.6). DeepTools2 was used to generate bigwig files, compute insert size distributions and visualize epigenomic data, as well as the Integrative Genome Viewer. MACS3 (v3.0.0a7) was used to call peaks101, using a q value of 0.01 and adjusting the genome size to each species (for example, -q 0.01 -g 4e7), as well as activating the broad parameter for broad peak calling. Broad peaks were defined as those having >1,200 bp using their width distribution as a reference (Extended Data Fig. 9c). The H3K4me3 signal was clustered using DeepTools2 plotHeatmap function, allowing four k-means clusters (--k-means 4), providing the four categories shown in Fig. 5.

Histone H3K4me3 suppression drugs OICR-9424 (MedChemExpress, HY-16993) and Piribedil (Cayman Chemical, 3605-01-4) were diluted in DMSO at 50 mM and 100 mM, respectively, as stock solutions. For drug treatment experiments, 2.1 million A. castellanii cells were cultured in 42 ml of liquid media at 23 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were treated for 30 h with either 60-µM OICR-9424 or 300-µM OICR-9424, or with 5-µM Piribedil or 250-µM Piribedil. Two control samples were prepared by treating cells with 0.6% DMSO (for OICR-9424) and 0.2% DMSO (for Piribedil), adjusting the DMSO concentration to the highest inhibitor concentrations. Cells were collected by scraping the flasks and centrifuged at 3,000g for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were snap-frozen in liquid N2 for subsequent histone and DNA extraction.

Histones were extracted using an acid extraction protocol optimized for western blot analysis. Briefly, treated or control A. castellanii pellets were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in Triton Extraction Buffer (TEB; PBS containing 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 5 mM sodium butyrate and one Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet per 10 ml) at a density of 3 × 10−⁷ cells per ml. Cell lysis was performed on ice for 10 min with gentle agitation. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 650g for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were washed once with half the volume of TEB and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.2 N HCl at a density of 12 × 10⁷ nuclei per ml and incubated overnight at 4 °C to acid-extract histones. Samples were then centrifuged at 650g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris. The supernatant containing soluble histones was collected and neutralized with 2 M NaOH at one-tenth of the volume of the supernatant. Histone extracts were aliquoted and stored at −20 °C until further use.

Protein samples (5 µg for H3 and 12 µg for H3K4me3 detection) were mixed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 50-mM dithiothreitol and denatured by boiling at 100 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBST buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween-20) containing 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk.

Primary antibodies were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in TBST containing 1% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:10,000 in TBST with 1% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk.

Signal of the secondary antibody was detected with a FUSION Solo S (Vilber Lourmat).

The primary antibodies used were antihistone H3 (1:1,000; Abcam, ab1791), histone H3K4me3 (1:500; Active Motif, AB_2615077) and the secondary antibody goat antirabbit IgG (H + L; Invitrogen, 31462).

The genomes of N. gruberi and C. perkinsii were re-assembled for this study. We used Oxford Nanopore reads and performed conventional base calling with Guppy using the ‘sup' model and splitting chimeric reads. The resulting reads were then used as input for Flye (v2.9-b1768) using –nanopore_hq option, and allowing two steps of polishing102. Publicly available Illumina reads90 were used for polishing using HyPo103 (v1.0.3). For N. gruberi, the resulting contigs were scaffolded using Naegleria lovaniensis chromosome-scale genome104 with RagTag105 (v2.1.0). Publicly available RNA-seq for each species90,106 was aligned to the genomes using HISAT2 with the -dta parameter with a maximum intron size of 10 kb, and Stringtie (v2.1.2) was then used to predict transcript models96,97. In parallel, Trinity (v2.8.5) was used to build de novo transcriptome assemblies107, which were mapped to the genome using GMAP (14 October 2020). The best transcripts were selected using Mikado108 (v2.3.0), which were then used to generate exon hints for Augustus109 (v3.4.0). Liftoff110 (v1.6.3) was used to transfer annotations from the previous genome assemblies to the new assemblies90,111, which were then used as coding sequence hints. Then Augustus was trained on the best Mikado gene models for each species, and those species models were used to predict the genes with both exon and coding-sequence hints. In the last step, transcript UTRs were added to the Augustus gene models using PASA (v2.0.1) with the best Mikado transcripts as input112.

For C. limacisporum, C. variabilis, C. fragrantissima and A. whisleri, the annotations were also updated with available RNA-seq data to include UTRs and improve TSS annotation41,82,113. We used a combination of Trinity and Stringtie as described above to generate a nonredundant transcript set with Mikado, which was then used to update gene structures with PASA.

Repeat annotations were generated for species that lacked them, using RepeatModeler2 (v2.0.2a)114, including the LTR finding module, and mapping the consensus repeat library against the genome using RepeatMasker (v4.1.2-p1).

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Bulk RNA-seq experiments were performed in two replicates for N. gruberi and S. punctatus, while all available replicates from public datasets were used for other samples. ChIP–seq experiments were performed with at least two replicates, and Oxford Nanopore sequencing was performed with one replicate per stage or species. Drug treatment experiments and western blot were performed twice with similar results. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during the experiments or during outcome assessment.

a, Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with selected species from Fig. 1b highlighting the prokaryotic outgroups, color coded by bacterial lineage (for those bacteria with genus/species defined). Trichomonas vaginalis AMT1 sequences are highlighted in bold, whereas Asgardarchaeota are highlighted in red. Nodal supports represent SH-aLRT and ultrafast bootstrap values. b, Taxonomy count of MT-A70 BlastP searches against NCBI RefSeq_select database (January 2024). c, Heatmap showing the number of MT-A70 family members across a collection of 231 eukaryotic species covering a wide scope of known diversity. Classification obtained from a phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1b. Black triangles are the species sequenced in this study, and red arrows indicate lineages/species for which 6mA has been previously confirmed at robust high levels, white triangles indicate species for which 6mA is contested. d, Domain architectures of eukaryotic MT-A70 families, defined with Pfam domains MT-A70 (PF05063) and ZZ (PF00569).

Source data

a, Global correlation of 6mA levels in ApT dinucleotides. Pearson's correlation was calculated for ApT positions with at least 10x coverage on each strand. Please note the lack of correlation in AMT1-lacking species. b, Average methylation levels in 6mA and 5mC for three species that lack AMT1 or AMT6/7. Dictyostelium discoideum also lacks DNMTs and has previously been reported to lack 5mC; thus, the signal is likely noise (also driven by the low number of annotated TEs—88). Borders of genes and TEs are represented by the 5' and 3' sites. The first 1,500 bp post-TSS and before the TES are unscaled. c, Average 6mA levels around the transcriptional start site (TSS) in five species with high 6mA levels (Fig. 2a), divided by sequence context. AT dinucleotides are the preferentially methylated context, but the AA context also gets residual methylation on the same regions, yet on average less than the total 6mA methylation. The dashed line highlights the max reached by AA methylation. d, Average 6mA level plot around the TSS in species with marked ‘promoter' methylation patterns. Genes with a head-to-head orientation are displayed in blue and genes with a head-to-tail orientation are displayed in green. The black arrow shows the artifactual ‘promoter' peak driven by head-to-head-oriented genes.

Source data

a, Distribution of transcription levels of genes divided into ten deciles sorted by the gene body 6mA levels in the AT context. Number of genes in deciles shown on top. Boxplots show the median (centerline), interquartile range (box), and the smallest and largest values within 1.5× IQR (whiskers). b, Distribution of methylated AT sites (>10% 6mA) in gene bodies sorted in ten deciles by transcriptional level (numbers per deciles shown on top), where not expressed genes (TPM < 1) are all shown separately (total number on no. expr. category). ‘n = ' in parenthesis indicates the total amount of genes shown for each species. Boxplots show the median (centerline), interquartile range (box), and the smallest and largest values within 1.5× IQR (whiskers). c, Average 6mA levels in the AT context around the TSS for genes sorted by transcriptional levels as in b. Decile of expression color code shown in legend. TPM, Transcripts per Million.

Source data

The figure displays the number of 6mA-methylated versus unmethylated genes across transcriptional deciles. For methylated genes, bars are colour-coded to reflect the average 6mA at ApT percentage, while unmethylated genes are represented by grey bars.

Source data

a, Comparison of 6mA levels in ApT dinucleotides across two cell stages in four species. Only ApT sites with at least 10x coverage in both samples are shown. b, Boxplot displaying the transcriptional levels of genes with the variable 6mA levels (≥1.5% 6mApT gene difference) across cell stages. Total number of genes in each category shown in the x-axis labels. Each RNA-seq sample is color coded according to each species legend. Boxplots show the median (centerline), interquartile range (box), and the smallest and largest values within 1.5 × IQR (whiskers); points outside this range are plotted as outliers. c, Average methylation levels on methylated and unmethylated genes in N. gruberi. Methylated genes were defined using R9.4.1 and Guppy as base modification algorithm, whereas 23 °C and 30 °C samples were sequenced using R10.4.1 pore chemistry and 6mA calls done using Dorado. d, Boxplot displaying the transcriptional levels of genes with the variable 6mA levels (>1.5% 6mApT gene difference) across N. gruberi temperature treatments. Boxplots show the median (centerline), interquartile range (box), and the smallest and largest values within 1.5× IQR (whiskers); points outside this range are plotted as outliers.

Source data

a, Global correlation of 5mC levels at CpG dinucleotides. Pearson's correlation was calculated for CpG positions with at least 10× coverage on each strand, noting the lack of correlation in species lacking DNMT1/3/5. Global 5mCG levels were estimated using Oxford Nanopore data. Black triangles indicate species for which WGBS/EM-seq data have confirmed the presence of this modification, while white triangles indicate confirmed absence. b, The global genomic 6mA levels in AT context (red) are shown next to the observed versus expected ApT dinucleotide ratios (turquoise) in each of sampled genomes. An observed-to-expected ratio of 1 indicates that ApT dinucleotides are present at the expected ratio given the genomic AT%, whereas <1 levels indicate depletion and>1 levels indicate enrichment. For comparison, global genomic 5mC levels (shown as a fraction with maximum being 1.0 in red) in the CG context are shown next to the observed versus expressed CG dinucleotide context ratio (turquoise) for the same set of species.

Source data

Average 6mA levels in the AT context shown side by side to average ApT content in genes separated by their methylation status. Methylated genes are shown in dark blue (6mA plot) and dark red (ApT content plot), whereas unmethylated genes are shown in pale blue (6mA plot) and orange (ApT content plot). Windows for averaging are 10 bp long. Enrichment of ApT in the TSS is likely driven by lack or inaccurate UTR annotations in many gene models, with 5' end of genes being the start codon ‘ATG'. Gray dashed lines indicate the TSS position and the 6mApT peaks in each species.

a, Fraction of reads falling within MACS3 narrow peaks for all H3K4me3 datasets used in this study. b, Distribution of peak sizes called as narrow peaks. c, Broad peaks, in each species. d, Heatmap showing the % of 6mA at ApT sites and H3K4me3 ChIP–seq coverage on both broad (≥1200 bp) and narrow (<1200 bp) H3K4me3 peaks (as defined in c, with average metaplots summarizing the data). ChIP–seq data are presented as reads per million (RPM), and each plot is centered on the H3K4me3 peak midpoint. e, Boxplot of the percentage of 6mA at ApT sites on H3K4me3 peaks compared to genomic regions that do not overlap H3K4me3 peaks (spanning less than 3500 bp).

Extreme precipitation events are driven by complex multiscale atmospheric dynamic interactions, fuelled by available moisture. They are expected to intensify with climate change, posing increasing risks to human communities and ecosystems. However, current low-resolution climate models struggle to accurately represent key extreme precipitation-generating phenomena, limiting our ability to generate robust and reliable future projections. Here we present an ensemble of climate simulations with a 10-to-25-km resolution and an improved representation of mesoscale convective systems to assess future changes in daily extreme precipitation and its drivers. Our high-resolution simulations more realistically capture the observed spatial distribution and intensity of daily extreme precipitation over the historical period than the 100-km resolution counterparts. In a future scenario with high carbon dioxide emissions, daily extreme precipitation over land could increase by about 41% by 2100, mainly as a result of increased mesoscale moisture convergence. The impact of this dynamical contribution to extreme precipitation is underestimated by a factor of three in the low-resolution model. These results highlight the crucial role of high-resolution climate modelling in constraining future extremes and informing more effective climate risk assessments and adaptation strategies.

Personalized mRNA Vaccines Will Revolutionize Cancer Treatment—If Funding Cuts Don't Doom Them

Vaccines based on mRNA can be tailored to target a cancer patient's unique tumor mutations. But crumbling support for cancer and mRNA vaccine research has endangered this promising therapy

By Rowan Moore Gerety edited by Kate Wong

Tavis Coburn

As soon as Barbara Brigham's cancerous pancreatic tumor was removed from her body in the fall of 2020, the buzz of a pager summoned a researcher to the pathology department in Memorial Sloan Kettering's main hospital in New York City, one floor below. Brigham, now 79, was recovering there until she felt well enough to go home to Shelter Island, near the eastern tip of Long Island. Her tumor and parts of her pancreas, meanwhile, were sent on an elaborate 24-hour course through the laboratory. Hospital staff assigned the organ sample a number and a unique bar code, then extracted a nickel-size piece of tissue to be frozen at –80 degrees Celsius. They soaked it in formalin to prevent degradation, then set it in a machine that gradually replaced the water in each cell with alcohol.

Next, lab staff pinned the pancreas to a foam block, took high-resolution images with a camera fixed overhead and used a scalpel to remove a series of sections of tumor tissue. These sections were embedded in hot paraffin and cut into slices a fraction of the thickness of a human hair, which were prepped, stained and mounted on glass slides to be photographed again. By the time a pathologist looked at Brigham's tumor under a microscope the next day, more than 50 people had helped steer it through the lab. Still, this work was all a prelude.

The real action came some two months later, when Brigham returned to the hospital to receive a vaccine tailored to the mutations that differentiated her tumor from the rest of her pancreas. Made of messenger RNA (mRNA) suspended in tiny fat particles, the vaccine was essentially a set of genetic instructions to help Brigham's immune system go after the mutant proteins unique to her tumor cells. It was, in other words, her very own shot.

It's been four years since Brigham received the last of nine doses of her personalized vaccine. In that time she's seen one grandchild finish college and get married and another embark on a Ph.D. She has attended dozens of high school basketball and volleyball games for her third and fourth grandchildren and cradled the family's newest arrival, a granddaughter born last year. She hosts a weekly mah-jongg-and-dessert gathering for a group of friends on Shelter Island and tries to live out her mother's maxim of having “a little adventure” each and every day. “I'm a little crippled here and there with arthritis,” Brigham says, but “I never sit still.” And she remains free of pancreatic cancer.

Brigham's recovery came as part of a small phase 1 clinical trial conducted by Memorial Sloan Kettering in partnership with pharmaceutical companies Genentech and BioNTech—the latter, along with Pfizer, helped to produce the first approved mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. Brigham was one of 16 patients in the study who received the vaccine, administered in tandem with standard drugs, and one of eight who experienced a significant immune response. Six of those eight patients are still in remission, along with one of the eight others who did not show much immune response to the vaccine.



Seven of 16 might not sound like much. But that number suggests that the vaccine has tantalizing potential. Pancreatic cancer can be exceptionally fast-growing, and its first signs—weight loss, cramping, a touch of jaundice—are easily missed, so by the time it is diagnosed it is almost always lethal. Only 8 percent of patients with the most common form of the cancer, ductal adenocarcinoma, survive to the five-year mark, and the vast majority of people with the disease show little response to treatment.

The results of Brigham's trial were also an early sign that mRNA vaccines may be effective for a wide variety of cancers: whereas pancreatic cancer is known for its low rate of mutations, the earliest data on personalized mRNA vaccines came from studies of melanoma, which researchers had targeted specifically because it tends to mutate so frequently. An earlier phase 2 trial in patients with advanced melanoma found that for those who received both a personalized mRNA vaccine and so-called immune checkpoint inhibitors, the risk of death or recurrence decreased by almost half compared with those who got only checkpoint inhibitors. Ongoing companion trials are targeting kidney and bladder carcinomas and lung cancer. In each case, the vaccine is additive: administered after surgery and with standard drugs. The shot's job is to prime the immune system to recognize abnormal proteins arising from mutations and attack any lingering malignancy that escaped conventional treatments—or stamp out future recurrence.

Seeing promising results in fundamentally different kinds of tumors has motivated researchers to pursue personalized mRNA vaccines much more broadly. In doing so, they've developed an approach at the nexus of several important trends, pairing insights about our immune system's response to cancer with advances in vaccine production spurred by the COVID pandemic, the rise of algorithms powered by artificial intelligence, and the plummeting cost of genetic sequencing. Today there are at least 50 active clinical trials in the U.S., Europe and Asia targeting more than 20 types of cancer. A melanoma trial led by pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Merck has now reached phase 3, the last step before a medicine can be approved for public consumption. Personalized melanoma vaccines could be available as early as 2028, with mRNA vaccines for other cancers to follow.

But the promise of this novel approach couldn't have come at a more perilous time for the field. In the first weeks of the second Trump administration, U.S. cancer research was thrown into unprecedented turmoil as federal grants were terminated en masse. According to one Senate analysis, funding from the National Cancer Institute was cut by 31 percent in just the first three months of 2025.

By March cancer researchers worried that mRNA vaccines were facing particular scrutiny. KFF Health News reported that Michael Memoli, acting director of the National Institutes of Health, had asked that any grants, contracts or collaborations involving mRNA be flagged for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., best known prior to assuming that role as one of the nation's most prominent anti-vaccine campaigners. Suddenly, the optimism around personalized mRNA vaccines was overshadowed by a sense that the public investment that sustained cancer research was being dismantled piece by piece.

Much of cancer's biological power comes from the fact that to the body, it doesn't always seem like a pathogen. Because cancer arises from mutations in each patient's own DNA, the disease complicates our immune system's central task of differentiating between body and foreign object, host and invader, “self” and “not self.”

Physicians long hypothesized that there was a link between cancer and swelling—a critical sign that the immune system “sees” an enemy to ward off. In the 1890s William Coley, now known as the father of immunotherapy, successfully spurred remission in patients with inoperable tumors by injecting them with bacteria like those that cause strep throat. But the mechanisms behind Coley's treatments were poorly understood, and for decades after his discovery, researchers weren't sure our immune systems could detect cancer at all.

Because doctors didn't know exactly how the body perceives and responds to cancer, early treatments were highly invasive and highly toxic: The first tactic was major surgery on the organs where cancer was taking root. That was followed in the 20th century by the development of systemic radiation and chemotherapy to attack cancer cells throughout the body. Over time oncologists narrowed and refined these approaches incrementally, using more precise surgery, more focused radiation and chemo that killed fewer normal cells as collateral. Still, the dream was to harness immunotherapy, which represented a dramatic departure from the usual tactics in seeking to use the human body's own systems to go after cancer in a more targeted way.

As demand for COVID vaccines has slackened, there has been a rush to apply mRNA technology to a long list of illnesses.

The first real proof that immune cells are capable of recognizing tumors didn't come until the 1950s and 1960s. Gradually, researchers came to understand that cancer deploys a host of tricks to suppress the immune response to growing tumors. Some forms of cancer use fibrous tissue called stroma to construct shields that make it difficult for immune cells to penetrate or attack tumors. Other cancers take advantage of the balancing act our immune systems are always performing when they decide how heavily to invest the body's defenses in warding off a given threat. Some tumors produce proteins that can shut down key immune cells. Tumors may even recruit immune cells to promote the growth of blood vessels that will supply them with oxygen and nutrients.

As scientists learned more about how cancer manipulates the immune system, they started identifying ways to thwart it. Inside our cells, proteins are constantly being chopped up into smaller sequences of amino acids, some of which are then presented on the cell surface as part of what's collectively known as the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC—essentially the immune system's tool for differentiating self and foreign molecules. When the immune system detects a protein from a pathogen, it's supposed to dispatch killer T cells to eliminate the invader. Some cancers can interfere with this process by hijacking the checkpoint proteins that keep our immune system from revving out of control and using them to turn T cells off. Starting in the mid-1990s, several research teams found success by treating mice with checkpoint inhibitors, then a new class of drugs designed to keep tumor cells from concealing their identity and signaling, effectively, “nothing to see here.” Thirty years on, checkpoint inhibitors have become a transformative tool in cancer treatment, especially for melanoma.

The research that went into developing checkpoint inhibitors showed conclusively that immune cells detect cancer much in the same way they identify other pathogens: through differences in protein structure determined by DNA—a crucial insight. But as revolutionary as checkpoint inhibitors have been for immunotherapy, they don't work for everyone—far from it. Some 80 percent of patients do not respond to this class of drugs. Researchers are still trying to understand all the mechanisms that play a role in determining who does respond, but one key factor is whether the immune system is able to recognize tumor cells on the basis of their mutations.

This is where mRNA vaccines come in. Jason Luke, a melanoma researcher who now serves as chief medical officer of mRNA-medicine start-up Strand Therapeutics, helped to design several ongoing clinical trials of mRNA vaccines for cancer. He explains that both checkpoint inhibitors and mRNA vaccines build on our deep evolutionary adaptation for fighting pathogens by identifying the proteins they shed in our bodies. But checkpoint inhibitors are effective only if the patient's immune system recognizes the cancer as a threat. In contrast, mRNA vaccines have the potential to work even in patients whose cancers haven't spurred much immune response. The trick, Luke says, is using computational tools to decipher which of a given tumor's mutations are most likely to be found by the immune system.

On a Monday morning last April, I visited surgical oncologist Vinod Balachandran at his lab on the eighth floor of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Balachandran led the trial Brigham participated in, and he now is director of a center for cancer vaccines that the institution launched in 2024. The entrance to his lab is at the end of a hallway lined with big freezers holding tissue samples.

When I arrived, Balachandran met me just beyond a pair of swinging doors, where postdocs hunched over laptops under rows of high shelves packed with boxes of pipettes and assay plates. He strode to the window and pointed to the brick façade of the main hospital across the street, explaining that tissue samples taken after surgery have only a short distance to travel to the lab, sometimes through a tunnel under East 68th Street. “The proximity of the laboratory tower to where patients are being treated is actually supercritical,” he says, because it allows the samples to be processed and put on ice quickly, minimizing the deterioration that begins as soon as tissue is removed from the body.

The work that culminated in Brigham's vaccine grew out of research into a subset of pancreatic cancer survivors known as exceptional responders—the small percentage of people who make it to the five-year mark after a diagnosis. “These patients, you know, they're very rare,” Balachandran says. Even at a facility as large as Memorial Sloan Kettering, which sees tens of thousands of cancer patients a year, it was possible to study this group with any precision only because of the hospital's long-standing mandate to save samples of every patient's tissue. When Balachandran joined the faculty in 2015, his research on long-term survivors relied on tissue samples taken more than a decade earlier.

In 2017 Balachandran and his collaborators published a study demonstrating that some patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma had more cells able to recognize the unique proteins that mutant tumor cells produced and that their immune systems seemed to develop a kind of long-term memory to fight recurrence. In some cases, immune cells with receptors that could bind to these cancer proteins persisted in the blood for more than a decade after the tumors that spawned them were removed. What if, Balachandran wondered, we could equip the 92 percent of patients who are not naturally exceptional responders with the same kinds of biological tools? “If you can teach the immune system to recognize the proteins in, say, pancreatic cancer, perhaps that could provide a blueprint,” he says.

As tumors grow and metastasize, they undergo a kind of compressed evolution in which normal cells with the host's DNA accrue mutations that cause them to divide and multiply abnormally, forming an ever larger group of closely related tumor clones. Many mutations register in the form of abnormal proteins and protein fragments, called neoantigens, some of which accumulate on the surface of the proliferating tumor cells.

Balachandran compared this growing family tree of tumor clones with new variants in a group of viruses, like the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2, which emerged as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on. “You'd want a COVID vaccine to be able to target each different virus in that rapidly evolving clade,” Balachandran says.

For the development of a cancer vaccine, mapping the evolutionary trajectory of a cancerous tumor is equally important, albeit with a different set of parameters. The goal is not to distinguish between the presentations of two related pathogens but rather to understand at what point a disease derived from one's own body starts to register to the immune system as not self.

“At some point—we don't think immediately—the immune system starts to notice,” says Benjamin Greenbaum, Balachandran's colleague at Memorial Sloan Kettering's Olayan Center for Cancer Vaccines, who led the computational work behind the vaccine given to Brigham. In later stages, tumors typically accumulate signs of immune system involvement even if the immune response hasn't been effective—changes in the cell makeup of the microenvironment around the tumor, the display of checkpoint molecules. These signs can be understood as evolutionary adaptations on the part of the tumor in the race to evade detection, Greenbaum explains. “So then the question really became, Can we try to estimate what the immune system is really seeing in cancer?”

To develop a workable mRNA vaccine, Greenbaum and Balachandran had to both sequence the DNA of the cancerous tumors they were targeting and develop a framework for going after the right neoantigens—those abnormal proteins that offer clues to a tumor's underlying mutations. Neoantigens are made up of short chains of amino acids from proteins with names that look like license plate numbers: PIK3CA, KDM5C. One overarching goal of their collaboration is to discern meaningful patterns in the frequency of the sequences across patients and across cancer types. What neoantigens survive one mutation after another? Which ones show up reliably under certain conditions or look most distinctive to the body's immune defenses?

Some of these sequences, from so-called driver antigens, are present in most clones of a given tumor type. In pancreatic cancer, the driver mutation is often in a gene called KRAS, but the resulting antigens don't seem to elicit a reliable immune response in long-term survivors. Instead, when Balachandran and his colleagues sequenced the blood of such survivors, the immune cells present in the highest concentrations were those adapted to antigens resulting from one-off, or “passenger,” mutations.

Another threat to personalized mRNA vaccines for cancer was coming into focus: mounting federal hostility to vaccines.

In 2017, at the time that the team published the results of the study, this was a counterintuitive finding. For decades researchers pursuing vaccines and other immune treatments for cancer had focused on melanoma because melanoma tumors have a high rate of genetic mutations. “It looks very different to the immune system than many other types of cancers do,” says Michael Postow, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering who is involved in clinical trials of mRNA vaccines for melanoma. “That made it a good target.” With all the mutant antigens it produces, melanoma should attract the immune system's attention and trigger it to attack. The conventional wisdom about pancreatic cancer, in contrast, held that it produces so few mutations that it is unlikely to carry passenger antigens that could elicit an immune response.

With the results from the 2017 study of exceptional responders in hand, Balachandran was able to flip that argument on its head. Even if vaccines appear to be well suited for melanoma, there's always a degree of uncertainty in selecting the right antigens to target. For starters, the sequencing of a pancreatic tumor biopsy like Brigham's is really just a snapshot in time. Come back a few months or a few years later or wait for the patient to experience a recurrence, and there's no guarantee the tumor clone that seemed dominant at the time of the initial sequencing will still be a factor in the disease. Each mutation can also have unpredictable effects, with the size, shape or biochemistry of the antigen in question shifting dramatically in response to the change of even a single amino acid.

What is more, not every antigen that corresponds to either self or not self is reliably expressed on the surface of the corresponding cell. A neoantigen that seems characteristic of the tumor might have a profile nearly identical to that of another self-antigen somewhere else in the body. In that case, a vaccine based on that neoantigen might fail to elicit much of an immune response, or it could provoke a response against the wrong target.

The study revealed a potential liability in a strategy for personalized mRNA vaccines that focused on melanoma: melanoma's high rate of mutations gives rise to a large pool of plausible vaccine targets, but it presents just as many chances to guess wrong. A given tumor could have as many as 10,000 distinct proteins on the surface of its cells; you couldn't possibly target every one. But in pancreatic cancer, Balachandran realized, the smaller number of mutations might improve the odds of picking a suitable antigen to target.

That insight underpinned the pitch Balachandran brought to Ugur Sahin, co-founder and CEO of German biotech company BioNTech. Their collaboration began before the COVID pandemic, but in 2020 BioNTech was consumed by the effort to bring the world's first mRNA vaccine to market. Together with Moderna, the company demonstrated the vaccine's safety through billions of doses administered worldwide with very few side effects.

Not only was mRNA safe for vaccine delivery, but, as Sahin knew from experience, it is also a flexible platform for genetic information. Whereas traditional vaccines typically require ongoing production of the exact virus they're targeting, most of the genetic information in an mRNA vaccine can stay the same no matter which disease you're fighting.

BioNTech's COVID vaccine built on 30 years of work by Sahin and company co-founder Özlem Türeci that was originally intended for vaccines targeting cancer. As longtime collaborators who are also a married couple, they had tinkered with the nucleotide sequences on the molecule's cap and tail that direct a vaccine to the right part of the cell and tell the immune system what to pay attention to, and they had improved the mRNA's stability so that even a small dose of a vaccine could provoke a full-scale immune response. All that work could be incorporated into vaccines for other diseases; the only thing that needed to change was the genetic information in the middle of the molecule. After obtaining positive results for the mRNA vaccine for melanoma, Sahin agreed to partner with Balachandran to develop an mRNA vaccine for pancreatic cancer.

As global demand for COVID vaccines has slackened, there has been a mounting rush to apply mRNA technology to a long list of illnesses, including malaria, flu, tuberculosis and norovirus. Cancer is a natural target. Despite treatment advances, it remains broadly incurable and is a leading cause of death as life expectancies improve across the world. But because cancer vaccines must be personalized, the biggest change in approach to developing them for an mRNA platform comes not in development but in manufacturing. Both BioNTech and Moderna now confront something like the inverse of the challenge they faced in developing the first COVID shots.

Prior to the pandemic, both companies were upstarts among the giants of the pharmaceutical industry. Neither had brought a product to market. Moderna employed under 1,000 people and had manufactured fewer than 100,000 total doses of its clinical-stage vaccines. Once its SpikeVax received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the company quadrupled its workforce and produced more than a billion doses in just 18 months.

The task facing Scott Nickerson, who oversees Moderna's manufacturing for individualized neoantigen therapies, was to reengineer a process perfected for producing mRNA vaccines for millions of people in batches of thousands of liters. For personalized vaccines, each batch would be a few milliliters at most and would have to be turned around in weeks.

To get there, Moderna is investing heavily in automation, partnering with a robotics firm to prepare sterile kits of raw materials for each batch and thereby minimize operator touch time on the manufacturing floor. The hope is that rather than following a single large batch of vaccine through the entire manufacturing process, workers will eventually be able to move from one small batch to the next after setup.

At both Moderna and BioNTech, the complex logistics of conducting the dozens of different quality-control tests required for each production run falls to algorithms powered by AI. Before being approved for release, doses of SpikeVax underwent 40 distinct tests that tracked the chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology and sterility of every vial. With COVID vaccines, the sterility test alone, which ensures that vials are not contaminated with organisms, took two weeks. Refinements have since compressed that test to eight days, Nickerson says. Ultimately the goal is to shrink it to five days and complete the other tests within that same window. “The reason it's hard is we have to design the equipment,” he explains. “None of this stuff's off-the-shelf.”

At the same time, the background science is, at least in theory, easily adapted from work that's already been done. Lennard Lee, an adviser to the U.K.'s National Health Service overseeing the rollout of clinical trials for cancer vaccines, says the pandemic gave regulators there a running start on trials for mRNA cancer vaccines. In partnership with BioNTech, the NHS launched a program that aims to provide personalized vaccines to up to 10,000 cancer patients in the next five years. And the NHS and Moderna have invested in a facility that could produce up to 250 million vaccines per year.

In that interval, as manufacturers work to reduce production times and costs, clinical trials will evaluate alternative dosage and delivery mechanisms, Lee says. Although current protocol is for vaccines to target micrometastases—small groups of cancer cells that spread to other parts of the body and linger after cancerous tumors are removed surgically—there's no shortage of adjustments that might follow from more data or improved screening. Could one deliver a therapeutic vaccine to tackle a tumor before it is large enough to operate on? Or maybe one could even administer a prophylactic shot that prevents tumor formation in the first place?

With a unified health system and world-class research and manufacturing facilities, Lee says, the U.K. is well positioned to advance research that would answer such questions. Fully realizing the potential of personalized mRNA vaccines for cancer, however, will require more trials in the U.S., which has many more cancer research centers than the U.K. But the ability of the U.S. to lead this effort is now in jeopardy.

The federal government has long been the dominant source of funding for cancer research in the U.S. Miriam Merad, a cancer immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, says that in a typical year, funding from the NIH accounts for more than half of the research budget at her institution.

In President Donald Trump's first term, threatened cuts to the NIH never quite materialized. Society is not going to let that happen, Merad thought. But just weeks into Trump's second term, the NIH announced plans to limit indirect contributions to research grants to 15 percent, meaning that for every $100 in funding awarded, only $15 extra would be included for overhead—a dramatic departure from historical rates in the range of 50 to 60 percent.

“This is an operation,” Merad says, gesturing to the building where she works, which is dotted with six-figure pieces of equipment and has an entire floor dedicated to rearing mice used in research. “We have to pay salaries; we have to buy food for the animals. We have to pay service contracts because we have instruments that need to be serviced all the time.” These are not expenses that can be easily paused or restarted based on the fate of a single grant. Within just a few months of the NIH announcement, Merad's department had reduced hires of new postdocs, and Mount Sinai's medical school had to shrink the size of its incoming class.

By May another threat to personalized mRNA vaccines for cancer was coming into focus: mounting federal hostility to vaccines. Senate Republicans convened a hearing entitled “The Corruption of Science and Federal Health Agencies,” featuring the false claim that as many as three out of four deaths from COVID were caused by mRNA vaccines deployed to stop the pandemic. (In fact, COVID vaccinations saved an estimated 2.5 million lives between 2020 and 2024, according to a study published earlier this year.) In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which makes recommendations on federal vaccine policy. He eventually replaced them with his own advisory committee, which includes several anti-vaccine stalwarts. Kennedy has also slashed research funding for mRNA vaccines. In August he canceled nearly $500 million supporting the development of mRNA vaccines against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. The move intensified the fears of researchers who want to develop mRNA vaccines for other illnesses, among them cancer.

After my visit to Memorial Sloan Kettering, Balachandran's team shared a chart that plotted Brigham's immune response to her personalized mRNA vaccine. Along the bottom, triangles marked the dates of her surgery and each of the nine doses of the vaccine she received over the course of a year. Above them a cluster of brightly colored lines showed the share of her body's T cells targeting the specific mutant proteins in her cancerous tumor. At first, when Brigham's tumor was removed, cells trained to go after each cancer clone were somewhere on the order of one in 500,000 T cells in her blood. A few months after surgery, when she'd had four doses of the vaccine, the lines shot up almost vertically, showing that the most common cancer fighter at that point accounted for around one in 20 to one in 50 T cells—an increase of more than 20,000-fold.

Those T cells dipped a bit in the months before Brigham's last booster shot, given almost a year after her tumor was removed. But they remained in the same range even three years on. A phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in a larger patient group is currently underway.

The vaccine for Brigham's cancer was just nine tiny vials of liquid administered through an IV, a private message that only her immune system was meant to decode. But the effort that delivered that coded message was a deeply collective enterprise, one that stretches back through the hundreds of thousands of tissue samples collected, stored and analyzed at Memorial Sloan Kettering, each one taken from the body of a patient who might not have survived their cancer. Also in that vaccine were the contributions of generations of taxpayers who never got to see these results. Perhaps their descendants will be able to beat the disease—if society continues to support this vital work.

In the last few minutes Cloudflare has confirmed it is aware of a major issue affecting its Global Network, which is causing widespread internet outages ranging from platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to ChatGPT, and, ironically, Downdetector. A wave of other websites and services are also experiencing outages.

Cloudflare's latest update says: "Update - We continue to see errors drop as we work through services globally and clearing remaining errors and latency."

Looks like this one is winding up folks, with most errors and disruption now cleared.

I won't mince words: earlier today we failed our customers and the broader Internet when a problem in Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us. The sites, businesses, and organizations that rely on Cloudflare depend on us being available and I apologize for the impact that we caused. Transparency about what happened matters, and we plan to share a breakdown with more details in a few hours. In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services. This was not an attack. That issue, impact it caused, and time to resolution is unacceptable. Work is already underway to make sure it does not happen again, but I know it caused real pain today. The trust our customers place in us is what we value the most and we are going to do what it takes to earn that back.

 




The Downdetector outage graph is going down! Just 1,660 reported outages right now.

Hi Sydney, Australia readers!

Don't worry if you have issues, this is a planned scheduled maintenance and not part of the global outage. Which should hopefully be coming to an end.

In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.Nov 18, 2025 - 15:01 UTC

Scheduled - We will be performing scheduled maintenance in SYD (Sydney) datacenter on 2025-11-18 between 15:00 and 19:00 UTC.Traffic might be re-routed from this location, hence there is a possibility of a slight increase in latency during this maintenance window for end-users in the affected region. For PNI / CNI customers connecting with us in this location, please make sure you are expecting this traffic to fail over elsewhere during this maintenance window as network interfaces in this datacentre may become temporarily unavailable.You can now subscribe to these notifications via Cloudflare dashboard and receive these updates directly via email, PagerDuty and webhooks (based on your plan): https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/notification-available/#cloudflare-status.Nov 18, 2025 15:00-19:00 UTC

What does "monitoring" mean?

In incident management, monitoring is when the incident team watches how a fix works in the real world. Ideally, fixes are tested in an environment before they are unleashed to the public. The team will look for issues and ask for reports from a number of sources with which they have close ties.

These issues are not incidents in the traditional sense, rather they are used to tweak the fix, with the hope that they resolve the incident.

Another update from Cloudflare

Update - Some customers may be still experiencing issues logging into or using the Cloudflare dashboard. We are working on a fix to resolve this, and continuing to monitor for any further issues.Nov 18, 2025 - 14:57 UTC

 




Time to check Downdetector's outage graph!

At 14:19 GMT, there were a reported 11,145 Cloudflare issues logged to the site.

Over at Cloudflare, the latest update states that

Monitoring - A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal.Nov 18, 2025 - 14:42 UTC

Could the end of this outage be nigh? Stay tuned!

This is a little worrying, but according to TunaTops in the comments for this story, PADS (Personnel Access Data System) a background check site for nuclear plants is also impacted by the Cloudflare outage. This means that visitor access to their respective nuclear plant is currently not available.

PADS is software used in the US commercial nuclear industry to manage access authorization for workers. This includes tracking their fitness for duty and training. Only authorized personnel, who have cleared background checks and completed training have access to nuclear power facilities.

PADS has nothing to do with running the nuclear power station, but it does impact who is working there. But dear reader, there is nothing to worry about.

My kid's daycare reverted to the 1990's. While they usually use tablets connected to an app parents can look at to check kids in and out (and also food and diapers), they're doing everything by hand. Godspeed to the two teachers and 10 toddlers.

Cloudflare's latest update has restored dashboard services, but outages remain.

Update - We've deployed a change which has restored dashboard services. We are still working to remediate broad application services impactNov 18, 2025 - 14:34 UTC

Another update from Cloudflare, but no fix yet.

Update - We are continuing to work on a fix for this issue.Nov 18, 2025 - 14:22 UTC

Not even lunch is safe from Cloudflare's current outage, according to one Reddit user. McDonalds' self-service ordering system has been photographed as being impacted by the dreaded errors which have plagued wide swathes of the internet over the last few hours.

Our colleagues at TechRadar acquired a statement directly from CloudFlare itself, as the service continues to investigate the ongoing downtime. The statement reads:

"We saw a spike in unusual traffic to one of Cloudflare's services beginning at 11:20 UTC. That caused some traffic passing through Cloudflare's network to experience errors. We do not yet know the cause of the spike in unusual traffic. We are all hands on deck to make sure all traffic is served without errors. After that, we will turn our attention to investigating the cause of the unusual spike in traffic. We will post updates to cloudflarestatus.com and more in-depth analysis when it is ready to blog.cloudflare.com."

 




ChatGPT is also suffering from "intermittent access issues". OpenAI has issued an update on its status page that the incident is "caused by an issue with one of our third-party service providers". No prizes for guessing which provider that might be.

The ongoing Cloudflare outage isn't only affecting services, but also websites like The Register, Notebookcheck, and Videocardz, which all display an Error 500 message when attempting to access them. Stay tuned to Tom's Hardware for more updates.

The free MMORPG, Runescape has been impacted by the Cloudflare outage with players turning to Reddit to report that they cannot log in nor use the wiki.

Another update, but nothing to get excited about, yet!

Update - We are continuing working on restoring service for application services customers.Nov 18, 2025 - 13:35 UTC

 




Is the Windscribe VPN another victim of the Cloudflare outage? We don't know because the status page is also down. Stewart is not having a good day, he uses it to check our deals.

 




Lets take another look at Downdectors graph of reported Cloudflare issues.

After a large spike at 11:45AM GMT (4,558 reports) things have calmed a little, with 1,927 reports at 12:45PM. As we know, the sys admins at Cloudflare are working on the issue, so it is now just a matter of time, and a constant of supply of coffee until the teams have things up and running again.

According to its status page, ClaudAI is suffering a major outage due to Cloudflare's own outage.

The old adage of "Don't put your eggs all in one basket" is once again being proven by another Internet outage.

 




WARP is back online! Could this indicate that things will soon be working again?

Update - We have made changes that have allowed Cloudflare Access and WARP to recover. Error levels for Access and WARP users have returned to pre-incident rates. We have re-enabled WARP access in London.We are continuing to work towards restoring other services.Nov 18, 2025 - 13:13 UTC

Well, this means that Steward and I can't work on any new graphics this afternoon! Canva, the online design suite is also impacted by Cloudflare.

 




According to Cloudflare's Status page.

Identified - The issue has been identified and a fix is being implemented.Nov 18, 2025 - 13:09 UTC

Hold on to your hats! Things are going to get a little bumpy while the fix proliferates across the Internet.

According to the latest Cloudflare update

"During our attempts to remediate, we have disabled WARP access in London. Users in London trying to access the Internet via WARP will see a failure to connect."

But what is WARP? Faster than light travel for starships?

Sadly not, Cloudflare's WARP is seemingly a tool to secure internet connections by encrypting all traffic from a user's device. It is mainly used as a privacy tool for consumers and corporate customers. Unlike a VPN, warp does not hide your IP address, it merely encrypts your traffic.

Just a couple of months ago, Cloudflare blocked a record-setting 11.5Tbps DDoS attack two months after the previous record-setting DDoS attack

It seems that this could be another attempt to launch a DDOS on Cloudflare. If so, who is leading this and why?

A mere 16 minutes after the previous update, Cloudflare has updated the page with the same message as before.

Update - We are continuing to investigate this issue.Nov 18, 2025 - 12:53 UTC

Why the same message? Because they are still investigating the issue, and because the incident management team will have to provide timely updates for their service level agreement. In a previous life I was an incident manager, so I can imagine the situation at Cloudflare's office.

Even 3D printer enthusiasts are feeling the sting of Cloudflare's outage. I visited Printables and Thangs to search for some fish bone models to print (long story) and both have the dreaded HTTP 500 error code.

 




X is down again and the Cloudflare information page shows that the issue is occurring on its systems. My browser and the X servers are both working, but Cloudflare's infrastructure is not. An error code 500 confirms that it is a Cloudflare server issue.

Over on the Cloudflare System Status page we can see that Cloudflare are still investigating the issue (12:37 UTC). Services have started to recover, but there will be higher than normal error rates while the sys admins work on fixing the issue.

The investigation is looking into HTTP 500 errors (errors occurring at the server level) that impact the dashboard and the Cloudflare API.

Could we soon be making the usual "It's not DNS... it was DNS" jokes? Was someone vibe coding the DNS entries? We'll find out when the post mortem happens.

 




Downdetector, the outage monitoring site saw 11,201 reports of issues at 11:37AM GMT today. At the last data point, there are 6,570 reports. This could mean that the fix is making its way across the Internet, or that people know about the issue, and and no longer reporting it.

X (formerly Twitter) has been experiencing intermittent issues as a result of the outage. The platform is currently available, but availability has been patchy for the last hour or so.

Cloudflare says "We are working to understand the full impact and mitigate this problem. More updates to follow shortly."

Cloudflare was previously undergoing scheduled maintenance at 10am UTC, according to the company's website. However, the latest update into Cloudflare's System Status states:

 Cloudflare is aware of, and investigating an issue which impacts multiple customers: Widespread 500 errors, Cloudflare Dashboard and API also failing.

In the last few minutes Cloudflare has confirmed it is aware of a major issue affecting its Global Network, which is causing widespread internet outages ranging from platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to ChatGPT, and, ironically, Downdetector. A wave of other websites and services are also experiencing outages.

UJET, a San Francisco-based company that sells AI-powered contact center technology, has acquired Spiral, a Seattle startup that helps businesses analyze customer conversations. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Spiral will operate as “Spiral by UJET,” continuing to support its customers as a standalone offering while also integrating into UJET's cloud contact center platform.

Founded in 2018 by former Amazon engineers Elena Zhizhimontova and Andrew DiLosa, Spiral uses AI to automatically detect and categorize issues raised across phone calls, chats, emails, surveys and social media. The technology is designed to help companies uncover product and support problems. Customers include Owlet, Whitepages and Turo.

“UJET's acquisition of Spiral will provide businesses with a unified view of all customer conversations for more proactive, personalized service,” UJET CEO Vasili Triant said in a statement.

Spiral previously raised nearly $7 million from investors including Trilogy Equity Partners, Bezos Expeditions, Techstars, Alumni Ventures Group, Ensemble, and the Alexa Fund. The startup has less than 10 employees — all will join UJET, including Zhizhimontova, now vice president of applied AI. The company competes in a growing category of startups applying AI to customer feedback.

As Nicholas Rudder built his last startup, an educational marketplace called ScholarSite, he kept running into the same problem: tax.  

“Marketplaces are liable for tax on their entire GMV (gross merchandise value) not just their take rate, so every new country meant a maze of registrations, filings, deadlines, and risk,” Rudder told TechCrunch. “It became a constant distraction. Instead of building the business, I was spending time deciphering international compliance rules I never wanted to become an expert in.”  

As he and co-founder Adrian Sarstedt were looking to shut down ScholarSite (later calling it Sphere), Rudder decided to keep the name but turn the product into something new.  

“The world was going global, but compliance infrastructure hadn't kept up,” Rudder said.  

In 2023, he alone launched Sphere as a tax software vendor that helps companies stay in compliance as they scale across borders. The company targets Series B to IPO stage companies with a global customer base, Rudder said.  

“We help companies collect tax on customer transactions,” he continued, explaining that companies have to collect tax on purchases and remit it to authorities each month or quarter. 

Sphere helps “automate registration, calculation, filing, and remittance obligations for companies,” he said. Sphere spent two years in stealth before officially launching, and clients now include the vibe coding platforms Lovable and Replit, as well as the AI voice company ElevenLabs.  

As an ed-tech marketplace, it raised a $4.3 million seed. On Tuesday, as a tax platform, Sphere announced a $21 million Series A led by a16z. 

Rudder says the product takes less than 24 hours to set up. It has integrations into major billing platforms, like Stripe and Campfire, allowing Sphere to pull a company's transaction data and assess global tax exposure, he said. Calculating the taxability of a transaction is where Sphere's AI tax review and assessment model engine comes in, he said — or, in other words, TRAM.  

“TRAM ingests and codifies the rules in every jurisdiction and creates a set of tax determinations” — like if something can be taxed or not — “along with reasoning and backing citations for that determination,” Rudder, the company's CEO, explained.  

Sphere's human team reviews and approves the outputs of TRAM, and approves them so that it can be pushed into a tax engine that applies tax to transactions in real time.  

“That part of the system has no AI so there is zero chance of hallucinations.”  

Sphere also monitors how much tax a company owes in what region, and is integrated directly into more than 100 tax authorities in the world, so companies can register for various tax jurisdictions directly through Sphere.  

“Once they submit a registration, we send that information to the tax authorities and let the company know when their registration is processed and when they can start collecting tax in that region,” Rudder said.  

Finally, Sphere helps with filing and remittance. It automatically generates tax returns and submissions, Rudder said, debits back tax returns to its customers' bank accounts and pays tax authorities. It's the product he wanted when he was building his first company.  

Others in this market include legacy players Anrok and Avalara.  

Although Stripe also has a global tax calculation and collection service, Rudder does not consider Stripe a competitor but a partner.  

“Sphere is one of only three tax vendors globally with a native integration to Stripe's Billing and Checkout products,” he said, adding that the company also has use cases that Stripe doesn't have, such as being able to fulfil the end-to-end compliance lifecycle. 

Rudder described his funding process as “unintentional.” He said he was looking to raise at the time, but knew he needed to move fast to execute on his ambitions.  

“When we met a16z and heard what they'd done for similar companies in the compliance and fintech space, we knew they were the right partner,” Rudder said. 

Marc Andrusko, a partner at a16z, said the VC firm first met Rudder back when he was working on ScholarSite. “While we didn't get all the way to a term sheet for that business, it was clear Nick had the horsepower, grit, and drive needed to be an exceptional founder,” Andrusko told TechCrunch.  

A few years later, Andrusko said the team started hearing whispers about how promising a new company called Sphere was becoming. “It took all of five minutes to put together that it was Nick's new business post-pivot, and we immediately reached out to get the update.”  

One aspect of the business that impressed Andrusko was how integrated Sphere was into local geographies.  

“Whereas both legacy players and many of the more recent venture-backed startup competitors often hand customers off to third-party consulting firms to manage certain geographies, Sphere took the time to build integrations into local rails plus AI automations that allow it to facilitate the entire sales tax compliance process completely end-to-end,” Andrusko said.  

YC and Felicis Ventures also participated in the round. The fresh capital will be used to build out more infrastructure to connect with more local tax authorities; expand its AI and engineering team, and build out an international sales team. 

“I want this product to be the indispensable tool that finance teams look to when they want to expand into a new market,” Rudder said. “Not just for indirect tax, but for every form of transactional compliance they may not even realize they're exposed to.”  

This piece was updated to clarify that Sarstedt is no longer at the company.

The University of Washington today announced a $10 million gift from Microsoft pioneer Charles Simonyi and his wife, Lisa Simonyi, to launch AI@UW, a campus-wide initiative supporting the university's leadership in the responsible, effective use of artificial intelligence in the classroom and research.

The initiative creates a new Vice Provost for Artificial Intelligence position, with Professor Noah Smith of the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering serving in the inaugural role.

Smith said there's a huge amount of expertise around smart AI adoption at the UW, “and what I really want to do is connect all of that, bring it together, map out what people already know and are doing, cast the light on it so we can all learn from each other more effectively and accelerate it.”

Professors are eager — perhaps even desperate — for support navigating AI's role in education. 

“If you ask faculty what's the one question on their minds right now, it's: ‘My students are using AI. What now? What am I supposed to do? How do we respond to this?'” Smith said.

The UW's response is setting a path where AI assists students by answering questions or prepping study tools, but doesn't do the work for them. On the faculty side, it can aid in creating fair and useful tests and evaluations. Smith is advocating for conversations and transparency in helping students find the balance where AI complements their academic journey, but doesn't replace their education.

“You don't go to university,” he said, “if you don't actually want to learn.”

A key component of AI@UW is its grant program — SEED-AI, which stands for Supporting Educational Excellence and Discovery. The grants will provide funding to faculty across the university who have innovative, exploratory approaches for using AI in their courses that could be widely adopted. The call for grant proposals should go out in the next few weeks. 

Smith highlighted three additional focus areas: 

UW President Robert Jones said the initiative and new vice provost role will help the university maintain its “strategic advantage” as a leader in AI. 

“We need somebody that wakes up each and every day that thinks about AI across the three parts of our mission: our teaching, our research and our innovation agenda,” Jones said in a GeekWire interview. “So that's the value proposition.”

Including the donation announced today, Charles and Lisa Simonyi have given more than $27.5 million to the UW since 2009, supporting DIRAC (Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics & Cosmology), the Ana Mari Cauce Welcome Center and the Allen School building.

Charles Simonyi, who has a net worth north of $8 billion, was a groundbreaking software architect at Microsoft and remains a technical fellow with the Redmond, Wash.-based company, while Lisa Simonyi is chair of the UW Foundation Board.

The new gift also establishes the Charles and Lisa Simonyi Endowed Chair for Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies, with Smith selected as the inaugural recipient. 

And in addition to his role at the Allen School, Smith is also affiliated with the Department of Linguistics, the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences, the eScience Institute, and the Stroum Center for Jewish Studies, providing useful experience in working across disciplines.

Smith is reaching out to other institutions who are likewise pioneering programs to employ AI on campus to learn about their efforts, but added that the UW has an advantage with the new funding. “The Simonyi gift,” he said, “is going to set us ahead.”



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Satya Nadella recently foreshadowed a major shift in the company's business — saying the tech giant will increasingly build its products and infrastructure not just for human users, but for autonomous AI agents that operate as a new class of digital workers.

“The way to think about the per-user business is not just per user, it's per agent,” the Microsoft CEO said during his latest appearance on Dwarkesh Patel's podcast.

At its Ignite conference this week, the company is starting to show what that means. Microsoft is unveiling a series of new products that give IT departments a way to manage and secure their new AI workforce, in much the same way as HR oversees human employees.

The big announcement: Microsoft Agent 365, a new “control plane” that functions as a central management dashboard inside the Microsoft 365 Admin Center that IT teams already use. 

Its core function is to govern a company's entire AI workforce — including agents from Microsoft and other companies — by giving every agent a unique identification. This lets companies use their existing security systems to track what agents are doing, control what data they can access, and prevent them from being hacked or leaking sensitive information.

Microsoft's approach addresses what has become a major headache for businesses in 2025: “Shadow AI,” with employees turning to unmanaged AI tools at growing rates. 

It also represents a big opportunity for the tech industry, as tech giants look to grow revenue to match their massive infrastructure investments. The AI agent market is expanding rapidly, with Microsoft citing analyst estimates of 1.3 billion agents by 2028. Market research firms project the market will grow from around $7.8 billion in 2025 to over $50 billion by 2030.

Google, Amazon, and Salesforce have all rolled out their own agentic platforms for corporate use — Google with its Gemini Enterprise platform, Amazon with new Bedrock AgentCore tools for managing AI agents, and Salesforce with Agentforce 360 for customer-facing agents.

Microsoft is making a series of announcements related to agents at Ignite, its conference for partners, developers, and customers, taking place this week in San Francisco. Other highlights:

As a backbone for the announcements, Agent 365 leverages Microsoft's entrenched position in corporate identity and security systems. Instead of asking companies to adopt an entirely new platform, it's building AI agents into tools that many businesses already use. 

For example, in the Microsoft system, each agent gets its own identity inside Microsoft Entra, formerly Active Directory, the same system that handles employee logins and permissions.

Microsoft is rolling out Agent 365 starting this week in preview through Frontier, its early-access program for its newest AI innovations. Pricing has not yet been announced.

From Intel to TSMC and back?

Taiwanese authorities have opened a national-security-related inquiry involving a former TSMC R&D executive who may have passed the company's trade secrets to a foreign company. The person in question is Wei-Jen Lo, according to a spokesperson for the High Prosecutors Office, who spoke to Nikkei Asia. Yet, for now the investigation is focused on finding out whether there was an intentional or unlawful transfer of TSMC's trade secrets to a foreign entity.

Wei-Jen Lo, a long-time executive at TSMC and Intel, this year retired from the Taiwanese foundry giant after spending 21 years at the company and building one of the strongest semiconductor R&D teams in the industry. However, instead of enjoying life, he unexpectedly surfaced at Intel in late October. Furthermore, he allegedly took a large collection of confidential materials related to TSMC's leading-edge process technologies with him, reports Liberty Times. Keep in mind that we are dealing with unofficial information, and both Intel and TSMC have declined to comment on the matter.

Wei-Jen Lo reportedly rejoined Intel as 'vice president of R&D' in late October, about three months after departing TSMC, according to a TrendForce report. But before leaving TSMC, Lo allegedly used his authority as the senior vice president of corporate strategy development to instruct subordinates to provide him copies of restricted technical documents covering TSMC's N2, A16, A14, and post-A14 process technologies and their derivatives, according to Liberty Times. Since Lo was a high-ranking executive, such requests appeared routine, so no internal security flags were raised at the time, Liberty Times asserts.

If the report from Liberty Times is to be believed, then Wei-Jen Lo is responsible for 'advanced equipment and module development from R&D up to pre-mass-production' at Intel, which does not look like a description of a 'VP of R&D' position. However, if the information is correct, it essentially means he is overseeing new production equipment and process modules before they are handed over to full-scale production. At first glance, such responsibilities may be too low for a VP as large chipmakers tend to have 'module owner,' or 'process owner,' responsible for a particular line of work within a broader process technology development process. However, as equipment tuning and the right tool settings are incredibly important for semiconductor performance and yields, Intel might establish a position overseeing new fab tools before they are used for mass production.

If this is indeed the case, could TSMC's secret documents covering the company's N2, A16, A14, and post-A14 process technologies help Wei-Jen Lo and Intel? Hardly. Intel's 18A process technology is already in mass production, and only Intel engineers can tune it to get lower defect density, improve CD uniformity, etc.

Furthermore, 18A is different from both N2 and A16 across so many aspects (e.g., 18A uses pattern shaping, N2 does not, A16 uses Super Power Rail backside power delivery that connects power directly to each transistor's source and drain, 18A's PowerVia delivers power to transistor contacts) that TSMC's experience is hardly significantly valuable for Intel's engineers, but is valuable for the company's competitive analysis team. As for information about more sophisticated nodes, Intel's 14A and TSMC's A14 will again be very different, as the former plans to use High-NA EUV lithography tools for critical layers, whereas the latter will rely on Low-NA EUV litho tools and multipatterning.

Meanwhile, as one of the leaders of advanced technology development at TSMC in recent years, he could bring valuable cultural input to Intel's process development, process integration, and manufacturing organization

Lo's departure was originally treated as a celebratory milestone. TSMC held a farewell event honoring his 21 years of service, and after leaving, he received the ITRI Fellow distinction, presented in person by Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim. Since TSMC believed he was retiring, it appears he was not asked to sign a non-compete agreement, a customary requirement for departing executives that expressly forbids employment at competing firms for 18 months, with half-salary compensation. However, now TSMC is reportedly investigating whether Lo indeed took trade secrets with him.

Most recently, Wei-Jen Lo served as senior vice president, overseeing technology development within the R&D organization at TSMC. He joined the company in 2004, initially taking charge of Operations II as a vice president. From 2006 through 2009, he led the R&D division, after which he transitioned into a role managing the firm's Advanced Technology Business along with manufacturing-technology operations. Under his leadership, his organization has accumulated over 1,500 patents worldwide, including approximately 1,000 filed in the United States.

Before moving to TSMC, Dr. Lo held senior technical and production roles at Intel, including oversight of the company's development site in Santa Clara between 1997 and 2000, according to The Org. His earlier career included teaching at an American university and research positions at Motorola's R&D organization and the Xerox Microelectronics Center.

On Tuesday, Google released Gemini 3, its latest and most advanced foundation model, which is now immediately available through the Gemini app and AI search interface.

Coming just seven months after the Gemini 2.5 release, the new model is Google's most capable LLM yet, and an immediate contender for the most capable AI tool on the market. The release also comes less than a week after OpenAI released GPT 5.1, and a mere two months after Anthropic released Sonnet 4.5 — a reminder of the blistering pace of frontier model development.

A more research-intensive version of the model, called Gemini 3 Deepthink, will also be made available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks, once it passes further rounds of safety testing.

“With Gemini 3, we're seeing this massive jump in reasoning,” said Tulsee Doshi, Google's head of product for the Gemini model. “It's responding with a level of depth and nuance that we haven't seen before.”

Some of that reasoning power is already registering on independent benchmarks. With a score of 37.4, the model marked the highest score on record on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark, meant to capture general reasoning and expertise. The previous high score, held by GPT-5 Pro, was 31.64. Gemini 3 also topped the leaderboard on LMArena, a human-led benchmark that measures user satisfaction.

According to Google, the Gemini app currently has more than 650 million monthly active users, and 13 million software developers have used the model as part of their workflow.

Alongside the base model, Google also released a Gemini-powered coding interface called Google Antigravity, allowing for multi-pane agentic coding similar to agentic IDEs like Warp or Cursor 2.0. Specifically, Antigravity combines a ChatGPT-style prompt window with a command-line interface and a browser window that can show the impact of the changes made by the coding agent.

“The agent can work with your editor, across your terminal, across your browser to make sure that it helps you build that application in the best way possible,” said DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu.

The frenzy of AI deals and cloud partnerships reached another zenith Tuesday morning as Microsoft, Nvidia, and Anthropic announced a surprise alliance that includes a $5 billion investment by Microsoft in Anthropic — which, in turn, committed to spend at least $30 billion on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.

Nvidia, meanwhile, committed to invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic to ensure the Claude maker's frontier models are optimized for its next-generation Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin chips.

The deal reflects growing moves by major AI players to collaborate across the industry in an effort to build and expand capacity and access to next-generation AI models. Microsoft recently renegotiated its partnership with OpenAI and has been increasingly partnering with others in the industry. 

Anthropic has been closely tied to Amazon, which has committed to invest a total of $8 billion in the startup. Anthropic says in a post that Amazon remains its “primary cloud provider and training partner” for AI models. We've contacted Amazon for comment on the news. 

OpenAI, for its part, recently announced a seven-year, $38 billion agreement with Amazon to expand its AI footprint to the Seattle tech giant's cloud infrastructure.

Beyond the massive capital flows, the Microsoft-Nvidia-Anthropic partnership expands where enterprise customers can access Anthropic's technology. According to the announcement, Microsoft customers will be able to use its Foundry platform to access Anthropic's next-generation frontier models, identified as Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Claude Haiku 4.5.

Microsoft also committed to continuing access for Claude across its Copilot family, ensuring the models remain available within GitHub Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and Copilot Studio.

The news comes as Microsoft holds its big Ignite conference in San Francisco.

A new Seattle-based startup called Peasy has raised a $2 million pre-seed round to challenge the status quo for independent consumer-goods brands — and it's doing it by giving software away for free.

The company, founded this year by former Shelf Engine execs Ryan Conti and Bryan Mitchiner, has built an operating system that centralizes inventory and operations for independent food, beverage, and beauty companies that traditionally have relied on spreadsheets. 

The company said it's helping brands reduce manual data entry by around 60%. The software can also forecast low stock, new manufacturing needs, and changes in demand.

Conti and Mitchiner met at Shelf Engine, the Seattle startup that helped grocers optimize ordering and was acquired earlier this year. Mitchiner also previously founded and sold a CPG brand, Mustard & Co.

Peasy's most unusual strategic element is its pricing: the core inventory management software is completely free. 

The decision to forgo a traditional subscription fee came from a simple realization: “We're competing with spreadsheets… and spreadsheets are free,” the company noted in a recent post.

Peasy plans to monetize by charging standard payment processing fees on transactions that run through the system, such as payments to suppliers and invoices to customers. This creates a “harmonic business model,” according to Aviel Ginzburg, general partner at Founders' Co-op, which co-led the round with Bread and Butter Ventures.

“It's not a business built around software that you pay for — it's mutually aligned outcomes where both the customer and the vendor share in the upside as they scale,” Ginzburg said. 

Peasy's unique pricing model comes amid growing discussion among tech leaders about how companies will pay for software in the age of AI. Some argue that AI-native businesses are shifting away from traditional seat-based subscription fees toward consumption- or outcome-based pricing.

Conti described the company's fundraising journey in a LinkedIn post: “Free is a hell of a wedge.”

Peasy is working with eight design partners, including Seattle ice cream company Frankie & Jo's, and has another 30 brands on its waitlist.

Founders' Co-op previously invested Row Zero, another Seattle startup rethinking spreadsheets. Ginzburg said the firm is “obsessed with businesses that compete with spreadsheets.”

The internet is down (again).

A wide range of websites (including our very own gizmodo.com) were down on Tuesday morning due to an outage involving internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare.

According to DownDetector, other websites affected by the outage were X, Spotify, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Trump's social media website Truth Social, gay dating app Grindr, online design platform Canva, and the movie rating app Letterboxd. Even DownDetector's own website was briefly impacted by the outage.

“Cloudflare is experiencing an internal service degradation. Some services may be intermittently impacted,” Cloudflare said in a status update shortly before 7 am ET.

At 8:09 ET, the company shared that the issue had “been identified and a fix is being implemented,” but recovery was somewhat patchy. Dashboard services were restored at 9:34 ET, according to Cloudflare.

Cloudflare told Gizmodo that prior to the first status update being issued, they saw “a spike in unusual traffic” to one of their services. The company does not yet know what caused the spike, but they do know that it caused the traffic passing through their network to experience errors.

“We are all hands on deck to make sure all traffic is served without errors. After that, we will turn our attention to investigating the cause of the unusual spike in traffic,” Cloudflare said in a statement.

Cloudflare provides the infrastructure and security for many websites worldwide. One of the company's main areas of service is protecting websites against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which occur when multiple bad actors flood a website or network with traffic requests to overload it and degrade performance or cut off access. Earlier this year, the company said that it had blocked the largest DDoS attack ever recorded.

Tuesday morning's outage comes less than a month after an Amazon Web Services outage that took sites like WhatsApp, Venmo, Coinbase, and more offline for more than two hours. The outage caused minor chaos at airports and hit online banking. In an assessment following the outage, AWS shared that the root cause was a bug that failed to automatically repair.

Just a week after the AWS incident, the internet had to contend with yet another outage, this time coming from Microsoft Azure. The Azure issue, for the most part, impacted the company's own services like Xbox.

In 2023, Tayla Cannon moved from Australia to the U.S. for a job in a city she'd never seen before.  

“No family, no friends, just a fresh start,” she told TechCrunch. A sufferer of chronic back pain,  she first started working in physiotherapy, thinking it was helping make a difference in the lives of others. Yet the traditional physiotherapy model never quite lit a spark in her.  

She moved to interventional cardiology but only became more disillusionedwith the physical rehab model with “its localized, reactive, and volume-based nature,” she said.  

Meanwhile, in her spare time, she became a content creator, sharing her perspective online about “proactive” and “holistic” ways people can get rid of pain.  

That took on a life of its own. 

She now has more than 130,000 followers on Instagram, a company called Athletic Rebuild, which provides rehab and performance coaching for athletes, and now, a platform called Rebuildr, a HIPAA-compliant and mentorship app to help rehab professionals run their own businesses online, set to launch early next year.  

“I wasn't trying to build a business; I was just putting my brain on the internet and helping people rethink what care could look like.”  

Cannon and her works caught the eye of Slow Ventures, which announced on Tuesday that it invested $1.1 million as a seed round.  She is one of the first creators to receive a check from Slow Ventures' $60 million Creator Fund, which seeks to back content creators and influencers making an impact online.  

Cannon said she had no plan when she started sharing her thoughts on social media in 2024 and then decided to make this her profession. “There was no strategy, no roadmap, and certainty no business model behind it,” she said. She credits what most content creators do for her success — remaining authentic and sharing unfiltered but genuine thoughts.  

Expanding a brand on social media is not without challenges, however. Her social media presence, and therefore brand, was growing fast, which was good but also a problem. She was instantly faced with the need to understand business logic, consumer acumen, and content strategy to connect with new audiences. “None of which are taught in healthcare,” she continued. “We're trained to help people, not to build brands.” 

The turning point came when she actually realized she was the bottleneck to her own business. “I couldn't keep scaling something that depended solely on me. I had to build something that could grow without me,” she said, adding that she ended up hiring people to help her with her projects.  

She also grew her strategy when she moved from just talking about what's broken in the world of rehab and started working on solutions to help fix it. Rebuildr is intended to be a “complete shift from localized reactive care to a proactive, holistic mode,” Cannon said, “combining consumer solutions, clinicians, education, and the software to deliver it all at scale.”  

She was introduced to the team at Slow Ventures through a friend who invited her to one of the firm's events in Austin. “I had zero intention of raising capital,” she said. “I wasn't even pitching. I wasn't even preparing a deck.”  Still, she connected with Megan Lightcap, an investor at Slow, and told her about what she was building with Rebuildr.  

“The conversation sparked something,” Cannon said, adding that Slow has helped her “imagine a version of Rebuilder that's even bigger” than what she envisioned.  

Others personal trainer software out there include TrainHeroic, Trainerize, and Everfit. Rudder hopes that her product, Rebuildr, fundamentally reshapes the rehab industry.  

“I want to make high-quality rehab accessible anywhere in the world, not limited by geography, insurance, or 30-minute appointments,” she said.

Zap Energy shared news that its fusion device has generated a pressure that's roughly 10,000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level, or 10 times the pressure at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench.

“This is a proof of principle that was designed to hit a particular set of milestones and to validate the principle, and it did that with flying colors,” said Ben Levitt, Zap's head of R&D. 

The Everett, Wash., company is in a race to efficiently smash together light atoms, simulating the reactions that fuel the sun. To do that on Earth, physicists need to create super hot temperatures and incredibly dense conditions and sustain that long enough for fusion to take place, releasing energy that can be captured and put on the grid. 

Zap also shared that next month it will commission its fifth fusion device to continue testing and optimizing the different systems required by the technology. The new machine will be called FuZE-A.

The company is still operating two other machines, the FuZE-Q and FuZE-3, which is the device that hit the new pressure milestone.  

“We can design and build one in half a year,” Levitt said of the fusion machines. “And that's what our superpower is — this rapid iteration that we have at our fingertips.”

Dozens of companies globally are trying to unlock fusion energy, which has eluded humanity for decades. But physicists are closer than ever to seizing the so-called Holy Grail of clean power, which is in great demand from tech companies running data centers and AI computations, as well as electrified transportation, industrial processes and building cooling and heating. 

Physicists are chasing fusion with different kinds of reactors in various configurations using high-powered magnets and lasers to create and hold plasmas, which are super heated gases needed for fusion. Zap's solution is to run a high current through the plasma in its reactor, which produces a magnetic field called a Z-pinch that contains and compresses the matter.

Helion Energy, a competitor located a short drive from Zap, is taking a different scientific strategy for fusion. It's building larger fusion generators and has broken ground on a commercial facility in Eastern Washington that is supposed to begin operating in 2028, but essential technical hurdles still must be overcome.   

Helion has been largely secretive in its efforts, citing concerns about thefts of intellectual property, while Zap has emphasized a more transparent approach to sharing its science and progress.  

Zap will present data on its new 1.6 gigapascal pressure milestone at the American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics meeting held this week in Long Beach, Calif., and later submit the research to a peer-reviewed journal.  

“We're going to share it in front of the entire fusion science community and in gory detail,” Levitt said. “So it's not hot air, it's hot plasma.”

Zap will also disclose details to the U.S. Department of Energy, which in 2023 selected the company to participate in the Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program. The company has also raised $330 million from investors and is No. 12 on the GeekWire 200, which ranks the Pacific Northwest's top startups. 

The recent milestone was achieved by splitting one of the two electrodes in the fusion generator that provide the energy needed to create and contain the plasma. The third electrode gave the device a new, metaphorical “knob” to turn, allowing the machine to crank up compression of the plasma. 

The pressure achieved was 10-fold higher than previous efforts and tracks with the largely exponential gains that new iterations of the technology have produced at Zap.

But orders of magnitude of additional improvement are needed to reach the state where the system produces enough energy to feed the electrical grid. 

Levitt said it's hard to say when that could happen as the gains in the system aren't linear but arrive in punctuated leaps forward. He hinted that scientific breakeven — getting more energy out of the fusion reaction than went into it, but not enough for power production — is possible by the end of the decade.  

The new milestone is “great progress” but the work isn't done, he said. “We're not waving our flag and resting on our laurels.”

WhatsApp's mass adoption stems in part from how easy it is to find a new contact on the messaging platform: Add someone's phone number, and WhatsApp instantly shows whether they're on the service, and often their profile picture and name, too.

Repeat that same trick a few billion times with every possible phone number, it turns out, and the same feature can also serve as a convenient way to obtain the cell number of virtually every WhatsApp user on earth—along with, in many cases, profile photos and text that identifies each of those users. The result is a sprawling exposure of personal information for a significant fraction of the world population.

One group of Austrian researchers have now shown that they were able to use that simple method of checking every possible number in WhatsApp's contact discovery to extract 3.5 billion users' phone numbers from the messaging service. For about 57 percent of those users, they also found that they could access their profile photos, and for another 29 percent, the text on their profiles. Despite a previous warning about WhatsApp's exposure of this data from a different researcher in 2017, they say, the service's parent company, Meta, still failed to limit the speed or number of contact discovery requests the researchers could make by interacting with WhatsApp's browser-based app, allowing them to check roughly a hundred million numbers an hour.

The result would be “the largest data leak in history, had it not been collated as part of a responsibly conducted research study,” as the researchers describe it in a paper documenting their findings.

“To the best of our knowledge, this marks the most extensive exposure of phone numbers and related user data ever documented,” says Aljosha Judmayer, one of the researchers at the University of Vienna who worked on the study.

The researchers say they warned Meta about their findings in April and deleted their copy of the 3.5 billion phone numbers. By October, the company had fixed the enumeration problem by enacting a stricter “rate-limiting” measure that prevents the mass-scale contact discovery method the researchers used. But until then, the data exposure could have also been exploited by anyone else using the same scraping technique, adds Max Günther, another researcher from the university who cowrote the paper. “If this could be retrieved by us super easily, others could have also done the same," he says.

In a statement to WIRED, Meta thanked the researchers, who reported their discovery through Meta's “bug bounty” system, and described the exposed data as “basic publicly available information,” since profile photos and text weren't exposed for users who opted to make it private. “We had already been working on industry-leading anti-scraping systems, and this study was instrumental in stress-testing and confirming the immediate efficacy of these new defenses,” writes Nitin Gupta, vice president of engineering at WhatsApp. Gupta adds, “We have found no evidence of malicious actors abusing this vector. As a reminder, user messages remained private and secure thanks to WhatsApp's default end-to-end encryption, and no non-public data was accessible to the researchers.”

Despite Meta's description, the researchers say they didn't circumvent or even encounter any “defenses” in collecting the phone numbers. Nor is their work the first time that WhatsApp has been warned about its exposure of phone numbers and associated profile data. Fully eight years ago, in 2017, Dutch researcher Loran Kloeze wrote a blog post pointing out that the phone number enumeration technique was possible and that it could be used to obtain phone numbers, profile photos, and also the times when a user was online.

Kloeze described a scenario in which the data exposure could be combined with face recognition to create a giant database of personally identifiable information. “Now that is quite scary, isn't it?” he wrote. Meta, then Facebook, responded to his findings, arguing that WhatsApp's privacy settings were still working as designed—users can choose to make their profile information accessible only to their chosen contacts—and even told him he wasn't eligible for a bug bounty reward for his work at the time.

When WIRED asked Meta what rate-limiting measures it instituted over the last eight years to prevent the technique Kloeze demonstrated, the company responded that it has, in fact, implemented evolving defenses against scrapers, including rate-limiting and machine-learning techniques to ban scrapers. Yet the University of Vienna researchers were able to not only replicate Kloeze's work, but take it further, actually enumerating all 3.5 billion registered WhatsApp phone numbers—far more than the service had in 2017. They also addressed WhatsApp's argument about privacy settings by measuring how many users publicly exposed personal information in their profiles, breaking down the results by country. They found that 44 percent of the 137 million phone numbers they collected for Americans displayed photos, and 33 percent showed public “about” text, for instance.

For countries where WhatsApp is even more widely used, a smaller fraction of the population turned on its privacy settings: In India, where the researchers counted nearly 750 million numbers, 62 percent of accounts publicly displayed a profile photo. For the 206 million Brazilian numbers they found, 61 percent had profile photos exposed.

The University of Vienna researchers stumbled on WhatsApp's phone number enumeration problem last year, when they were testing what they could learn from the service about users despite its end-to-end encryption for messages, such as the times when a user is connecting from the desktop app versus the mobile one. They found that the app didn't appear to have any obvious rate-limiting protection, so they tried simply enumerating all US numbers. “In a half hour, we had like 30 million US-based numbers,” says Gabriel Gegenhuber, one of the University of Vienna researchers. “So we were kind of surprised. And then we just kept going.”

One interested audience for the exposed phone number data, the researchers point out, would be scammers and spammers who are seeking a database of potential targets. But the researchers also found millions of phone numbers registered to WhatsApp in countries where it's officially banned, including 2.3 million in China and 1.6 million in Myanmar. Those countries' governments could have used WhatsApp's exposure to collect those numbers and hunt down illegal app users, the researchers point out. Muslims in China, according to some reports, have been detained merely for having WhatsApp installed on their phones.

The University of Vienna researchers also analyzed the cryptographic keys for the 3.5 billion accounts they found exposed via their enumeration method, the long strings of characters used to receive encrypted messages in WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption protocol. They found that a surprising number of accounts used duplicate keys—a security issue given that anyone who has the same key as another user would also be able to decrypt messages sent to them.

Some keys were reused hundreds of times, they found, and 20 US numbers used a key of all zeroes, strangely. The researchers speculate, though, that the key duplication was likely the result of unauthorized WhatsApp clients, rather than a flaw in WhatsApp itself. On closer examination of some of the accounts with repeated cryptographic keys, they also noted that they looked like scammer accounts, suggesting that some scam operations that exploit WhatsApp may use a client with broken encryption features.

Aside from the lack of rate limiting, the researchers argue that their findings point to a more fundamental issue with services like WhatsApp: Phone numbers, they say, don't actually have enough randomness to be used as a unique identifier for a service with billions of users. That leaves rate-limiting as the only available measure to prevent user data from being scraped en masse, and one that will never be fully secure against privacy leaks if WhatsApp prioritizes convenient contact discovery for users. (WhatsApp has, in fact, started testing a username feature in beta, which may offer a better approach to privacy.)

“Phone numbers were not designed to be used as secret identifiers for accounts, but that's how they're used in practice,” says Judmayer. “If you have a big service that's used by more than a third of the world population, and this is the discovery mechanism, that's a problem.”

Attack from botnet hit Azure with over 3.6 million packets per-second

Microsoft's Azure has mitigated the largest botnet attack in history, with over 500,000 devices used to send up to 15.72 terabits per second to a single cloud endpoint in Australia, which is roughly equivalent to 3.5 million Netflix movies streamed simultaneously per-second.

In a blog post, Microsoft claims the Azure DDoS protection was able to detect the attack and filter the traffic so customers remained unaffected, but urged organizations to validate the security on any internet-facing devices to help prevent future attacks.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks use botnets of infected systems and devices to send unprecedented quantities of traffic to particular sites and servers in order to overwhelm them. It's a brute-force method to bring down services that can be particularly effective if safeguards aren't in place.

Over the past few years the scale of DDoS attacks has grown exponentially, too. Just this year we've seen record-breaking attacks that delivered 7.3 Tbps of traffic in June, followed by a larger 11.5 Tbps attack in September. Those have now been dwarfed by the scale of this latest attack, which reached 15.72 Tbps at its peak.

Not only is the scale of DDoS attacks increasing, but the way they are conducted is changing too. NetworkWorld quotes security analyst, Sunil Varkey, who highlights that DDoS attacks are becoming far more akin to hit-and-run incidents. Attacks are conducted with incredible intensity over short periods of time. This can make it hard for defences to react in time, though in this case it appears Microsoft's Azure was able to keep the lights on while mitigating the effects.

Part of the problem stems from the growing capabilities of home networks and devices. As fiber offers far greater upload speeds and growing numbers of IoT devices increase attack vector options for hackers, the ability for them to infect and utilize more devices has exploded.

Security cameras, appliances, Wi-Fi range extenders, video doorbells, smart thermostats, and a range of other smart home devices can all be used to send traffic to endpoints as part of botnet attacks. It's often hard to spot if they've been infected, too. As long as they continue to function normally, device owners may not be aware that their device(s) have been compromised and potentially used in future attacks.

“This isn't just a technical issue,” Varkey said. “It is a global cyber hygiene failure that is now manifesting as a strategic infrastructure risk. It is a large army of compromised and easily compromisable devices waiting for the command to initiate. Security accountability and assurance need to be revisited on priority, whether it is the OEM, the service provider, or the home user.”

He called on enterprises to employ layered defences of their networks and endpoints, using traffic-rate limiters, DDOS scrubbers, and robust network stress testing through DDOS simulation to dry-run attacks.

It's a never ending game of cat and mouse. As we were writing up this coverage, CloudFlare has suffered a major outage that may have been caused by another DDoS attack, though details remain unclear.

Microsoft states that agents read files in an isolated runtime 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A few days ago, a high-ranking Microsoft executive characteristically gushed about how Windows is becoming an agentic OS with a focus on AI features, a sentiment that was met with intense scrutiny on social media. Today, we have our first look at what that eventuality could look like, with AI agents working by your side in the background in Windows 11 Insider Build 26220.7262, as detailed by the Windows Insider Blog.

This latest update adds a new "Experimental agentic features" toggle in settings, which creates a separate desktop environment called the "Agent Workspace." Think of it like Windows Sandbox; still isolated from the rest of the system, but Microsoft says it's supposed to be more efficient than virtualization. Unfortunately, Agent Workspaces are not functional right now beyond a simple toggle.

 




The idea behind this concept stems from agents in ChatGPT or Copilot Actions. They're little digital assistants carrying out mundane tasks on your behalf, such as scrolling through documents, pointing and clicking at various things, and maybe even booking a flight for you. Previously, features like these operated in the cloud in a virtualized window, but now Microsoft wants them to run locally on your computer.

Each time an AI workspace is created, a different AI agent is in charge of that, with its own customized access to "known folders" like Downloads and Desktop. Because the Agent Workspace is its own separate entity, everything is logged with a clearly traceable path of everything the agent saw or performed. You can set up rules for all the agents and allow access to connect to apps (like Copilot) which have agentic feature support.

"Known folders" are six of the most common, standard directories inside Windows that can be automatically backed up and synced to a cloud service like Microsoft's OneDrive. These include Documents, Downloads, Desktop, Videos, Pictures, and Music.

It all sounds like a privacy nightmare, but Microsoft says "security in this context is not a one-time feature — it's a continuous commitment." AI agents are turned off by default, so creating Agent Workspaces is a deliberate choice that even Microsoft acknowledges has some tradeoffs, advising users to only opt in if they're comfortable with letting agents poke around within the PC's data.

"We recommend that you only enable this feature if you understand the security implications outlined on this page. This setting can only be enabled by an administrator user of the device and once enabled, it's enabled for all users on the device including other administrators and standard users."

Once the setting is enabled, AI agents can gain read/write access to certain aforementioned folders if you grant them the necessary permissions. Therefore, these agents can access files in those places, which is needed in order for them to work for you. Microsoft claims that this is safe because each Agent Workspace has its own isolated runtime and "scoped authorization". But, in practice, it remains to be seen whether these claims hold water.

In simple words, essentially a new user account is created, seperate from your personal account, tied specifically to an AI agent. This ensures permissions don't overlap and that the admin account always remains in control, with the AI account only having limited access, operating within set boundaries. It's similar to how user accounts in general work in Windows — now, it's just an AI, instead of a real human.

The benefit of such deep AI integration is... scarce, at the moment, especially when you remember that Agent Workspaces literally don't work right now. Many users are also rightfully furious over how Microsoft is steering Windows into this instead of addressing long-permeating issues within the OS.

Intuit has signed a multi-year contract worth more than $100 million with OpenAI, enabling its tax and financial apps to operate within ChatGPT and expanding the company's use of OpenAI's models across its products.

Intuit said its tools, such as TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks and Mailchimp, will be accessible through ChatGPT, allowing users to ask questions and complete tasks such as estimating tax refunds, reviewing credit options, or managing business finances.

With users' permission, Intuit's apps will be able to access their financial data to generate responses and complete tasks, like sending marketing messages or issuing invoice reminders. Customers will also be able to use the tools within ChatGPT to review credit cards, personal loans and mortgages.

The agreement reflects a broader trend of technology and financial firms adopting large language models in consumer and business software. OpenAI in October introduced a way to let developers build apps accessible through ChatGPT. Early participants in the program included Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify and several other consumer and productivity platforms.

But Intuit's integration differs from existing ChatGPT apps, as it will be used for tasks that can directly influence financial decisions. Such uses have raised concerns about the reliability of AI systems, which can produce incorrect or misleading outputs. 

Intuit employs multiple validation methods and utilizes large domain-specific datasets to minimize the risk of errors or “hallucinated” responses, Bruce Chan, a spokesperson for Intuit, told TechCrunch.

“When our AI provides an answer or gives guidance to a customer, it's drawing on the deep expertise that Intuit has developed over many years, plus the data that gives us a 360-degree view of the customer,” Chan said. “This helps make sure the answer given is relevant and grounded in the customer's own data, and reflects Intuit's years of domain expertise.”

Chan said Intuit continues to stand behind the accuracy guarantees offered through its products, including TurboTax, but did not clarify when asked if the company or the customer would be on the hook for errors that result from AI-generated recommendations or insights.

Intuit has been expanding its use of AI in recent years with an eye towards taking advantage of its massive data infrastructure. In 2023, the company introduced Intuit Assist, an AI assistant that works across its products.

The partnership also involves Intuit expanding its use of OpenAI's models across its business. The company already uses AI models from OpenAI alongside other commercial and open-source large language models. Intuit said the partnership will give it access to new audiences through ChatGPT, adding another distribution channel for its small-business and consumer finance tools.

“This partnership will deepen Intuit's use of OpenAI's frontier models, which will help power select AI agents across Intuit's platform,” Chan said.

The deal also covers Intuit's continued use of ChatGPT Enterprise, which the company said is deployed internally to support employee workflows.

GF is betting on silicon photonics as the future of AI computing.

GlobalFoundries just announced its acquisition of Advanced Micro Foundry, a Singapore-based silicon photonics maker, a purchase the company says makes it the largest manufacturer of the technology, as reported by Reuters. Silicon photonics uses light instead of electrical pulses to transmit data, and it can be used for communication within chips, between components, and even across servers.

Nvidia is already planning to implement silicon photonics for its next-generation AI servers, which would reduce power consumption while simultaneously increasing data transfer speeds. This is crucial for the company, as it could enable clusters with millions of GPUs within data centers. AMD is also jumping on this technology, reportedly spending nearly $300 million to open a research and development center in Taiwan that focuses on said tech. It acquired Enosemi, another silicon photonics firm, earlier this year, to help compete against Nvidia.

Silicon photonics' ability to reduce power consumption while increasing data transmission speeds is crucial for the future of AI computing. This is especially true now that the AI data center build-out is straining the electricity grid with the unprecedented increase in power demand. “As data moves faster and workloads grow more complex, the ability to move information with greater speed, precision, and power efficiency is now fundamental to AI data centers and advanced telecom networks,” said GlobalFoundries CEO Tim Breen in a statement.

Aside from its use with AI, silicon photonics is a pivotal technology in quantum computing. The use of light instead of electrical signals could allow for systems that do not require cryogenic cooling, making quantum computers much more practical and less costly to operate.

While big names like AMD, Nvidia, and GlobalFoundries are investing in silicon photonics, other startups are also entering the fray. Firms like Ayar Labs, Celestial AI, and Lightmatter are developing their own technologies and photonic-based chips, especially as it's seen as the future of computing.

While we don't expect to see consumer-grade CPUs, GPUs, and motherboards come with this technology anytime soon, it's already being applied to large-scale servers that deal with terabytes of data every second. And with the continued investment in AI data centers, we anticipate that research and development on this promising tech would move forward as well.

If you read any of WIRED's recent AI edition, you know that lots of people are spending lots of time talking about how the technology is revolutionizing pretty much everything—from coding to writing to accounting. You've also probably heard by now, from us or somebody else, that we might very well be in an economic bubble of AI origin, one wherein the billions and billions of dollars being funneled into the industry is creating an untenable economic scenario that could turn catastrophic.

Of course, you may also have read that I'm really sick of being asked about AI. I'm still not sick, though, of asking other people about it—especially when they're much smarter about this stuff than I am. Enter Joe Weisenthal, the cohost of Bloomberg's fantastic Odd Lots podcast, and a former coworker of mine. Trust me: As someone who spent a year listening to Joe lose his mind in the office—loudly!—anytime the economy hiccuped, few people think more about our country's, and our planet's, financial circumstances than Joe does. And right now, Joe's concerns aren't strictly about what happens if or when that AI bubble bursts. His worries are more focused on what's going right and wrong with the US economy writ large.

For this week's episode of The Big Interview, Joe and I talked about weird market indicators, US competition with China, and whether or not we should all prepare for an AI economic apocalypse.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: Joe Weisenthal, welcome to The Big Interview.

JOE WEISENTHAL: Thrilled to be here. Nice to see you again.

It's been too long. We were just talking about how [you] and I worked together—what was that, like nine years ago?

I think you were there 2014, 2015, so maybe 10 years ago or something?

Yeah, I worked at Bloomberg. I lasted about a year.

Not bad.

Not bad. In my mid-twenties, maybe not the most conducive environment to my professional success. Let's just say that. But Joe, you were there, you were loud, you were proud, you were always very excited about the economy.

I love talking about the economy.

You would just scream and shout and hoot and holler, and I was like, who is this guy sitting across from me? And why is he so loud? But I really appreciated your enthusiasm.

Thank you.

So we always start these conversations with some very fast questions. Are you ready?

Yes.

OK. So, you wake up extremely early. What is the latest you've slept in this year?

This year, on a weekday, probably no later than seven, but that's because of kids. You know, I'm getting a little bit soft in my old age. If I didn't have anything, I could sleep until eight or nine. I've really changed.

Wow.

There used to be times when I was waking up at 4:00 am every single day.

And you were tweeting.

I still get up early a lot, but I let myself slide a little bit now.

What's the weirdest market indicator you actually take seriously?

We did a really good episode of our podcast about a month or two ago about cardboard boxes, which are very important. I don't know how weird they are. I guess it's kind of intuitive because of ecommerce, but you can really dive deeply into cardboard box volume sales, the types of cardboard boxes that are hot right now. Like are they ones that go for individual packages? Are they more of the larger grocery-oriented ones?

Cardboard boxes are top of my mind these days. I used to pay a lot of attention to Macao gambling receipts, when that was more of a measure of Chinese capital market outflows. But I think they've clamped down on that and it's not as useful as an indicator these days.

If you could ban one financial cliche from headlines forever, what would it be?

Oh, there's so many. It's hard to choose. “The stock market is not the economy.” People love saying it; it's not true.

The stock market is a very important part of the economy. “Investors hate uncertainty.” Things are always uncertain. That's never been a thing. I could go on and on, but I would say “the stock market is not the economy” is one that I've hated for a long time, and I would say a very timely one.

What is a chart you would get tattooed?

I really like the chart of public sector employment over the last hundred years. You know why it's a fun chart?

I'm imagining the tattoo.

I don't think I would actually get it tattooed. It's just one of my favorite charts, because it's one of the—if you see this chart and you never knew what it was, you could probably figure out what it was because there is a little spike every 10 years, and that's additional hiring for the census collection.

So I've always just enjoyed this chart because if you really think about “OK, what is this indicator that always spikes right at the turn of every decade?” There's one thing that happens in the economy every 10 years—1990, 2000, 2010—and that's the census. You might be able to figure it out. It's fun trivia.

If the economy were a movie, what's the title?

I don't know. Mind Breaker. Something like that.

I do think the story of the last several years is: How many people's brains have been broken because things that are perceived to make sense or relationships that they had assumed to be stable, et cetera, have not held? You just see people—there are other factors, but people who are in this space, going crazier and crazier year after year because they have such a difficult time reconciling what they see on their screen.

You are seeing these people go crazy?

I think so, yeah. I don't know if it's outward signs of, you know, literal insanity, but I think in markets you see this sort of intense frustration.

For almost my entire career—at least the last 10 years—people have said, “Oh, tech stocks can't go any higher.” Or, “When are we gonna rotate out of tech stocks?” Everyone is all-in on this already, and yet these trends just persist month after month. Most people pride themselves in some way on not being part of the herd. Or taking some sort of contrarian viewpoint, or finding something that everyone else doesn't know about.

Everyone at this point has heard of Nvidia, everyone in the world. You could have made a lot of money over the last couple years just buying Nvidia. I think this phenomenon really breaks a lot of people's brains because the industry, to some extent, is supposed to encourage people to seek out information that others don't have. I don't think that's been a particularly fruitful pursuit for a while now. And I think it's so mind-breaking.

Alright, last question. You get to have dinner with one economist living or dead, who is it?

I'd love to talk to John Maynard Keynes. He was a very interesting character. Very interesting character, hung out with all sorts of artists and dancers and I love his writing.

Dinner, maybe one day. Well, he's dead.

Maybe one day the AI-generated, reanimated corpse of John Maynard Keynes. Don't put it past them.

Let's talk about the big picture for a second. You work at Bloomberg. I know firsthand that you really care about this stuff. But you've said the thing that really interests you is quote, “figuring out what's actually happening underneath the headlines.” What's going on underneath the headlines right now?

Look, the headlines are all about the AI build-out and how the AI build-out is represented in the market. I think probably what's less discussed is maybe some of the crowding out effects of this.

We had this guy on our podcast who is a real estate developer for drive-through coffee shops. So like, Starbucks, when they want a new drive-through location. In recent years, really basic electrical equipment that would be required to build a new facility has been in short supply because there's all this physical capital that's been going into data centers.

We all know about that, right? You hear about that all the time. But just think about that: Where were these things going to go instead? Cooling gear or heating gear or water filtration or doors or gas turbines or electrical equipment that allows any facility to hook into the power grid—all of this is in incredibly short supply right now.

So the ISM manufacturing report, that's a monthly economic indicator. One of the things that they always ask their survey respondents is: What is in short supply right now? With the exception of maybe two months, electrical equipment has been in short supply for five straight years.

I'm not trying to dismiss it as being wasteful or anything per se. I have no opinion on that. But I do think that it's interesting to think of some of these second-order effects of who is not able to get natural gas turbine equipment, who is not able to get electrical gear equipment because some big data center operator is just willing to pay top dollar for it in order to get these things online.

Right.

I think that's one of the most interesting stories right now. In a market economy, the way allocation of capital goods works, of course, is price signals. And the builder of the data center is gonna pay more for that same piece of gear than someone who is building a drive-through coffee shop.

If you're thinking about how it would be done in China, they would just say, “OK, look, right now we are prioritizing data centers for drive-through coffee shops. That is where we want to direct our resources.” We do it through the price system, which works well, but if some of these investments don't pan out, it's interesting to think what type of economic activity was constrained because it didn't have access to capital goods during this incredible boom.

Other types of goods relevant to these build-outs are also in short supply. Why has supply not increased to meet the obvious increase in demand that exists?

It's a really good question. I think there's a couple of things. I think at the margins there has been more supply. But in times of uncertainty, building a big factory or building a new facility is very risky, right? You don't really know how long any boom is going to last. So if there are, say, three companies that are the makers of some widget that's very crucial in the economy and it's costly, why not keep supply where it is and just raise your …

… jack your prices up. Right.

Then you have an order book that's consistent out to the year 2030, in some cases at top dollar. It's very difficult to get out of that equilibrium because that's very nice if you're one of the sellers in this environment.

The alternative is to build another factory, make a big bet on upfront capital outlays. So that's money going out the door, and that's uncertain, and you're expanding supply so the price is going to be softer than it otherwise would've been.

I think one of the themes across the economy for a long time is paying the price for persistent underinvestment. I think another good example of that is housing. So housing activity was pretty soft in the years after the great financial crisis. All these home builders went out of business because housing prices collapsed and so forth.

Right.

So there was just not that much new housing activity. When you look at the surge in home prices now, especially post-pandemic, part of what we're experiencing now is the price that we paid for under-investment in the 2010s.

I think you can really go across a range of industries and find this phenomenon that when the economy lies fallow and the economy is soft, investment goes down. Then when you get this boom, either across the economy like we got in 2021 or 2022, or in specific sectors like we've seen in 2024 and 2025 with data centers, you run into a supply crunch pretty quickly.

That brings me to tariffs, which have been, I think for me and probably for many people, one of the most insane, confusing, befuddling phenomena of this year, of the Trump administration.

Definitely.

Can you explain to us what is going on with the global supply chain with regards to tariffs right now?

The tariffs are not high enough to induce a massive amount of domestic investment in some area. The tariffs aren't high enough that it makes a lot of sense to build big furniture factories in the United States, but the tariffs may be high enough that someone who had been importing them from China or Vietnam, maybe they're looking for a supplier in India. That's definitely happening. So the furniture still arrives.

Yes.

By and large, there aren't massive shortages of things in the US economy right now the way people might have thought there would have been in early April. Part of it is that those early tariff levels, they all came [down]. Maybe we would've had more persistent actual shortages had those initial tariff rates stayed in place, but they didn't. I think the administration saw they were unsustainable.

So then there's this switching where, OK, we're gonna maybe switch some vendor sources. We're gonna move to a lower-cost country. So anyone who's in the business of importing, maybe they can keep prices roughly stable. But there is this costly process of: OK, now we have to spend money finding a new supplier, building a new relationship with them, changing our trade routes, figuring out all these things, figuring out how they operate. But then this new supplier, they don't know the customer as well. They may be reluctant to make long-term commitments with the customer because they don't know what the tariff rate is gonna be.

Right.

This is a worry for suppliers, that they're gonna make this furniture, these gardening goods, these holiday goods, and then the tariff rate is gonna go up and then the customer walks away from them. So the way I think about tariffs overall, outside of some niche areas, is not that they've raised the cost of specific goods dramatically, though in some cases they definitely have, it's more that they've really raised the cost of doing business in the United States.

If I wanna understand what is going on with the economy right now, I'd say there's basically two things: There's this slice of the economy that's doing phenomenally well, which is anything to do with big tech and AI; then there's this economy that's sort of creaking and, I don't know, like the rest of the economy, is it in recession? It's fairly stagflationary. I would say that hiring is certainly pretty mediocre right now. We're recording this on a day that we would've gotten a jobs report had the government been open. But we're pretty sure that hiring is certainly not booming.

The cost of living is very high, so it's still a lot of price pain. I think the broad swath of the economy outside of AI is kind of creaking and tariffs are probably part of the story. I wouldn't say they're the entire story, but they've raised the cost of doing business for the entire economy, even if not directly in goods, just in the effort that companies have to do to reorient their supply chains.

I have a lot of questions for you about AI, especially in terms of the chatter about a bubble. We're in an AI bubble. It will burst at some point. There are varying degrees of hysteria around this notion. How is artificial intelligence affecting the global economy right now? Are there some examples that you can give to bring this down to earth a little bit?

I would start by saying I'm very skeptical that AI as a tool is having a significant impact on the global economy, including hiring. Now, I will caveat that a little bit. I do think it's possible that, across a range of organizations right now, there is a lot of pressure on managers to show that they're using AI, whatever that means, that they're implementing, that they're finding ways to capture value from AI in their workflows.

Everyone's doing experiments, everyone's spending money, everyone's trying to figure something out. One way that you could sort of demonstrate that you're using AI and getting value is to just cut head count. Right? And then you go back and say, “Oh, because we adopted some AI workflow, we were able to reduce hiring by 10 percent.” That doesn't mean that the AI tool actually allowed you to do the same amount of work with only 90 percent.

I mean, when I see those announcements my immediate assumption is: Air cover. You did layoffs and you used AI as air cover to explain why you're eliminating 10,000 positions. I just don't see the technology being equipped to eliminate 10,000 white collar jobs right now.

So anytime I ask about actual implementation I say, “Don't give me the stuff about how your coders are using it, because I know that's well-established.” The other connection is, OK, there is this mandate or there's this impulse to spend more on AI. So you're thinking about your budgetary allocations for the year 2026. We did an episode today and our guest was talking about this, that perhaps it's a matter of, OK, we know we're gonna spend more on AI tools and services in 2026, so that means we're gonna allocate less to hiring in 2026.

I don't think there's a lot of evidence for it. Like I said in the beginning, I think the stock market really is an important part of the economy. It's not just a scoreboard, it's an engine. It is a driver. People found companies in order to sell them to public companies or to sell into the IPO market. When stocks are up, that means IPOs are gonna be more valued. That means seed rounds will be more valued. That means more people are gonna move into this space, and that's fine.

You know, Keynes talked about that, speaking of my ideal dinner guest. So this has been understood for a very long time, that financial markets have this accelerant, that they're a force of production, so to speak, within the economy in a very real way.

I do think that the big rise that we've seen in asset prices, in stocks in particular, it's been related to technology and AI is a big part of the economic story.

When you look at Nvidia stock, for example, which is just through the roof, when you look at how AI is a significant factor in the stock market right now, and then combine that with the fact that you are having a hard time finding tangible examples of corporate productivity being enhanced by this technology, what does that mean? What happens when those things are both happening simultaneously?

Intuitively, it's really hard to imagine that these big AI companies, whether we're talking about Nvidia or Google, that the AI premium that they're receiving, the AI activity that they're receiving, can persist forever if there aren't more clear-cut examples of companies saying, “This is a valuable thing that I want to keep paying more and more for.” One possibility is that the productivity-enhancing use cases will be found, which is certainly possible.

Well, Joe, do you use AI to enhance your productivity?

It's a good question. I certainly use it for interview prep.

Sure. Research, yeah.

But I put out the same number of podcasts as I did before. And they're probably about as good as they were before. I don't know, it's a really good question. I think many people would say that they actually use ChatGPT, or [an AI tool] almost every day for something. I'm in that camp. But whether I can actually point to something and say “now I'm more productive” is really tough.

Like, “this is my killer use case,” you know what I mean?

But you know what's weird? I've been thinking about this question, which is that the internet has obviously changed our lives. We didn't have some mega productivity boom in the ‘90s. Productivity was a bit higher in the 90s than it was previously as the internet was rolling out, but it was not insanely different.

Same with mobile phones. Intuitively, the world changed because we all have an iPhone, but has there been some measurable productivity boom that we can find in the aggregate in economic statistics associated with the iPhone? Not really.

Part of the puzzle of figuring out where the productivity measures are going to show up with AI may mean we just put aside the AI conversation for a while and go back to the 20 years of technological gains, which have completely changed society.

But then the other possibility, of course, is that companies pull back and they don't spend as much and then you get a stock market crash.

Well, that sounds fun. I'm curious about the psychology of all of this. I've been wondering in the last few months as we've seen more discussion around this idea of an AI bubble: How does that affect psychology? Is there a potential for a spiral from that? People start reading about this, it becomes part of the narrative, and then you do see a crash, right? That's maybe less related to a lack of efficiency gains and more related to people flipping out a little bit.

It could be. I think there's a famous George Soros quote, which is something like when he sees a bubble, he runs towards it. He doesn't run away. Some people, they see a bubble and they wanna step away. Some people it's like, No, I wanna ride this bubble and I wanna make a lot of money. They have some confidence that they'll be able to get out when the time comes.

Oh, that sounds so stressful.

Yeah, I've always thought that bubbles, when I read about historical ones, are stressful because if you're not in it, you're jealous that your neighbor or your friend is making a ton of money. If you are in it, you're probably kicking yourself for not having invested more in it, right? Then if you actually have a decent allocation such that the increase in the monetary value has changed your life, then you're really stressed out about timing the sale correctly. So bubbles are very stressful.

But the one thing I'll say is I do wonder if the mass retail or the mass investing world has sort of internalized the Soros idea that bubbles are exciting. Bubbles are something that you run toward. Retail investors who bought the dip; this was the story of the 2010s, which is that every time there was a hiccup in the market, the right move was to buy more. In March 2020, when the stock market plunged due to Covid, it worked out really well. In April 2025, when the markets plunged after the “Liberation Day” tariffs—every time we've seen some sort of hiccup in the market for 15 years the right thing has been to buy the dip.

So it's possible that the psychology of anytime there's red on the screen, it's a good time to buy could last a lot longer than people think.

Well, I've missed every dip opportunity. I have bought zero dips. I'm a very anxious person.

I don't think we as journalists have the best mentality for the market.

I don't touch a market. I'm scared of the markets. I just cover them in an adjacent way. But I would like to live in a country that is in a financially healthy place. So the AI bubble, let's say it bursts. I know that you are a very good journalist and very smart about this stuff. You're not a tarot card reader, but what does that potentially look like for the United States?

I think the scary thing for the United States is like, what else is working right now? Right?

What else is … well, the other part is creaking.

Well, the other parts are creaking and the industrial areas of the economy are getting clobbered because of competition with Chinese industrial might. So we know that the auto sector, which probably hasn't really been a particular load-bearing sector for the overall US economy for a while, is obviously having a very difficult time with global competition to say the least.

The pharmaceutical industry for the United States—here's another area where internationally, again, particularly in China, there is much more competition than there has been in the past. So I think the scary thing is for the United States is it doesn't feel like our growth drivers are particularly diversified right now.

Right.

There is one sector that's doing phenomenally well, and look, it's not even just AI. I mean big tech companies. They've just been huge money makers. They're huge money makers globally, and so we're getting a lot of money from around the world, from the existence of the Metas of the world and the Alphabets of the world and so forth.

It's not just AI, but it does not feel like we're particularly well-diversified. And then I think, you know, there are serious structural issues facing the economy. It's an aging population. There's a lot of pressure that emerges on the labor force because of the requirement to care for the elderly and to care for the infirm, which is growing every month.

We didn't get a jobs report today, but one thing that we've seen is that almost every month for years and years now, the number of people who work in healthcare goes up. So there's this very intense strain that's being placed on the labor force overall simply because of shifting demographics.

Obviously as a society it's important that the elderly are cared for and so forth, but these are low productivity areas, they're low productivity jobs. When we think about real wealth as an economy, placing that greater strain on younger workers who theoretically could be used in some more productive areas, there's some deep, deep stresses being placed on the US economy.

There are also a lot of things that are just costlier. Food has gotten a lot costlier. So you look at an economy that's under a lot of strain, but there isn't a lot of slack. If there's just this one thing that's doing well that goes away. When you look at it that way, there's not a lot to be particularly excited about.

Well, that was actually my next question: What should I, or a WIRED reader, look to for optimism, economic optimism, in this moment?

What I think is really striking, and a reason to be optimistic, is that it's easy to say, yes, Silicon Valley is doing great and New York is doing pretty good, the financial industry is doing well, and everyone else is doing terribly. I don't really think that's true, and I think one of the things that I've been struck by is just—and maybe this sounds a little bit corny—but America is just such an insanely wealthy country. I mean, the sheer material wealth of this country is …

It absolutely is.

It's absolutely jaw dropping. Also the natural resources that we're endowed with. These great lands of ours are really extraordinary. I don't think it would be great for the economy if we completely cut off trading with the rest of the world.

But I also think if there's one country in the world that probably could completely be self-dependent in some respects, it would be the United States. We have all the energy that we need, in theory. We have incredible technology and incredible education.

So we could go full isolationist. You're not recommending it, but …

I do think we would be poorer for it, but I think if there's one country in the world that could probably live off of everything that's within its borders, it's probably the United States.

Let me try to bring together the supply chain and tariff conversation with the AI one. How are global supply chains changing with the use of AI? Where do those two things come together?

I think that where they really come together is in a lot of the energy demand. We did an episode recently with the famed energy historian and economist, Daniel Yergin. He wrote this book, The Prize, about the history of oil, and he was talking about if you go to any maker of natural gas turbines right now, they're sold out for years and years. I think this affects everyone outside of AI all around the world.

In 2022, natural gas prices spiked. Part of it was the war in Ukraine. Obviously, the US became this huge exporter of liquid natural gas, but there were these huge auctions that were going on among all the world's countries to get their hands on any gas.

So when you think about where AI really intersects with international trade, it's the energy dimension that immediately comes to mind, because the needs are so intense because everyone wants it.

Part of the thing with AI, obviously, is it's wrapped up in this national competition. There's this feeling that every country in the world needs their own, if not their own model, per se, at least their own data centers and so forth.

Right.

So there's this very intense idea that national sovereignty could be on the line for some countries if they're not somewhere playing in the AI space. Therefore, they have to be playing in the energy space, and therefore they have to take their energy needs really seriously.

And that brings me to asking you about China. China is the big boogeyman in a lot of conversations, but with AI in particular there's talk about this arms race around AI. There's debate about export controls on chips.

Yep.

There's this talk of AI brain drain here in the US because of the Trump administration's stance on immigration and visas. Everyone is keeping a very close eye on China and what they're doing in the AI space. Do you see that conversation, the arms race that's often discussed, as hysteria? Is that marketing? Or is there more there? How are you thinking about that?

I think there are some pretty real reasons for US companies to be concerned about international competition. I guess there is an element of hysteria. But also, when you think about the basics of, again, sovereignty and national defense and so forth, it's hard to imagine a country truly being sovereign without manufacturing capacity. Even if you don't have manufacturing capacity for everyday industrial goods or consumer goods, there is a good chance that eventually you lose the manufacturing capacity for weapons and arms because historically these things have been integrated, and being able to build anything means you're able to build more things, if that makes sense.

One of the things that worries me a lot is: Why have we gotten worse at building airplanes in this country? When you think about the struggles that Boeing has had, in particular, there is emerging competition. So China has a civil aviation jet maker called Comac. That's not the reason that Boeing is struggling. The reason that Boeing is struggling is because somehow over 20 years they got worse at building planes. That really worries me, and that's really important for all kinds of things.

Broadly, we're losing the muscle to build things in this country. Therefore, that eventually creeps up the chain to a company like Boeing, which has all kinds of niche specialty suppliers in all kinds of areas.

If you don't have that whole ecosystem surrounding it, then eventually Boeing itself becomes worse at doing its job. Now, I don't know specifically what the Boeing story is, and other people will say something different. Other people will say, oh, it's about, you know, they brought in the bean counters who just care about Wall Street …

Right. Corporate incompetence.

I want that story to be true because it's so satisfying. Right? If the story of Boeing struggles is that they just started caring too much about Wall Street, that's a very delicious story, right?

Not that we as a country are losing muscle.

Then we can blame finance for it. We can blame investors and so forth. I'm just not entirely convinced that that story is true. I think maybe there's something deeper going on about the ability of an advanced manufacturer in the US to thrive.

It's the same really with Intel, and we know the massive struggles that they have had. They seem to have hit the end of their line in their ability to construct factories, or fabs, for the most advanced semiconductors. They design semiconductors and they manufacture them, as opposed to, say, Nvidia, which uses TSMC to manufacture their chips and so forth.

I think that's where the deeper China conversation comes in, which is, OK, did the hollowing out of these lower value areas eventually creep up and affect the higher areas? And can the US be a secure, sovereign nation without advanced manufacturing in things like airplanes and whatever else? I guess on that level, I don't think it's hysteria. I think it's something that people need to take seriously, the fact that industrial competition has created vulnerabilities for the US.

That's a much more thoughtful and informed answer than, “Well, if they get super intelligent AI first we're all dead.” It's like, what are you talking about?

Well, it's always so funny because there are so many flavors of the AI apocalypse conversation that you can have. There are obviously some people, and I'm sure you've talked to them and WIRED has covered them a lot, who think the moment there is some sort of super intelligence, we're all dead.

I mean, I've talked to academics and they have been in tears talking to me about this.

And I get that to some extent, but it's also very funny. It's like, Oh, and we're worried that China is gonna get there first? Here's this machine that's gonna kill us all and we have to build it first …

Yeah. I mean, if anyone is gonna kill everyone, let it be the United States.

Yeah, that's right.

American exceptionalism, right up until the end. Well Joe, let me ask you one more question. Looking forward, what story or company or market should everyone start paying more attention to? We pay a lot of attention to what's happening in the United States. Maybe we're looking abroad a little bit. What are people missing? What's really interesting?

I think one thing that hasn't gotten enough attention is the future of Europe. Or I would say two things, maybe the future of Europe and which path is Europe going to go down? Because it's pressured in multiple directions. It's very literally in between the US and China, but also figuratively, because Europe has its own share of industrial powerhouses that have struggled with intense competition from Chinese competitors, most notably Germany.

Intuitively, Europe should be in part of a larger trading bloc with the United States. But of course there's the tariffs and there's been a division that's opened up. Then the other option is Europe needs to integrate more deeply within itself, right? In order to achieve scale in production, it needs to go further on the project of deepening integration between all the European countries. The problem is, I don't really know if there's politics for that, because we live in this very nationalistic time and we see nationalist politicians rising pretty much everywhere where there's elections, right? Even probably in places where there aren't elections, there's been more of a nationalist tilt.

Then, related to that, what are these other emerging markets? Which path are they going to go down? Think of Indonesia or Vietnam or Brazil, and they've seen their trade with China boom, but they also have concerns about national sovereignty and they also have domestic champions and their domestic steel companies, or their domestic nickel companies or so forth that are doing really well.

The question is, are they gonna be undercut? And what do they want their relationship with China or the US to be? So some pretty big open questions right now on how they're going to orient their economies with the rest of the world.

I feel much smarter than I did 45 minutes ago. Before we end, I wanna get a little bit dumber for a minute. We're gonna play a very quick game.

Oh yeah. I was supposed to prepare for this …

It's too late now. It's called Control, Alt, Delete. So the question is, what piece of tech would you control? What piece would you alt, or alter? And what piece would you delete?

OK. I would probably delete sports gambling and sports gambling apps.

Do you have a problem with sports gambling?

I don't, but I really worry about it and don't want it in my face all the time. It doesn't seem particularly healthy.

No, but it's not a problem for you. I'm glad.

Thank you. But would I say “yes”? I would prefer there be less, that there was less betting on everything. So I deleted sports gambling.

Control and alter?

I would probably alter social media in some respects. I'm a dad and I do think, I don't know, I would probably like an hour a day.

For all of us.

I think that would be plenty.

A national limit.

I can't say I want to delete social media because I made my entire career on social media. I love Twitter, but maybe like an hour a day for everyone I think that would be good.

I like that.

We haven't talked about crypto at all in this podcast. I think that probably there is going to be a lot of real economic use, activity running through stable coins and perhaps tokenization of equity and so forth. I think that's pretty real and legit. Most of it, I do still think, is just basically garbage. But I'm not as cynical as I used to be, and so I think there's some exciting things happening there. Maybe I would control it. I would guide it in some positive direction.

So you would like to control the cryptocurrency industry?

Yes. I would control that. No big deal.

No, I like that. Very specific, focused. You know, I ask this question of some people and they're like, “I would control the weather.” I'm like, “Well, you're much more ambitious than I am.”

Last week, the Social Security Administration (SSA) quietly updated a public notice to reveal that the agency would be sharing “citizenship and immigration information” with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This data sharing was already happening: WIRED reported in April that the Trump administration had already started pooling sensitive data from across the government for the purpose of immigration enforcement.

This public notice issued by SSA makes that official, months after the fact. The notice is known as a system of record notice (SORN), a document that outlines how an agency will share the data it has, with whom, and for what purpose. This notice is required under the Privacy Act of 1974. Normally, SORNs are issued before any data is shared between agencies, giving the public and government officials sufficient time to offer comment. But WIRED found that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was pulling in data from across DHS, SSA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and state voter data, among other sources, based largely on the US Citizenship and Immigration Service's (USCIS) Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database.

“There are laws that require the government to inform the public about their use of various kinds of databases and other surveillance technologies,” says Adam Schwartz, privacy litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital privacy and free speech. “If the government starts using the database and does not put out the appropriate disclosure and then later does put out that appropriate disclosure, they still have violated the law.”

The Trump administration has gone to drastic lengths to remake the government in its image. A core component of this has been an effort to vacuum up large swathes of data from across federal agencies, many of which were never meant to be comingled. This has frequently happened regardless of the laws, norms, or procedures that normally govern the access and sharing of sensitive data. The SORN from SSA is just the latest confirmation of exactly how much data is being shared in ways experts tell WIRED is “unprecedented.”

Much of this data sharing begins with misinformation about the data at hand. In the early days of the Trump administration, Elon Musk seized on a misunderstanding of SSA's data to spread the claim that 150-year-old people were receiving benefits. They weren't, but DOGE capitalized on the idea that the SSA's systems were inefficient and fraudulent to burrow into the agency's data and technology systems. In April, reporting from The New York Times found that in an effort to force immigrants to self-deport, the administration was adding them to the SSA's database of dead people, effectively meaning that their Social Security numbers could not be used to get jobs or access government services. As part of the effort to combine disparate data across the government to verify citizenship and surveil immigrants, DHS recently published a different but related SORN that effectively transforms SAVE into a voter verification system, which experts also warned could be bypassing the requirements of the Privacy Act.

Leland Dudek, who served as acting commissioner for the Social Security Administration between February and May 2025, led the agency when members of DOGE first appeared. Dudek says he was initially supportive of DOGE and acted as a bridge between SSA staff and members of the DOGE team before becoming disillusioned.

Dudek tells WIRED that though there had been agreements to share data with DHS before—mostly Social Security numbers—the scope of the recent SORN seems unprecedented. Normally, says Dudek, DHS is able to check certain Social Security numbers against SSA data, within a limited scope.

But he says that the SSA does not have a way to deactivate a Social Security number, meaning that it can't be used to allow someone to work or collect government payments, unless that person has died. Dudek says what appears to have changed within the new SORN is that there is now “a special indicator code that identifies types of questionable data or special circumstances concerning an application for an SSN.” This, he says, appears to mean that there would now be a way to essentially flag a Social Security number and take it out of use, without marking them as deceased.

“You can literally cut off anyone's financial life you want, and you don't need to use the death master file,” he says.

President Donald Trump has focused heavily on cracking down on immigration since his return to office. The administration has canceled Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from countries in Africa and Latin America; deployed the National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement; and claims to have deported more than 500,000 undocumented immigrants. The administration has also sought to collect more data on immigrants, particularly those using government services like housing assistance or food benefits, and Republicans have renewed an effort to add a citizenship question to the US Census. Part of this effort also appears to be the creation of a national citizenship database.

“It seems that DHS was dead set on creating a national citizenship data bank, and for whatever reason, they determined that the Social Security Administration had the largest set of citizenship data across any agency in the government,” says Nikhel Sus, deputy counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). “The American people had no opportunity to weigh in on this dramatic new expansion of the SAVE system before the government illegally repurposed Social Security Administration data.”

CREW is part of a group of organizations currently suing the US government, claiming that the Trump administration is unlawfully consolidating sensitive data across agencies. “These belated systems of records notices only confirm after the fact that the government has run roughshod over the law,” says Sus.

The government also previously held that Social Security data shouldn't be used for citizenship purposes. In a 2023 letter from the SSA to the Fair Elections Center, a nonprofit focused on voting rights, SSA lawyer Jessica Vollmer wrote that “while SSA records provide an indication of citizenship, they do not provide definitive information on U.S. citizenship,” and that “SSA does not have citizenship information for all individuals who have been issued an SSN.” That authority lies with DHS.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin tells WIRED that “USCIS remains dedicated to securing the nation's electoral process—by allowing states to efficiently verify voter eligibility, we are reinforcing the principle that America's elections are reserved exclusively for American citizens. We encourage all federal, state, and local agencies to use the SAVE program.”

SSA did not respond to a request for comment.

“[I am] not aware of something happening on this scale, where there was a total disregard for the required procedures of the Privacy Act,” says John Davisson, director of litigation and senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), which is also part of the suit against the government.

Davisson also says that the legal statute that the SORN cites as justification—one that dates back to when immigration was handled by the now defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)—does not actually support unrestricted data sharing with DHS. In a 1999 opinion, the Department of Justice limited the kinds of restrictions agencies could put on sharing data with law enforcement. “It essentially says you cannot obstruct an otherwise lawful disclosure of citizenship- or immigration-related information. It does not actually give the Social Security Administration an affirmative grant of authority to disclose information outside of the strictures of the Privacy Act,” says Davisson.

But Davisson says that doesn't mean there are no restrictions at all. “This administration has attempted to subvert that reading of the statute and to claim that it has carte blanche to obtain from any agency, anywhere in government, whatever immigration or citizenship information it wants.”

Experts tell WIRED that because Social Security data was never collected with the goal of being used for citizenship or immigration purposes, it is also likely to include inaccuracies.

For instance, if someone receives a Social Security number and later becomes a naturalized citizen, Social Security data would not necessarily reflect that change. “There are a lot of reliability concerns when you match disparate data sets across agencies, especially when the data was collected for different purposes,” says Sus. “You could have mismatches. You could have the wrong people's records being incorrectly linked together.” This could mean that people who are legally in or are citizens of the United States could lose their ability to vote or work due to data matching errors.

Dudek, like Sus, says that SSA data is not a reliable way to determine citizenship and could risk disenfranchising people. Dudek says that in order to combine data responsibly, experts would need to clean and cross-match it across other data sources to reduce the risk of false negatives or positives, and agencies would need to disclose risks or biases within the data itself.

“Is that being done?” says Dudek. “I'm not aware of it being done, and that concerns me.”

A trial in Essex highlights how reused server heat is being piped into homes.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A couple from Essex in the United Kingdom are heating their home with a small data center in their garden, according to a BBC News report. The system, described as a “HeatHub” installed in a shed, has reduced owners Terrence and Lesley Bridges' energy bills to around £40 a month by diverting the heat from server workloads into a domestic hot water system.

The setup is part of a program from Thermify, which itself is part of the SHIELD project by UK Power Networks. The SHIELD Project aims to develop new ways for low-income households to transition to net-zero. According to Thermify's CEO and co-founder, Travis Theune, the couple's HeatHub installation will become part of a “remote and distributed” data center — just one of many units processing customer data.

Each HeatHub unit consists of several modules containing up to 56 Raspberry Pi computers. Although these datacenters are not designed for heavy AI workloads, Theune says the systems could be used to run apps or analyze large volumes of data. While the project is still in its pilot phase, clients will eventually pay Thermifty to process their data using HeatHubs.

Thermify's HeatHub is just one example of server heat being used to help offset utility bills. Deep Green, another UK firm, has installed micro data centres at leisure centres and swimming pools in Devon and Manchester. Each pod contains high-performance compute units submerged in mineral oil coolant, which is circulated through existing heat exchangers. In one deployment, Deep Green claims its waste heat covers more than 60 percent of the pool's annual demand, saving thousands in gas bills and cutting emissions by six tonnes a year.

Neither model is suitable for DIY installation. Most UK homes are limited to a 100-amp single-phase supply, and any sustained high-power load must be carefully managed to avoid overload or fire risk. A typical combination boiler system won't benefit from cylinder heating, and insurance or grid compliance could become an issue if systems are installed unofficially.

Still, the trend is very much on energy regulator Ofgem's radar. It's preparing to regulate heat networks under a phased plan beginning in 2026, running through 2027. While garden-shed datacentres may not fall under its scope yet, the idea of selling reused server heat back into homes is beginning to gain formal oversight.

You don't always get to know the real reason someone leaves their job—not even the guy in the video below, Abidur Chowdhury, an Apple industrial designer who played a “key role” in developing the iPhone Air, and acted as its spokesman when it was introduced, but who has, according to Bloomberg, left Apple for an AI startup.

With that in mind, the Information reported a little over a week ago that the iPhone Air is such a flop that Apple has delayed rolling out the next model. (Bloomberg's story on Chowdhury notes that a second iPhone Air will still happen, but not until 2027) Gizmodo's largely positive review of the device found it too lightweight for its own good, with less-than-ideal battery life, and noted that if it “ends up going the way of the dodo like the iPhone Mini and Plus,” it might turn out to be a “testbed for miniaturizing components into a smart glasses form factor” and may include components of a foldable iPhone still to come.

Bloomberg's story on Chowdhury's departure (attributed to anonymous “people familiar with the move”) is from Bloomberg's intrepid Apple scoop-getter, Mark Gurman, who has hastened to imply that he does not think the iPhone Air is some sort of corporate disaster that merits Chowdhury being forced out. “His exit is unrelated to the debut of the phone, which has seen its design praised despite underwhelming sales,” Gurman tweeted.

— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) November 18, 2025



Chowdhury joined Apple in 2019, around the same time celebrity chief design officer Jony Ive departed the company. According to reports, that period would have coincided with the company's attempts to recover from the slow-motion meltdown that ensued when Ive seemingly lost his faith in Apple due to disagreements over what the Apple Watch was supposed to be, and then mostly stopped coming to work, and let his department basically atrophy.

According to Gurman, Chowdhury's resignation “made waves internally, given his rising profile within the design team.”

Flagship phones provide experiences that justify their premium price points, packing in superior cameras, faster processors and features that budget phones just can't match. This Galaxy S25 Ultra represents the best offering from Samsung with a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 512GB of storage, and camera hardware that captures professional-quality photos even in challenging conditions.

Amazon has quietly cut the price to $1,069 from the usual $1,419 (25% off), a new record low that rarely sees flagship devices that have just recently hit store shelves. This is an unlocked model that works on any carrier and includes a full one-year US warranty.

The Dynamic AMOLED main display is 6.9 inches and sports a resolution of 3120 x 1440 pixels, which makes text razor-sharp and images highly detailed. Its adaptive refresh rate goes up to 120Hz and adapts to what you are watching automatically; it's very smooth if you're scrolling through or gaming, down much lower to conserve battery on static content. The peak brightness hits 2600 nits which means you can read the screen relatively easily under direct sunlight, whereas many other phones become dim and washed out. The device also has HDR10+ enabled for better contrast and color reproduction for watching Netflix content compatible with the resolution.

Scratch and drop resistance has been improved over prior generations with the Corning Gorilla Armor glass protecting the screen while an anti-reflective coating reduces glare in bright conditions. The S Pen stylus slides into a built-in slot within the titanium frame for precise input to take notes, draw, or navigate the interface without having to carry an additional accessory. The construction in titanium feels premium and truly durable, standing up to daily wear and tear better than aluminum frames. Water and dust resistance remains IP68 and survives submersion in water up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.

The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is Qualcomm's most powerful mobile chip, delivering performance that handles demanding tasks without slowdown. Gaming runs smoothly at high graphics settings, and the most resource-intensive apps-anything from video editors all the way to 3D modeling software-operate instantaneously. The processor includes dedicated AI cores that accelerate machine learning tasks, improving everything from photo processing to voice recognition.

The camera system includes a 200-megapixel main sensor that captures extraordinary detail in well-lit conditions and maintains quality when cropping into or zooming photos. Light entering through its larger sensor outperforms typical camera phones, capturing cleaner images with less noise in darker environments. AI Night Mode improves low-light photography by stitching together multiple exposures and intelligently brightening shadows, all while taming highlights

The periscope telephoto lens offers 5x optical zoom and up to 100x digital zoom: it allows you to photograph faraway scenes as clear as possible without having to get closer. The ultra-wide camera shoots broad landscapes and tight interior shots that the main camera cannot fit into the frame. Video recording goes up to 8K resolution at 30fps or 4K at 120fps for smooth slow-motion footage. Advanced image stabilization keeps video smooth even when you're walking or moving fast and directional microphones record clean audio and reduce wind noise.

The 5000mAh battery easily lasts a full day of heavy use including streaming, gaming, photography, and constant connectivity. Adaptive battery learning adjusts power management based on your usage patterns, optimizing background processes to extend runtime. Fast charging reaches wired speeds of 45W that take the battery from empty to full in under an hour. Wireless charging and reverse wireless charging let you top up accessories like earbuds directly from the back of the phone.

At $1,069, you save $350 on Samsung's flagship while getting the full 512GB storage configuration that normally commands top dollar. This record low pricing brings premium smartphone tech within reach at a discount that none of its competitors can offer with similar specs and features.

Dead car batteries always seem to happen at the worst time and leave you stranded in parking lots or stuck at home when you're running late. Jump starters resolve that by allowing you to restart your car without the need for another vehicle or a wait for roadside assistance: The NOCO Boost GB40 packs 1000 amps of lithium power into a compact unit small enough to fit in your glove box, and it's capable of jump-starting vehicles up to 20 times on a single charge. Amazon has dropped the price for early Black Friday to $99, down from its usual $124, which is the lowest price ever for one of the most popular jump starters available.

See at Amazon

The GB40 provides 1000 amps of peak current which is a sufficient amount of juice to crank over gas engines up to 6.0 liters and diesel engines up to 3.0 liters. This covers everything from compact sedans and SUVs to larger trucks and work vehicles. The lithium battery technology maintains its charge far better than traditional lead-acid jump starters and holds power for months between uses. You get up to 20 jump starts from a single charge which means you can help multiple stranded drivers or restart your own vehicle repeatedly if you're dealing with a stubborn battery issue.

The UltraSafe technology eliminates the biggest fears people have about jump-starting cars: Spark-proof connections mean there are no dangerous arcs to be seen in case you accidentally touch the terminals together when attaching the clamps. Reverse polarity protection prevents damage in case you connect the positive and negative clamps backward-a mistake made more often than people care to admit.

With the built-in power bank function, the NOCO Boost GB40 becomes an emergency charging station for your devices: The USB ports can recharge phones, tablets, portable speakers, and any other USB-powered gear when you are away from outlets. That dual function means the jump starter does double duty as backup power on camping trips, outdoor events, or during a power outage.

The integrated 100-lumen LED flashlight provides seven different lighting modes, including steady beam, SOS signal, and emergency strobe. The steady mode lights up your engine bay while you make connections in the dark or helps you locate that dropped tool during roadside repairs. SOS mode flashes the international distress signal if you need to draw attention to yourself in an emergency. The strobe setting's good for making yourself visible to traffic when you're stuck on the shoulder of a highway at night.

The entire package weighs just 2.5 pounds and measures small enough to tuck into a glove compartment or center console. The compact size means you'll actually keep it in your vehicle instead of leaving it in the garage where it does you no good. The IP65-rated housing protects the internals from water splashes and dust intrusion, while the rubberized over-molding absorbs impacts if you drop it.

At $99, you're paying less than a roadside assistance call for a tool that eliminates the need for those services entirely. The combination of genuine starting power, comprehensive safety features, and the bonus power bank functionality creates value that goes beyond just the emergency jump-starting capability. This all-time low price makes it easy to keep one in every vehicle you own.

A new study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center found that patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) may benefit from receiving immunotherapy earlier in the course of treatment. 

Results from the phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03521830), presented Oct. 20 at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual meeting, show that first-line nivolumab, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, produced an objective response rate (ORR) of 52% in 29 patients with inoperable BCC. Objective response rate is the percentage of patients in the study whose cancer shrunk or disappeared after treatment. In this study, the ORR is significantly higher than published response rates of approximately 25%-30% for second-line anti-PD-1 administered after a hedgehog pathway inhibitor, the current standard of care, the researchers report. 

Our results show that we can improve the likelihood of tumor response in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma by administering anti-PD-1 in the front line, rather than after hedgehog pathway inhibitors. We look forward to further investigating these findings in larger, randomized trials."

Govind Warrier, M.D., M.P.H., assistant professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and co-leader of the study

Investigators also explored whether adding relatlimab, an anti–LAG-3 immune checkpoint inhibitor, to nivolumab could induce tumor regressions in patients whose disease had progressed on nivolumab alone. Among 13 such patients, the ORR was 31% (4 of 13). The rationale for testing this combination was based on promising results in melanoma studies, where adding anti-LAG-3 to anti-PD-1 helped overcome resistance to single agent anti-PD-1, and from work at Johns Hopkins revealing that LAG-3 may be an important immune checkpoint in BCC. 

"We discovered that LAG-3 is commonly expressed in the tumor microenvironment of aggressive basal cell carcinomas, suggesting LAG-3 blockade could be an attractive therapeutic option for these patients," said Julie Stein Deutsch M.D., assistant professor of dermatology, pathology, and oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, member of the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and a co-leader of the study. LAG-3 was first co-characterized by scientists at the Bloomberg–Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. 

Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and relatlimab work by blocking proteins that cancers use to evade the immune system, enabling the body's immune cells to recognize and destroy tumor cells. Nivolumab is FDA-approved for patients with melanoma and several other cancers. Relatlimab in combination with nivolumab is FDA-approved for melanoma and is being tested in patients with a variety of other cancer types. 

In the United States, approximately 10,000 patients each year develop inoperable BCC, according to a report in the Annals of Oncology. Current first-line treatment with hedgehog pathway inhibitors is often limited by short-lived responses and intolerable side effects. Response rates to second-line anti-PD-1 (about 20 – 30%) are low relative to response rates of other skin cancers to first-line anti-PD-1 (about 40 – 50%), the researchers say. 

"These findings highlight important opportunities to improve outcomes for patients with advanced BCC, a population with few effective treatments," Warrier said.

A new study investigating neuroinflammation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain, a small, midbrain dopaminergic region, has found that acute and chronic depression are associated with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. The findings from this new study in Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, published by Elsevier, help clarify the VTA's role as a potential target for developing more targeted and state-specific treatments for depression.

Depression affects approximately 300 million individuals worldwide, making it a leading cause of disability. Inflammation has consistently been linked to depression in both clinical and population studies. Periods of prolonged stress, often preceding depression, can induce acute and, in severe cases, chronic inflammation in the brain. Previous research suggests that inflammatory processes can disrupt the synthesis, release, and reuptake of dopamine, the key neurotransmitter central to the brain's reward system. Disruptions within this reward circuitry are thought to underlie core depressive symptoms such as anhedonia and low motivation.

"Our study focused on the VTA because it is at the core of the mesocortical and mesolimbic systems, which are both strongly associated with depression due to their central roles in reward processing, motivation, and emotional regulation. However, because of its small size and complex structure, the VTA has been relatively neglected in neuroimaging research," notes co-lead investigator Lena K.L. Oestreich, PhD, School of Psychology, and the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

The researchers wanted to determine whether the VTA could reveal biological differences in individuals with a history of depression (chronic state) or current depressive symptoms (acute state). They analyzed MRI markers sensitive to inflammation and brain microstructure, specifically measures of extracellular and intracellular water content in the VTA, using a large and diverse sample from 32,495 UK Biobank participants, including 3,807 individuals with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)-diagnosed depression.

Co-lead investigator Sarah Khalife, PhD candidate, School of Psychology, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, explains, "We found that individuals with a history of major depression showed higher MRI markers associated with neuroinflammation (free water and isotropic volume fraction) in the VTA, suggesting increased extracellular inflammatory processes. In contrast, current depressive symptom severity was associated with distinct microstructural changes (higher intracellular volume fraction and orientation dispersion, but lower isotropic volume fraction), indicating that acute and chronic depression may involve different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."

Depression is a highly heterogeneous disorder influenced by numerous factors, including sex, lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition, and metabolic variables such as BMI. The results of this analysis underscore the complex interplay between neuroinflammation, lifestyle factors, and depressive symptoms, suggesting that future studies should consider these factors in more detail to fully understand the multifactorial nature of depression.

"By focusing on the VTA and using updated brainstem atlases, the investigators were able to map the VTA more precisely and contribute to the limited body of human imaging research on this region, illuminating the VTA's role as a potential future therapeutic target for depression," concludes Editor-in-Chief of Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging Cameron S. Carter, MD, University of California Irvine School of Medicine.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) will host its first Digital & AI Summit in Berlin on 21-22 November, bringing together global experts in cardiology, technology, and healthcare. This two-day event will spotlight the latest artificial intelligence (AI) developments and explore how digital innovation can drive life-saving progress in cardiovascular care.

The summit's 61 sessions will include three roundtables in which academic and industry experts, along with patient representatives, will discuss trustworthiness and user friendliness of AI, as well as issues surrounding regulation, cost and policies for integrating the technology.

"Clinical implementation of AI is currently the final frontier we are trying to reach, yet some 90% of what we have so far are developments, proof-of-concept studies and early validations," says Summit co-chair Associate Professor Nico Bruining, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands. "Few AI tools are in clinical use today because they still need validation, regulatory approval, and financing. Post-market surveillance, ethical safeguards, patient acceptance, and clinician education are also essential for successful implementation."

"These roundtables provide key information and debate on these crucial topics, allow the audience to connect with one another and build communities, and may even lead to publications. They also aim to inform policymakers and media, whose accurate reporting is essential for public understanding as AI evolves."

The first roundtable, Trustworthiness of AI, will include a talk by Frank Rademakers, Emeritus Professor of Medicine at KU Leuven, Belgium, who says: "AI tools should not be treated differently from other diagnostic and therapeutic agents that we use in medicine. They should be evaluated for their intended purpose in the intended population and context with appropriate clinical investigations, including but not exclusively randomised controlled trials. In contrast with most drugs and medical devices, however, AI software can 'drift' during use., and also further learn and improve with use; so more emphasis should be placed on post-market continuous evaluation of each AI tool during its real-world use in specific environments."

Giving a patient perspective at that same roundtable session will be Inga Drossart of the ESC Patient Forum, Berlin, Germany. She says: "AI in cardiology and medicine should feel like a tool that supports, not replaces the human care and connection. When patients are involved in shaping and improving these tools, AI can truly enhance care while keeping the things like empathy, communication and the human touch at the heart of medicine."

The roundtable on User experience with AI will include a presentation by David Duncker, Head of the Hannover Heart Rhythm Center, Germany. "Clinician trust is key to successfully using AI in ECG diagnostics. Ongoing education helps build this trust by explaining AI technologies and clarifying what they can and can't do. For example, Holter ECG analysis by AI is already implemented into clinical practice. But while prediction of future atrial fibrillation in sinus rhythm ECGs worked in some studies, it is not yet ready to use for clinical decision-making," Duncker says.

The last of the three roundtables, Regulations, policies and economics for AI, will include a diverse group of participants including Professor Alan Fraser, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK. Professor Fraser says: "Referring uncritically to the potential of 'artificial intelligence' in general is not constructive; we should consider each application more precisely. Innovation in healthcare led by technological advances looking for clinical applications is misguided.

"There is wide consensus that risk-based, proportionate regulation is needed but an accepted scientific framework and detailed standards are lacking. Key requirements must include full transparency of performance of any new tool in a large independent retest study that is representative of the target population of use."

AI has already shown great promise in cardiology, but trust, usability, cost, safety and regulations are key to integrating it into clinical practice. The roundtables at the ESC Digital & AI Summit will explore these critical issues with insights from a wide range of experts. We hope to see you there!"

Researchers led by investigators at Mass General Brigham have discovered that over the last 25 years, heat and cold-related deaths have caused more than 69,000 deaths in the U.S., disproportionately affecting certain populations. The findings are published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

"Prior research, many of which was ecological, modeling or forecasting in nature, has examined heat- and cold-related deaths separately, but this study provides a real, observed nationwide and contemporary assessment of deaths related to non-optimal temperatures at both ends of the spectrum and across key demographic subgroups," said senior author Shady Abohashem, MD, MPH, investigator at the Cardiovascular Imaging Research Center of Massachusetts General Hospital and Mass General Brigham Heart and Vascular Institute. Abohashem is also an instructor at Harvard Medical School.

For their study, Abohashem and his colleagues analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) platform, specifically looking for death certificates that recorded temperature as a contributing or underlying cause of death based on codes from medical records.

Between 1999 and 2024, there were 69,713,971 U.S. deaths, of which 69,256 (1 out of every 1,000) had extreme temperature exposure recorded as an underlying or contributing cause (35% heat-related and 65% cold-related). Crude estimates indicated that temperature-related mortality rates were higher in more recent years. 

"Our findings show that both heat and cold exposure continue to claim thousands of lives every year in the United States, deaths that are largely preventable," said Abohashem. "While most temperature-related deaths are still driven by cold exposure, heat-related deaths are expected to rise as climate change accelerates."

Older adults (≥65 years) and males had higher temperature-related mortality compared with their counterparts. Regarding race/ethnicity, Black individuals had the highest heat-related adjusted mortality rates, which were more than twice those of white individuals. Cold-related adjusted mortality rates were likewise greatest for Blacks, followed by Whites and Hispanics.

"Climate change increases risks of severe weather events, and our findings underscore the need for targeted adaptation strategies, like improving housing quality, access to cooling and heating, and early-warning systems, to protect vulnerable groups as climate extremes intensify," said Abohashem. "The results help us understand which populations may be disproportionately affected so public health strategies can shift accordingly."

Researchers at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Biology have identified a unique mechanism involved in the aging of the immune system – along with a framework for enhancing its function in older individuals. The study, published in Nature Aging, was led by Assistant Professor Noga Ron-Harel and doctoral student David Ezuz.

The human immune system weakens with age, partly because T cells – white blood cells responsible for identifying and destroying viruses and cancer cells – gradually lose their effectiveness.

The Technion researchers discovered that a key factor in this process is the aging of the spleen, a vital organ in the immune system. In addition to serving as the body's main reservoir of white blood cells, the spleen contains a specialized region responsible for breaking down defective red blood cells and recycling their iron-rich components. This essential process becomes less efficient with age, leading to the accumulation of iron deposits and toxic by-products in the spleen. These create an oxidative environment that damages T cells. The researchers found that even brief exposure of young T cells to an "aged spleen" impairs their immune effectiveness.

In response to this toxic environment, and in an effort to protect themselves, T cells reduce their iron uptake and sequester the iron already present within the cell in protein complexes that lower its availability. However, this protective mechanism has a downside: since available iron is essential for T-cell activation, their ability to respond is significantly weakened.

The researchers went beyond these findings and proposed a way to counter the decline in immune function – controlled iron supplementation at the time of T-cell activation. In experiments on elderly mice, this intervention improved the activation of aged T cells and enhanced the immune response of older mice to vaccination.

The research was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the Horizon 2020 program.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 10 of Aging-US on October 3, 2025, titled "Growth hormone excess drives liver aging via increased glycation stress."

In this study, led by first author Parminder Singh alongside with corresponding authors Pankaj Kapahi from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and Andrzej Bartke from Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, researchers investigated how elevated growth hormone (GH) levels contribute to liver aging and dysfunction. They found that excess GH disrupts liver metabolism in ways that resemble aging-related liver damage. The study suggests that managing glycation stress may help prevent or treat liver diseases linked to abnormal hormone levels.

Excess GH is known to cause different disorders, but its long-term impact on internal organs like the liver has remained unclear. To address this, researchers used a mouse model engineered to overproduce bovine GH and examined how chronic hormone exposure affects liver function over time.

"Pathological conditions such as acromegaly or pituitary tumors result in elevated circulating GH levels, which have been implicated in a spectrum of metabolic disorders, potentially by regulating liver metabolism."

The team found that young mice with GH overexpression showed molecular and cellular patterns similar to those in naturally aged livers. In both groups, genes involved in metabolism were suppressed, while those linked to immune and inflammatory responses were activated. On one hand, the metabolic changes were associated with the buildup of advanced glycation end products, harmful compounds formed when sugars attach to proteins or fats without proper regulation. On the other hand, the immune and inflammatory changes reflected a process known as "inflammaging," a form of chronic, low-grade inflammation commonly associated with aging. By revealing the overlap between hormone-driven and age-related liver dysfunction, the study provides new insight into how GH may accelerate aging processes.

Importantly, the team showed that reducing glycation stress can reverse many of these negative effects. Mice treated with a compound that lowers glycation levels demonstrated improved liver health, reduced insulin resistance, and enhanced physical function. This intervention also corrected several abnormal genetic patterns caused by excess GH. The findings point to a potential therapeutic strategy for liver diseases associated with aging and hormonal imbalances.

Overall, this research identifies glycation and its byproducts as key contributors to liver damage caused by excess GH. It suggests that targeting glycation could offer broad therapeutic benefits, not only for hormone-related conditions but also for supporting liver health during aging.

Apriori Bio, a Flagship Pioneering company focused on developing prospective, variant-resilient vaccines, and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research Infectious Diseases Labs (A*STAR IDL) announced a strategic research partnership to co-develop and evaluate next generation self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccines targeting seasonal and pandemic influenza. The collaboration brings together Apriori's Octavia™ platform for intelligent, prospective antigen design with A*STAR IDL's saRNA delivery technology, and will initially focus on improved H5 influenza vaccines that anticipate infection in humans.

This collaboration is an important step for Apriori as we unite complementary strengths in vaccine design and delivery to drive lasting immunity against one of the world's most challenging viruses. Apriori has redefined what's possible in vaccine development by harnessing the power of AI to predict viral evolution and protect people against pathogens that outpace traditional approaches, such as influenza. Together, with A*STAR IDL's next generation RNA delivery capabilities, we aim to change the standard of protection for patients worldwide."

Craig Williams, MBA, Chief Executive Officer of Apriori Bio and CEO-Partner at Flagship Pioneering

Professor Lisa Ng, Executive Director of A*STAR IDL, said, "This collaboration reflects our shared commitment to translating research into real-world impact. By combining A*STAR IDL's strengths in RNA and infectious disease expertise with Apriori's AI-guided antigen design, we aim to accelerate vaccine development and strengthen preparedness for future outbreaks in Singapore and globally."

Harry Kleanthous, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Apriori Bio, added, "Today's vaccines against H5 influenza have shown limitations in achieving both robust single-dose immunity and breadth of protection against emerging viral variants. saRNA offers a compelling solution to deliver durable protection from a single dose, while Apriori's Octavia™-generated antigen sequence would provide enhanced coverage. By addressing both of these critical unmet needs, we aim to develop the first anticipatory H5 vaccine to build a healthier future."

Ms Irene Cheong, Assistant Chief Executive of A*STAR Innovation and Enterprise, added, "This partnership between A*STAR and Apriori Bio brings together complementary expertise in RNA and vaccine science that can better protect populations and strengthen global health security. A*STAR is excited to partner with another Flagship portfolio company with cutting-edge technologies to advance novel solutions for human health."

The collaboration takes place under Flagship Pioneering's ongoing institutional partnership with A*STAR, which aims to jointly advance breakthrough solutions for the advancement of human health, as well as to advance Singapore's position as a global hub for biotechnological innovations.

Researchers at the University of Tokyo developed an experimental method to induce a strong physiological response linked to psychological pressure by making participants aim for a streak of success in a task. Their findings suggest this approach reproduces pressurelike conditions in a laboratory setting more effectively than traditional methods, affording easier access to the study of this state. That in turn could open up research into how pressure influences human performance in physical and intellectual tasks.

Whether in an exam hall or on the field, to "crack" under pressure is a common trope. But what's the reality behind this idea? It's easy to assume that with greater pressure comes greater chance of losing your composure. To know, then, how to overcome this could yield greater performance benefits. But the path to study such ideas is far from simple. Being rigorous in the field of psychology is extremely difficult, as there are limitless factors that can impact different people in different ways. Previous experimental methods have been limited in that they failed to induce strong physiological arousal.

Driven by such limitations and an urge to better understand the impacts of pressure on performance, Professor Kazutoshi Kudo and his team at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences set out to devise a better method. Their aim was to find how to produce strong physiological arousal in subjects in ways that allowed them to isolate the effects of different kinds of tasks, so that the nature of the tasks, settings and other variables could be methodically measured and accounted for. It was also important for them that their method could exist at larger scales than is often possible for tests and trials in this field.

"We tested a simple idea: If people aim for a streak of consecutive successes, does the feeling of being on a roll produce a measurable change within the body or to their performance?" said Kudo. "In a simple force exertion task, people aiming for 10 successes in a row showed an exponential rise in heart rate with improved accuracy. But when the goal was to simply make 100 total successes, removing the streak mindset, both the heart rate and performance changes disappeared. The takeaway is that how we frame a goal can strongly shape both arousal and performance."

The team set up two simple tasks and had 30 participants try them. In the first "streak-goal" experiment, 15 people had to press a sensor with a specific amount of force, not too much nor too little, and they had to try and get it right 10 times in a row. In the second "totals-goal" test, a group of 15 were tasked with getting 100 successes overall, but they did not have to be consecutive. During the tests, participants' heart rates were measured to gauge their state of arousal.

Kudo and team found that in the first experiment, people's heart rates rose rapidly the longer they maintained their streaks, showing they were feeling more pressured. What was a little surprising, though, was that their performance - the ability to accurately reproduce an equal amount of force with their finger each time - improved rather than dropped. In the second experiment, heart rates and performance levels remained far more consistent. All this implies the sense of pressure only really came when the idea was to keep a streak of successes going.

"The streak goal produced a large, escalating rise in heart rate as people approached longer streaks, on the order of about 20 beats per minute in our lab setting, much larger than in typical lab experiments," said Kudo. "Also, under the streak goal, performance improved steadily rather than dropping, at least for this simple task. And when the goal was totals instead of streaks, both the heart‑rate rise and performance gains vanished, showing that the mindset of fragility - one miss resets everything - is what drives the effect."

To many these findings will seem intuitively obvious; racing a clock, or performing contingent rather than independent actions will naturally make some feel more pressured. But what the point of these experiments was to demonstrate that this method can tease out the differences in responses in a controlled and measurable way. The "consecutive success" method gives scientists a simple and efficient way to create psychological pressure in a lab environment without needing external drivers such as rewards or audiences, which have been used in the past.

"Many lab studies make simple binary comparisons - pressure vs. no pressure - and often produce only modest physiological changes, which don't fully match the psychological pressure people feel in real life," said Kudo. "We wanted a continuous, scalable way to raise stakes trial by trial, without money, judges or crowds. The streak frame does exactly that, as the streak grows, each trial matters more, so we asked whether this would more faithfully capture real‑world pressure and how it relates to performance."

This idea could also evolve into tools to study athletic training, mental health, stress management, education and even musical performance. Though, before then, the team aims to build upon these early experiments. At present, there are limitations due to the size of the groups, which were also all male, and the simplicity of the tasks, alongside some other more technical constraints.

"We plan to recruit more diverse participants, including women and a wider age range, and test cognitive and artistic tasks alongside motor ones. Heart rate, self-report and other sensors will track the sense of pressure felt across groups and contexts. Because our arousal manipulation is simple and nonverbal, it could even extend to animal studies, enabling comparative research on the neural mechanisms underlying performance changes during high-arousal situations," said Kudo. "We think training could become more pressure-aware, athletes and musicians could practice near their tipping point, and therapists could use gentle streak goals to build precision and confidence in rehab. The low cost and portability of our methodology make it suitable beyond use in the lab."

Nigella sativa (black cumin), the spice that boosts the flavor of curries like korma and paneer also has another use: its seeds have long been used as a medicinal plant in traditional medicine for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Now, a clinical trial led by Osaka Metropolitan University suggests that they also have anti-obesity benefits.

To investigate these effects, a team led by Associate Professor Akiko Kojima-Yuasa of the Graduate School of Human Life and Ecology used cellular experiments and human clinical trials.

In the human clinical trial, participants who consumed 5g of black cumin seed powder daily-roughly a tablespoon-for 8 weeks showed significant reductions in blood triglycerides, LDL ('bad') cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels. In addition, HDL ('good') cholesterol levels increased.

Improvements in blood lipid profiles like these are associated with a lower risk of heart problems and premature death.

The group also performed cellular experiments to understand the processes involved. They found that black cumin seed extract inhibited adipogenesis-the formation and maturation of fat cells-by blocking both fat droplet accumulation and the differentiation process.

"This study strongly suggests that black cumin seeds are useful as a functional food for preventing obesity and lifestyle-related diseases," Professor Kojima-Yuasa said. "It was so gratifying to see black cumin comprehensively demonstrate actual, demonstrable blood lipid-lowering effects in a human trial."

"We hope to perform longer-term and larger-scale clinical trials to investigate the effects of black cumin on metabolism," she added. "We are particularly interested in investigating its effects on insulin resistance in diabetes and inflammatory markers."

In a surprising discovery, a 'sticky molecule' that occurs naturally in our blood vessels could be both a culprit behind blood clots and organ failure during COVID and long COVID and the key to new treatments to counter COVID-related viruses.

Researchers say the molecule, called P-selectin, could turn the tide to develop a new generation of mRNA therapies to combat not just COVID variants, but also other viruses in the same family.

The study, co-led by the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney, was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. 

P-selectin is a molecule that already plays a major role in inflammation in our body, acting like a homing signal to immune cells during infection. 

The study found that P-selectin was especially 'sticky' and attached itself readily to protein 'spikes' on the surface of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and both Wuhan and Delta strains of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for causing COVID).

"P-selectin is expressed on platelets – the cells that cause blood clots – and it promotes virus and platelet complexes that can cause dangerous blood clots, a major driver of death in severe COVID infection, and also a likely cause of long COVID," said lead researcher Dr. Cesar Moreno from the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre and Faculty of Science.

But P-selectin also normally controls white blood cell migration through our body., and our study found that during COVID infection, P-selectin also captures SARS-CoV-2 virus in the blood, holding the virus in blood vessels and blocking its ability to infect our cells."

Importantly, when the researchers created an mRNA-based therapy that could drive P-selectin expression in the absence of inflammation, it provided broad protection against coronavirus infection.

"Since P-selectin can catch the virus and block its ability to infect our cells, we took advantage of this to create a broad-acting mRNA therapy that can protect against known and most likely emerging coronavirus pandemic strains," said Dr Moreno.

The researchers used CRISPR genetic screening to test the entire human genome, looking for any human genes that can block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond P-selectin, they found 33 other new genes that can protect us from SARS- CoV-2, and these genes can likely also be used as protective therapies against coronavirus and probably also other major viral infections.

"Vaccines have significantly reduced disease severity and deaths, but whether it's coronavirus or other strains, at some stage new pandemics will pose a threat to us. Having broad, easily manufactured mRNA therapies ready can help mitigate these risks," said senior author Professor Greg Neely, Head of the Dr. John and Anne Chong Lab for Functional Genomics at the University of Sydney.

"In some cases people can't get vaccinated, and for these people our strategy can provide another source of protection from current or emerging viral threats,"

"We now have a realistic strategy to future-proof against the next pandemic."

Successful root canal treatment could reduce inflammation linked to heart disease and improve levels of blood sugar and cholesterol.

In the first of its kind research, a clinical study by King's College London tracked changes in blood chemistry following root canal treatment for a common dental infection (apical periodontitis). The infection can cause bacteria to enter the bloodstream and increase inflammation, associated with risks to cardiac health and reduced ability to control blood sugar levels.

Despite the link between the infection and wider health impacts, the association between successful root canal treatment and the benefits to heart and metabolic health had not been investigated until now.

The team discovered that successful root canal treatment was associated with:

Root canal infections can cause bacteria to enter the blood, leading to inflammation, heart disease and diabetes risk. Successful treatment reduces these risks.

The study followed the health of 65 patients from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust over two years after root canal treatment. Scientists analysed molecules in the blood of patients to reveal how the body processes sugar, fat, other key substances, and responds to disease and treatment. They used a technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, used to analyse proteins in the body.

The findings suggest that monitoring blood metabolic markers, such as glucose, fats known as triglycerides, and the protein tryptophan, could help assess recovery and risk after dental treatment.

Our findings show that root canal treatment doesn't just improve oral health – it may also help reduce the risk of serious health conditions like diabetes and heart disease. It's a powerful reminder that oral health is deeply connected to overall health.

Long-standing root canal infections can allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream, trigger inflammation, and increase blood glucose and fats levels – raising the risk of serious health issues like heart disease and diabetes. It is vital that dental professionals recognize the wider impact of these root canal infections and advocate for early diagnosis and treatment.

We also need to move towards integrated care, where dentists and general practitioners work together to monitor the risks through these blood markers and protect overall health. It's time to move beyond the tooth and embrace a truly holistic approach to dental care."

Dr. Sadia Niazi, Lead Author, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Endodontology, King's College London

While more research is needed to confirm these effects in larger populations, the study opens exciting new doors for understanding how oral care can support general health and wellbeing.

This study is published in Journal of Translational Medicine.

The likelihood of high blood pressure is clearly higher among people who have both sleep apnea and insomnia. This is shown by a study from the University of Gothenburg.

High blood pressure is one of the most important risk factors for heart attack and stroke. Elevated blood pressure can have many underlying causes, such as obesity, stress, or kidney disease. Sleep apnea is already known as a contributing factor - but for the first time, this study shows that the combination of sleep apnea and insomnia represents the strongest risk factor for uncontrolled hypertension.

Sleep apnea involves repeated pauses in breathing during the night, leading to oxygen deficiency and disturbed sleep. Insomnia refers to long-term sleep difficulties - such as trouble falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night, or waking too early in the morning.

The study included nearly 4,000 randomly selected middle-aged adults from the general population. Participants underwent extensive health examinations, including blood pressure measurements and an overnight home sleep study. They were divided into four groups: those without sleep problems (2,616 people), those with insomnia (404), those with sleep apnea (694), and those with both problems (118). Blood pressure readings above 140/90 mmHg were considered high.

The results showed that 4.5 percent of people with insomnia alone had high blood pressure, compared with 7.9 percent of those with sleep apnea alone and 10.2 percent of those with both conditions.

Mio Kobayashi Frisk, physician at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and doctoral student at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, is lead author of the study:

"We see that it is specifically the combination of sleep apnea and insomnia that is most clearly linked to high blood pressure. This is important knowledge for identifying patients who are at the greatest risk and need closer monitoring in healthcare," says Mio Kobayashi Frisk.

Good sleep is now part of the international recommendations for protecting heart health. For patients with both sleep apnea and insomnia, treatment with a breathing mask may not always be enough - support with sleep habits or cognitive behavioral therapy can also be important to reduce the risk of high blood pressure." 

Ding Zou, researcher, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, senior author of the study

The study is part of SCAPIS, a large population study funded by the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation. The results are published in the journal Annals of the American Thoracic Society.

At the Neuroscience 2025 conference, Bruker Corporation today announced the release of the xView Module for Ultima 2Pplus multiphoton microscopes to significantly extend imaging scale and experiment flexibility for advanced neuroscience research. This patent-pending upgrade enhances the field-of-view (FOV) of Ultima systems by more than 2.5 times to enable high-resolution imaging of neural activity across larger brain areas, without compromising speed or sensitivity.



Engineered to meet the growing demands of systems neuroscience research, the xView Module empowers researchers to visualize more expansive neural circuits in tandem with optogenetic activation, using Bruker's NeuraLight 3D Ultra Module for holographic photostimulation. This unprecedented commercial pairing of a vast imaging FOV with complementary large-volume optogenetics makes it possible to study input-output relationships and manipulate widespread neuronal networks for insights toward brain-wide connectivity and function. The xView Module is particularly suited for broader imaging studies of epileptic activity across the brain and circuit mapping for understanding mechanisms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

“Over the past months I have been using xView to study the spatial and temporal properties of circuits across cortical brain regions, where the increase in FOV has been critical to achieve meaningful data,” said Associate Professor Caroline Runyan of the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Neuroscience. “I am excited to be able to combine this new capability with 3D optogenetics on our Ultima 2Pplus microscopes.”

The xView Module unlocks a new scale of imaging for neuroscience.

By expanding the FOV while maintaining optical precision, we are continuing to build upon the Ultima platform's success and research capabilities and push the limits of imaging instrumentation. We are looking forward to seeing the benefits and discoveries this helps bring to the scientific community.”

Scottish Brain Sciences (SBS), a leading clinical research organization dedicated to transforming the early detection and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, today announced that it has opened a new state-of-the-art clinical research center at ONE BioHub, Aberdeen. The new clinical research center will enable people living with Alzheimer's disease, and those concerned with memory issues, to participate in studies focused on the early detection and treatment of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative conditions.

The clinical research center at ONE BioHub becomes SBS's third research facility, complementing the Company's research hub in St Andrews and its Edinburgh headquarters. The new facility will allow SBS to conduct clinical studies focused on early diagnosis, intervention, and precision trials to advance the global understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's and related disorders.

By establishing a presence within ONE BioHub, a launchpad for start-ups and high potential life science companies looking to rapidly scale and grow, SBS joins a growing network of research-driven companies including NovaBiotics and Genomes.io already based at ONE BioHub. From ONE BioHub, SBS will play a central role in connecting brain health research with clinical and commercial pathways, strengthening Scotland's position as an international hub for brain health innovation and further contributing to the country's wider life sciences growth strategy.

The Aberdeen site was officially opened on 14th November by Aberdeen-based research participant, Lynne Carroll and was also attended by Richard Lochhead MSP, Minister for Business and Employment, who will highlight the Company's investment as a boost to Scotland's innovation economy and public health landscape.

The people of the north-east deserve early access to breakthroughs in brain health and dementia research. This new site will help ensure that people here can take part in trials, receive advanced assessments, and contribute to discoveries that could change the future of Alzheimer's disease. Inviting one of our research participants to officially open this center reflects our belief that progress begins and ends with the people who volunteer to take part. They are the beating heart of discovery."

Professor Craig Ritchie, CEO and Founder, Scottish Brain Sciences

Lynne Carroll, Scottish Brain Sciences research participant, added: "It took several years to receive my Alzheimer's diagnosis, and that is the reality for so many people. By being part of research that aims to detect and treat Alzheimer's earlier, I hope I can help make the path a little clearer for others in the future. I reached out to Scottish Brain Sciences some time ago as I was eager to contribute. When they shared plans to open a research site in Aberdeen, I was thrilled, as it means I will be able to take part in trials that may require regular visits. It is a privilege to be involved in today's opening, and I would encourage anyone locally affected by Alzheimer's to connect with the team."

Dr Deborah O'Neil OBE FRSE, Chair, ONE Life Sciences and BioAberdeen Ltd: "We are delighted that Scottish Brain Science is expanding at ONE BioHub. Their focus on advancing understanding and treatment of neurological conditions adds important strengths to our growing life sciences cluster. The north east has a vibrant community of life science innovators and it is wonderful to see our first tenant growing and scaling within ONE BioHub."

A new study led by University of Toronto researchers has shown that immune cells in the gut follow an atypical pathway to produce antibodies that provide long-term protection against viruses.

The findings, which were published today in the journal Cell, could help guide the development of better vaccines for respiratory viruses like influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and bird flu.

While COVID-19 and flu vaccines reduce the risk of severe complications of illness, they are less effective at preventing infections at the outset. To protect against infection, a vaccine must activate a strong immune response at the places where a virus typically gains entry - the nose, mouth and airways. This so-called mucosal immunity relies on an antibody called IgA, which is concentrated in the mucous membranes lining your respiratory and digestive tracts and secreted through bodily fluids like saliva and tears.

If you could make a mucosal immune response that's durable, that's the Holy Grail because then you're blocking entry of the virus. If you block entry, then you're not going to get infected and you're not going to transmit the virus." 

Jen Gommerman, study's senior author and professor and chair of immunology at U of T's Temerty Faculty of Medicine

One of the biggest challenges in developing a mucosal vaccine has been figuring out how to create a long-lasting IgA response. 

Gommerman says that previous research, including a 2020 study from her group in collaboration with Anne-Claude Gingras, have shown that even though natural infections with viruses like SARS-CoV-2 do generate a local immune response, those responses fade quickly.

"When we looked at the key IgA antibody that protects us against infection, those antibody levels really don't last," she says. 

At the same time, researchers also knew that a long-lasting, vaccine-induced IgA response was possible. 

"We know that oral vaccination against rotavirus and polio gives you lifelong immunity, so we hypothesized that maybe there was something about the oral route and the small intestine that could allow for a long-lived IgA response," says Gommerman.

To test their hypothesis, the research team, led by postdoctoral fellow Kei Haniuda, turned to a mouse model of rotavirus infection with the goal of better understanding how virus-specific IgA immune responses are generated. 

They found that while the gut IgA response depends on crosstalk between two types of immune cells, T cells and B cells, it skips a key step where parts of the virus are first presented to T cells, thereby allowing for a faster IgA antibody response. Moreover, the IgA produced in response to the virus were protective and lasted for at least 200 days after the initial infection.

"The IgA response was shockingly long lived," says Gommerman.

"Despite the virus being cleared within about 10 days, the response continued to improve over time, so you end up having IgA antibodies that are very, very good at recognizing rotavirus."

She thinks there may be something unique about the gut environment - for example, its anatomy and rich microbial community - that enables it to generate such a durable and effective immune response. These findings support the potential of oral vaccination as a strategy to protect against respiratory viruses, but Gommerman notes that there are also significant hurdles to creating an oral vaccine. 

Building on this work, she recently submitted a funding application to pursue the development of an oral vaccine against highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. 

Her lab is also exploring a complementary approach using the microbiome to make current flu and COVID-19 vaccines - which are delivered by injection - more "mucosal-friendly" and hopefully leading to a stronger IgA response.

"We learned how the immune cells get activated, how we can detect them and what signals are critical for their development," says Gommerman.

"We can now apply that knowledge to developing better vaccines."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart disease and impacts an estimated 1 in 500 people in the U.S., according to the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere. Because many cases go undetected and untreated until acute symptoms occur, the Association is scaling up its efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment of HCM.

HCM is a thickening of the lower main pumping chamber of the heart (the left ventricle). It is a chronic disease that can get worse over time and lead to poorer quality of life and long-term complications, including atrial fibrillation, stroke and heart failure. Despite its serious implications, care for HCM remains fragmented, with inconsistent standards and limited early detection.

To further address these gaps, the American Heart Association is expanding its existing initiative to improve HCM systems of care and standardize how people with HCM are identified, assessed, referred and treated. With new support from Cytokinetics, the program will grow to include:

The new, matching support from Cytokinetics builds on a national effort designed to unify and elevate consistent standards of care for HCM patients financially supported by founding sponsor Bristol Myers Squibb.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be an insidious disease, with some people having no obvious symptoms, while others may only feel symptoms with exercise or exertion. This initiative represents an essential step toward a unified approach to HCM care, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes, enhance quality of life and reduce the risks associated with the disease. Integrated commitment across the system of care is critical to success."

Anjali Owens, M.D., volunteer co-chair of the American Heart Association's HCM initiative and director of the Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine

"Our longstanding commitment to tackling cardiovascular diseases by discovering and developing innovative medical therapies compels us to support the American Heart Association on this important initiative to create a consistent standard of care for people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy," said Fady I. Malik, M.D., Ph.D., Cytokinetics' executive vice president of research and development. "Because HCM can be complex to identify and treat, we are proud to support the initiative's focus on advancing care and improving outcomes for those affected."

Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) significantly increased the number of people at risk of HIV diagnosis who were prescribed preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a preventative medication taken in pill or injectable form, according to Rutgers Health–led research.

The study, published in Health Affairs, analyzed PrEP prescription data from all 50 states and Washington, D.C., between 2012 and 2023.

Researchers found rates of PrEP prescribing increased overall and significantly increased relative to the number of new HIV diagnoses across all demographic groups, potentially because of overall increases in PrEP access and decreases in HIV diagnoses. Gains in access to PrEP, though, were greater for white populations compared to Black, Hispanic and Latino populations.

Medicaid expansion is a powerful tool for improving HIV prevention. But the disparities we observed underscore the need to intentionally address barriers that may be limiting access to PrEP for Black and Hispanic communities specifically."

Elizabeth Stone, lead author of the study and core member of the Rutgers Center for Health Services Research at the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 35,000 to 40,000 new HIV infections are reported annually in the United States and it is estimated that 36% of people who could benefit from PrEP receive the prescription. Common PrEP medication brands include Truvada and Descovy.

When broken down by race, however, disparities are evident. Ninety-four percent of white Americans who could benefit from PrEP received a prescription in 2022, while 13% of Black Americans and 24% of Hispanic and Latino Americans received prescriptions.

Medicaid, which provides health insurance for disabled and low-income populations, is jointly funded by the federal government and states. The ACA expansion gave states the option to expand coverage to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line with increased federal funding for this population. As of November, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded their Medicaid coverage through the ACA.

Rutgers researchers said that progress made in HIV prevention through Medicaid expansion is at risk of being lost because of recent policy changes. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, eliminates the increased federal funding for Medicaid expansion populations and introduces additional barriers, including work requirements and more frequent eligibility determinations for enrollees. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over the next 10 years, 7.5 million people will lose Medicaid coverage because of these changes.

In their study, researchers found the strongest increases in the ratio of PrEP prescriptions to new HIV diagnoses occurred among men, individuals ages 25 to 34, and white populations. In contrast, Black, Hispanic and Latino populations, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV diagnoses, experienced smaller gains.

"These disparities highlight the limitations of relying solely on state-by-state insurance expansion to close gaps in HIV prevention," said Stone, an instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. "We need policy interventions that address the social and systemic factors driving inequities in PrEP access."

New evidence suggests that regularly consuming flavonoid-rich foods, such as berries, citrus, cocoa, and tea, may gently improve mood by supporting brain chemistry and neuroplasticity, offering an accessible dietary strategy for everyday emotional resilience.



Study: Effects of Dietary Flavonoids on Mood and Mental Health: A Systematic Review. Image Credit: sav_an_dreas / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition Reviews, researchers at the University of Reading, UK, evaluated how dietary flavonoids from commonly consumed foods and beverages affect mood and mental health across the lifespan in physically healthy people.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, global cases of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder have risen substantially, and families notice these changes around meals, commutes, and screens. Daily food choices matter, as foods like fruits, cocoa, teas, citrus, and berries supply flavonoids that cross the blood-brain barrier and may influence neurotransmitters and neuroplasticity. Food-based strategies are accessible and familiar, making them easily integrated into daily routines at school, work, and home. However, study results are inconsistent, with varying doses and methods, so clearer evidence is needed to identify what truly helps.

This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guideline and was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Eligibility was guided by the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design framework. Experimental human trials of any age, sex, or ethnicity were included when at least one flavonoid-rich food containing at least fifteen milligrams per one hundred grams or milliliters was provided as whole food or lyophilized powder, and at least one mood or mental health outcome was assessed. Trials using flavonoid extracts, alcohol confounds such as red wine, or clinical conditions influencing physical health or hormone balance were excluded to focus on physically healthy populations.

Searches spanned PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus to October 2024. The United States Department of Agriculture and Phenol Explorer databases were used to estimate flavonoid dose when not reported. The risk of bias and methodological quality were assessed using the Quality Criteria Checklist from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Library, and data extraction was conducted according to the Library's standardized template. Mood was defined as emotional and psychological well-being, excluding social belonging and task fatigue. Parallel and crossover trials were eligible without restrictions on duration or blinding.

A total of 38 experimental datasets, involving 1,972 participants, met the criteria. Interventions included wild blueberries, mixed berries, purple grape juice, orange juice, cocoa or dark chocolate, green tea, peppermint, nuts, soy, and apples, with cocoa and wild blueberries being the most studied. Chronic trial durations ranged from five days to twelve months. Mood outcomes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Profile of Mood States, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Bond-Lader visual analogue scales, Beck Depression Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire 9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale 10.

Acute effects were mixed. Five of the thirteen studies reported benefits, particularly with anthocyanin-rich foods. Three acute wild blueberry datasets showed an increase in Positive Affect in children, young adults, and emerging adults. Purple grape juice elevated calmness, and an orange juice study indicated favorable short-term mood effects. Several cocoa-based acute trials showed no change, suggesting that dose, food matrix, or expectancy may influence the detection of the impact. Overall, acute responses appear to be possible but inconsistent across different foods and time points.

Chronic findings were more encouraging. Twelve of twenty-five studies favored flavonoid supplementation, including wild blueberry for depressive symptoms in adolescents, cherry for anxiety and alertness, cocoa for lower negative affect in select designs, as well as peppermint, orange juice, walnuts during exam stress, green tea, and multi-food patterns. Benefits were most common in anthocyanin-rich choices consumed daily over weeks. Null results were also reported, indicating that population factors, baseline diet, dose ranging from 30 to 774 milligrams of anthocyanins per day, duration of at least three to four weeks, and outcome tool selection shape the observed results.

Methodological quality varied. Eight studies were rated as positive, three were rated as negative, and the majority were neutral. Common weaknesses included insufficient reporting of withdrawals, unclear randomization, and heterogeneity in dosing and measurement timing. Biological plausibility is supported by known mechanisms. Flavonoids can cross the blood-brain barrier, act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, influencing the levels of serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline, and modulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a key driver of neuroplasticity.

Observational data, including analyses from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, link anthocyanidin intake with lower prevalence of depression. Meanwhile, intervention studies show that a diet combined with activity programs can improve well-being. These signals align with the idea that habitual food-based flavonoid intake may support mood. For daily life, this translates to making repeated choices, such as adding berries to breakfast, swapping a sugary snack for citrus, or opting for high-cocoa dark chocolate in mindful portions. These strategies may be particularly helpful during exam stress or acute mental stress, when timing and cognitive load can significantly influence outcomes.

To summarize, in physically healthy populations, dietary flavonoids exhibit promising yet heterogeneous benefits for mood, with stronger evidence from chronic interventions rich in anthocyanins. Effects are modest and context-dependent, but align with plausible neurobiological pathways, including monoamine oxidase inhibition and brain-derived neurotrophic factor support. Food-based strategies are accessible and fit budgets and habits, potentially easing stress and low mood over weeks. More straightforward dosing guidelines, standardized outcomes, and more diverse samples are needed to guide practice and policy.

Thirty-six years ago, Wednesday, on  Nov. 19, 1989, the U.S. men's national team, qualified for its first World Cup in 40 years by defeating host Trinidad & Tobago in the final qualifier for Italia 90. FrontRowSoccer.com editor Michael Lewis covered the game and sets the scene with this story.

By Michael Lewis

BigAppleSoccer.com Editor

A funny thing happened to the U.S. in what they thought was going to be a 1-0 victory over Trinidad & Tobago on May 7, 1989. They gave up the tying goal in the waning minutes, a goal that almost came back to haunt them. Instead of walking away with two points, the Americans had to split them with their rivals from the Caribbean.

The U.S. was clinging to a 1-0 lead behind a goal by defender Steve Trittischuh with two minutes left. U.S. forward Peter Vermes cleared the ball into the Trinidad half of the field. Trinidad's Brian Williams took control and knocked a long pass toward Hudson Charles, who ran into opened space, drawing defender Trittschuh with him.

Two players raced for the ball – U.S. captain Mike Windischmann with an outstretched foot and Trinidad forward Marlon Morris, who got there first to gently head it to Charles, who had only goalkeeper Dvid Vanole to beat. No last-minute heroics this time.

“We kind of had a letdown,” Trittschuh said. “I don't know why. We weren't tired, but I could feel us letting down.”

It was still early and the U.S. got an opportunity to redeem itself against Guatemala in New Britain, Conn. on June 17 – a 2-1 victory behind goals by Eric Eichmann and Bruce Murray.

“You could say it was huge,” said Vanole, explaining the importance of the match. “I think even if we had tied this game, it would have been disappointing.”

The victory left the U.S. with a 2-1-1 record and in second place in the tournament. Costa Rica (3-2-1, seven) led with Guatemala (1-2, two), Trinidad & Tobago (0-2-1, one) and El Salvador (0-0-0, 0) trailing.

Next up was El Salvador on July 9 (“It's going to be like hell going down to El Salvador in July,” U.S. forward Bruce Murray said) – or so everyone thought.

The Americans' July 25 match in El Salvador was postponed until Sept. 17, to be played at a neutral site in Tegucigalpa, Honduras because of unruly fans stopped El Salvador's qualifier on June 25 with Costa Rica. The Ticos enjoyed a 4-2 advantage with six minutes remaining. Fans from the capacity crowd of 50,000 threw fruits, bottles and pennants onto the field to protest their team's poor performance.

Due to the postponement, head coach Bob Gansler was able to experiment with the lineup and decided to use 20-year-old Tony Meola, a University of Virginia sophomore in goal. Meola had acquitted himself well in the Marlboro Cup, an exhibition tournament, against the Peru national team and Benfica (Portugal). Meola, who eventually captured the Hermann Trophy as college soccer's top player in 1989, split his time between the national team and Virginia, helping the Cavaliers to a share of the NCAA Division I championship with Santa Clara in December.

Meola, an excellent ballhandler for a goalkeeper, could not, however, give the U.S. a needed lift offensively. The Americans did managed to get by El Salvador, 1-0, on a free kick by Perez.

The U.S. could not have planned the worst time for a scoring drought, playing host Guatemala on Oct. 8 and El Salvador at the St. Louis Soccer Park on Nov. 5 to back-to-back scoreless draws.

On Oct. 8, the U.S. outplayed Guatemala and had several serious scoring opportunities, but had trouble putting them away.

“Our Achilles Heel showed again,” Gansler said. “We had difficulty putting it in.”

The U.S. (3-1-2, eight) remained in third place behind Costa Rica (5-2-1, 11), which clinched a berth with the result, and Trinidad & Tobago 3-1-3, nine).

“It feels like a loss,” said Murray, who had two of the best scoring chances for the U.S. during a five-second span in the first half, but goalkeeper Ricardo Piccinini made a pair of bang-bang saves on point-blank shots. “I'm just disappointed. We came down to get two points and we didn't get them. We're going to need them for the stretch run.”

Meola agreed. “I'm as depressed as if we lost,” he said. “The most depressing thing about it was we have an incentive for Italia '90, they didn't.”

For a team eliminated in September and rebuilt within the past couple of weeks, Guatemala (1-4-1, three) acquitted itself quite well. There wasn't much local interest in this match, as one newspaper headlined the game “Futbol de la consolacion” — consolation soccer.

Although ticket prices were as low as 80 cents, $2 and $3.20, a crowd of only 4,723 turned up at the 45,000 seat Estadio Nacional Mateo Flores that featured a field better suited for growing rice than playing soccer because of torrential rain the past several weeks.

It was more of the same against El Salvador at the St. Louis Soccer Park on Nov. 5. El Salvador, which had been eliminated, brought in what was an experimental team, played the Americans to a scoreless tie.

So, that set up THE GAME — the deciding match in Port of Spain, Trinidad on Nov. 19.

You may have thought Qatar and Russia were tournament lows. You didn't account for the US president and his Fifa soulmate, Gianni Infantino

“It's very clear,” claimed haunted Fifa cue-ball Gianni Infantino not so long ago, “that politics should stay out of football and football should stay out of politics.” But is it clear? Is it really? On Monday, the worst man in world sport was – yet again – to be found in the Oval Office, this time nodding along to Trump's declaration that games could be moved from host cities for next summer's World Cup if the US president deems there's “a problem” with security or that the cities are non-compliant in some other way. In practice, that seems to mean if they're run by a Democrat/“communist”. Amazing that the Fifa president will gladly allow his tournaments to be held in any old violent autocracy but, for the purposes of the White House cameras at least, might need to draw the line at Boston.

Honestly, the very sight of Infantino these days causes decades of writing about Fifa to flash before my eyes. How could it have happened? How could we have ended up with an even bigger horror in charge of world football's governing body than the various ones who went before? When Sepp Blatter was thrown from a moving gravy train in 2015 amid an explosive corruption scandal, it would have felt like a genuine feat of sporting excellence to have beaten his record for craven awfulness.

And yet here we all are. This year, the Fifa president has been the Forrest Gump of Trump's administration. Back in May, he attended the US president's Middle East peace summit, causing him to be so late for Fifa's own congress that even Uefa accused him of prioritising “private political interests” and staged a delegate walk-out. Last month, Gianni was back on the political trail at Trump's Gaza peace talks in Egypt, and earlier this month instituted some preposterous Fifa peace prize that he's going to inaugurate at the final draw for the 2026 World Cup in Washington next month, quite possibly so that the orange organ grinder can be the first winner of it. He spent yesterday grinning along while Trump announced things such as the possible ordering of “strikes” on one of the US's 2026 World Cup co-host nations, Mexico. Perhaps the writing was on the wall when Gianni kicked off the year of ceaselessly grim politicking by attending Trump's inauguration, where he was filmed giggling appreciatively during the bit where the US president announced he'd be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.

Back then, in January, Infantino looked like a competition winner. Now he resembles a fully operational member of Trump's troupe of winged monkeys. It used to be host governments that got co-opted into Fifa's supra-national edicts – I remember South Africa being forced to set up highly dubious “Fifa World Cup Courts” for errant fans during the 2010 tournament. But now Fifa is a wholly owned tool of whoever will have it. Like all parasites, it relies on its host organisms.

As far as I can tell, a political leader removing a game from a host city has never happened in the entire 95-year history of the World Cup tournament, which should perhaps confirm the increasing global impression that the US might just be a uniquely backward country. Football fans considering buying expensive tickets and making even more expensive travel arrangements should consider that they are journeying somewhere so apparently volatile that even its own president talks its safety down. Hopefully here in the UK there will be official Foreign Office advice warning of the logistical and political dangers of watching a remorselessly poor match between two of the 48 countries that Infantino has triumphantly ruined the group stages with. Or, indeed, watching no match at all, because Seattle's mayor has been deemed less politically acceptable than anyone connected to the leadership of the last two host countries, Qatar and Russia. Which, by way of a reminder, were not actually even democracies.

Or as Trump's White House World Cup taskforce head, nepo gimp Andrew Giuliani, put it on Monday, the next World Cup could only have happened because of Trump's “vision”, and is going to be “one of the greatest cultural events in world history”. Infantino went with different superlatives, promising that it would be “the greatest and most inclusive World Cup ever”. Mm-hm. In the hands of marketing men, of which Mr Infantino is most certainly one, there are few more telltale red flags than use of the word “inclusive”. If you ever hear the word inclusive in what amounts to an advert, you can be sure someone's about to get done over or excluded – and in this case, would you believe, it's the fans. Not only has the Fifa overlord allowed World Cup game tickets to be subject to the loathed dynamic pricing, but those games might be shifted hundreds or even thousands of miles away due to politics.

No doubt Infantino is patting himself on the back for all this. But his true achievement – so far – is presiding over an era in which “sportswashing” stopped being some niche critical term of art, and became something that all football fans know the minute they see it. Because they see it all the time. As for that peace prize, please don't limit yourself to thinking it will be annual. The last time Gianni invented a prize – Fifa's The Best Awards – he held them twice inside nine months. So there is every chance Trump could win it again before next summer's World Cup kicks off. It's all thanks to the least political man in world sport – or certainly, the least sporting man in world politics.

England have been eliminated from the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in spectacular fashion, losing 4-0 against Austria in the round of 16. Alejandro Gomes Rodriguez's red card shortly after the Young Lions fell behind early in the second half proved to be a crucial moment, with Austria eventually going on to run up the score-line in the latter stages of the knockout tie.

At the Aspire Zone in Qatar, where the world's best teenage players have been performing for the past couple of weeks, England proved no match for an Austria side enjoying what is already their country's best ever performance at this age-restricted tournament.

Austria took the lead two minutes into the second half when Hasan Deshiksu managed to dribble his way into the penalty area and squeezed a shot between Jack Porter and the near post, something the Arsenal goalkeeper will no doubt be disappointed with. Then came Rodriguez's red card, which handed Austria an advantage they made sure to fully take.

Johannes Moser doubled the lead from the penalty spot after 70 minutes, before adding an Austrian third less than 10 minutes later. As England collapsed, the fourth goal came from defender Ifeanyi Ndukwe in the closing stages, tapping in on the line after Porter had saved an initial attempt.

Based at Red Bull Salzburg feeder club FC Liefering, Johannes Moser scored twice to help fire Austria in the quarter-finals, where they will face Japan. The 17-year-old midfielder was playing regularly at frst-team level in Austria's second tier prior to this tournament and his 2025 is only getting better.

Lyon's Alejandro Gomes Rodriguez was guilty of missing a hatful of chances in England's shock opening group stage defeat to Venezuela, ironically the country he switched allegiance from to play for the Young Lions, and was again at the centre of things for the wrong reasons here.

His dismissal, the result of a late challenge on Austrian goalkeeper Daniel Posch, wasn't the only reason England are out of the tournament. But it certainly didn't help, coming at a poor time right after falling behind with almost half the game still left to play. From that moment, England were up against it and the momentum was firmly with Austria for the rest of the tie.

Former Premier League referee Mike Dean has admitted that he found it strange how Queens Park Rangers played the final moments of their historic game against Manchester City in May 2012, adding fuel to a longstanding conspiracy theory peddled by Wayne Rooney that Manchester United were done out of the title. Sergio Aguero's last-ditch winner famously secured the title for City instead.

Rooney has always openly questioned whether QPR allowed City to win the game in question at the Etihad Stadium a little too easily. Roberto Mancini's team, who had hauled Manchester United back in during a rollercoaster title race up to that point, needed three points in their final match of the season to be sure of a first English league championship in 44 years. But QPR, who were fighting relegation, led 2-1 going into the final stages.

It meant that because United won their own fixture away at Sunderland, they finished their season as champions. But City were still playing and had enough time to turn things around, through Edin Dzeko and then Aguero. What has always rankled with Rooney is that QPR survived relegation, even in defeat, because of Bolton's 1-1 draw with Stoke. He has implied that they may have already before the end of the game they were safe, although that has always been unclear.

"Paddy Kenny should have done better for a couple of the goals," Rooney said in 2022. "City get the second goal and QPR kick it straight back to them and that's never been questioned – I find that strange. Djibril Cisse celebrating after the game with the City players, but yeah listen it's a historic moment in the Premier League so I'm sure that, if you are not involved as a Manchester United player, that's probably one of the greatest moments in the league."

Speaking onThe Overlap Fan Debate, Mike Dean gave his opinion on what happened that day. He was the referee for the game and considered it odd the way QPR surrendered possession so easily after City had got back level at 2-2 through Dzeko's equaliser.

"[City] make it 2-2, and [QPR] just kick it back and give it to them. And we [the match officials] were like, 'What's going on, why are they giving the ball back straightaway?' I said [that] in the ear piece. To kick off and give the ball straight back to them. Neil Swarbrick, the fourth official, said, 'Keep switched on, something is going to happen.'

"You just knew something was going to happen. You could just tell. What was strange about it, once QPR found out they were safe, Jamie Mackie was on the pitch celebrating while the game was still going on."

Rooney was also appearing on the show and cheekily added: "They had loads of ex-City players in there as well," referencing Shaun Wright-Phillips, Nedum Onuoha and Joey Barton in the QPR side – Barton had earlier been sent off for violent conduct.

QPR and former Liverpool striker Djibril Cisse was seen celebrating with City players afterwards, but recently denied that had anything to do with wanting the club to win the title over United. He told FourFourTwothis year that it was only because close friend Samir Nasri was in the City team, combined with QPR's own survival.

"I was celebrating with Samir Nasri," he said. "I didn't celebrate with Mario Balotelli, Sergio Aguero or anybody else. I celebrated with my brother, Samir, who had been a friend of mine for 15 years.

"Manchester United lost the Premier League title because they dropped points throughout the season. It was nothing to do with me or QPR. What Rooney said isn't cool. He took out his frustrations on me. It's not my fault. If we had wanted Man City to win the league, would it not have been a little risky to have waited until the very last minute to let them score? We could have let them win 4–0 or 5–0 and gone home. But we played a strong team, the manager wanted to win that game. It wasn't our reserve team."

Theoretically, United could still be retrospectively awarded the 2011-12 Premier League title. The season falls within the period of time for which City face at least 115 charges for alleged financial rule breaches between 2009 and 2018.

A verdict is still to be given on the case that has dragged on for years, with the long-awaited hearing concluding almost 12 months ago without any further updates. Nobody really knows what sanctions and punishments could be applied if City, who fiercely deny wrongdoing, are deemed guilty. But nothing, including titles being stripped, is off the table at this stage.

Our soccer expert offers his Spain vs Turkey predictions, ahead of Tuesday's World Cup Qualifiers clash, at 2:45pm ET (11/18).

Our betting expert expects a decisive home victory, with Mikel Oyarzabal finding the net as Spain seal their place at the 2026 World Cup.

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.

On Sunday, England became the first team to complete World Cup qualifying in Europe without conceding a goal or losing a point. Spain can achieve the same record if they win this match without letting the opponent score.

Despite dealing with several injuries, they've been unstoppable in this campaign. Their 4-0 rout of Georgia at the weekend was their latest dominant display. Excluding a penalty shootout defeat to Portugal in the Nations League, they're now unbeaten in 30 competitive games.

Midfield depth has been crucial for their success. Even with the likes of Pedri and Rodri sidelined, other quality players have stepped up. They dominated the reverse fixture against Turkey, allowing only 0.5 xG. That suggests they should be able to keep it tight again with home advantage.

Mikel Oyarzabal has been having a fantastic 2025 season on the international stage. He has replaced Alvaro Morata as the main striker in this Spanish side.

The Real Sociedad forward has scored five goals in five matches in this group, equating to a strike rate of one every 77 minutes. The 28-year-old has also taken on the role of penalty taker, and he scored from the penalty spot against Georgia on Saturday.

Oyarzabal has been in good form for his struggling club too, having scored five times in 12 appearances in La Liga. He has an average of 3.1 shots per game across all matches for club and country this term. On current form, he is at value as an anytime goalscorer bet in this match.

Spain have frequently controlled matches before the break during this World Cup qualifying campaign. That was the case again at the weekend, when they raced into a 3-0 lead in 35 minutes against Georgia.

However, they have frequently eased off in the second half. They only scored once after the break at the weekend. Three of their five qualifiers have produced one or fewer second-half goals.

Turkey are a much better side than they showed in the reverse fixture. They also won't have to deal with the injured trio of Pedri, Nico Williams, and Lamine Yamal in this match. That suggests a slightly tighter game.

Spain also have no incentive to chase a dominant win and improve their goal difference on Tuesday. Another relatively low-scoring second half seems likely.

These have been the two outstanding teams in Group E of World Cup qualifying in Europe. Spain have won all of their five matches, including a stunning 6-0 victory against Turkey in the reverse fixture.

However, Luis de la Fuente's team have not yet statistically secured qualification. That should only be a formality on Tuesday, as Turkey need to win by seven goals to win the group.

Vincenzo Montella's side won both matches against Georgia and Bulgaria. They beat the latter 2-0 on Saturday, while Spain dominated Georgia 4-0 in Tbilisi on the same day.

Spain expected lineup: Simon, Cucurella, Laporte, Vivian, Llorente, Ruiz, Zubimendi, Merino, Baena, Oyarzabal, Ferran

Turkey expected lineup: Cakir, Celik, Demiral, Bardakci, Kadioglu, Calhanoglu, Kokcu, Aydin, Guler, Yildiz, Akturkoglu

Arsenal have an "AI dossier" which is reportedly powering Mikel Arteta's Premier League title pursuit, with the manager being assisted with input on transfers, tactics and even injuries. This quiet revolution is an attempt to build the most technologically advanced operation in English football. They have computer models humming with millions of data points to predict problems before they happen.

According to the Daily Mail,the Gunners have rapidly expanded their data science department, investing heavily in artificial intelligence infrastructure. Competing with Europe's elite clubs is no mean task, and Arsenal's leadership have made it clear that they believe staying competitive requires not just talent on the pitch, but intelligence behind the scenes. A well-timed rotation could stop a key player from breaking down. One scouting insight could produce a bargain where others see no value. Arteta has already hinted, albeit cautiously, that the club's adoption of AI is already underway.

"It's in use already for many things and many processes that can help not just a team but an organisation as well," he said. "It will improve and it will give us good insight, or things at least to think about. I'm not an expert but it's a valuable tool. We have developed certain things that in our opinion can help us to understand ourselves better and evaluate what we do and what we can improve."

The biggest breakthroughs at the club's London Colney base come through their tailor-made performance models, which are AI-driven programs designed internally by Arsenal's data scientists. Every day, enormous volumes of information are collected, including GPS sprint maps, recovery times, energy outputs, bio-mechanical readings, match actions, and even micro-movements during training drills. Unlike traditional analysis, which often relies on video clips and subjective assessments, these systems digest tens of thousands of data points from each session. The models then learn patterns about fatigue signals, mechanical inefficiencies, and subtle warning signs with a level of granularity no human eye could catch. The shift is profound as Arsenal are now preparing for what is about to happen, and not reacting to what has just happened.

One major branch of Arsenal's AI system is individual profiling. Every player, right from academy prospects to first-team starters, has a dynamic profile that logs sprint mechanics, joint stress patterns, muscle fatigue responses and changes under load. This gives Arsenal the ability to personalise training. No two players respond to stress in the same way, and machine learning allows coaches to tailor workloads to match bodies rather than the other way around. These profiles also highlight areas for improvement. Weaknesses can be addressed before they impact performance, which will allow players to train smarter, not harder. 

The most critical area of Arsenal's AI application is injury prevention. William Saliba's back problem derailed Arsenal's 2022-23 title charge, while last season Kai Havertz's hamstring injury forced Mikel Merino into an improvised striker role. The models identify clues such as tiny drops in acceleration, altered stride patterns, and minor imbalances that can signal impending muscle injuries. Before a congested fixture, run the system flags players with elevated fatigue risk, which helps Arteta to make an informed decision.

Arsenal's analytics tools also parse opposition patterns frame by frame. Machine learning evaluates how full-backs behave under pressure, how midfield shapes morph in transitions, and where passing lanes appear during pressing triggers. This gives Arteta's staff the opportunity to build game plans not on hunches, but on probability maps.

AI is also reshaping Arsenal's transfer strategy. Beyond traditional metrics like goals or tackles, Arsenal's models study adaptability across roles, physical intensity benchmarks, tactical compatibility with Arteta's system, and log behavioural data from hundreds of match scenarios. Every role now has a detailed blueprint, such as what the physical output should look like, how quickly a player must transition, how he presses, and how he receives the ball under pressure. This tech-driven approach allows Arsenal to find undervalued players who might not shine in traditional stats but are ideal fits for Arteta's structure. Arsenal's technological leap is bold, advanced and path-breaking. However, whether it can end their 22-year wait for a Premier League title remains to be seen.

The final day of qualifications for the 2026 World Cup is a true whirlwind of tension and mathematical calculations, with qualification hanging by a thread in many groups across Europe and CONCACAF. The complex combinations of results and goal differences promise an unforgettable outcome for this group stage.

In Europe, all eyes are on the direct confrontations that will determine the group leaders. The matches between Scotland-Denmark and Austria-Bosnia-Herzegovina are decisive.

Scotland absolutely must beat Denmark to qualify directly, while a draw would suffice for the Danes to qualify. Similarly, Bosnia-Herzegovina must win in Vienna against Austria, who would qualify for the World Cup with a draw. These encounters are the epitome of "all or nothing".

On the other hand, nations like Spain (against Turkey) and Switzerland (against Kosovo) have almost secured their place in the next round. These two countries must avoid a defeat by six goals or more, a scenario their opponents find unlikely.

The group of Belgium is the most complex in terms of calculations. The Belgians, who face Liechtenstein, only need a victory to qualify. However, the chances of North Macedonia and Wales are mathematically slim and rely on spectacular victories (by 7 and 11 goals respectively) combined with a Belgian misstep. The risk is low, but it forces the Belgians to stay focused.

The CONCACAF zone is not lacking in excitement, with three direct qualifying spots and playoff spots still up for grabs.

The duel between Suriname and Panama is the most complex, as both teams can qualify for the World Cup. Suriname must win and Panama must lose, or if both teams win, they must have a better goal difference. Panama has the advantage: it qualifies if it wins and Suriname does not, or if it wins with a four-goal difference more than its Caribbean rival.

The second direct qualifying spot will be contested between Jamaica and Curaçao. The calculation is simpler: Jamaica must win to qualify, while Curaçao can settle for a draw.

Finally, the fate of the Honduras-Haiti-Costa Rica group will be decided in the final minutes. Honduras must win and Haiti must lose. Haiti is in a similar situation: if both teams win, it must win by at least two goals more than Honduras. Costa Rica's hopes rest on a victory and a defeat for Haiti. The final standings will determine the winner of one of the most open qualifying rounds.

Attention is also focused on the Middle East, where the final phase of Asian qualifications is taking place. Iraq hosts the United Arab Emirates in Basra for the second leg of the continental playoffs. After a 1-1 draw in the first leg, everything is still possible. If the match ends in a draw after 90 minutes, extra time and a penalty shootout will decide the teams, and the winner will qualify for the intercontinental playoffs in March.

The U.S. men's national team don't play a competitive fixture until their World Cup opener next June, but for Mauricio Pochettino, any meeting with Marcelo Bielsa, his “hero” who is in charge of Uruguay, carries far more weight than another meaningless friendly.

Midnight had long since passed when there was a knock on the door of Pochettino's family home one night in 1987. The then-teenager's parents answered to find a complete stranger claiming to be a scout for Newell's Old Boys, a team in Argentina's top flight based in Rosario, more than 90 miles away. It was Bielsa.

The unashamedly obsessive coach was at the start of his own winding career and took on the job of searching for the country's best talents with a typically feverish appetite. Bielsa and his assistant divided Argentina up into 70 territories and set about visiting each one in his Fiat. By the time he had made it to Pochettino's hometown of Murphy, driving past the city limits sign which describes itself as “Ambassadors of Good Soccer,” it was 2 a.m.

Pochettino's parents welcomed Bielsa in on the condition that he not wake up a sleeping Mauricio. That was alright, all he needed to see was his legs. “They came up to my room,” Pochettino recalled years later, “lifted up the duvet and Marcelo said, ‘He has the makings of a footballer.'” And so began a relationship which is stretching towards its fourth decade.

Bielsa would oversee Pochettino's blossoming into a talented center back at Newell's. It was Bielsa who then handed Pochettino his first senior call-up for Argentina. After hanging up his boots, the former Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea boss would model his entire managerial philosophy on the transformative pressing style that Bielsa has implemented throughout an itinerant coaching career, which has now led him to Uruguay's national team.

As the USMNT host the South American outfit in Florida on Tuesday evening, what would otherwise be written off as little more than a delay until the real show gets going at the World Cup this summer, this friendly serves another chapter in a heartening tale of mutual affection.

When he wasn't hailing his team for playing their part in a bench-emptying brawl against Paraguay, Pochettino spent much of his pre-Uruguay press conference lauding Bielsa. “Always, my admiration and my respect is massive,” he gushed. “I cannot consider him like a friend. I cannot consider him like another normal person. It's bigger respect.”

During his reverential discussions with Bielsa, Pochettino adopts the same rules which apply to speaking with royalty.

“I speak with him like a man that you admire, is your hero,” he said. “He's this type of person that you wait [to] talk. You always wait for him to say hello and then you say hello.”

“Yes, [Tuesday] for me is a thing to enjoy, to be with him very close,” Pochettino continued. “And in the same time, we are going to suffer because all the team under Marcelo's management are so tough to play.”

Uruguay are one of the outside favorites for next summer's World Cup, adopting a full-throttle style which has earned notable victories over Brazil and Argentina during the qualification process. Results have rarely been a factor for Pochettino in this experimental period of the USMNT's World Cup buildup, but the occasion of sharing the touchline with his soccer idol once again will be something to savor regardless of the outcome.

Trinity Rodman explains how she's leading by example for the USWNT after a 2-0 win over Brazil. (0:56)

The NWSL has been one of the leaders in the women's sports boom, but as great as the commercial gains have been, there are more challenges than ever facing the league in a rapidly evolving global market. How well positioned is the NWSL to handle the competition? And what are the biggest problems facing the league in the near future?

ESPN sought answers from general managers (or the equivalent highest-ranking soccer executives on each team) across the league in our second annual anonymous GM survey. These highest-ranking technical staff members from 15 of the 16 teams in the league (one had scheduling conflicts) participated in one-on-one surveys either over video calls or in person.

GMs were granted anonymity in order to speak freely about sensitive topics ranging from rule-breaking and their concerns with the salary cap, to grading league leadership and discussing the league's relationship with the U.S. Soccer Federation. While there was widespread agreement on some topics, their reasons for optimism and worry are wide-ranging.

The NWSL imposes a hard salary cap on each of its teams, in stark contrast with top European leagues such as those in England, France and Spain. NWSL GMs are loud and clear here: The salary cap, even with built-in risers over the coming years, is a problem for the league.

This year, GMs were so emphatic about the cap issue that 10 of the 15 GMs interviewed named the salary cap as the rule they would change, and a combined 10 of 15 named talent retention and global competition -- all relating back to the cap -- as the biggest challenges the league is facing. Two even said it needs to be abolished entirely.

Competition from abroad, the GMs surveyed said, is currently only from a handful of teams, led by Chelsea and OL Lyonnes. One GM summarized that group as the perennial UEFA Champions League quarterfinalists. But the recent losses of USWNT stalwarts Naomi Girma and Alyssa Thompson to Chelsea furthered their concerns. "I'm worried that more dominoes will fall," one general manager said.

The next domino might be falling sooner than expected, too, as Trinity Rodman's contract expires next month with the Washington Spirit, and interest from European clubs is at an all-time high. Rodman told ESPN's Futbol W earlier this year that she "always thought about playing overseas at some point in my career," and "it's just a matter of when." Yet negotiations with the Spirit have stalled because of cap restraints.

"Right now, top talent is going only one way," another GM said. "We're not seeing that the other way around. We're not seeing players that are in top clubs in their prime coming this way. Yes, for now, it's only a handful of players that have left, but if that becomes a trend, then that will be an issue."

League leaders have long defended the salary cap as the reason for the league's success, but one GM pushed back: "Why is parity the best? If you look at other American sports, sure, you see that. If you look at the global game of football, that is not what you see. If you want to be the best league in the world, anybody who knows soccer would say that's the English Premier League in the men's game -- there's no parity."

One GM who expressed concern that the salary cap could hold the league back also worried that abolishing it would create "a bubble that could be dangerous for all of us." This GM did note that the NWSL must compete better "against that handful of teams in Europe that right now could pretty much pick any player they want and offer an amount that it would be crazy for us to offer."

Another GM said, "we risk the game imploding" if spending grows too quickly, noting that European teams' "cost versus revenue is way out of balance." Two GMs defended the salary cap and said the NWSL would become one of the European leagues that NWSL execs criticize -- but "with not even an interest because there's no relegation," one said. That GM added that it would be "impossible" to reverse the decision if the salary cap were abolished. "The gap will widen far quicker in this country" between the "haves and have-nots," the other GM said.

The natural question is: How does the NWSL solve this problem, when the salary cap is written into a binding CBA? One GM said the league needs to "find a solution to paying top talent with the least amount of damage to the rest of the ecosystem," potentially a version of the designated player rule in Major League Soccer that allows teams to pay top players outside of the cap.

"I'm not in favor of abolishing it," another GM said, adding that instead, there should be regular reevaluation of the cap every 18-24 months. "It shouldn't be knee-jerk reactions -- every time a player leaves we say we have to look at the cap."

For much of the league's history NWSL teams could -- and, in plenty of cases, did -- trade players within the league without consent. The NWSL's new CBA ratified last year changed that: It brought full free agency to the league and required all trades to be approved by the players involved.

"I actually think it's better. It's healthier for everybody," one GM said. Several GMs also pointed out that it brings the NWSL in line with the global norm where players approve transfers. "I think any human should have a voice on where they're going to play and live," another GM said.

"It's the way it should have been a long time ago," added another. The flip side is, a different GM said, is that  "We also get forced as GMs to move players who are under contract on our team. That, I think, is more prevalent now." That same GM noted that if a player wants out, the club is frequently in a bind. "That has been a factor on multiple occasions in multiple deals," they said.

Clubs are further hamstrung in those situations, a different GM said, because "We've lost a lot of trade capital. No draft picks available, allocation money phasing out -- when you have fewer things to trade, all of that impacts the ability to make these deals." The result is more traditional transfers for cash within the league.

Another GM said teams now must better educate players on why they won't make a transfer. "We want to honor that as much as possible if a player doesn't want to be in that environment anymore -- for whatever reason. But there have been situations where it's almost the players are confused about not just allowing them to leave when it doesn't make sense from the club's perspective."

Four GMs said that teams are not breaking rules -- up from just one saying it last year. The majority still said that the practice continues. As one GM put it: "Would I bet my annual salary that no one is breaking the rules? Not at all."

One pointed out an issue we heard last year about how much confusion there is about what the rules actually prohibit: "I think rules are changing quickly, and I think not everybody knows what the rules are -- and that goes for the clubs and the league."

Another GM said rule-breaking can be relatively minor: "The league has a couple rules where you say, why does it matter? They still have a lot of those types of rules where they say you need to disclose that [small amount of money] and it goes on the salary cap. Those are the types of rules where we know factually people are breaking the rules and it doesn't sound right, but I'm not going to turn a club in because they are buying dinner for people."

Others, however, claim more egregious rule-breaking is happening. One GM added "there's a lot of questions around how some teams are bringing in the players that they have or are bringing in."

"I speak to agents trying to sign players. I can't sign them because clubs are willing to break the rules and I'm not," a different GM said.

Still some GMs noted better compliance, with one adding: "The league's interventions have been helpful. Before, I was very convinced that people were actively cheating. I feel like that has decreased significantly or potentially kind of gone away for the most part. I can't say 100%."

Jessica Berman became NWSL commissioner in early 2022, taking over in the wake of the league's abuse scandal. Under Berman's leadership, valuations of NWSL clubs have gone up from $35m to over $250m, and the league signed a $240 million media rights deal (which includes ESPN). The league also ratified a new, long-term CBA last year ahead of schedule.

The league's upward trajectory commercially is undeniable, and many of the sweeping reforms that followed the league's abuse scandal were implemented during Berman's tenure.

"I think that she's navigated a very challenging time in the league's history for a variety of reasons," one GM said. "Emerging league, the behavior of some leaders in the league years ago. I think that as well as a CBA plus a modification of the CBA, all of that has positioned the league in a positive way."

On the field, however, the NWSL faces increasing global competition and in the opinion of one general manager, is "really slow to react" to the rapidly changing landscape. That business vs. sporting dichotomy led to wide-ranging opinions in our survey.

"There is a tremendous amount of focus on the commercial side and less focus on the sporting side," one GM said. "If we want the commercial piece to continue to excel, we need the best product on the field."

Another GM said Berman's "intention and motivation and ambition for the league is absolutely right," but that they want to see more of "her openness and willingness to look at the league a little different from a sporting aspect." A different GM wants to see more collaborative decision-making.

One general manager acknowledged the growth of the league's front office but still wanted to see more employees hired around Berman, including on the sporting side. The NWSL's front office lost multiple executives this year, including the departure of chief sporting director Tatjana Haenni and chief marketing and commercial officer Julie Haddon.

However, the reality of the commissioner's job in any league is that the person reports to and works on behalf of the league's owners. Berman was hired -- and recently rehired, with a new contract -- by those owners, who are ultimately the bosses of the GMs. And arguably the most important part of Berman's job is aligning a historically divided boardroom rather than making unilateral decisions.

One GM complimented Berman's "unique insight and ability to coalesce a group of owners to move the league forward." Another said that Berman is simply the front-facing person for decisions made in the boardroom and this GM "tries to detach all things NWSL challenges from one person, although it's easy to fire shots at the leader."

A different GM complimented Berman's tenure, comparing the job of commissioner to that of a goalkeeper: People only talk about them when something goes wrong. "Sometimes we should look 10 years backward and see how much has been done," they said.

Berman said repeatedly throughout this year that the NWSL can, one day, be as big as the NFL, which has 32 teams. She recently softened that stance, saying that she wasn't "intending to state we're going to have 32 teams by some date."

GMs are split on this issue. Most said that they could not provide an ideal number of teams due to the uncertainty around other factors like player development pipelines. The most common answer, listed by three GMs, was 20 teams.

"Thirty-two is such an American thing," one GM said. "Find other ways to maximize revenue. It doesn't need to be 32 just because all the men's sports are. Other countries have shown that 20 teams with a 38-game season makes all the sense in the world."

A prevailing concern is that rapid expansion without a higher salary cap will lead to mediocrity -- "a lot of OK teams," as one GM said. Others cited the addition of the USL Super League and Canada's Northern Super League, and how it is getting more difficult to fill out rosters.

People on both sides of the debate brought up the need for geographically divided conferences to reduce travel. One general manager said travel in such a large country, from chartered flights to better hotels and meals, needs to improve to attract top players.

GMs were surveyed long before Atlanta was announced as the NWSL's 17th team, set to begin play in 2028, and it makes sense given that many of those polled have always been fond of the market's potential.

"It's a soccer city, and they've got everything facility-wise," one GM said. Another said, "preferably someone that has a grass field," while a colleague said, "the league needs to stress warm weather locations to be able to consider refining the competition calendar to align with the FIFA calendar."

Cincinnati, which was one of three finalists for the 2026 expansion slot that ultimately went to Denver, was the next most common answer. One GM said that "they should move Louisville to Cincinnati." A second GM also proposed relocating Louisville because of its commercial struggles as a small market.

One GM who voted for Cincinnati stressed the increasing importance of facilities. "This venue equation is huge," they said. "Look at San Diego. They were at the top in so many of these metrics a couple years ago, but being the third or fourth tenant [Snapdragon Stadium also hosts MLS side San Diego FC, college football's San Diego State Aztecs and other big events], I think that's the root of some of their challenges."

Last year, there was a prevailing feeling among GMs that player power had "gone too far," to the point that staff couldn't properly do their jobs. This year, six general managers believe that those concerns were at least partly heard by the NWSL, although some "yes" answers were couched as "slightly."

Two GMs specifically pushed back that teams need to take responsibility: "I think how that's managed internally is the most important thing," one said.

A different GM disagreed that the league office should be absolved of the issue: "No, I don't think the league properly recognizes the issue at hand. I think the league feels that if we have higher level or better staff, that that will mitigate the issue. I don't think it does.

"We're at a point right now where somebody can anonymously report something and they could say whatever they want, make whatever accusation. ... If it's accurate, it needs to be investigated and it's a safety mechanism. If it's just unfounded and aimed at ill will, there's nothing that happens to the player."

The most common complaint centers around the NWSL's semiannual player surveys, which have always existed in the league and ask players to anonymously score their satisfaction with all aspects of their clubs. Those results might impact staffing decisions within clubs when it comes to the feedback received from players about coaching and/or team personnel.

Several GMs said that the language of those surveys has been misleading in the past, but that improvements were made this year. One GM was particularly frustrated that similar language was initially used this year before further complaints led to change. Another said that the surveys are "sent at a time when if people are not being re-signed or playing a lot, it's easy to point the finger. Timing, wording could be different."

Overall, however, feelings around the topic were far more restrained this year. A different GM also made a point to say that they disagreed with last year's prevailing frustrations from GMs, noting that players had endured horrible treatment in certain environments in the past, and "there's a reason" that such measures are in place.

The ambitions of NWSL teams vary greatly, creating a wide range of investment in infrastructure, staffing and players. The Kansas City Current built the league's first primary-tenant stadium as part of a $1 billion new business district. "You step into their stadium and you feel like you are in KC," one GM said.

Another GM added that Kansas City's marketing and investment could be a blueprint for other markets: "They vomited teal everywhere and you just can't get away from it."

Gotham FC also received plaudits for its smart executives and "not allowing [money] to be a crutch" in the country's most expensive market. Forthcoming expansion side Denver was name-dropped by one GM who was impressed with their plans to build a stadium and training facility. Angel City was named by one GM purely based on being "this commercial beast."

Chicago Stars FC was the most common answer. "The ones at the bottom of the standings are there for a reason," one GM said, adding that poor facilities "bleed into a lot of things," including revenue. (Chicago is changing home venues in 2026.)

But one GM took aim at recent expansion sides Utah Royals and Bay FC, who they say wasted a clean slate and major advantages like extra cash when they joined in 2024: "When you see the amount of money they spent on transfer fees and players, and what I call an advantage from their start, a fresh start, I wouldn't have bet that they would be in those positions in the standings."

Racing Louisville FC's attendance struggles were brought up by the two GMs that chose them, with one saying "it's just a tough, tough market" to attract top players. The team averaged just over 5,000 fans per game this season, second worst in the league.

The NWSL announced earlier this year that it plans to launch a second division to improve player development. Exactly what that league will look like, which teams will participate, or even when it will launch -- Berman confirmed recently that 2026 is off the table -- remains unclear.

Almost every GM that we polled was supportive of the concept of a second division, with caveats. One GM gave an emphatic "a thousand percent" yes to the need, because "the gap's massive" now between college players and pro-ready players. However, "the devil's always in the details of what it looks like," a colleague said. Others pointed out that the league has failed to provide meaningful details, making it hard to judge.

"I question the order of priorities," said one GM who still voted "yes." Another GM is "concerned that things weren't thought through," and the NWSL needs to "focus on what our actual product is" first.

"Who pays for it is the big question," said a different GM, who suggested that an outside equity group could be a solution.

Support of the idea largely centers around the need to develop players further down teams' rosters. "If players don't play on a Saturday or Sunday for a couple weeks, where are they getting that game time?" according to another GM who said "We need more meaningful competitions" like cup games.

Another GM was supportive of the idea of getting current players more minutes, but "dead against" a second division being created just to pull players out of college. As a colleague who agreed asked, "Who's going to play in it? I couldn't name five players who would want to play in it."

Almost unanimously, those surveyed see the college game as a continued necessity for the development of professional players despite the elimination of the college draft system and the ongoing changes to NCAA athletics.

"A hundred percent," one GM said. "It's the unique thing about the United States and we shouldn't ignore that. Some of the best coaches coach in the collegiate game; some of our best players have come from the collegiate game; some of our best overall people have come from the collegiate game. It's just a big part of our culture here. To ignore it would be a catastrophe."

Another GM said there needs to be "a cohesive plan" between the NCAA and NWSL. A colleague said the elimination of the draft has led to increased spending on scouting, while a different GM said teams initially paid "a ton of money to get kids out of college" without knowing how they would play as pros.

One GM, however, felt that the elimination of the college draft would have major consequences. "The draft gave college players the opportunity to become a professional athlete. Taking that away has just restricted that. I think teams now will just go and get players from elsewhere that are probably at the level instead of taking the time [to develop]."

Several GMs clarified that they want the new first-division USL Super League to be a partner or that "it should be a partner," with many GMs citing the number of NWSL players who have been loaned to Super League teams.

"I wouldn't use the word partner," one GM said when pressed to label what sounded like that description. "It's a great development league for us to loan players to."

Their biggest issue with creating a partnership is that they have found that Super League teams are not always willing to cover the entire salary of a player the NWSL team wants to loan out, which leaves the NWSL team with a salary cap hit and doesn't help them financially.

"Managing the budgets and some of the inabilities that they have, has hindered some of the movement we could have seen," a different GM added.

Those who viewed it as a competitor cited that term more literally, since the Super League is also sanctioned as a first division. "They're positioning themselves that way," one GM said. "I don't view it that way at all. I don't think the coaches or the players feel that way."

Another GM wants to see actual competition between the leagues: "We should have some kind of cup competition with them. Everyone's on their own different page."

The NWSL and U.S. Soccer have been tethered since the league's launch in 2013. U.S. Soccer was the founding managing partner of the NWSL, and that remained the case until 2021, which makes Emma Hayes the first U.S. women's national team coach to operate entirely in an era of an independent NWSL.

In the old relationship, U.S. Soccer paid USWNT players both for their international play and for the NWSL. The federation would pull players from their clubs even outside of FIFA international windows -- including several weeks in advance of major tournaments. Those dynamics caused regular tension with NWSL teams, but the strategy paid off with the U.S. winning World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019. However, "the script has flipped," as one GM said, because NWSL teams are now paying the USWNT stars directly.

"Now, we're making real investment in players where we as clubs feel protective over our players' health, loading, all these things. If it's not completely aligned, it's a lot more stressful than in the past. ... The landscape has changed to put more pressure on the relationship."

Half the grades issued in our survey were 4 or higher, indicating general satisfaction with how Hayes and her USWNT staff worked with NWSL clubs. The USWNT's staff travels to NWSL markets throughout the year to meet with players and their club's leadership to communicate and align goals.

"They are doing a tremendous job by trying to meet with everyone," one general manager said. "I try to connect with every national team, even where we don't have players, and I can tell you that sometimes we have to be more proactive. With the USWNT, they are really taking responsibility; they are helping us. It's a win-win situation."

A different person said that Hayes has helped the NWSL by "encouraging people to know that your club play matters," referencing the high volume of first-time call-ups.

"Four and trending upwards," another GM said, noting that Hayes started right before an Olympics and won it while also trying to plan the program's future. "I think when people judge things, they always look at what's happening right this second. What they're doing is strategic."

Still, others felt there was room for improvement. Two general managers said the USWNT staff deserves high marks for intent, but they felt execution could be better, including more direct contact with Hayes.

A handful of GMs also expressed concerns about the trend of top USWNT players going to Europe, with one GM saying that "continuing to really advocate for our players' development within our league is something I'd really love to see from our USWNT coach." Hayes said recently that players make individual choices and that her role is to ask the right questions rather than steer a player in any direction.

ESPN previously reported that Hayes delivered that message to NWSL owners at a board meeting.

Three GMs pointed out that the recent retirements of Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe have left a void in stardom in the NWSL. "They were really the needle-movers," one person said. "I think there's a massive gap right now. We're in between eras. Historically, it's been those national team players that get the most attention. We say you can be soccer-famous and famous-famous. I don't know if we have any famous NWSLers right now. I think we have soccer-famous people."

USWNT forward Alyssa Thompson just left the league. Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson have also been on maternity leave.

The one candidate to become a megastar, five GMs said, is Rodman. But Rodman is out of contract with the Spirit at the end of this year, and she has publicly talked about playing in Europe one day. She could well be the next to head overseas.

A common complaint among general managers is that the league and its clubs fail at storytelling. Three GMs pointed to how much better the WNBA has been at storytelling and building a media presence. "What the WNBA has done -- I don't watch basketball and names are flooding my world," one said. "The growth of the WNBA has been exactly what we need, this coverage and storytelling of our elite athletes and elite personalities," another person added.

Having a star as the face of the league was a premise rejected by several GMs. "This is about us, not I, and while I believe that marquee players are instrumental in growth, I think we also have to be mindful of the pressure that that puts on an athlete," one GM said.

Two others also said that player-driven fandom is unsustainable. "I believe that clubs should be the face of the league, because players will always come and go," one GM said, noting that player-driven fandom might provide a short boost but not "long-term, sustainable growth."

The NWSL was founded by U.S. Soccer in late 2012 to provide USWNT players with a strong domestic league. The gamble paid off with World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019, though recent moves by Thompson and Girma to Chelsea reignited questions about USWNT players leaving the NWSL.

In contrast with the concern around the salary cap, there were a surprising number of GMs unfazed by the potential of more USWNT players leaving for Europe in the future.

"I'm not worried about it," one person said. "If they want to, go for it. I think we spend a lot of time talking about it. If someone wants to play in Europe to try it, they're gonna go play in Europe to try it. Good for them. I don't think it's great for our league, but I don't think it's something that we should spend so much time fighting against. If they can make more money, if there's a huge transfer fee paid for them that drives our game forward, it is what it is."

A different GM said they are not worried, pointing out that the migration of players to Europe is often cyclical and happens during this gap between the Olympics and World Cup. They cited examples like Lindsey Heaps, Morgan and Tobin Heath all going overseas at different points of previous eras.

But one GM is worried that "it's not going to stop" -- they felt the salary cap is part of the issue and that "we're at a crossroads" with the push and pull of Europe.

A different GM is worried because "If we want to be the best league in the world, then those players should stay." What many GMs want to see is top players from Europe joining the NWSL -- and that isn't happening frequently enough for them.

"We were talking to a top, top player from Europe who was willing to take a pay cut in this last window, and the pay cut would have had to have been so significant that she couldn't justify it," one GM said. "Players are even willing to take a little less salary [to play here], but we're talking about taking a third off their salary."

The NWSL and England's WSL each claim to be the best in the world, and every GM agreed that those two leagues are tiers above the rest. So, we asked them to order these eight leagues -- which we chose as a small sampling of global competitions -- from best to worst, and we let them interpret that as they saw fit.

A first-place vote was worth eight points, second place worth seven points, and so on. Three clear tiers emerged, with a 34-point gap between England's WSL and Germany's Frauen-Bundesliga, and a 32-point gap between France's Première Ligue and Mexico's Liga MX Femenil.

The NWSL received 11 first-place votes, and the WSL received the other four. "We have a grass is greener situation" where players in one league want to try the other but might realize it isn't any better, one GM said. Another added that the NWSL has better marketing, but England is "further ahead on the sporting side."

Added another general manager, who also voted for the WSL: "We can't just keep saying we're the best. What are we doing to make sure we continue to be?"

Spain, France and Germany were also interchangeable for many GMs, with common and familiar complaints of top-heavy leagues. One person said France and Spain are "heading in the wrong direction," while someone else said they've seen "no growth" from those leagues. "I see Lyonnes win 8-1 and they played their second team," a third GM said. "They can't be at the top. All these leagues have that."

Multiple GMs praised Mexico for its investments in growth and visibility. "In terms of marketing, if I picked which league has done the best job in the last 10 years [outside the NWSL], it's probably Mexico," one GM said.

While Japan finished last in these rankings, several GMs said that they might have the best administration of any league, and they complimented the WE League's player development. "That's why their transfer fees are going to be so high," one GM said, while another rated Japan fifth and said there is a lack of appreciation for the style of play there.

The desire for top Spanish players continued this year, although answers to this question were far more diverse than they were in 2024. Alexia Putellas, two-time Ballon d'Or and FIFA Best winner, was not named by anyone this year. Nor was OL Lyonnes forward Tabitha Chawinga. Both those players tied for first last year with four mentions apiece.

Now, "Everyone wants to see [Aitana] Bonmatí here," one GM said. "She's so smart, talented and creative," another added. "She just makes every single person around her better. So, I'd like her on my team in the league, but I'd like her in the league."

It's no surprise that reigning MVP and Golden Boot winner Temwa Chawinga (who might win both awards again) is top of mind.

"This is tough, because I want to say Chawinga, but I actually think that Chawinga changes the way her teams play, and I wouldn't want my team to do that -- but it's so enticing," said one GM, who thought out the hypothetical scenario aloud in real time. A few GMs reasoned not to take Chawinga because of that concern, but this GM came around in their own thought process. "I guess I could build the team around her, though? Yeah, I can't not say Chawinga. I want to win the games."

USWNT forward Sophia Wilson, who recently gave birth to her first child and is an impending free agent, tied Chawinga atop the list. "Soph has all of those things [of a Chawinga] and then she can take you off the dribble," one general manager said.

Another would build their team younger, saying Ally Sentnor is "a player with a lot to grow but still a very good player, and will be for many years."

And then there is the GM who also voted for Sam Coffey: "I think Sam Coffey should be in the top five in the Ballon d'Or. If Sam Coffey was Spanish, she would have been. For some reason -- Spanish player or not -- we all have our culture and we expect that from a player in that country. But she's a player that probably can even offer more than what she's offering, and she's already offering a lot."

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Countdown

 Win McNamee / Getty Images

FIFA secured a concession from the White House as President Donald Trump announced that match ticket-holders for next summer's World Cup will have access to advanced appointments for tourist visas at U.S. overseas consulates — but FIFA's respite was short-lived as Trump warned host cities including Seattle and Los Angeles may be in danger of having their games relocated due to “safety” concerns.

In an extraordinary conference alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino in the Oval Office, in which the World Cup trophy took pride of place, Trump also said he would be prepared to launch “strikes” in 2026 World Cup co-hosts Mexico due to concerns about drug trafficking.

Trump and Infantino were joined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.

The event was principally called to announce the new FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (FIFA Pass) but Trump press conferences inevitably end up in different places and this one also encompassed the Epstein files and U.S.-Venezuela relations.

One of the major concerns for FIFA's government affairs team in the lead-up to the World Cup has been troublingly long wait times for visa appointments at U.S. consulates around the world. This threatens to impact fans of nations who have already qualified for the World Cup.

As an example, the current wait time for an appointment in Bogota (Colombia) is 11 months, while Quito (Ecuador) is 9.5 months and Casablanca (Morocco) is 6.5 months.

For some of the nations competing in the tournament, including many in Europe, as well as Japan, South Korea and Australia, access should be easier as they are part of a visa waiver program — ESTA — to enter the U.S. This system means citizens of these countries can travel without obtaining a visa, so long as their trip for tourism or business does not exceed 90 days; however, those traveling from many possible contending nations for the World Cup do require visas. This includes Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay, among many other Latin American nations, as well as large swathes of the Middle East and Africa.

The State Department has previously succeeded in reducing extremely long wait times in Argentina and Brazil. The cause was helped by $50million set aside “to reduce passport backlogs and reduce visa wait times” in a bill signed into law by President Biden in March 2024.

At the World Cup in Qatar, visitors were able to expedite their entry into the gulf state by applying for a Hayya card, which was effectively a fan pass for World Cup ticket-holders that doubled up as the visa for the tournament.

The newly announced FIFA PASS for the U.S. does not equate to this. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated: “The United States is offering prioritized appointments so FIFA World Cup fans can complete their visa interviews and show they qualify.”

He warned “a ticket is not a visa and it doesn't guarantee admission to the U.S.” but said those who apply with a ticket could get an interview within “six to eight weeks”.

However, applicants will still be subject to the same level of stringent vetting, questioning and security clearances as any other individuals seeking to enter the country. The Athletic has reported previously that the U.S. government, even under President Biden, had been loathe to make any more concessions for FIFA, and officials, speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to talk publicly, had pointed out it was unrealistic to expect the U.S. to follow the lead of countries such as Qatar or Russia, because, they argued, those countries are not deemed globally to be desirable places for people to seek permanent residence.

Regardless, it marked a concession of sorts for FIFA and a possible good news story for Infantino. Yet as the news conference developed, questions were opened to the media.

Trump was asked about the new mayor-elect of Seattle, Katie Wilson, who is a democratic socialist. He was asked how closely he will be watching crime in the city.

Trump said: “If we think — and I will have to speak to Gianni about this — the Mayor of L.A. is incompetent, everyone knows it…If we didn't go in early on, not only would you have had the fires but you would have had total insurrection in Los Angeles. If we didn't go in, (the police) said we could not have done it without the federal government.

“We did a great job. If we think there is going to be a sign of any trouble, I would ask Gianni to move that to a different city. We have a lot of cities who would love to have it and would do it very safely. If we think there is a problem in Seattle, where there is a liberal, communist mayor… I watched her over the weekend, wow that is another ‘beauty' we have got there. Gianni, can I say we will move the event to some place it will be appreciated and safe?”

Infantino answered: “Safety and security is the number one security for a succesful World Cup. We can see people have trust in the United States because we have record-breaking ticket sales. Tickets are almost two million sold already. People know they will be coming here to experience a safe and secure World Cup. This of course is the responsibility of the government and obviously we will discuss, we are working together, we must ensure all fans coming from abroad can experience a celebration of coming together of the sport and with 100 percent safety.”

Trump was then asked if he had a timeline for relocations in mind given tickets are already on sale and host cities are selling sponsorship packages and any moves will impact local businesses.

“The governors and mayors are going to have to behave,” he replied. “In California, you have a problem. You have high crime and a place that just suffered great fires…so here is the story, I love Los Angeles. If they want help during this, I would love to send in the National Guard or whoever is necessary. I want it to be great. I love Los Angeles. I love the place.

“If we think there is going to be crime, if we are obstructed by the Governor (Gavin Newsom) — maybe he won't obstruct us — I would love for him to call and say we would like help. If there is even a hint of a problem, we want to get in there before a problem occurs. We want it totally safe for Gianni and FIFA. I would be honored to help California. We can be there in 24 hours and do a great job.”

Asked for the message he would send to local businesses, Trump said: “Tell your governor to ask for federal help. We would love to help them.”

Trump was then asked if he would launch strikes or place troops in Mexico.

He said: “Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? Okay with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs. Mexico is — look, I looked at Mexico City over the weekend, there's some big problems over there.

“If we had to, would we do there what we've done to the waterways? You know, there's almost no drugs coming into our waterways anymore.”

Asked if he would get Mexico's permission, he said: “I've been speaking to Mexico. They know how I stand. We're losing hundreds of 1000s of people to drugs. So now we've stopped the waterways, but we know every route.

“We know the addresses of every drug lord. We know their address. We know their front door. We know everything about every one of them. They're killing our people. That's like a war. Would I do it? I'd be proud to. I'd probably go into Congress and say, ‘Hey' — and you know what? The Democrats and the Republicans would both agree, unless they're crazy, and they are a little crazy on the Democrat side. But we have lost hundreds of 1000s of people a year — death, and that's not talking about family destruction.

“That's talking about death, and much of it comes through Mexico. So let me just put it this way. I am not happy with Mexico. OK? Thank you very much.”

Earlier this month, FIFA announced that Infantino will present the inaugural ‘FIFA Peace Prize', which Trump is likely to receive, at the World Cup draw on December 5 in Washington, D.C. The award is designed to acknowledge “individuals who have helped to unite people all over the world in peace”, football's world governing body said.

The World Cup, co-hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States, will begin on June 11, 2026.

Real Madrid striker Gonzalo Garcia is emerging as a target for Brighton and other Premier League sides - should the Spanish giants agree to loan him out in January.

The 21-year-old shot to prominence last summer when he was called up to Xabi Alonso's squad for the Club World Cup after an impressive season with a record-equalling 25 goals for the club's B team Castilla.

He went on to finish top goalscorer at the Club World Cup with four goals and one assist in six games and Madrid awarded him a new contract until 2030.

He has remained a regular part of Alonso's squad and eager to prove his worth but, with competition for attacking places fierce, has made 12 appearances with 11 of those coming off the bench.

That has alerted clubs such as Brighton to make soundings about whether he could be available in January.

Much will depend on the fitness of Kylian Mbappe and Rodrygo while they also have Brahim Diaz but Madrid will assess closer to the window.

Should they open the door to a temporary move then a number of English sides are keen. Leeds and Sunderland showed interest in the summer but others also admire Garcia.

Amid increasing speculation over his future, the Spain U21 international has been asked about his ambitions but he has remained committed to Los Blancos.

'My only option has always been to stay at Real Madrid. For me, it's a dream to be part of the first team. And for now, I'm very happy and content with the decision I made,' Garcia told Spanish publication Marca.

'We're talking about the best club in the world, and the competition is going to be fierce, because the best in the world are always here. But for me, having spent so many years in the youth academy and having been a Real Madrid fan since I was a kid, it's a true dream to be part of the first team, and I don't regret a single thing.'

Madrid may yet believe though that his development in the short term could be best served getting more regular and competitive game time elsewhere.

Judging from statistics, Denmark are facing a challenging night when they clash with Scotland at Hampden Park tonight in the crucial World Cup qualifier which will determine who finishes first and second in Group C. 

If you delve into the statistics, it reveals that the Scottish national arena is actually a bit of a horror ground for the Danish national team, who have only one win to show for eight matches at Hampden Park throughout history. 

Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg knows what's in store for the Danes Tuesday night at Hampden Park.

"I'm really looking forward to it. On top of the disappointing result we got against Belarus, I experience a little extra motivation, where we can put things in place", says Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to Bold.dk.

The Olympique Marseille defensive midfielder expects a close and even match at Hampden Park. 

"I expect 54,000 Scots will do everything they can to push their team towards the World Cup. After all, it is the first time since 1998 that they can secure entry to a World Cup finals", says the Danish national team captain.

President Donald Trump said the US is creating a priority visa system for 2026 FIFA World Cup ticket holders, an effort to handle the large number of visitors expected for the soccer event.

Trump on Monday touted the creation of a "prioritised appointment scheduling system" which he said would allow World Cup ticket holders facing long wait-times for visas to speed up that process. 

Under the initiative, led by the US State Department, fans holding a ticket purchased through FIFA would get priority access to visa interviews, according to a release from the international soccer organisation. The priority interviews are expected to be available in early 2026.

The president said the departments of State and Homeland Security had worked to "ensure that soccer fans from all around the world are properly vetted and able to come to the United States next summer easily."

Next year's World Cup, the first hosted by three countries – the US, Mexico and Canada – offers to draw large numbers of spectators, including international fans, and deliver an economic windfall to host cities.

"I think safety and security is the number-one priority for a successful World Cup," said FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who joined Trump in the Oval Office Monday.

The president's comments followed a meeting of the White House task force on the World Cup, a group created to handle the logistical and security challenges surrounding the premier showcase for international soccer. The task force, established via executive order, is focused on coordinating various federal agencies in the planning, organisation and execution of the tournament. Trump installed himself as chair and Vice President JD Vance as vice chair, with Andrew Giuliani, son of ally Rudy Giuliani, as the executive director.

An avid sports fan who has already attended numerous premier sporting events since returning to office, Trump has involved himself in the planning, regularly touting the upcoming event. And FIFA has used the upcoming showcase for international soccer to expand its own footprint in the US.

While the president has said he will facilitate travel and visa access for World Cup teams, critics have expressed concerns that an immigration crackdown and efforts to expand federal policing of Democratically controlled cities will undermine that pledge. Last month, Trump threatened moving World Cup games out of Boston and the 2028 Olympics from Los Angeles if he thought the cities were not adequately prepared or if he deemed them unsafe.

Trump has also sparred with the other host nations over trade, and last month cut off talks with Canada after he was angered by an ad from Ontario's government targeting his tariff policies.

The president reiterated those threats on Monday and, when asked what his timeline would be for making such a decision, said that he would be willing to help cities that asked him for troops to maintain order.

"You know, the governors are going to have to behave. The mayors are going to have to behave. You know, in the case of California, you have a problem, you have high crime, then you have a place that just suffered great fires and everything else, and they didn't do a very good job," he added, referring to Los Angeles.

"I love Los Angeles. If they want help during this, I would love to send in National Guard or whoever is necessary to help them. I want it to be great. I'd love it to be in Los Angeles," Trump said.

Monday's task force meeting comes ahead of next month's draw to determine the match-ups for the tournament's group stage. The draw will be held at the Kennedy Center, another institution that Trump has sought to put his mark on. 

The US president has long had a warm relationship with FIFA's Infantino, hosting him at the White House multiple times and earlier this year attending the FIFA Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium. 

FIFA opened an office in Trump Tower in June, with Eric Trump, executive vice-president of the Trump Organization and son of the US president, attending the event. That followed the 2024 opening of a FIFA office in Miami, Florida, which is home to the organisation's legal division.

SEATTLE — FIFA President Gianni Infantino and U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled an expedited visa process for World Cup ticket holders seeking entry into the United States, while the President made a veiled threat to Seattle as well.

Seattle is among the cities slated to host the 2026 World Cup, with six games planned. 

RELATED | President Trump suggests cities deemed unsafe could lose FIFA World Cup matches

During the announcement, Trump spoke about Seattle's new Democratic mayor-elect, Katie Wilson, and whether her agenda and the city's existing crime issues could impact its ability to host the games. 

Despite Infantino's reassurances, President Trump expressed concerns about potential issues in "liberal" cities, stating that if there is a "problem," he might consider relocating World Cup events from Seattle.



President Trump then redirected the question to Infantino did not directly answer, but said safety and security were FIFA's number one priority and noted that early ticket sales indicate fans are not currently concerned about it.

FIFA has contracts with 11 American cities and venues to host the games. The Trump administration has allocated $625 million to those cities for security and recently pledged to provide $500 million more for counter-drone defenses.

Infantino toured Seattle and the Sounders' Renton facility in October of 2024 and sang the praises of the facilities. FIFA also held multiple Club World Cup matches at Lumen Field this past summer, with no significant complaints.

The Seattle World Cup Organizing Committee said on Monday it was business as usual in planning for the event, noting that it had team members in DC last week. 

"We are working lockstep with the White House Task Force. We're working at every level of government, local, state, national, even international, on the border, to make sure this event comes off as the best event ever. And so we're super pleased with how it's all going," said Seattle World Cup Organizing Committee President Peter Tomozawa, who added that Wilson had pre-emptively reached out to his group to get more information and offer her excitement over hosting the global games.

Wilson's transition team pointed to a campaign statement in which she said she wanted the city to host an "awesome" World Cup and "This is a chance to make permanent upgrades to downtown public spaces and public transit, not just expensive, temporary improvements for the duration of the event."

“President Trump's comments about moving the 2026 World Cup out of Seattle once again display his ignorance about our city and what we stand for," Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell stated. "The safety of residents and visitors to Seattle is always a top concern of our administration. Violent crime is down 20%, homicides are down 42%, and shootings are down 29%." 

Harrell continued, "Seattle continues to attract major sporting, cultural, and music events, showing that visitors and organizers from around the world have confidence in our city. As a global destination for sports, we have been doing our part to prepare for a safe, welcoming, and fun experience for all who come to Seattle for matches. We are not going to be intimidated by political theatrics from the other Washington. Seattle leaders will continue to do the hard work necessary to create a safe, welcoming, and fun experience for residents and visitors alike.”

Visit Seattle, the city's tourism arm, also issued a statement: "We are thrilled to welcome soccer fans from around the world for FIFA World Cup 2026. Seattle – and the greater state of Washington - is all in on creating a memorable World Cup experience. We are actively collaborating with local partners and law enforcement to deliver a safe and secure World Cup."

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson also reacted with a statement, reading “Seattle will be an excellent host for the World Cup. My team has been working hard with the city of Seattle and our partners to make sure we're one of the best regions to host these games. I look forward to working with Mayor Wilson and her team. We're excited to share our city and our state with the world.”

Trump's full remarks on Seattle and Katie Wilson can be found starting at the 21-minute mark in the video below:



Wilson, who defines herself as a democratic socialist, won the Seattle mayoral race running on her platform of affordability, housing, homelessness, public safety, and transportation.

On her website, she highlights a plan for a "Trump-Proof Seattle," which aims to shield the city from potential federal rollbacks under a second Trump administration.

The proposal centers on protecting vulnerable communities, preserving essential services and reinforcing Seattle's progressive values in the face of national political shifts.

Wilson's plan acknowledges Seattle's reliance on roughly $150 million in annual federal funding and outlines a proactive strategy to close potential budget gaps with progressive local revenue sources. Among her proposals is the implementation of a city-level capital gains tax, a recommendation she helped develop during her tenure on the city's 2023 Revenue Stabilization Workgroup.



The mayor-elect also pledges to strengthen support for immigrants and refugees, expanding legal services, language access, and rapid-response tools for those facing immigration enforcement. She plans to update and reinforce Seattle's sanctuary city policies, ensuring that city departments, including the Seattle Police Department, do not cooperate with civil immigration arrests or share data with federal agencies.

Wilson's “Trump-Proof” agenda extends protections to the LGBTQ community and reproductive rights. She commits to safeguarding access to gender-affirming care and reproductive health services, ensuring shelters remain inclusive, and supporting schools in resisting federal pressure to retreat from inclusive practices.

Addressing concerns over government surveillance, Wilson plans to review how the city collects and stores data, especially any that could be accessed by hostile federal entities. She intends to strengthen surveillance ordinances and prevent SPD from using unapproved technologies acquired through other jurisdictions.

Framing her policy as both defensive and forward-looking, Wilson said Seattle must “build resilient systems that protect our people and uphold our values” in uncertain national circumstances.

As for questions regarding Seattle's World Cup safety, the World Cup Organizing Committee and city leaders have already assured the public that there are multiple plans in place for maintaining a safe environment. 

These efforts include a focus on combating human trafficking with training for staff and workshops for businesses, and implementing traditional security measures like ticket checks and security perimeters. The  Organizing Committee is working with law enforcement and organizations like the Department of Homeland Security to create comprehensive plans. Plans also address concerns like drone threats and ensure security and safety drills are conducted. Organizers have also unrolled a detailed anti-human trafficking plan.

SEATTLE — FIFA President Gianni Infantino and U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled an expedited visa process for World Cup ticket holders seeking entry into the United States, while the President made a veiled threat to Seattle as well.

Seattle is among the cities slated to host the 2026 World Cup, with six games planned.

During the announcement, Trump spoke about Seattle's new Democratic mayor-elect, Katie Wilson, and whether her agenda and the city's existing crime issues could impact its ability to host the games. 

Despite Infantino's reassurances, President Trump expressed concerns about potential issues in "liberal" cities, stating that if there is a "problem," he might consider relocating World Cup events from Seattle.



President Trump then redirected the question to Infantino did not directly answer, but said safety and security were FIFA's number one priority and noted that early ticket sales indicate fans are not currently concerned about it.

FIFA has contracts with 11 American cities and venues to host the games. The Trump administration has allocated $625 million to those cities for security and recently pledged to provide $500 million more for counter-drone defenses.

Infantino toured Seattle and the Sounders' Renton facility in October of 2024 and sang the praises of the facilities. FIFA also held multiple Club World Cup matches at Lumen Field this past summer, with no significant complaints.

The Seattle World Cup Organizing Committee said on Monday it was business as usual in planning for the event, noting that it had team members in DC last week. 

"We are working lockstep with the White House Task Force. We're working at every level of government, local, state, national, even international, on the border, to make sure this event comes off as the best event ever. And so we're super pleased with how it's all going," said Seattle World Cup Organizing Committee President Peter Tomozawa, who added that Wilson had pre-emptively reached out to his group to get more information and offer her excitement over hosting the global games.

Wilson's transition team pointed to a campaign statement in which she said she wanted the city to host an "awesome" World Cup and "This is a chance to make permanent upgrades to downtown public spaces and public transit, not just expensive, temporary improvements for the duration of the event."

“President Trump's comments about moving the 2026 World Cup out of Seattle once again display his ignorance about our city and what we stand for," Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell stated. "The safety of residents and visitors to Seattle is always a top concern of our administration. Violent crime is down 20%, homicides are down 42%, and shootings are down 29%." 

Harrell continued, "Seattle continues to attract major sporting, cultural, and music events, showing that visitors and organizers from around the world have confidence in our city. As a global destination for sports, we have been doing our part to prepare for a safe, welcoming, and fun experience for all who come to Seattle for matches. We are not going to be intimidated by political theatrics from the other Washington. Seattle leaders will continue to do the hard work necessary to create a safe, welcoming, and fun experience for residents and visitors alike.”

Visit Seattle, the city's tourism arm, also issued a statement: "We are thrilled to welcome soccer fans from around the world for FIFA World Cup 2026. Seattle – and the greater state of Washington - is all in on creating a memorable World Cup experience. We are actively collaborating with local partners and law enforcement to deliver a safe and secure World Cup."

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson also reacted with a statement, reading “Seattle will be an excellent host for the World Cup. My team has been working hard with the city of Seattle and our partners to make sure we're one of the best regions to host these games. I look forward to working with Mayor Wilson and her team. We're excited to share our city and our state with the world.”

Trump's full remarks on Seattle and Katie Wilson can be found starting at the 21-minute mark in the video below:



Wilson, who defines herself as a democratic socialist, won the Seattle mayoral race running on her platform of affordability, housing, homelessness, public safety, and transportation.

On her website, she highlights a plan for a "Trump-Proof Seattle," which aims to shield the city from potential federal rollbacks under a second Trump administration.

The proposal centers on protecting vulnerable communities, preserving essential services and reinforcing Seattle's progressive values in the face of national political shifts.

Wilson's plan acknowledges Seattle's reliance on roughly $150 million in annual federal funding and outlines a proactive strategy to close potential budget gaps with progressive local revenue sources. Among her proposals is the implementation of a city-level capital gains tax, a recommendation she helped develop during her tenure on the city's 2023 Revenue Stabilization Workgroup.



The mayor-elect also pledges to strengthen support for immigrants and refugees, expanding legal services, language access, and rapid-response tools for those facing immigration enforcement. She plans to update and reinforce Seattle's sanctuary city policies, ensuring that city departments, including the Seattle Police Department, do not cooperate with civil immigration arrests or share data with federal agencies.

Wilson's “Trump-Proof” agenda extends protections to the LGBTQ community and reproductive rights. She commits to safeguarding access to gender-affirming care and reproductive health services, ensuring shelters remain inclusive, and supporting schools in resisting federal pressure to retreat from inclusive practices.

Addressing concerns over government surveillance, Wilson plans to review how the city collects and stores data, especially any that could be accessed by hostile federal entities. She intends to strengthen surveillance ordinances and prevent SPD from using unapproved technologies acquired through other jurisdictions.

Framing her policy as both defensive and forward-looking, Wilson said Seattle must “build resilient systems that protect our people and uphold our values” in uncertain national circumstances.

As for questions regarding Seattle's World Cup safety, the World Cup Organizing Committee and city leaders have already assured the public that there are multiple plans in place for maintaining a safe environment. 

These efforts include a focus on combating human trafficking with training for staff and workshops for businesses, and implementing traditional security measures like ticket checks and security perimeters. The  Organizing Committee is working with law enforcement and organizations like the Department of Homeland Security to create comprehensive plans. Plans also address concerns like drone threats and ensure security and safety drills are conducted. Organizers have also unrolled a detailed anti-human trafficking plan.

Bill Maher is putting a pause on stand-up comedy, and one of his reasons is due to the intense political division in the country. 


	Maher told Patton Oswalt on his Club Random podcast Monday that he decided to stop touring at the end of 2024 because, “I don't want to be out there in this country, in this political atmosphere. I could get shot by the left or the right,” adding “Its a good time not to be out there.” He did acknowledge though, that there are other reasons. He said he was “tired of the travel,” and “I just got tired of being twice as funny as people who were selling twice as many tickets as me.”

	“Not that I didn't sell a lot of tickets and do great theaters — but I didn't sell arenas,” Maher added. “And some people did, who, frankly, are not that great. But, you know, when the audience is 35 to 45, they don't wanna see somebody 70… I just did my 13th HBO special. I feel like that's a good body of work… I felt they all, they basically got better as it went along. I feel like the last one was the best one, which is a good way to get off.”

	Maher has taken heat over the years from both the left and right over his contrarian views, but the criticism intensified on the left when he had dinner with Donald Trump earlier this year at the White House. He insisted he “didn't go MAGA,” and he defended his decision to meet with Trump. 


	“Lemme first say to all of the people who treated this like it was some kind of summit meeting, you're ridiculous… like I was gonna sign a treaty or something,” he said. “I have no power, I'm a f—ing comedian, and he's the most powerful leader in the world.”

Bill Maher is the most unfunny loser in the whole industry

“And some people did, who, frankly, are not that great. But, you know, when the audience is 35 to 45, they don't wanna see somebody 70… ”

Seinfeld, Larry David…

Problem is Maher has never been funny. He is the Colin Cowherd of comedy — just having the contrarian view and being loud about it doesn't make you informed or funny.

nobody wants to hear his “jokes” anyway. he's never been funny.

Kevin Hart is mourning the loss of his dear friend Nate Smith, who served as his tour manager before his passing.

Hart, 46, often shared hilarious anecdotes of his life with his late pal throughout his standup career. 

The “Jumanji” star took to social media on Monday, November 17, to announce the devastating news. 

“I lost a dear friend today,” Hart began in a post shared via Instagram. “Nate you are a legend in this game of comedy…. I am honored to have been able to call you my road manager.”

He continued, “You taught me so much about this business… ur loyalty and dedication was unmatched…. U had a heart of gold man…. Sometimes misunderstood by some but never by me.”

Hart went on to thank Smith for his years of friendship.

“Thank you for all that u did …. I love you for life man. You will be missed. RIP NATE…. One of the best to ever do it!!!!! Love u.”

Fans of the comedian were quick to flood the comments section with thoughts and prayers for Hart and his late friend, as many felt a connection to Smith due to his constant presence in Hart's sets.

“I remember watching this, wishing him peace 🕊️” one fan commented. 

“I'm so sorry Kev, keep keeping his memory alive the way you do. Love and peace to you and yours. 🤍” another wrote. 

“Prayers for you, Nate and those who love him 😇 🫂” a third follower added. 

The “Night School” actor often told stories of his relationship with Smith, including in his 2010 comedy special, “Seriously Funny.”

“My road manager and I are very close,” Hart began to a roaring audience. “He's older. We fight a lot, though. It's kinda like a relationship. He's been around me for years. He was with me before money even came into the picture. He's the one scrambling up for me. But when you're around somebody for so long, naturally you start to butt heads. Little [expletive] annoys you.”

He then delivered the punchline, “I don't like the way he sneezes… I never saw nobody catch they breath from a sneeze.”

Smith stayed by Hart's side throughout his career, and the actor showed his appreciation in 2018 by gifting his friend a vintage car. 

“My Road Manager of 12yrs Nate Smith walked into his home and found a nice surprise in his garage. We argue like cats and dogs but ur loyalty has never been in question,” Hart captioned a video of the sweet moment. “I love your old ass man….Thank you for your help in making another tour a major success!!!!”

To have had this admiration and respect for someone is so tellin.

Teyana Taylor was honored at Monday night's Elle Women in Hollywood event, wearing a gold look that included little more than a skirt and a hood.

Crafted in a lustrous metallic fabric, Taylor's Balmain outfit featured a gathered skirt that was accented by a belt at her thighs. The rest of the dress was basically just a hood, with one long piece of the shiny material traveling up from the belt and around the top of her head. 

A rippling layer of fabric was precariously placed on her chest to avoid any unwanted wardrobe malfunctions, showing off her sternum tattoo and navel piercing while leaving her back totally exposed.  

She stacked chunky gold rings on her fingers and wore artistic gold drop earrings in a warm hue similar to her dress.

Her gathered skirt exposed her ankle, showing off gold high-heeled sandals that snaked their way up her calves.  

The dress was presented as part of Olivier Rousteing's Resort 2026 collection back in June. It was one of his final collections for the house, following the announcement that Antonin Tron would be replacing him at the helm.

Holding the latest iPhone, she chatted with Elle on the red carpet about her obsession with a wallet phone case; her dress had no room for pockets.

“I don't like carrying purses. One thing I'm never going to do is lose my phone. I will lose a purse, I will lose a diamond ring, I will lose a chain, I will lose earrings … but I ain't gonna lose my phone.”

Taylor has just concluded a whirlwind press tour for her latest Hulu show, “All's Fair,” where the group certainly brought the jaw-dropping fashion, which the actress happily continued through this event last night.

	In a joint press conference with survivors of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, House lawmakers bashed President Donald Trump and Republican leadership ahead of the lower chamber's vote to compel the release of the so-called “Epstein files.” 


	Standing before survivors, longtime Trump sycophant and MAGA standardbearer Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) told reporters that the debacle over the Epstein files has been “one of the most destructive things to MAGA.” 


	“I wasn't ‘Johnny come lately' to the MAGA train,” Greene said. “Watching the man that we supported early on […] Watching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart.” 


	Greene has long supported transparency in the Epstein case, while Trump has pressured the nation to move on from the scandal. The president — whose was once close friends with Epstein and whose name reportedly appears in the files — recently revoked his endorsement of Greene, and repeatedly bash her as a “traitor” to his movement. 

	











	The congresswoman addressed the president's attacks on Tuesday. “I gave him my loyalty for free,” she said. “I've never owed him anything. But I fought for him for the policies and for America first. And he called me a traitor for standing with [survivors] and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition.”

Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), bucked House leadership and Trump's efforts to silence calls for the administration to follow through on its campaign promise for transparency regarding the cases against Epstein. The members spent months shoring up support for a discharge petition that would allow them to bring “The Epstein Files Transparency Act” to a floor vote without the approval of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who has been allied with the president on the issue. Johnson for seven weeks stalled the swearing-in ceremony of Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who ultimately cast the vote to bring the resolution to the floor . When it became clear the petition would be coming to a vote, Trump flipped his position, encouraging House Republicans to vote yes.

	Survivors were not buying it. 


	Halye Robinson, who worked closely  with members of Congress to secure a vote to release the files, spoke directly to Trump: “To the president of the United States of America who is not here today. I want to send a clear message to you: while I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files — and I'm grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill — I can't help to be skeptical of what the agenda is.” 


	“I am traumatized. I am not stupid, I am traumatized,” she added. “You have put us through so much stress: the lockdowns, the halting of these procedures that were supposed to have happened 50 days ago. Adelita Grijalva, who waited to get sworn in. And then [you] get upset when your own party goes against you because what is being done is wrong. It's not right.” 


	Survivors and lawmakers who spoke called on the Senate to also pass the resolution, and criticized lawmakers — including Johnson — who only decided to lend their support after it became clear the vote had enough momentum to pass. 


	“I think the speaker wants to save face,” Massie said. “He's going to vote for a piece of legislation today that he's disparaged for four months.”


	In a subsequent press conference, Johnson said “if and when” the legislation makes it to the Senate — Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-Mont.) would take the time to carefully amend the act in order to assuage “concerns” about its scope.

	Johnson expressed worry that releasing the files “could ruin the reputations of completely innocent people, such as those who may just have known Epstein but knew nothing of his crimes or whose names he exploited and used to try to get close to his intended victims.”


	The American justice system exists precisely as the mechanism to try those accused of crimes, and fear of reputational damage is no reason to continue denying Epstein's survivors the justice they deserve.

The standard time for Broadway intermissions ranges between 15 and 20 minutes, long enough to stretch your legs, maybe grab a snack, and hit the washroom. An entire year? Why, that's more than enough time for all of that and more, including forgetting some of the most important plot points and character machinations of any sort of spectacle, even the major ones. Such is the case with Jon M. Chu's “Wicked: For Good,” the second offering in his planned two-film adaptation of the beloved musical “Wicked.” 

In preparation for my return to the Land of Oz, I caught up on my review of the first film. I refreshed myself on my big quibbles: That it was hard to know what any of these people really wanted (even if they did sing about that stuff a lot) and that Oz as a location felt far too flat, lifeless, and confusing. The smaller ones, too: “Odd missteps, hinky plotholes, and confounding questions,” many of them about the very nature of magic in this world. I made sure to note the things I did enjoy, particularly the performances of both Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, plus some whimsically mounted musical sequences.

In “Wicked: For Good,” there's plenty of continuity, even if it's of the disappointing variety. The things that missed the mark the first time, well, they still do. The things that worked in “Wicked”? They still do, but only a clock-tick better. If nothing else, and even as a person not steeped in “Wicked” lore and admiration, the casting of Erivo and Grande is ne plus ultra, and the deep respect and love the performers share for each other, on and off the screen, really keeps this particular trifle afloat. Their Elphaba and Glinda form the heart and soul of this story, and it's difficult to imagine another duo personifying that better (or with better singing).

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Despite drawing out the combined running time of both films to nearly five hours (the musical runs two hours and 45 minutes, with a 15 minute intermission), big questions still remain (and they will persist). But Chu's choice to kick off “Wicked: For Good” with little in the way of catch-up is a refreshing one, albeit short-lived in its boldness. The film opens in impressive fashion: It's some months after Elphaba (Erivo) and Glinda (Grande) chose distinctly different paths during a heartbreaking parting in the Emerald City, and both remain firmly locked into their respective roles.

Elphaba is now fully the Wicked Witch of the West — aided in part by the tireless work of her former mentor Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), who has dedicated herself to spreading horrific misinformation to all Ozians, in service to propping up a despot loser (Jeff Goldblum as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, bored) — which sees her taking on wild missions in service to her aims to unseat the Wizard and undo his many misdeeds. Top of mind for Elphaba is freeing the Animals, who have been conscripted into terrible slavery, mostly because the Wizard keenly understands that to keep people together, a common enemy (real or imagined) is the true golden ticket.

As a broom-riding Elphaba sweeps over the currently-in-construction Yellow Brick Road to free the Animals, it's hard not to feel a big thrill. Here's our heroine, doing the tough work (with a big dash of magic) to make things right in Oz. As the Animals — in this case, massive bison-like folks — fight their way free, it's also hard not to be very much on their side. We're rooting for you, Elphie, and what kind of story would this be in, what sort of fairy tale, if you didn't succeed on your altruistic mission? Well.

 










If Elphaba has embraced her role as Oz's baddie, Glinda has taken things a step further as the land's number one goody-two-shoes. As Glinda the Good Witch, she spends her days swanning around Oz (soon enough, in her very own bubble), trying to cheer up a population that has been made to blindly fear her own best friend. It's a horrible, horrible gig if you can get it. Both Elphaba and Glinda have been forced into roles that, while they may generally suit them (Elphaba is a natural fighter and leader, Glinda places real value on making people feel good), only really serve to divide, scare, and hurt. However will this be worked out?

Two hours-plus later, the answer is, well, quite a bit like the beloved stage musical, just with a couple new songs (both from Stephen Schwartz, including “No Place Like Home” and “The Girl in the Bubble”), some curiously flat staging, and the continued question, why is this in two parts? As one established fan of the musical commented to me after her screening, “no plot but it somehow goes on forever.” Another sagely noted that Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox's script (itself based on Holzman's own musical book) has taken all of the musical's laugh lines and “turned them into deadly serious ones.”

That's not to say that there is not serious stuff afoot here, and Chu and his writers aren't at all afraid of digging into the terrible political implications of dishonest messaging, violent politicking, raising charlatans to power, and abusing those who are somehow “different,” but it butts heads with the lighter stuff at every turn. Yes, it's hard to feel too seriously about a film that includes a song with the lyrics “There are bridges you cross/You didn't know you crossed/Until you've crossed.” At what point did this cross into gobbledygook, we wonder?

 










While this entry into the franchise, by necessity, has to expand further out into the wider world of Oz, it often feels bound up in the places we've already been. The Emerald City and Munchinkland still figure prominently, and even good ol' Shiz University appears in flashback (unnecessary, along with another flashback to Glinda's charmed childhood). Brief forays to Elphaba's forest hideout are a welcome change of scenery (as the location of a much-vaunted love scene between her and Jonathan Bailey's Fiyero, the less said, the better), as is another visit to a far-off stretch of the Yellow Brick Road, but these change-ups are few and far between, and so very missed.

Even scenes that involve bigger explorations of our known spaces, including a number set in the Emerald City, feel somehow off, in thrall to odd blocking that doesn't allow the audience to see the full scope of a location and weirdly obscure key focal points. Yes, in the big musical sequence in which we get a bigger taste of the force of the Ozians' fear (“March of the Witch Hunters”) and the rage of Ethan Slater's Boq, perhaps it would be nice to see a facial expression or two. You won't.

The same applies to a key sequence in which Fiyero is forever altered, and which appears to have been shot from five miles down the Yellow Brick Road. If we want to see more, it shouldn't be because we're seeing so much less than is absolutely necessary. Yet another shot of sweeping tulip fields does not a true trip to Oz — or “Wicked” — make.

 










The same quibbles, but just writ larger (and, yes, longer). Still, what holds these two films together is difficult to deny: the power and talent of leads Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Both of their characters are firmly boxed in to their roles in Oz, and yet Erivo and Grande never feel so constrained, either when it comes to their heart-breaking acting work or their soaring lyrical stylings. 

Much like “Wicked,” “Wicked: For Good” works its way up to a massive duet between the pair, so emotionally resonant than even the most wicked of audience members will still likely shed a tear (the song is, of course, “For Good”). It's an unmitigated high note, but it's a lonely one indeed. Is it alone worth the wait? Maybe, why couldn't the entire film feel that way?

Universal Pictures will release “Wicked: For Good” in theaters on Friday, November 21.

During another night of powerful performances on November 17, 2025, the Knockouts continued on season 28 of “The Voice.” Below you'll find videos of each featured artist during week four of the Knockouts, including the latest “Mic Drop” recipient, and details on who's moving on to the Playoffs.

The night started with two of Reba McEntire's country artists duking it out onstage — rural Minnesota's Cori Kennedy and Aaron Nichols of Bakersfield, California. Nichols kicked things off playing his electric guitar on a rousing rendition of The Band of Heathens' “Hurricane.” 

During rehearsals, Kennedy told McEntire and Mega Mentor Joe Walsh of the Eagles that she'd never played with a full band backing her until making it onto “The Voice.” So she decided to take advantage of the opportunity by breaking out of her country wheelhouse to do a rock version of Lady Gaga's “You and I.” 

The coaches loved both artists' performances, but McEntire decided to move forward with “Aaron Cold as an Icicle Nichols,” as Snoop Dogg nicknamed him due to his vocal “control” and “grit.” McEntire called Kennedy a “powerhouse,” but said Nichols' years of performing in Nashville had paid off in his onstage presence. 

He even received McEntire's coveted “Mic Drop,” which means he'll be one of four artists (one from each team) that viewers will vote on to determine which singer will get to perform during the Rose Bowl Parade on New Year's Day.

Nineteen-year-old Carolina Rodriguez had her first mentoring session with Snoop (and his Mega Mentor Zac Brown), since he stole her from coach Niall Horan during the Battles. For the Knockouts, the Miami native sang Adele's version of The Cure's “Love Song” because the song reminds her of her siblings, who've supported her dreams unconditionally. 

Maryland's Mindy Miller, 35, told Snoop and Brown that she decided to sing Jamey Johnson's “In Color,” calling it “one of the finest pieces of storytelling in music.” Miller tearfully said she was dedicating her performance to her grandparents, who lived across the street from her as she was growing up and “taught me so much about music and life and love.” 

Though Snoop told Rodriguez she was “amazing,” especially at her age, he decided to move forward with Miller, whom he said “touched my heart tonight, and that's what music is supposed to do.” 

Michael Bublé brought Latin singer Teo Ramdell and soul singer Jazz McKenzie together for his latest Knockout. Ramdell decided not to sing in Spanish this time, opting for Bon Jovi's “It's My Life.” McKenzie, meanwhile, decided to sing Smokey Robinson's “Cruisin.'”

Snoop told Ramdell that his singing and moves onstage was “superstar stuff.” Their coach told Ramdell he knew how hard he worked on the Bon Jovi song, but he chose to move ahead with McKenzie, whom he told, “God's light radiates through you.” 

The final round of the Knockouts airs on November 24 at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

	The White House posted a video to its website of Donald Trump‘s recent gaggle with reporters on Air Force One, but one brief moment has drawn media attention.


	That came on Friday, when a female reporter attempted to ask the president about the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. She appeared to be attempting to ask him that, if there was nothing incriminating in the files, why doesn't he order their release himself, rather than have Congress vote on it?


	But before she finished, Trump pointed her way and said, “Quiet, quiet piggy.” Trump then turned to answer a question from CBS News' Jennifer Jacobs. Jacobs reported on Trump's outburst on her X account and said that he had said it to a Bloomberg reporter.

	











	A White House spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. A Bloomberg spokesperson also did not return a request for comment.

	The House is voting later Tuesday on a resolution to release the Epstein files. Trump had opposed the release until Sunday when, after it was clear that the resolution would pass, he told Republicans to vote for it.

	On Air Force One, Trump had been asked about an email released last week in which Epstein claimed that the president “knew about the girls.”


	“I know nothing about that. They would have announced that a long time ago,” he said. He then pointed to other Epstein emails that have mentioned President Bill Clinton and his Treasury Secretary and ex-Harvard president Larry Summers, among others. Trump called on the Justice Department to investigate Clinton and other Democrats for their connections to Epstein. Soon after, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that a prosecutor was assigned to look into it.

	











	“Jeffrey Epstein and I had a bad relationship for many years,” Trump said.

Trump really needs to stop talking to himself like that.

Looking like to me he is nervous

The only thing more disgusting than knowing this evil soulless ghoul is president is knowing that not a single other grown adult on that plane felt the urge to speak up in the reporters defense in that moment. 

Not even a “wait, what did you just say to her?” 

If I'm in a supermarket and hear a man tell a woman “quiet, piggy” I'm getting very involved. You don't speak to a woman like that under any circumstance. You don't speak to anyone that way. It's abhorrent and should be met with instant public shaming and rebuttal.

good point

He is a coward and punk to speak to women that way

“The Chronology of Water,” a new biographical drama from Kristen Stewart, has released its first trailer. 

Adapted from the 2011 memoir of the same name by writer Lidia Yuknavitch, “The Chronology of Water” stars Imogen Poots as Lidia, recounting her story of attempting to escape an abusive home through competitive swimming. When her hopes are derailed due to alcohol and drug addiction, she navigates her troubled life and goes on a journey of sexual discovery all while finding healing through the power of writing. Shot on 16mm film, the movie serves as Stewart's feature directorial debut; previously, she dabbled in the craft through directing two short films for anthology series as well as several music videos for groups such as Chvrches and Boygenius.

The film first premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival in May, as part of the Un Certain Regard section. Reviews for the film were largely positive. In a review for IndieWire, critic David Ehrlich gave the film a “B+” and praised Stewart's direction, saying “There isn't a single millisecond of this movie that doesn't bristle with the raw energy of an artist who's found the permission she needed to put her whole being into every frame, messy and shattered as that might be.” 

 










Aside from Poots, “The Chronology of Water” stars Thora Birch, Jim Belushi, Earl Cave, Tom Sturridge, Charlie Carrick, and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth fame. The film is produced by Maggie McLean, Dylan Meyer, Michael Pruss, Rebecca Feuer, and Charles Gillibert, and will be released by independent distributor The Forge. 

After the release of her directorial debut, Stewart will next star in the upcoming stoner comedy “The Wrong Girls.” She has also been announced to star in an '80s vampire thriller “Flesh of the Gods” from “Mandy” director Panos Cosmatos, alongside Oscar Isaac. Her recent film credits include “Sacramento” and “Love Lies Bleeding” from 2024. 

“The Chronology of Water” will receive an awards-qualifying December 5 release in New York and Los Angeles. The Forge will expand the film to theaters nationwide next year, on January 9. Watch the trailer for the movie below.

Colombia's Oscar entry “A Poet” is one of the most bruisingly funny contenders in this year's Best International Feature lineup, but it still packs plenty of art. Writer/director Simón Mesa Soto directs first-time actor Ubeimar Rios, whose obsession with poetry in a literary industry bent more toward spectacle has turned him into the stereotypical tortured artist. Until he meets a teenage protege who turns his life well, not quite around, but certainly upside down.

Distributor 1-2 Special is set to release the film, which won the Cannes Un Certain Regard Jury Prize earlier this year, in January. The film's caustic humor centered around a sad-sack protagonist whose pratfalls recall the work of graphic novelist Daniel Clowes or, more recently, Owen Kline's A24 movie “Funny Pages.”

Below, IndieWire debuts the exclusive trailer ahead of preliminary shortlist voting — which includes Best International Feature, Best Documentary, and more categories — which begins December 8. The shortlists will be announced Tuesday, December 16. (See our Academy Awards predictions here.)

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Here's the synopsis courtesy of 1-2 Special: “Middle-aged and erratic, Oscar is a failed writer who has given up on life. Unemployed and living with family, he wanders the streets of Medellín in a drunken stupor, lamenting the state of literature in his home country, where he has succumbed to the cliché of the tortured artist. However, the opportunity to mentor a young student offers a chance at redemption, if he doesn't screw it up first. In a performance marked by darkly comic pathos, first-time actor Ubeimar Rios stars in Simón Mesa Soto's Un Certain Regard Jury Prize-winner ‘A Poet,' a raw and riotous farce about how good deeds are often met with the universe's idea of cruel and unusually poetic punishment.”

More on the film from IndieWire's Critic's Pick review out of Cannes from Ben Croll: “Put together with impressive efficiency — the film only started shooting in January — this art-world send-up explores the many fears and frustrations the acclaimed director felt in the decade since making the 2014 short film Palme d'Or winner ‘Leidi,' channeling them into a darkly-funny burlesque that speaks of verse while playing like a Dan Clowes comic brought to manic life… The film's bawdy sense of humor plays off a non-professional star — himself a full-time teacher from a nearby school — that looks like he was drawn by Robert Crumb and acts the part just as well.”

 










“A Poet” opens in select theaters January 30, 2026, from 1-2 Special. Other recent and upcoming releases from the distributor include Harris Dickinson's “Urchin,” Radu Jude's “Dracula,” Christian Petzold's “Miroirs No. 3,” and Mark Jenkin's “Rose of Nevada.”

Jimmy Kimmel returned to the airwaves Monday, Nov. 17, after taking several days off following the death of his longtime friend and Jimmy Kimmel Live bandleader, Cleto Escobedo III.


	Escobedo died suddenly on Nov. 11, with a cause of death later revealed to be cardiogenic shock following complications related to a liver transplant. Kimmel went ahead with his show that day, delivering an emotional tribute to Escobedo during his monologue, before taking the rest of the week off to grieve.


	On last night's show, Kimmel didn't directly address Escobedo's death. But there was one notable change, with announcer Lou Wilson tweaking the house band's name from Cleto and the Cletones to just the Cletones. 


	As Kimmel recalled in his monologue last week, he met Escobedo not long after his family moved from Brooklyn to Las Vegas. “We became friends. And not just regular friends,” Kimmel said. “We became like 24/7, ‘Mom please let me sleep over please,' kind of friends.” 

	











	Escobedo was a gifted saxophone player and spent time touring with Paula Abdul, Marc Anthony, and Cecilia Noël. When Kimmel was offered the chance to do his own late-night show, he immediately knew he wanted Escobedo to be his bandleader. “We grew up watching Dave and Paul, and the idea that anyone other than him would lead the band was terrifying,” Kimmel said, referring to David Letterman and his longtime bandleader Paul Shaffer. “It had to be him.” 


	Kimmel went on to call Escobedo the “nicest, most humble, kind, and always funny person,” adding: “He loved me. He loved seeing all of this happen. He loved being a part of it. He never took it for granted… He was just a great older brother. No baggage, all love. There's no one in my life I felt more comfortable with.”

Speaking with Rolling Stone, Escobedo's bandmate, the keyboardist and musical arranger Jeff Babko, said, “I don't think I've ever seen television like Jimmy's monologue the other night. It was something else. We were all feeling a lot, and I think it really showed what kind of family Jimmy created over there. If it's not legit blood family, it's one step removed. It's pretty deep. And with Cleto gone, it's all hitting hard. These events — the good ones and the bad ones — show our little show-family at its closest.”


	Over the weekend, Kimmel launched two fundraisers in Escobedo's memory. One was for UCLA Medical Center, where Escobedo was being treated, and the other was for the Animal Foundation in Las Vegas, in honor of Escobedo's love of animals and rescue dogs.

	Cambridge Dictionary defines “Parasocial” as “involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.” It can now also be defined as the dictionary's 2025 Word of the Year, thanks, at least in part, to Taylor Swift‘s engagement to Travis Kelce, streamer iShowSpeed blocking an overzealous fan, and widespread controversies involving AI chatbots.


	“As social media intensifies the intimacy that fans feel with their adored celebrities, and with the rise in popularity of AI companions that can take on personalities, the word for these one-way relationships – parasocial – is having its own moment,” Cambridge Dictionary wrote in an overview of the term's development in culture throughout the year. 


	According to the report, searches for “parasocial” spiked in June when iShowSpeed — named Rolling Stone's most influential creator of 2025 — blocked a fan account on X that published an extensive thread about his past relationship. The compilation of posts made assumptions about the streamer's private life, what his family thought of his former partner, and more boundary-crossing observations shared as fact. When iShowSpeeed blocked the account, which identified as his “number 1 parasocial,” the user behind it pleaded, “I'll delete the tweet please unblock me I've dead been shaking non stop please I'll stop.”

	











	Another spike came in August, when Swift and Kelce announced their engagement after two years of dating. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” the couple wrote in a joint post on Instagram. It playfully reflected the personal relationship some Swifties feel towards the musician, having been on a journey through the highs and lows of her past relationships by way of her music for nearly two decades. “Taylor Swift is engaged and I've never felt more parasocial over someone,” one viral post read. Other fans shared videos of themselves crying tears of joy, while people who have convinced themselves that Swift is secretly gay pushed more conspiracy theories.

	That same month, attorneys general from 44 states signed an open letter warning AI companies about the dangers of “chatbot parasocial relationships,” particularly as they relate to children. This came after internal reports from Meta that coding in its AI technology on Facebook allowed for chatbots to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” per Reuters. As the year progressed, AI programs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Character Technologies' Character.ai, among others, were linked to harrowing instances of self-harm and suicide in young users.

	“It's interesting from a language point of view because it has made the transition from an academic term to one used by ordinary people in their social media posts,” Colin McIntosh, Cambridge Dictionary Chief Editor, said in the report. “And it also captures the zeitgeist of 2025, as the public's fascination with celebrities and their lifestyles continues to reach new heights.”


	Earlier this year, Cambridge Dictionary added “Skibidi,” “Tradwife,” and “Delulu” to its lexicon. Looking ahead, the report concludes, it will also be keeping an eye on “Glazing,” “Vibey,” and “Bias,” as in the term for “the object of a fan's stanning” as popularized by K-Pop fans.

Cable pioneer and ex-Viacom CEO Tom Freston is out with a new book, "Unplugged," and some amazing stories.


							By 

	Lacey Rose


Writer-At-Large


	Despite his 26 years in a traditional media job, ultimately rising to CEO of what was then Viacom, Tom Freston had no interest in writing a traditional business book. Instead, Unplugged: Adventures From MTV to Timbuktu, published by Gallery Books, is a story of one former mogul's adventures around the world.


	“Most people who are executives or have been executives write a ‘how to do business better' type book,” he explains. “I wanted to write one about how to have a better, more interesting life.”




	It's a fitting approach for a man who's lived as much of his life off the grid as he has on it. The 79-year-old logged years in such far-flung locales as India and Afghanistan, where, at one point, he had a multimillion-dollar clothing export business. He tended bar in the Virgin Islands, built an orphanage in Burma and, later, centered his focus on Africa as board chair of The ONE campaign, an anti-poverty advocacy organization co-founded by Bono, one of Freston's famous pals.

	In between, Freston returned to the U.S., and landed a gig at a new, scrappy startup, the Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment Co., which had just launched two cable networks, Nickelodeon and The Movie Channel. Determined to have cable do for TV what FM radio had done for AM, the company would launch a music channel next, and Freston, a music fanatic, joined its founding team as marketing chief, soon rising to president. From there, he swiftly climbed the corporate ladder, adding other brands like VH1 and Comedy Central to his purview.


	By late 2005, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone, who had acquired the company years before, was so impressed by Freston's consistent results, he elevated him to CEO. Of course, he fired him eight months later, furious that he hadn't scooped up Myspace as Redstone rival Rupert Murdoch had, paying $580 million for the social networking service at the time. (When the latter famously collapsed in 2011, Murdoch offloaded it for $35 million; not doing that deal had saved Viacom more than $500 million. As Freston writes, “I'm still waiting for a thank-you note.”)

	











	In early November, Freston, a father of two whose globe-trotting continues, hopped on a Zoom to recount a few of his wildest tales, including an infamous sex tour with Redstone, and sound off on David Ellison, David Zaslav and the fate of MTV.


I can't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday, and somehow, in your book, you're recounting conversations you had in your 20s and 30s. Had you kept journals along the way?


	When I was living in Afghanistan and India, I did, and they were pretty precise. When I was working [at Viacom], I had a diary and some notes, but when I left, I didn't take anything other than a few pieces of paper and a chainsaw [a gift from the heavy metal band Anthrax]. That was it. I was gone. But you can Google stuff and try to triangulate and figure out where you were, and then I'd talk to people. It's remarkable how your memories come back.


I suspect there were some stories that felt like “musts.” One of my favorites is how, in order to get David Bowie to do an “I Want My MTV” commercial in the early '80s, you flew to Switzerland and met him on the ski slopes in Gstaad. You then proceeded to ski with him, ultimately ending the day in a sauna with him and Paul McCartney.


	I've been dining out on that story for years. It's a good one.


I'll admit I'm still processing another story you share about taking Sumner Redstone and his mistress to sex clubs in Asia. At his request, you'd watch people fornicate onstage. I'm guessing you didn't need a journal entry to recall that trip?












	No, no, it's still clear in my mind. (Laughs.) I figured that had to go in there. It showed a side of him. On one hand, he's a brilliant businessman, bold and unstoppable. I mean, who wants to start a conglomerate when they're, like, 65 or whatever he was? But then there was this side of him that was emerging that I saw. And then, in the end, after I leave [the company], he's spending, like, $150 million on hookers. I thought, maybe that thing in Bangkok kind of set him off on a new trail.


It's your fault.


	Yeah. (Laughs.) But taking him through there and just looking at the look on his face — I had to get out of there, and he had to move up [to get a closer look]. I hadn't seen that side of him before because he was always with his wife, Phyllis. I never knew he had this longing.


You also included a wild story about how Comedy Central was born. One day, without any plan whatsoever, you publicly announced you'd be launching a comedy channel, simply because you'd heard rival HBO was doing so.


	There were so many Comedy Central stories to choose from, but I thought it would be good just to say how we did it. And what we did is the kind of thing you can't do these days. “Hey, HBO is starting a comedy channel. Well, we should start one this afternoon. Let's just announce it. We'll be in all the news articles.” And it worked like a charm. That thing became worth billions of dollars.

	











What didn't make the book?


	Well, I wanted to keep a fun tone, so I had a couple of stories [that we cut]. There was one about when I was working in Liberia with ONE and Red, and I met this cannibal warlord guy named General Butt Naked. Then when I wrote it up, it just was a downer. The guy killed, like, 10,000 people, ripping hearts out of kids. There was another one about when I brought a case to the Supreme Court for special needs kids, for my son, but it just didn't fit. [My editors] were like, “Hey, keep it at 300 pages. You're not Barbra Streisand.”


As you write in the book, you got your job at MTV because Bob Pittman liked your checkered past. In fact, he was convinced you'd been a hashish smuggler.


	Yeah! He recognized I had done other things, too. He wasn't just like, “Oh man, let's get a dope smuggler in here.” (Laughs.)


Of course. But I'm curious how you think your lack of a traditional path or any TV experience, for that matter, served you in that job?


	They wanted untraditional people. Same with the people they hired for Nick — they were, like, schoolteachers. No one had come from TV. Because we were inventing it from the ground up, so there was no legacy. You could be scrappy and open to different ideas and a little edgy. And we had fun. Those early days at MTV, everybody was a music fanatic and no one really cared about how much money we were making, which is a good thing because no one was making any. But even now, whenever I run into somebody, they say how much they loved working there. We have a Facebook group called, “I worked at MTV when MTV was cool.” I mean, people couldn't wait to come to the office in those days. They would sleep there.

	











Well, yes, there were also hookers and tequila girls and whatever else was going on in those offices.


	We had a receptionist who sold cocaine, but he didn't last that long. (Laughs.) That was the ‘80s!


Are there moves you wouldn't have made had you come in with traditional TV background?


	Yeah. When we'd get thrown off cable systems, we'd go full blast. I mean, we'd fly Don Henley and John Mellencamp to Denver to the TCI headquarters and we'd try and rabble-rouse these bottle-wielding youths, who were our fan base, to storm the cable system. And we'd always get back on. I saw that recur in the Jimmy Kimmel episode.


How so?


	Everyone talked about “Poor Bob [Iger],” who I love, but the missing piece of the equation was the young fan base that's rabidly in love with Jimmy Kimmel. You don't just take something away from them. They're going to hurt you, reputationally and business-wise. You saw that: They canceled all those Hulu and Disney+ [subscriptions]. And that was not in the equation. It was like, “Well, do we listen to the FCC? What do we do? We don't want Trump [to retaliate].” But to get back to your question, [we probably would have been more concerned about] offending our distributors instead of just burning down their cable system or having a rock band out in their parking lot.


You ultimately rose to CEO of Viacom, but that was never a job you wanted.


	I was in an imaginary world, thinking I could stay where I was. I wanted to be like Lorne Michaels, who's seen 50 regimes come and go and he's still there doing his thing. Everything I loved was at that company, and when I moved up, I knew what would happen. I mean, you're dealing with serious business — with Wall Street and bankers and financial statements. Not that I don't know those things, but it wouldn't be as enjoyable a job.

	











Have you ever regretted accepting the job?


	No. Because if I hadn't taken it, I'd be working for Les Moonves. And who knows where that would lead me.


Presumably out the door.


	(Laughs.) By the way, Les and I always got along pretty good. But by [the time Redstone approached him about taking over for Mel Karmazin], I'd been there for, like, 20 years, I was around 60, and I figured being the head of a public company is a big honor. Who would've thought I'd be ringing the bell on Wall Street? So I decided I wanted to do it, and then the funny thing was that I'd told Sumner I needed 24 hours to think about it, and then when I came back to him to say yes the next day, he said, “I already gave the job to Les.” I was like, “It's only been 17 hours!” [Redstone ultimately made Freston and Moonves co-presidents in 2004; by late 2005, he split the company in two and named Freston CEO of Viacom.]


It sounds like Paramount chief David Ellison is going to make a go at rebooting MTV. How would you approach that? And is it even possible?


	I think so. I had a meeting with David and Jeff Shell and a couple people. They had a lovely dinner — me and [former colleagues] Judy McGrath and Doug Herzog and Jason Hirschhorn just before they made the purchase. It was due diligence on their part. They were like, “You guys were there in the golden age. We don't know what's happened?” I said, “First of all, when they sawed the ‘music television' off the bottom of the logo, they lost me.' But all the music people had left and MTV didn't have any real value as a music brand. I don't know if you can resurrect it, but I think you might be able to.

	











	One, they have a huge library of shows. The Unpluggeds and some of the reality shows were pretty good. They also have a huge library of music videos and MTV News — everything that happened from 1980 on. So, why couldn't you do some kind of digital curation thing? Anyway, I'm really happy to see Ellison there. I mean, if someone was going to buy Paramount, the Ellisons got my vote.


Why is that?


	He loves movies. He can make movies. He's proved himself, and he's got a lot of money. If a private equity company came in there, they'd sell it for parts, and it would disappear. Ellison will have to go through some rough times now. They have to cut costs. But my hope is that they'll be able to attract more smart, creative folks to take it to a new level. And the options were not good for anything else as far as I could see.


What did the new leadership team ask of you?


	It was like, “If you were me, what would you do?” But first, they laid out the situation as they saw it. “We're going to have to face some tough cuts. But we're buying this company, we don't want to spin it out into one of these Shit Cos., as people call them. We'd like to see if we could resurrect [the brands], and what ideas do you have?” And yeah, they're asking a bunch of older people how to make it a cool, fun place to work and have a good business plan that people could line up and salute — but at least we've been there. Of course, the answer is you really should tap into young kids and find someone like John Mayer. He has this amazing channel on Sirius.

	











John Mayer is approaching 50 …


	But he's still young, and he could still have ideas. And he's better at directing some 20-year-olds than we would be!


Looking out at the entertainment landscape, who's doing a good job right now?


	I admire Bob Iger, like everyone. I love the folks at Fox Searchlight. They've still got spunk. They still find the right thing. Those guys are curators. I love A24, they find something with some edge, and they're able to mainstream it in their own specialty-label way.


You famously got fired by Sumner for not buying Myspace. Can you describe the emotional whiplash that must have occurred between your firing and the flash mob of sorts that occurred in the lobby as you exited?


	I was humiliated and depressed. I was leaving this thing that I loved, and we were just getting going. I'd seen him fire both Mel Karmazin, who was wonderful, and Frank Biondi, who was fantastic, for doing their jobs. They were making smart moves, and they were getting credit. So, I packed up and I thought I'd just sneak out, get a taxi and go home. Then the elevator door opened and I couldn't believe it. It was packed, and it was a big lobby, and they started chanting my name. I mean, they followed me out the door. “Tom! Tom! Tom!”


What was going through your head at the time?


	Everything was in slow-mo. I started to well up — all the people I love, they were all there and touching me. It was like I was some rock star. And then they aired it on CNBC. I guess it was validation. Because I'd had imposter syndrome, and I'd thought, “Oh fuck. They finally busted me. I've been faking it all these years, and now I've been caught and I'm going to leave in disgrace.” Then all of a sudden you get this hero's sendoff, and it was extraordinary. It was probably one of the greatest moments of my life.

	











You'd mentioned in the book that one of the first people you heard from was Tom Cruise, whom Redstone claimed he had fired as well.


	And Tom didn't even work there! Yeah, he called up, and I had a good relationship with Tom. He's a lively, friendly guy and he was the backbone of Viacom, and then he's getting humiliated by Redstone for no good reason. [In 2006, Paramount Pictures terminated its 14-year relationship with Cruise over his offscreen behavior, notably the couch-jumping incident on Oprah.] So, we both just laughed. And Tom was very kind, he said, “I'm sorry to see you go,” and I think he was sincere.


You were approached about a lot of different traditional CEO jobs after that but opted to take none of them. How come?


	I didn't know at first. I took my friends and my wife on the “Tom Got Fired” tour to Burma. It's a beautiful place, and there was no media there. At the time, I had my lawyer saying, “You better get another job right away or you're going to be gone.” It was Bob Pittman who said, “You're in no condition to make a decision right now. Go away and clear your head, and if you come back, I'll give you an office in my new place and you can figure out what you're going to do.” Bob gave me the permission to go and I did, I got clarity. I realized, I'd done this for 26 years, why not do a portfolio of things next?


	I was never into the job for money. I mean, I got a nice goodbye [$84.8 million, to be precise], but I figured I don't need to be grafted on top of a company like Yahoo that I didn't build and had no connection with. So, I went back to Afghanistan, which was exhilarating and meaningful because the networks there were all about socially connecting the Afghans to the world and to each other, gender equality, all these things that you sort of believe in. And I worked with Oprah. I went in with Vice. I was on the DreamWorks board. It was a good mix.

	











In many ways, your involvement as an investor in and adviser to Vice legitimized the company and its larger-than-life leader, Shane Smith. You've said that he'd call you his mentor, but he was a difficult protégé. Is that right?


	Oh, Shane's his own man. No one's going to be a mentor to Shane. I got to say, I love him, still. He could sell ice to the Eskimos, that guy. And the HBO show that we did was exhilarating. We were going everywhere, doing everything, and Shane was great at piecing these stories together. That was really fun for me. They were building their own little MTV Networks. But at the end of the day, they ran into the same head-on winds that the cable networks did, which was, even though they were digital, all the digital publishers ended up following the cable networks because Google and Facebook were taking, like, 90 percent of the money. They're like vacuum cleaners.


Presumably there was advice you were giving Shane that he wasn't taking?


	Yeah. I said, “You sure you want to start a TV network? They're kind of going out of style, these linear networks.” But he was always on a quest for a bigger deal and more money. And he'd convinced all these people to partake, and he was making good stuff, it just wasn't profitable enough, particularly when the revenue started to drop. But I had a lot of fun with him. And I'd run into him everywhere. He liked all the edgy places.

	











Are you two still in touch?


	I'll still get a text or two. They come at, like, 5 in the morning: “Hey, buddy. I love you.” And you go, “Oh, it's Shane.”


When Paramount Pictures came under your purview, you'd go to Bob Daly's home in Bel-Air a few times a week and, as you put it, you became a student at the Bob Daly Film School. I'm curious what the Tom Freston leadership school curriculum would entail?


	I'd have to be a professor emeritus at this point. But I'd try to teach people that it's about risk-taking — while still keeping your costs under control. So, let's not get ahead of your skis, but take risks. Look to the edges. I was always a proponent of operating out of the mainstream. I don't want to be going head-to-head with all the major studios or all the big cable networks. If I could be No. 1 in some category over on the left here, I'm removing myself as much as possible from the forces of supply and demand. And then fill it with a creative group of people and make it a place that they want to come to work and where their work would be noticed and rewarded. Is that still possible today? I hope so.


Beyond Ellison and Shell, how often are people still calling you for advice these days?


	Oh, it's decreasing at an increasing rate. (Laughs.)


You don't get calls from the Zaslavs of the world?


	Oh, I speak to Zaz. He and I kind of came up together, and now he's the man.

	











What would you do if you were him?


	I guess you sell [Warner Bros.] for the highest price. I got to give credit to David, though. He went out to Hollywood, and he indicated a love for the form and actually made real friends like Spielberg out there. That's a hard cult to break into, and he did it.


I imagine in writing this, you thought a lot about your own legacy. Where did you land?


	I think I did some good, and I had an innovative, creative life. I certainly took a lot of left-hand turns, and if there's a lesson to teach younger people, it's that you don't have to stay on the straight and narrow, particularly when you're young. Travel is the best classroom, so get out in the world and look around. You see too many kids today, they get out of school and a week later they're working at Goldman Sachs or wherever, and they're having panic attacks and depression episodes. It doesn't have to be that way. You can improvise your own life. I'd like to be an example of someone who did that and it paid off.

With the last few major films of 2025 set to open over the coming weeks, it's already time to start looking ahead to the biggest releases of 2026. And they don't get much bigger than “Project Hail Mary.” 

The latest directorial effort from Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who have found box office gold in both the animation and live-action spaces, stars Ryan Gosling as a scientist who forgets his own identity after being launched into space on a dangerous mission and has to figure out who he is in time to save humanity. The film is based on “The Martian” author Andy Weir's bestselling 2021 novel of the same name, with “The Martian” screenwriter Drew Goddard once again adapting Weir's work for the big screen. If you tried to engineer a blockbuster hit in a laboratory, you'd be hard-pressed to start with stronger components.

An official synopsis for the film reads: “Science teacher Ryland Grace (Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone.” 

 










In addition to Gosling, the film stars Sandra Hüller, Lionel Boyce, Ken Leung, Milana Vayntrub, and James Ortiz.

2026 is shaping up to be a big year for sci-fi lovers, as “Project Hail Mary” will be joined by other tentpole releases including Jon Favreau's “The Mandalorian and Grogu,” which will be the first theatrical “Star Wars” movie since 2019, and Steven Spielberg's untitled UFO movie starring Josh O'Connor and Emily Blunt. 

And if fans enjoy seeing Gosling in outer space, they won't have to wait long for his next intergalactic adventure. Gosling also stars in Shawn Levy's “Star Wars: Starfighter,” which is set to hit theaters in May 2027. 

An Amazon MGM Studios release, “Project Hail Mary” opens in theaters on March 20, 2026. Watch the second trailer below.

Exploration fuels many of humanity's most important scientific and artistic pursuits. But in Lav Diaz‘s decidedly unromantic “Magellan,” the promise of the horizon can't save a crew in peril from the corrupt passion of the man and mission keeping them at sea. 

Expected in theaters on January 9, Diaz's new film debuted earlier this year at Cannes, where it gained critical acclaim for its fearless consideration of colonialism. Star Gael García Bernal delivers a layered performance amid an inventive style that recalls fine art from the Renaissance seen through a detached cinematic language closer to a crime scene.

 










With a film career spanning from “Y Tu Mamá También” to “Coco,” actor García Bernal comes equipped with a lifetime of thespian paints at his disposal — aiming to render a complex portrait of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. The 16th-century adventurer, who first circumnavigated the globe by sea in 1522, wavers beneath the pressure of his pursuit, ultimately leading his men to mutiny and madness on the Malay Archipelago. The review from IndieWire contributor Josh Slater-Williams described the film as both an “atypical biopic” and a deconstruction of the Magellan most people know.

García Bernal's performance has been effusively praised for its challenging nuance, a feat made all the more impressive by Diaz's confrontational approach to the historic material. Rarely portraying the active motions of mass murder, “Magellan” forces audiences to instead linger in “the constant presence of dead bodies within the frame,” wrote Slater-Williams for IndieWire. In the trailer, the filmmaker — also known for “Nortre, the End of History” (2013), “From What Is Before” (2014), and more — ushers viewers into an epic retelling that's seemingly designed to critique the timeless of instinct greed by forcing viewers to sit with the permanence of Magellan's massacres in their immediate aftermath.

Diaz's features are infamous for their extraordinary length, and although “Magellan” clocks in at roughly two hours and 40 minutes at Cannes, there's reportedly a nine-hour version of the film that could be on the way, drawing out Diaz's central thesis about the normalization of violence and the profoundly flawed men who charted human history to an even more agonizing point. Of course, that stands in stark contrast to García Bernal's generally friendly demeanor and the unusual quip Diaz made at the 2025 New York Film Festival about selecting him for the “Magellan” cast.

 










The writer/director reportedly confused his Filipino translator at Lincoln Center when he used an elaborate sex metaphor to bring festival attendees inside the addition of García Bernal to his film. That cocksure casualness reflects not only Diaz's famous sense of humor (you know, assuming the idea to bring García Bernal on board didn't actually occur to him and producers Albert Serra and Joaquim Sapinho during sex) as well as the breezy assuredness you'd need to seriously consider an extended cut longer than the typical workday. 

The first promo for Diaz's “Magellan” bears a sense of self the real man may not have, while still maintaining a dispassionate POV and tonal omnipresence essential to commingling truth and terror.

Back in 2019, I interviewed Rian Johnson at the Toronto International Film Festival the morning after the world premiere of the first “Knives Out.” This somehow seems both like not that long ago and impossibly ancient history, all at the same time.

But it was a time in which Johnson was still regularly asked what his three upcoming “Star Wars” movies were going to be about. I, too, am guilty of this. But in my defense, back then, “making ‘Star Wars' movies” sure seemed like it was going to become Rian Johnson's thing. And now here was this quirky little mystery movie he filmed in-between.

 










It was during this interview, watching Johnson's face light up every time he discussed the prospect of more “Knives Out” movies and watching his face drop every time “Star Wars” was mentioned that it hit me. Ohhhhh, right, these are what he wants to be his “thing.” To the point that I even asked him if there was a future in which he's best known for making murder mysteries and that it's kind of weird he did one “Star Wars” movie. He responded, “I would be so thrilled.”

“Knives Out,” the little quirky mystery movie, would go on to gross over $300 million at the box office and lead to a reported $450 million deal with Netflix for two sequels. So, yeah, we do basically live in that future now on the eve of Johnson's third “Knives Out” film, “Wake Up Dead Man.” 

Daniel Craig is back as Benoit Blanc and, well, it's probably best to stop right there as far as plot descriptions go. All you basically need to know is Josh O'Connor plays a conflicted priest named Jud Duplenticy, there's a murder at his church, and Benoit Blanc must, once again, use his wits (and impeccable comedic timing) to solve the case. As with the past entries, an all-star cast makes up our list of suspects and eccentric weirdos, including Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Andrew Scott, Mila Kunis, Kerry Washington, Jeremy Renner, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack, Jeffrey Wright, and Thomas Haden Church. 

But the tone of “Wake Up Dead Man” is considerably different than the one of its predecessor, “Glass Onion.” Johnson is keenly aware of this, even bracing the crowd before its own TIFF premiere that it may not be what they are expecting. But, as Johnson says, these movies reflect the tone of the time and right now, yeah, with current events what they are, he's feeling pretty angry.

 










Ahead, Johnson explores what the future might look like for Benoit Blanc and if there's a world in which the title character could be played by anyone other than Daniel Craig. Also, he reveals there almost was a world in which quite a few people almost played Benoit when they thought Craig wasn't available. Also, Johnson gives us his dream casting coup for the fourth installment with a direct plea to this Oscar winning actor. (Also, there's probably a lot more talk about the 1993 film “Sliver” than you're probably expecting.)

The following interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity. 

IndieWire: I noticed when you introduced “Glass Onion” at its TIFF premiere, it was just a quick, “let's watch the fucking movie!,” but with “Wake Up Dead Man,” I wouldn't say you're worried, but you did give a longer explanation that this might not be the movie audiences are expecting.

Rian Johnson: Yeah, not worried. And this is also part of the reason why I was excited to make the third movie right away. I think when you have two films in a series, people can chart, tonally, where those are at draw a line through them and assume that's where the series is going. So part of the fun of it was, let's break that pattern for people. These movies can be whatever they need to be, tonally. So, I'm aware it's a big change from “Glass Onion” and I wanted to kinda set the stage a little bit for people.

 










Right, normally the second movie is the darker film.

These movies are very much a reaction to the world. I wrote the second movie during lockdown, so the notion of a big fun vacation movie would be not only a fun thing to shoot but people might just be in to at that moment. So that's maybe where that came from. And right now it feels a little darker.

So is this you being in an angrier headspace so you made an angrier movie?

Well, I don't know. For me, there's something about… I can't sit down to write unless I'm angry about something. Even on the first two that were a maybe a little lighter in tone…

The second one was pretty scathing about tech bros.

Yeah, so for me, anger is one of the things you kind of have to have to be motivated to sit down to write something. With this one, it's all stuff I care very deeply about. There's the stuff I'm angry about and there's the stuff I feel passionate about that the world actually desperately needs more of right now. So, I don't know, man, I think that's why I was a lot more nervous [at the “Wake Up Dead Man” premiere] then I was on “Glass Onion” before showing it. It's just more personal in a lot of ways for me. These are big entertainment, and it always feels weird saying this, but these are, for me, incredibly personal movies.

 










So basically what you were trying to convey was, I have something to say here.

Yeah, hopefully not in “a message” way, but for me it's very much about the character of Blanc and the character of Jud, which is Josh O'Connor's character….

It's a film dealing directly with politics and religion.

Yeah, absolutely. And that dialogue between them, I have both of those guys inside me. I have both of those halves of me, basically. And to let those two halves talk was what was personal about the movie, I guess. Just meaning that it's not important to me because I had a message to get across, God forbid. But that it's a topic I really care about and I wanted to do a movie that was both an entertainment, but took topic seriously.

When we spoke for the first “Knives Out,” I kind of said it half-jokingly, but I mentioned it seemed like you just wanted to make these the rest of your career. You were dead serious about even the possibility of making more of these. Well, here we are.

I feel the exact same way. Especially after working with the past two casts. It's heaven. But the thing I'm writing now is not one of these movies. It's an original, totally different thing. So I won't just be making these. But if Daniel and I feel we are able to figure out a different thing to talk about, or approach, or makes it scary in the right way for us, I would be thrilled to keep making these movies.

 










I'm not using this reference because Daniel Craig played this character, but is Benoit Blanc like James Bond for you in which different actors could play him if Daniel doesn't want to do it anymore? Or is he Indiana Jones where Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones? 

He's Indy. He's Daniel doing it.

I ask because, obviously, many people have played Hercule Poirot.

Yeah, totally. For me, personally, these movies are working with Daniel. It's a partnership. And the instant either one of us feels even slightly like not doing it, we'll stop doing it.

Is it satisfying for you how happy he seems?

Oh, God, it's my favorite thing.

Famously, he was not always thrilled about playing James. He certainly doesn't say that about Benoit.

Like I said, Daniel is a partner in these things. We're in the boat together in this thing. I think the pressure we both put on ourselves is trying to do right by the other one. And that's a really good partnership. If Daniel is happy, I'm happy.

Every movie, you have to build new rapport between him and a brand-new cast. Have you considered every bringing anyone else back from the prior films?

In terms of, “God, I'd love to work with that actor again?”

 










Yeah, maybe as a new character or the same character?

Edward Norton kept joking how he's going to come out with a big moustache.

I get the feeling he'd love to do that.

He would do it. On one hand, I would do that in a heartbeat. On the other hand, I love working with actors so much. There are so many actors I haven't worked with I want to work with. And that's one of the real treats of making these movies is you get to experience new actors and these big casts. At the same time, I'd be lying if I didn't say: one of the great things about doing these movies is I get to know these actors so, when I'm writing original stuff now, that are not these movies, of course I have everyone in mind for it.

Is there someone you've gone to for every one of these movies who has said no?

Well… no, there's nobody who is like the white whale. But, it's a casting process for each of them. It may seem, from the outside, with these movies we just get our pick of the litter. It's not the case. The reality is it's a casting process and you're going after movie stars who have busy schedules and you get a yes or no, but at the end of the day you make the movie and you can't imagine anyone else in the part.

Was Daniel Craig always going to be Benoit?
 










When we were first trying to get “Knives Out” made, Daniel wasn't available. He was doing the Bond movies. He was my first choice for it, but he was a hard “not available” because he was on the Bond movies. So, we went to other people for it. We got a bunch of “no”s about Benoit Blanc.

Wait, really?

Yeah. There's an alternate universe, I'm not going to tell you the people we went to.

OK, let me ask this then: Have you run into any of those people you asked who said no who are now like, “Yeah I should have done that”?

No. I mean, this is how it works…

Right, but, maybe you're at a party and someone is like, “Man, I didn't know.” No one has expressed regrets?

I don't know. I mean, I don't think any of these people are tearing their hair out at all.

Right, but it's pretty hard to create new IP these days and you created a brand new character who has been in three movies now.

I'll reiterate that the instant there was some delay with the Bond movie and Daniel had a window, the instant he became available, I leapt. Thank God. Thank God Daniel got it. And the moment Daniel read the script and said yes, it was six weeks until we were shooting. So the whole movie was put together really, really quickly. Which, actually, with casting helps. It's not, can you save us a slot six months from now? And then maybe they get a Marvel movie or something. It's, can you come to Boston next week?

 










You didn't use the U2 song, “Wake Up Dead Man.”

No.

You did use “Glass Onion” by The Beatles in the second movie.

I did, yes.

No offense to Bono, but probably not the same cinematic impact as “Glass Onion.”

And probably a little cheaper. I think “Pop” is a very underrated album actually. I mean, the phrase “wake up dead man” I actually know from an old folk ballad and Pete Seger sang on that album.

Played last year by Edward Norton.

Full circle. Every time.

What further adventures do you envision for Benoit?

I don't know? The thing is, it really is true that if you're a fan of the whodunnit genre, you're aware of how broad a spectrum the mystery movie can be.

I saw “Green for Danger” because you programmed it at the Paris Theater in NYC. I had never even heard of this movie…

It's great! It's a medical mystery.

Right, set during World War II. And the ending is truly insane and hilarious.

It's perfect. It's so good! But I don't know, like I said, the thing I'm going to do next is an original…

You've brought this up more than once now. Do you want me to ask about it? What is it? I just assumed you wouldn't tell me anything.

Oh, no no.

I'm like, are these hints that he wants me to ask about this new original project?
 










They are not. They are not at all. I'm still writing it. But that's just to say, I hesitate to call it an approach, but it's really kind of what's in the air right now and what feels exciting in the moment. That's all to say, when it's time to think about doing another one of these, that will be the time to think, OK, what seems exciting in the moment?

A volcano.

A volcano.

You read it here first.

Benoit flying into a volcano. Actually, do you know the story? When my wife Karina [Longworth], when she was researching Erotic ‘90s, her podcast season, the movie “Sliver” originally ended with a volcano. It originally ended with William Baldwin flying Sharon Stone in a helicopter into a volcano.

What?

Look it up. You heard it here first.

So in honor of the original ending of “Sliver,” we might see Benoit Blanc fly a helicopter into a volcano.

I'm just saying, who knows? I'm 90 percent sure it's “Sliver,” but now watch it be “Jade.”

Okay, back to this new thing you are writing. Can you even say the genre?

I'd call it a paranoid thriller. A ‘70s paranoid thriller, sort of. With a sci-fi twinge. I'm still thinking about it but I'm really excited about it.

How many more do you have left with Netflix?
 










This was it. The deal was for two.

Do they want more?

We'll have to have those conversations with them … we can talk more about “Sliver” if you want.

Obviously we can't get into spoilers…

For “Sliver”?

Yes. There will be no “Sliver” spoilers here today.

I'm always tempted to do a joke at Q&As where I say, “So-and-so is the killer,” but then even joking about it means that that person isn't the killer.

OK, I know you said there's no “white whale” of someone you've gone to and can't get, let's pretend, at this point, anyone you'd ask would say “yes” to being in the next movie. Who would you want?

There are so many great actors I'd like to work with. But, yes, if you're reading this, Meryl Streep, I feel like you'd slot into a murder mystery very well.

They did finally get her to appear on “SNL.”

If Lorne can do it, then, goddamn, so can we.

“Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” opens in select theaters on Wednesday, November 26 before streaming on Netflix on Friday, December 12.

T

he bird man is at his desk, vaping and working the phone. Fly traps coated with insects dangle from the ceiling. Tigers and lions pace fenced enclosures in the backyard. Tilting in his swivel chair — legs crossed, plaid short-sleeve shirt unbuttoned to the chest, reading glasses propped on his balding head — Gideon Fourie takes a long drag on his blue vape and begins to tell me how he became one of South Africa's leading parrot traders. 


	“The African grey is the best talking and friendly [sic] bird in the world,” Fourie says, rolling the R's in his heavily Afrikaans-­inflected English. He swats a tabby cat off the brown leather sofa where I'm sitting in his home office in Nigel, a small gold-mining town about 40 miles southeast of Johannesburg. On this sweaty February day in the Southern Hemisphere, he's speaking above the whir of an oscillating floor fan and the drone of Fox News. He smiles: “Yes, that's the popular one.” 


	Fourie's involvement in the animal trade has deep roots. As a boy living in Rustenburg, he helped out on his parents' ostrich farm and tannery, which turned skins from springbok antelope and other animals into rugs, hats, purses, wallets, and throw pillows. Later, after working for the family business selling ostriches to the U.S. and Taiwan, he joined the South African Air Force, where he became a certified metalworking instructor before getting into politics as a town counselor in Boksburg.


	A framed cover of The Economist on the wall shows a thirtysomething Fourie and his toddler Phillipus, whom he calls Billy, at a political rally for the far-right, white-­supremacist, neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) paramilitary organization. Blond little Billy wears an olive-green button-down shirt with a patch representing the Vierkleur, the flag of the former Boer-led South African Republic, and holds in his pudgy hands a flag emblazoned with the AWB's swastika-­like symbol.

	











	In the early 1990s, when South Africa began transitioning to democracy, Fourie got out of politics — “too many [sic] corruption,” he says. He returned to his family roots in the animal industry after a friend in Taiwan asked him to acquire some African grey parrots for the pet trade. What started as a single shipment soon grew into a sprawling 30-year business shipping tens of thousands of African greys globally — along with all sorts of other exotic birds and animals. It has also landed Fourie on the wrong side of the law — two years ago, he was convicted of smuggling endangered parrots and monkeys out of Johannesburg. (He doesn't want to talk about that.) 

	











	African grey parrots — roughly the size of a pigeon, with sleek grey bodies and crimson tail feathers — are the great apes of the bird world. Their brain is the size of a walnut, but they have the intelligence of young children and are renowned for their freakish ability to mimic human speech, traits that make them popular pets and TikTok superstars crooning opera, whistling, and cursing “Fuck you!”

	I've spent too many hours scrolling videos of grey parrots doing everything from singing “Who let the birds out!” to playing soccer and beating Harvard students on memory tests. A grey parrot named Bud helped solve his owner's murder by repeating the last words the man said to his wife during a fatal ­argument: “Don't fucking shoot!” Einstein knows more than 200 words and sounds, and even has her own TED talk. Gizmo tells Siri to set a timer for “chirp, chirp” and regularly asks his owners, “Whatcha doing?” — punctuated by kissy noises and “I love you's.” Bailey, a grey in Alabama with a Southern twang, likes to ask “Where's the whiskey?” and “Want a beer?”

	But there's a dark side to the hilarious parrot reels. Animal-welfare activists say the treatment of parrots raised for the pet trade is cruel and inhumane and should be abolished. Many parrots come from commercial farms — essentially bird mills — with rows of hundreds of caged breeding pairs pumping out chicks that are sold and shipped often thousands of miles in cramped wooden boxes. The rising demand for pet African grey ­parrots and the price for a single bird — as much as $7,000 — drive rampant poaching in the forests of West and Central Africa. An estimated 1.3 million wild African greys were traded from 1975 to 2015, but the true number taken was likely far higher — possibly up to 3 million — because most die in transit. Alarmed by the trend, in 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) designated African greys as “endangered” — at risk of imminent extinction.


	The underground market for greys often operates on the same digital platforms where performing parrots draw millions of followers. Illicit trading is difficult to track: Financial transactions take place through encrypted messaging apps, closed social media groups, and hidden corners of the internet, where sellers use vague language and coded messages to avoid detection. The illegal wildlife trade is one of the most profitable criminal enterprises, alongside guns, drugs, and human trafficking, and is often run by the same crime syndicates. But law enforcement is more focused on those other crimes — animal smuggling is a low priority, with minimal penalties. “It's high reward and low risk,” says Ian Guildford, an investigator with the U.K. National Wildlife Crime Unit.  


	To understand the crisis facing African grey parrots, I traveled from poaching hot spots in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the twilight chatter of their flocks is growing quiet, to South Africa, the world's largest exporter of captive-bred African greys. Wildlife-crime investigators have long suspected that birds snatched from the wild are laundered through the country's legal export channels. Searching for clues, I tracked dozens of leads on the ground and teamed up with a Colorado scientist and a retired South African environmental-­law-enforcement agent to test if an innovative forensic technique — analyzing parrots' gut microbes — could reveal whether some parrot exporters are trafficking poached birds. In the glitzy United Arab Emirates, a major marketplace for greys, I visited dozens of pet shops catering to families who want their own talking bird. And in a Florida living room, I met an African grey who is trending on YouTube.

	











	Parrot reels might seem benign, says Rowan Martin, director of the nonprofit World Parrot Trust's Africa conservation program, but the posts are “playing a central role in opening up vast new markets for exotic wildlife.” Openings that traders like Fourie are ready to seize upon.


	Apollo's claws dig into my scalp as he finds his balance after climbing up from my shoulder. Just a pound of feathers and beak, he peers down at me with curious eyes, intrigued by the new visitor taking a selfie with him. Apollo belongs to Dalton and Tori Mason, a YouTube couple in their mid-twenties who live in St. Petersburg, Florida. They bought him from a local pet store as an eight-month-old in 2020 with plans to make him the star of a profit-making YouTube channel. “Talking animals, that's one of the biggest fantasy sort of genre tropes ever,” Dalton says. “It would a hundred percent work.”


	And it has. Apollo first said “hello,” and then “fresh water,” delighting fans when the couple started posting videos in 2021. He now knows about 50 words, has around 3 million followers on TikTok, and a Guinness World Record for the most items identified by a parrot in three minutes: 12, including “book,” “bug,” and “sock.” 


	“Want a snack,” Apollo says after Dalton scoops him from my head. “Earn a snack.”


	This means he's ready to work, Dalton says.


	“Two questions — you get a snack,” Dalton instructs. He holds out a copy of a famous parrot researcher's memoir and asks the bird, “What's this called?” 

	











	Apollo answers, “Book.”  


	“Yes, book,” Dalton replies, following with “What's the book made of?”


	“Paper,” Apollo answers.


	“Yes, good job,” Dalton says. “Here's a pistachio.” 


	Between quizzes, Apollo practices his repertoire: “Block … rock … bottle … doo doo! … Want a pistache?” and whistles “Funkytown” while the Masons recount their journey to YouTube fame and their future plans.


	Revenue from social media advertising and merch — T-shirts, hoodies, pint glasses, coffee mugs — has allowed Dalton, who previously sold glassware on eBay, and Tori, a drugstore cashier, to quit their jobs. They estimate that combined they make about $120,000 a year, and they recently moved into a bigger rental house. Videos in which they ask Apollo questions such as “What color?” are the biggest moneymakers, they say, often attracting millions of views. They hope one day to earn enough money from their videos to buy a mansion where Apollo will have lots of space to fly freely. (They'll live in the mother-in-law suite, Tori jokes.)


	Apollo may have shot to fame thanks to social media, but talking birds have been popular since way before TikTok. Queen Victoria had several grey parrots as pets who spoke French, told jokes, and sang, “God Save the Queen.” U.S. President Andrew Jackson owned a grey named Poll that reportedly squawked and cursed at his funeral. 


	Animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg bought a year-old African grey named Alex at Noah's Ark pet store near Chicago's O'Hare Airport in the late 1970s, launching her exploration into a new field of research that reshaped our understanding of animal intelligence and communication. In the previous decade, researchers had taught apes to use sign language to convey their thoughts and feelings, revealing that nonhuman primates are capable of grasping complex concepts, forming sentences, even initiating conversations. Pepperberg wanted to know if a bird, with a very different brain, might also be capable of such sophisticated learning. 

“Parrot reels are playing a central role in opening up new markets for exotic wildlife.”


	Her studies with Alex over the next three decades, detailed in her book Alex & Me, ­redefined the meaning of “bird brain.” She found that Alex could use more than a hundred words, identify colors and shapes, understand forms of matter — metal, wood, glass — and grasp abstract concepts such as “same” and “different.” Remarkably, he understood the concept of zero, something that baffles most humans younger than four. Pepperberg demonstrated that Alex could use language to answer questions, share his desires, joke, even express frustration and regret. Alex once asked a woman he'd met if she'd like a nut or some corn. When she said, “No, thank you,” he replied, “Well, what do you want?” Another time, after he shredded a 20-page grant proposal Pepperberg had spent weeks writing on an electric typewriter, she yelled, “How could you do such a thing, Alex?” He surprised her with the words “I'm sorry.” 


	The first time Alex noticed himself in a mirror, he cocked his head and said, “What's that?” 


	“That's you. You're a parrot,” replied Pepperberg's student Kathy Davidson, who was looking after him that day.


	Alex looked into the mirror and asked, “What color?”

	











	“Grey,” Davidson replied. “You're a grey parrot, Alex.”


	This exchange, though brief, had huge significance. Alex's questions suggested that he not only recognized his reflection — a sign of self-awareness long considered to be a uniquely human trait — but also that he was curious about his appearance.


	Alex and other African grey parrots have evolved to have a complex awareness of their world, Pepperberg tells me. Their “huge memory” allows them to find food in sprawling forests where they fly up to 35 miles a day, to remember social dynamics within their flock, and to communicate through songs and vocalizations.


	Pepperberg's work with Alex was cut short. He died in 2007 at 31 — barely middle-aged for an animal that can live up to 80 years. A necropsy showed no discernible cause of death, but it was later determined that Alex likely suffered a fatal arrhythmia, heart attack, or stroke. His last words to Pepperberg were the same as always at bedtime: “You be good. I love you.”


	Pepperberg received an outpouring of support and condolences. One New England man who owned an African grey parrot wrote that he was so devastated that he had to leave work early: “My eyes have been welling up at various points throughout the day.”


	Pepperberg still hears from people wanting a bird just like Alex. But, she says, most of them are unprepared for the commitment of caring for “a creature with the intellectual capacity of a six- to eight-year-old, the personality of a two-year-old — I want what I want, when I want it, and what's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine! — a beak like a Swiss Army Knife, and a voice like a klaxon.” Parrots aren't usually compatible with people who have long workdays at the office, kids, and the endless activities that come with them, she says. Her advice to most would-be buyers: “Get a picture of a parrot, paste it on the wall, and just look at it.”


	The Masons realize that videos of parrots like Apollo doing extraordinary things inspire online viewers all over the world to buy their own parrots. But they see a greater good in teaching people about parrot cognition because it can help make the case that birds, just like cats and dogs, deserve animal-welfare protections.

“Live animals are a very risky business — it's not like selling shoes. your shoe cannot die.”


	Critics say that argument is misguided — animals that fly shouldn't spend their lives in cages. “Every cell in a parrot's body was engineered for flight,” says Karen Windsor, the executive director of Foster Parrots, a Rhode Island nonprofit dedicated to rescuing unwanted and abused parrots. “Their hearts and lungs were designed for an enormous level of cardiovascular activity. Air sacs under their skin act like bellows, pumping abundant oxygen into their lungs quickly. Their eyes, their hollow bones, and, of course, their feathers are all designed for a relationship with the wind and sky.”


	That's why caged parrots are prone to atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke, Windsor says. Healthy greys often outlive their human companions, suffering anxiety and depression when they suddenly find themselves without their person. “You get a parrot when you're 40, and it seems like a good idea, but by the time you're 80, that bird's just middle-aged,” Windsor says. It's one reason sanctuaries like hers are experiencing a surge of surrendered African greys. 


	Another is buyer's remorse. “Everybody wants an Alex,” and “there are so many ­African grey stars on social media,” she says. But often the birds aren't as “cuddly” as the buyer anticipated. “Some are prone to phobias and self-destructive behaviors like [feather] plucking.”

	











	Windsor says parrot lovers should consider adopting a bird if they think they can provide a lasting home. “There are so many parrots — just like cats and dogs — and the rescues are full. We're turning birds away because we can't fit them in.”


	Smaragda Louw thinks the entire commercial pet industry should be obliterated. Petite with shoulder-length grey hair, she's the founder of the South African nonprofit Ban Animal Trading. Wearing a long powder-blue tunic, she meets me at her home on a lush hillside of manicured gardens in Johannesburg. Her organization targets a wide range of animal industries, from “canned” trophy hunting — sport shooting of confined animals — and circuses to scientific laboratories, operations smuggling lion bones for traditional Chinese medicine, and the trade in exotic animals for pets.


	In Louw's study — decorated with a giant ceramic bunny, glowing lanterns, a wall of wooden bookcases, and a fluffy dog bed for her rescue, Bella — are stacks of documents detailing thousands of birds shipped by parrot exporters. She enters the reams of information into a database and stores the hard copies in the room's crammed walk-in closet. The numbers of birds exported legally are “breathtaking,” she says. Last year, South Africans legally shipped about 60,000 African greys. Louw says the actual number is likely higher than reported because traffickers use tricks to evade the authorities: stashing ­additional birds in hidden compartments, altering permits (sometimes reusing them multiple times), misidentifying endangered species as common, and bribing airport workers and authorities. 


	Two years ago, Louw sat for an interview with the South African investigative-journalism television series Carte Blanche. The report was about a shipment of live lions shipped to a notorious zoo in Laos suspected of being involved with the lion-bone trade. Fourie and his business partner, Edward Coet­zer, were identified as likely playing a role in the lions' export, though they deny any wrongdoing.


	Fourie had been of interest to Louw for years. In 2010, she learned he was under investigation over the deaths of 730 wild African grey parrots on a flight from Johannesburg to Durban. Authorities traced them to Byart Birds, a company owned by businessman Martin Byart. They suspected that the shipment included parrots seized from ­trappers and sent to Lwiro Sanctuary, in eastern DRC, for rehabilitation and eventual release back into the wild. Army and government officials allegedly confiscated the birds at gunpoint, threatening the sanctuary's director. The parrots then vanished, likely back into the pet trade.


	Fast forward to Dec. 21, 2018, when Fourie was apprehended for smuggling animals at Johannesburg's O.R. Tambo International Airport. Officials found in his cargo undeclared endangered species: two cockatoos, eight Amazon parrots, a capuchin monkey, and two small marmosets. He couldn't produce the permits for those animals. As a result, environmental-law-enforcement agents, the Green Scorpions, seized the shipment, valued at about $36,000.

	











	Fourie agreed in a plea agreement in 2023 to pay a fine of roughly $4,700 and received a suspended five-year prison sentence on condition he stay out of trouble. He was banned from exporting or importing any endangered wildlife until 2028. It infuriates Louw that he's still in business. “This is a known bird trafficker,” she says, shaking her fist. “He was caught red-handed.” 


	Louw says her analysis of the export data shows systemic fraud and corruption within South Africa's grey parrot industry. She has found shipments being sent to fake addresses, making it impossible for authorities to track the parrot supply chain. She has also discovered parrots without the required identification and exporters using permits multiple times, including a handful of companies Fourie runs with his partners. (Fourie denies he's used permits multiple times.)


	Fourie isn't the only member of his family who's been in trouble with the law, Louw says, her face lit by the glow of the computer screen as we scan her seemingly endless database. Back in 2007, customs officials at New Zealand's Auckland International Airport caught his son Billy, the boy pictured on his office wall, attempting to sneak 44 parrot eggs into the country in a specially made pocketed vest under his clothes. He pleaded guilty and was fined $20,000.  


	Louw says the Fouries' past involvement in wildlife smuggling should disqualify them from trading animals altogether. “You're a trafficker. You cannot export animals anymore legally, end of story,” she fumes. “But that's not how it works around here.”

“Regulators don't know the tricks of the trade. Only people involved know that.”


	During my meeting with Fourie at his home in Nigel, he spends more than an hour talking about his parrot business. “There's a lot of very, very big customers,” Fourie says, exhaling a cloud of vapor. “Most of our birds go to the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Jordan, Malaysia, Indonesia.”


	Pet buyers want young, impressionable birds (identifiable by their black-colored eyes rather than the light grey of adulthood), so they can form a close bond with their pets and get them talking early. At $440 a bird, Fourie's African greys sell faster than Taylor Swift tickets — he can't fill all his current orders. “If I can get 2,000 African grey babies, I can send it [sic] out tomorrow.” Transporting greys is more challenging than exporting other commodities, he says. “Live animals are a very risky business — it's not like selling shoes. Your shoe cannot die.” Nonetheless, Fourie says, grinning, it's “a good business.”


	Especially good until nearly a decade ago, when it was legal for breeders in South Africa, which has no wild African greys, and elsewhere to buy them from traders in countries such as Cameroon and the DRC. Wild birds are cheaper and easier to breed — captives take at least four years to become sexually mature, requiring expensive veterinary care, food, and shelter.


	Fourie scoffs at the concern about African greys disappearing in the wild. “They will never finish the greys in the Congo,” he says, because the country is so big. “There are some areas a human being has never been — that's how big it is.” And those jungles are full of “thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands of African greys.”

	











	In truth, nobody knows how many greys there are in the war-torn DRC — surveying has been too difficult — but scientists suspect the trend is consistent with other parts of Africa. Just decades ago, millions of African greys flew in dense flocks, prattling in high-pitched screams and whistles, but they now may number no more than a few hundred thousand, says the World Parrot Trust's Rowan Martin. In 2016, a study found grey parrot populations in the forests of Ghana had plummeted by 90 to 99 percent since the early 1990s. “It was unimaginable to people 50 years ago that this species could ever be threatened with extinction,” Martin says. “Yet wild populations have collapsed in our lifetime in no small part due to the human desire to keep birds in cages.”


	Conservationists concluded that there was no way to regulate a legal trade for the parrots in countries where borders are porous, ­governance is weak, and resources for wildlife protection are minimal. The IUCN's 2016 classification of African greys as endangered effectively banned all international commercial trade of wild-caught greys and tightened regulations for legal trading of captive-raised ones.  


	Fourie says suspicions that some wildlife businesses in South Africa are laundering wild African greys through legal export channels is nonsense. (And when later sent a long list of fact-checking questions, Fourie wrote off the whole premise of this investigation as “bullshit.”) Then, he adds, perhaps to deflect my attention, that he knows people in the DRC who are smuggling significant numbers of African greys directly to customers abroad. Fourie mentions Martin Byart and another Kinshasa trader, Alex Kalala, both of whom have lobbied to lift the ban on trading wild-caught parrots while maintaining that they are adhering to the 2016 prohibition. Fourie worked closely with them in the 1990s when he and his veterinarian traveled to the DRC several times to buy wild African greys to sell to breeders for their stock. But when Byart and Kalala established businesses in South Africa, Fourie says, “they cut us out.”


	The DRC's legal industry is finished because of the wild-parrot trade ban, Fourie says, waving his vape, so “they're smuggling to other countries.” (Byart and Kalala did not respond to questions about Fourie's accusations.) Fourie says he hasn't worked with Byart and Kalala for years, but they remain good friends and stay in contact. A few months after my visit with Fourie, he sends me — inexplicably, perhaps absentmindedly — a WhatsApp exchange with Kalala, in which Kalala says, “No I don't have a Grey at the moment! But I have many more another [sic] birds!”


	I ask Fourie if illegal activity with wild parrots in the DRC and other countries could put the legal parrot business in South Africa in jeopardy because regulations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) could be tightened further. “If they know about it,” he says, referring to officials at the CITES headquarters in Switzerland, but “CITES people are so stupid, and South African government people, they don't know the tricks of the trade. Only people involved know that.”

The scale of the burgeoning egg trade, says the World Parrot Trust, is “staggering.”


	Lately, live-bird traders like Fourie may be losing market share to a new illicit trade: smuggling eggs, which are easier to hide. A 35-year-old Thai man was convicted in January 2025 after he collected 72 parrot eggs from various bird farms around Johannesburg, tucked them inside a black thermal bag with two attached power banks, spirited them through South Africa's airport security, and flew to Hong Kong. Forensic testing revealed that more than half the eggs were African grey parrots, along with eggs from five species of macaws — collectively worth more than $153,000. No birds survived, and the man was sentenced to 39 months in prison. Two years earlier, a local Hong Kong man got 16 months in prison for importing 62 parrot eggs on a flight from Johannesburg. And this June, 11 people were indicted in the Taiwan Strait's Matsu Islands in connection with allegedly smuggling more than 4,500 parrot eggs to China. It appears that the eggs of African greys, colorful macaws, graceful cockatoos, and other exotic parrot species were smuggled from Thailand and Vietnam to be hatched in Taiwan, then loaded on ships to China. The scale of the burgeoning egg trade, says the World Parrot Trust's Martin, is “staggering.”


	Fourie takes me on a tour of his facility. He shows me through a glass door to one of two quarantine buildings, where his birds are monitored for signs of disease before export. We're met by deafening squawking, Raaaaak! Rak! There are eight rooms lined with small cages containing chicks — African greys, macaws, and cockatoos. Some are only four weeks old and still featherless. Others at almost 12 weeks approach the age when they'll be less likely to be sold as pets; older birds are bought for breeding. When the quarantine is finished (21 to 30 days, depending on the importing country), a veterinarian examines the birds. With a certificate of good health, they're cleared for shipment.

	











	 Fourie takes pride in cleanliness. The birds drink from bowls of filtered water. Their food dishes are freshly washed, and the floors beneath the cages have new wood chips. The building doesn't even smell that bad — there's a light aroma of cedar shavings and bird urine. He shows me around the rest of the property — the office where an employee is doing paperwork; the freezers where he keeps chicken meat to feed the tigers and lions; the quarantine areas where he can hold large animals like hippos, zebras, and giraffes; new showers and toilets for his workers; a row of large plywood shipping boxes punctured with breathing holes for transporting lions; small cats called servals that hiss when we come close; five lions on order from a private Thailand zoo in a fenced enclosure. “Look how fat they are,” Fourie says, taking a drag. “They've got a nice life.” When he approaches two tigers he keeps as pets, the cats purr and moan, rubbing against the enclosure. “Hallo, kat. Hallo, poeskat (pussycat),” Fourie coos, scratching their muzzles through the fencing.


	If I'm free this afternoon, he asks, he'll make arrangements for me to see his other quarantine facility, about 30 miles north in Boksburg, run by his business partner, Coet­zer. “Let me phone Eddie.”


	An hour later, I find Coetzer, a tall, lean 40-year-old with a sharp nose and short, ash-blond hair, sitting at a wooden desk in a room with terracotta-tile floors and walls covered with mounted zebra and antelope heads. Coet­zer says most clients order a mix of bird species, “but if we can't give them the African greys, they cancel the other birds as well.”


	He says they can buy greys legally only from any of the 200 or so registered South African breeders. Some have as many as a thousand pairs of African greys producing baby birds. When the chicks are a few weeks old, they're fitted with tiny metal anklets, or “rings,” bearing letter-number codes, similar to the serial numbers on guns, that identify the business where they were hatched and hand-raised. The rings must be loose enough for the chick to grow without the metal cutting into their leg — but not so loose that they can easily be removed or tampered with. A veterinarian and an airport inspector check the birds' rings against a list on the export permit like one Coetzer shows me for a batch of about 90 birds going to Dubai the following week. They look at “every bird's leg,” he says. He assures me that all of the birds in the quarantines have rings.


	But as I walk through the rooms lined with cages, I see some parrots with bare ankles. When I leave Coetzer, I zoom in on my photographs and videos from both quarantine locations and confirm it. At a nearby gas station in Boksburg, I meet up with Eugene Swart, a retired Green Scorpion agent who participated in the confiscation of Fourie's birds in 2018. Swart tells me that the evidence he uses to detect smuggled parrots includes birds behaving nervously, suggesting they're wild, fraudulent paperwork, and loose or missing leg bands. Examining the photos of Fourie's parrots without anklets, he says this means one of two things: Either those birds have been bought from unregistered breeding facilities, or they've been poached from the wild in another country. “In both cases,” Swart says, “they are illegal.”

	











	When asked about the birds without leg bands in their quarantines, both Fourie and Coetzer, who says as of right after my visit he's no longer associated with Fourie, reply that those birds would then be microchipped, another method that's sometimes used to identify birds being traded. Experts and authorities I speak with, however, insist that bands are key to prevent malfeasance. “In rare cases, microchips are used,” Swart says, “but 99.9 percent [of the time], these birds are from outside the legal framework.”


	I want to see wild parrots in the forests of the DRC, but days before my flight to Kinshasa, the capital, shots ring out as dozens of men dressed in military fatigues fire rifles and submachine guns in an attempt to overthrow President Félix Tshisekedi's government. Six people are killed and 50 arrested, including three U.S. citizens. Concerned about safety, I text the driver I've hired to meet me at the airport. “Everything is quiet and calm for the moment,” he responds.


	I make my way to the rural town of Kindu, the capital of Maniema province, a two-hour flight east from Kinshasa. There, John and Terese Hart have a house surrounded by a big white fence and gardens. Terese, with short bobbed grey hair, is a petite woman whose wardrobe varies from colorful sleeveless blouses, pencil skirts, and black Mary Jane shoes for meetings with government dignitaries to field pants, cotton tank tops, and floppy sun hats for days in the bush. John, who has hearing aids, glasses, and white hair swooped off his forehead, is rarely found without his earth-tone cargo pants and Crocs.


	The couple have been working in the DRC for more than 50 years. Their accomplishments are impressive. They've discovered a new species of monkey, the lesula, and helped create a nearly 2.2-million-acre national park where elusive bonobos, okapi, and forest elephants roam. Now in their seventies, they say their urgent priority is halting the trade in African grey parrots. They've been tracking populations in Maniema and two other provinces that encompass a third of the birds' home territory in the DRC. “This is an iconic bird,” John tells me over a Mützig beer in a little grass hut overlooking the Lualaba River. The African grey is even pictured on Congolese currency, he says, “but it's being decimated.” In 2024, he found evidence of more than 17,000 African greys poached from the wild being transited through just one airport in Tshopo province: Kisangani Bangoka International. The Harts' surveys and interviews with villagers show that greys are trafficked in ways similar to what they've seen before with elephant ivory. “The fundamental difference,” he says, “is you have to keep these birds alive. You can't just store them away for later.”


	The pipeline begins in the forest. To capture parrots, poachers scale trees up to a hundred feet high, coating branches with homemade glue or grabbing chicks from nests in cavities. The weakest parrots die during days-long journeys by dugout and motorbike to ports where — often still sticky, and missing feathers — the traumatized birds are sold for about $10 each to middlemen. The birds pass through many more hands before they're sold to exporters for 20 times as much.

	











	One night, with a blood-red moon hanging low, I arrive at the Harts' office near Kindu's lumberyard. Rhythmic music and singing floats on a light breeze. Nearby, families gather around fires, women sell eggs at the roadside, and men socialize at a bar in the glow of a neon light. I park myself in a plastic chair in the driveway and wait for the parrots. Three birds confiscated from smugglers in Kibombo are being brought here on a nine-hour, bumpy ride by motorbike.


	At about 9 o'clock, a motorcycle rolls through the entrance. Two live chickens dangle from the handlebars, and on the back is a loosely woven wicker basket. The rider unwraps the covering used to shield the birds from road dust and passes them off to the Harts' small team, which tucks them into clean cages with sugar water, fruit, and corn. To thwart bird thieves, the parrots will be protected by a round-the-clock armed guard.


	If the newly arrived parrots recover from their ordeal, which included having their flight feathers crudely cut to prevent them from getting away, they'll eventually join a flock of caged birds being rehabilitated at a parrot conservation center established by the Harts in Dingi village, a day's journey by motorized dugout. At Dingi, parrots regrow their wing feathers and regain their strength, and one by one, they fly free, crimson tail feathers glowing brilliantly in the sun.


	A few times a year, the Harts host events so local officials can help release parrots back into the wild. “We're never going to out-confiscate this trade,” John says — it's “too vast and too complex.” 

	











	Even though the international trade in African greys has been banned for nearly a decade, until August the DRC had no comprehensive national law prohibiting their capture, transport, and sale within its borders. In that vacuum, traffickers have thrived — helped by bribable officials, desperate communities, weak oversight in remote regions, and the instability of armed conflict. The country's environment minister has now signed a landmark national law officially closing the grey parrot trade, despite heavy pressure from those who profit from it. Yet few expect the decree alone to end trafficking. Terese calls it an important step, but adds, “There's no question, it will somehow continue … going more underground.”


	One tactic smugglers use is passing off African greys as species that can still be legally exported, such as green and red-fronted parrots. In August 2024, authorities in Turkey seized 252 greys falsely declared as green parrots smuggled from Kinshasa on Turkish Airlines — identified in 2019 as “the poachers' airline of choice” by the nonprofit World Animal Protection because of the carrier's association with wildlife seizures. The birds were bound for Iraq and Thailand, major hubs for live-animal trading. (Turkish Airlines did not respond to requests for comment.) 


	The Harts and the World Parrot Trust urged officials with the Turkish and Congolese wildlife-management authorities to repatriate the birds to the DRC, and Turkish Airways agreed to fly them back to Kinshasa at no cost. But when wooden crates crammed with greys arrived in November 2024, there were only 113 living birds, 13 others having died on the flight. An investigation by the DRC authorities found they were exported illegally by a member of the National League of Congolese Wildlife Exporters, an organization representing the interests of the country's commercial animal industry. That group has been led by Gideon Fourie's associate, Martin Byart.


	Byart is based in Kinshasa — a megacity of 17 million, with gleaming high-rise buildings, French patisseries, and designer stores standing in stark contrast to sprawling slums where millions live in corrugated-metal and tarpaulin shacks with no clean water. I meet him in one of the poorer parts of town, at a yellow house with a concrete courtyard on a dirt street. His Aston Martin, à la 007, is parked in the courtyard.

	











	Imposing in a black button-down, black pants, and pointy black shoes, he sits with three colleagues. He demands to know why I've come to the Congo to talk about African grey parrots. I tell him I'd like to understand why the parrots have become endangered. Byart, like Fourie, insists that African greys aren't declining. “There's no scientific proof,” he says. He strongly believes the grey-parrot trade should be wide open, but he says he hasn't traded greys since the ban. To emphasize the point, Byart shows me around the property's empty aviaries.


	When I mention there are people who say he's one of those in the DRC who are smuggling parrots, he shoots back, “Où est la preuve?” Where's the proof?


	Hoping to uncover proof of smuggling, I find myself crouching in the back of a car one day in February, keeping my head low so no one can see me watching Gideon Fourie's colleagues arrive at Johannesburg's O.R. Tambo International Airport with his shipment of nearly 90 parrots headed for Dubai. Eugene Swart, who made special arrangements for us to be here, moves into position as soon as the wooden crates clear inspection.


	As yet, efforts to find clear evidence of a large-scale African grey laundering operation in South Africa's parrot-breeding industry have yielded nothing. But University of Colorado-Boulder microbiologist Valerie McKenzie is developing a forensic tool that could be transformational — and she's letting us try it. 

	











	Just as we humans have more diverse gut microbiomes if we have healthy lives, spending time outdoors and eating a mix of many different types of nutritious foods, wild parrots eating fruits and nuts in the forest have more diverse microbiomes than parrots raised in a building, fed commercial bird seed, and medicated with antibiotics. Analyzing the makeup and variety of greys' gut microbes can provide insights about where the birds spend time — at large in the wild, or getting shuffled along a black-market trade route, or sitting in a cage at a bird farm.


	The airport inspector examines Fourie's paperwork and looks over the mesh-covered crates. He doesn't open them to examine their leg bands — the birds would fly out. The crates filled with squawking birds are then stacked on a pallet and forklifted into a holding area. There, Swart snaps on blue neoprene gloves and uses swabs attached to dowel rods to poke inside four crates for clumps of fresh feces. He collects about a dozen samples, plopping each into a vial of special solution for preserving biological material.


	It will be four months until we hear the results from McKenzie, who finds one “highly suspicious” sample in Fourie's shipment and a second in another shipment we tested from a different company. The microbiomes in the questionable samples resemble those of wild parrots, she says, a promising finding, though not enough to prove a crime at this early stage of the technique's development. (When presented with these findings, Fourie expressed doubt about the credibility of the test.) As the method advances, says the World Parrot Trust's Martin, it could help catch and convict traffickers. It could be a “game changer.” 

At Dingi, parrots regrow wing feathers and regain strength, and one by one, they fly free.


	To see where many parrots leaving Africa are going, I head to Dubai to visit Al Warsan — the biggest bird marketplace in the United Arab Emirates. Here, far from the city's gold and diamond market, luxurious marinas brimming with shops and restaurants, and the world's tallest building, Emiratis and expats buy their family pets. Men in long white coats called kandura and women in flowing black abaya browse with children, hoping to take home a kitten, goldendoodle, python, canary, fish — or an African grey parrot.


	I track down the address where Fourie sent his shipment: Parrot World Birds Trading, Block 3, Shop Number 10. The store manager, who gives only his first name, Noushad, tells me he's fresh out of African greys today — they're so popular he can't keep them in stock — but he's expecting a new batch soon. He promises to text me when they arrive. Very few other shops I visit have African greys for sale. Among the ones that do, the average price is about $600. One shop owner offers me a $200 discount because his grey has been plucking its feathers. 


	“He's angry,” he tells me. “Stressed out because he wants a mate.”


	In the nearby emirates of Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, I hear the same refrain from shopkeepers: We're waiting for greys. Maybe in a couple of days, or next week. I text Fourie that there's currently a dearth of greys in the UAE markets. He replies, “I can supply them.”


	I ask shop owners where their grey parrots come from. Most say South Africa; some aren't sure. One manager in Abu Dhabi says he won't buy from South Africa anymore — too many sick greys.

	











	In Sharjah's indoor-outdoor animal market, I see a canary face down in its food bowl, dead, and a nearly featherless grey parrot panting behind the glass of a locked storefront. Around the corner, the windows of Shop 34 are covered with newspaper, and the front door is sealed with a sticker stating that tampering with it is a crime. Moiz Jarral, the manager of the shop next door, Al Taghreed Birds & Animal Trading, says he thinks the owner of Shop 34 was selling illegal parrots, and he suspects several other shops at his end of the market may be doing the same. I ask him about the African greys without ankle rings I've seen in shops, including one just down the hall. “If any of the birds don't have the ring, it will not be considered a legal bird,” he says. “If a bird doesn't have a ring, you can't keep it.” The government will confiscate it.


	Jarral texts me when he gets his next shipment of African greys, 30 “pieces” from Fourie. They're snapped up in days.  


	Back in Dubai, I meet Canary Land owner Hameed Shraim — “Dubai's answer to Dr. Dolittle,” according to Emirates Today. Many visitors to his shop aren't so enamored. With more than 70 one-star reviews detailing “horrible conditions,” including filthy cages and sick birds, Canary Land is widely considered a grim example of animal abuse. One reviewer calls it a “graveyard for animals.” Another writes, “Allah will punish u for what u do.” 


	Shraim's store is tucked between a vegetarian Indian restaurant and a dog groomer. The 51-year-old Jordanian is defensive about his bad reviews. The animals in bad shape were abandoned by customers moving abroad who couldn't travel with them because they didn't have paperwork to show they're legal, Shraim says.


	Parrots and other larger animals tucked in cages line one wall. A two-foot-long green iguana is stacked atop a barking black and white “pomchi,” a pomeranian-chihuahua mix, apparently being boarded while its owner is in England for several months. There are some large, black ravens, two nesting macaws shielded from view, and four pairs of African greys in cages, their floors coated with excrement. Several are trembling and missing clumps of feathers on their chests and bodies. One has lost almost its entire wing, maybe from plucking at it. A sign on the wall instructs “No photographs” — a measure, Shraim says, to prevent unwanted visitors from posting pictures with bad reviews.  


	I ask him if online influencers have been a boost to business. In the past, he says, people like him would sell only the pet-shop basics — rabbits, hamsters, fish, turtles, kittens — but today's customers, primed by what they see on social media, are often in the market for more unusual and exotic animals. 

	











	“If you need to be famous,” he says, “you need to have something strange.”

Eilish called out the world's richest man last week while urging him to be more charitable amid news that he could soon be the planet's first trillionaire.

	Elon Musk has hit back at Billie Eilish after the singer slammed the world's richest man last week in an infographic suggesting how the Tesla CEO could use his historically massive wealth to do some charitable good. Borrowing a page from his former DOGE boss Donald Trump's book of sexist insults targeting women's intelligence, Musk posted a message responding to Eilish's graphic, saying, “She's not the sharpest tool in the shed.”

	Eilish's post came amid news last week that Musk, 54, could soon become the world's first-ever trillionaire. The 23-year-old “Bury a Friend” singer has had America's wealth gap on her mind lately, including at WSJ Magazine‘s 2025 Innovator Awards last month, where late night host Stephen Colbert presented her with the honor, noting that she has raised more than $11.5 million for organizations addressing food insecurity and climate change through her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour.


	Eilish then proceeded to lay down the gauntlet for American billionaires — including Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg (net worth $228 billion), who was in the room — suggesting that perhaps they could use some of their cash to help others in need. “I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things and give it to some people that need it,” Eilish said. “Love you all, but there's a few people in here that have a lot more money than me. If you are a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? No hate, but give your money away, shorties.”

	











	But it was what she said last week about Musk that appeared to get under his skin. Eilish posted the series of infographics suggesting the world of good that Elon could do with his money, including spending $40 billion every year to end hunger by 2030 or provide universal safe clean water for the planet for the next seven years with for $140 billion, save all 10,443 critically endangered species by spending $1-$2 billion annually to bring them all down to endangered status, or rebuild war-ravaged Gaza and the occupied West Bank for $53.2 billion.


	Eilish doubled-down on her suggestion last Thursday (Nov. 13), specifically slamming Musk in her Instagram Story, calling him a, “f–king pathetic p–sy b–ch coward.” Billie's remarks came after a shareholder vote paved the way for Musk — already the world's richest man with a net worth of $465 billion — to rake in $1 trillion in Tesla stock if he delivers on specific performance goals over the next decade.


	While Musk reportedly donated nearly $1.9 billion shares of Tesla to unnamed charities in 2022 — as well as $5.7 billion worth of shares in 2021 — a March 2024 New York Times story said that unlike fellow billionaire Bill Gates, who has used his massive wealth to improve health care across Africa, Musk's philanthropy has “been haphazard and largely self-serving, making him eligible for enormous tax breaks and helping his businesses.” The paper reported that Musk has seeded his charity with tax-deductible donations of more than $7 billion in stock since 2020, noting that the foundation housing the money has “failed in recent years to give away the bare minimum required by law to justify the tax break.”

	











	In addition, according to the Times, the foundation has not hired any staff, with the billions in its coffers overseen by a board consisting of Musk and two volunteers, one of whom devoted the equivalent of six minutes per week working on its charitable works. A Times analysis also found that the Musk Foundation's giving in 2021 and 2022, the latest years for which the full data was available at the time, about half of the donations had some link to Musk, one of his employees or one of his businesses. 


	At press time a spokesperson for Eilish had not returned Billboard‘s request for comment on Musk's post.

Staff at Lilliput Church of England Infant School in Dorset explained to parents that demons are associated with "spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness."


							By 

	Lily Ford



	A Christian school in England has barred its students from singing along to KPop Demon Hunters amid concerns over references to demons.


	Lilliput Church of England Infant School in Dorset sent a note to parents and carers for the pupils, aged from four to seven, saying some members of the community are “deeply uncomfortable” with specific song lyrics in Netflix‘s smash hit film.




	According to BBC News, the initial note asked parents to encourage their children “not to sing these songs at school out of respect for those who find the themes at odds with their faith”. Staff explained that demons are associated with “spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness,” and therefore attempts must be made to foster and uphold the school's “Christian ethos.”

	In a new letter made public on the school's website Monday, acting head teacher Lloyd Allington wrote to parents and carers: “For some Christians… even fictional or playful use of this language can conflict with their faith, which emphasises rejecting evil rather than engaging with it — even in entertainment.”


	However, he did also mention that he had received positive feedback from some parents about KPop Demon Hunters, who have said that the songs encourage values like teamwork and kindness.


	“We want to reassure you that we are not asking parents to tell their children that there is anything wrong with enjoying the film or its songs if it aligns with your own views and beliefs, and this will not be the messaging we share in the school either,” the letter continued.


	“Our role will simply be to help children understand that some of their peers may hold different views and to explore how we can respect and support those peers in upholding their faith.”

	











	The movie follows K-pop girl group and demon-hunting trio Huntr/x. It was released to widespread acclaim in June this year and swiftly became the streamer's most-watched original title in Netflix history, with a sequel already in the works.


	It was also the first film soundtrack on the Billboard Hot 100 to have four of its songs in the top ten and earned an impressive five Grammy nominations.


The Hollywood Reporter‘s review called KPop Demon Hunters a “dazzlingly animated, infectiously soundtracked treat.”

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Stranger Things star Sadie Sink will make her London stage bow as Juliet in a production of Romeo & Juliet that hot director Robert Icke will helm in March, Deadline can reveal.


	But soft — who is her Romeo? Icke and producer James Bierman have picked Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place, Le Mans ‘66) to play the love-hungry teen besotted with Juliet.


	Gotta say, they appear just right as the star-crossed lovers.


	Jupe, who plays Hamlet in Chloé Zhao's Hamnet movie that opens this month, will be making his professional theater debut. The actor also appears with Tom Hiddleston and Olivia Colman in the forthcoming second season of BBC drama The Night Manager. 

	











	Sink, who plays Max Mayfield in Stranger Things, is a creature of the theater, having played in the musical Annie on Broadway when she was just 10 years of age. A year later she portrayed Princess Elizabeth, who would grow up to become Helen Mirren as Elizabeth II, in Peter Morgan's The Audience.

	Earlier this year, Sink received a Tony Award nomination for her lead role in Kimberly Belflower's John Proctor Is the Villain.


	Sink is what's known as a proper actress. Sure, she's in a big television hit and she's presently shooting Spider-Man: Brand New Day until the middle of December, but the theater is her home; it's a place she seeks out.

	











	Bierman saw Sink in New York in John Proctor Is the Villain “and thought she was fantastic.”


	He adds that she “has real, great stage presence and obviously has grown up on stage” because of Annie and The Audience.


	Bierman and his Empire Productions produced Suzie Miller's Prima Facie, which won Jodie Comer countless prizes including a Tony and an Olivier.

	He says that Texas-born Sink's initial meeting with Icke lasted four hours. “And then she just threw herself in and did some workshop sessions with Rob, working on the language and text. And it grew organically from there really, that this was the play, this was the role for her. … As I say, it felt incredibly organic, very much from the ground up. 


	“And we're just very fortunate that the stars have aligned because this sort of period of time that she was actually available to do something corresponded with the Harold Pinter Theatre being free,” Bierman explains.


	Performances of Romeo & Juliet will start on March 16 for a limited 12-week run through June 6.


Spider-Man: Brand New Day is scheduled to open on July 31. There has been much speculation about the role Sink has in the Spidey film, and frankly, I do not know the answer, but I do know that she'll join the cast of the next Avengers picture that shoots here in London later in 2026.


RELATED: Sadie Sink Talks ‘John Proctor Is The Villain', ‘Stranger Things' And Joining The Marvel Universe – The Deadline Q&A


	Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet was the first play that Icke directed professionally back in 2012, and Bierman says that Icke has “unfinished business” to resolve.


	“I think for Rob, it's about trying to explore, actually within the play, the question of time … and how there's a running motif in the piece about time and how everything's moving very, very quickly,“ Bierman says. “And potentially, if it didn't move so quickly, they wouldn't have the outcome they have. And so he wants to explore it through the prism of time and time running out and just sort of hint at what might have happened if Romeo arrives half an hour later, he might find Juliet awake. But he doesn't. That's what makes it so tragic.”


	Icke enjoys thoroughly examining classic play texts to help him explore new ways of presenting the piece. A case in point is his stunning contemporary production of Oedipus, which takes place on an election night. It was a hit in London with Mark Strong and Lesley Manville, and producer Sonia Friedman just opened it on Broadway.

	While Icke's been working in New York, Sink and Jupe have been conducting line readings of the play with him via Zoom from London. Rehearsals for Romeo & Juliet will begun in late January.


	The creative tram will include set and costume designer Hildegard Bechtler, lighting designer Jon Clark, sound designer Tom Gibbons and video designer Ash J. Woodward.


	Casting directors Julia Horan and Jim Carnahan will liaise with Icke for further casting when he returns to the UK in the next few days.

	











	I ask Bierman whether there's any likelihood of Romeo & Juliet making its way to New York at some point in the future.


	He's quite sensibly cautious. “I think, well for now, I think that's kind of it. And it's also — we've just filled this nice gap before the next Spider-Man movie comes out, and then [Sink is] busy again.”


	Both he and Icke are excited with how Sink has jumped into working on the part. “Juliet as a character has a lot of agency in it, and there's a lot more of an active journey for her that sometimes doesn't come out.  … She's lived quite a sheltered life, and her parents are trying to marry her off to Paris,” Bierman tells us. “And she's realizing that maybe that's not her fate, but maybe there is a way out of that, that you don't just have to accept this. And then enter Romeo.”


	It's an opportunity to explore “a Juliet with dynamism and agency,” he declares.

How many times can they put Romeo & Juliet up in the west end? Produce a new play

Answer, as many times as they can convince a screen actor this production will display they are serious actors with stage credits. A year ago it was Spiderman now it's Max from Stranger Things. A familiar play with familiar actors equals ass in seats.

The Mexican auteur explains why star Cuautli Jiménez thought, "This must be a mistake" when he got the lead role, casting Maggie Civantos after extensive research, and that Harry and Meghan reference.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	“After losing his chance at the Mexican presidency, ambitious politician Chema retreats with his elegant wife Carmina to a countryside hacienda. Exile soon turns into delusion: they crown themselves king and queen of a fabricated realm, household staff are recast as courtiers, halls transform into stages of decadent ceremony, and fantasies spill into cruel punishments and bizarre rituals.”


	Sounds like this could possibly be real life, you say? Mexican writer-director Andrés Clariond (Hilda) wants you to feel that way about Versalles, his new movie that has just world premiered in the main competition lineup of the 29th edition of the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (PÖFF).

	The title of the satire, which walks the narrow line between reality and absurd megalomaniac insanity,is inspired by the home of former French rulers, Versailles. “Inspired by works like The Death of Stalin, The Favourite and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, Versalles reimagines the decadence of French aristocracy through the lens of modern Mexican politics,” the PÖFF website notes.

	Cuautli Jiménez and Maggie Civantos star in the movie from Pimienta Films (Roma), which the director co-wrote with Alo Valenzuela. MMM Film Sales is handling world sales. 


	If Versalles feels eerily familiar to a global audience despite being a Mexico-set tale, its director isn't surprised at all. “In Mexico, this has been the political reality for longer now,” he tells THR. “Now, the whole world is dealing with all these autocrats and crazy leaders. But in Mexico, we had the same party [in power] for 70 years, so only the president changed. And politicians feel like they deserve everything, they have all these privileges. And when they end their time in power, they start to go crazy, because they are used to all the attention. Suddenly, they are common people. And that's what I wanted to portray.”

	











	Clariond also writes newspaper editorials in Mexico, as “a side business,” he says. “I have always been interested in politics, and especially the more intimate, psychological side of it, because you see many films [and series] about political intrigues, such as House of Cards.” Was that show ever mentioned in pitches? “Many people actually were saying, ‘Oh, this is going to be like House of Cards‘,” the auteur tells THR. “And I was like: ‘That's not what I want to explore.' I wanted to explore the psychology and all the demons in this guy's head after almost achieving his goal, and then everything falls [apart].”


	Watching Versalles, you can't help wanting its protagonist to succeed early on. And that is by design. “In my movies, I always think about how do I make these characters emphatic,” Clariond explains. “Because they do such terrible things. So for me, I like when you start out saying, ‘you have to win, and I'm with you.' And then suddenly, my characters start doing these horrible things, but well, you are already with them.”


	The protagonist Chema in the film discusses his skin tone. “In Mexico, that plays into every realm or every area of society,” the director says. “For our actor, Cuautli Jiménez, for example, this is his first role as a protagonist. Actors with darker skin really suffer because most of the parts they get offered are like crime gang leaders and poor people. So when he got the offer to play a governor, he was like, ‘This must be a mistake. How come they are choosing me?' So it's a meta thing where even this movie and its casting is something provocative.”

	











	What he loved about his male lead were the cracks in the armor that he can show, the layers of the character. “What I liked was that he shows some vulnerability,” Clariond recalls. “Because sometimes, when you tell someone to play a politician, they will go with the cliche of being all strong and raising their voice. Cuautli had this vulnerability that I wanted for the characters.”


	Clariond researched Civantos' past work before choosing her for the role of Chema's wife in Versalles. “Because I put so much importance on directing actors, I like to analyze all their work,” the director explains. “I like to see how they act, what they do and what they don't. That's why I do so much research.”


	He focused on Spanish actresses and a certain look in addition to the depth of acting skills he was looking for. “I was looking for the traditional beauty, like a princess' beauty – blonde, green eyes,” the director shares. After seeing her in a Spanish series while on the treadmill, “I started researching and seeing all of what she has done and chose her.”


Versalles mixes intimate scenes with big, loud scenes, such as one where the couple is in old-school French aristocrats' outfits and throws a big party. “The big scenes, I wasn't used to,” Clariond tells THR. “This is the first time that I have had scenes with 200 extras, and that was crazy for me.” 


	The post-production process was also full of challenges. “We did color grading that I didn't like, and so we changed that “to get the look and feel right,” he explains. 

	











Versalles may be a Mexican story, but its creator believes in its universality, especially in our time of populism and social media. “For me, the need for attention, being rejected when you have almost achieved something, all of that is universal,” Clariond tells THR. “And so is the relationship of the couple.” 


	He continues: “We have seen these couples in power around the world. It is now very common that both of them are famous. We see that in Mexico, in Argentina, in the U.S., in many places.” In one scene, the English subtitles mention one power couple of a different sort, Prince Harry and Meghan. “I couldn't find a good translation” for a Mexican reference, the director explains. “The original line mentions local people in Mexico, so it was impossible to find a good translation. So I looked for a reference that would be [recognizable] and make sense” for international viewers.


	Adds Clariond: “So yes, I think that the movie deals with universal topics and human desires, including how much you want something when you don't get it, the envy.” 


	For example, there is a scene in which Chema sits in his bathroom, checking on his rival by watching one of his latest campaign commercials in the middle of the night. “He is basically stalking the other candidate. I think that's very human. So, yeah, I hope that the film works for everyone.”


	Clariond doesn't know yet what he will do next. “But I do know that I want to go for a lighter tone,” he says. “I think I have had enough of tormented characters. In my three films, I have all these tormented characters dealing with their demons. I really want to explore either humor or a lighter tone next.”

Seth Meyers and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene have found unlikely common ground. During Monday's “A Closer Look” segment on Late Night With Seth Meyers, the host fired back at President Donald Trump‘s calls over the weekend for NBC to fire him.


	“You guys! They said my name on TV! It's not often you hear the name Seth Meyers on TV before midnight,” joked Meyers when remarking on the media's coverage. “I'm also aware that being attacked by the president this weekend doesn't make me special in any way, shape or form. I was simply on the same shit list as Christopher Wray, James Comey, Indiana Republicans, Thomas Massie, Rand Paul, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and and former President Joe Biden.”


	“I want to clarify that I take no issue with the president voicing his displeasure with my show. That is his right, and on a lot of nights, he's got a point,” continued Myers, before taking issue with the president's grammar. “But I would like to unpack this sentence from Trump's post about me: ‘He was viewed last night in an uncontrollable rage.' Not to repeat something I'm sure you've heard many times over the years from your English teachers, but what's with the passive voice my man?”

	











	Meyers then segued into Trump's “feud with Republicans over the Epstein files,” and his MAGA civil war with Greene, who was once one of the president's staunchest allies. The Georgia Republican has been pushing for the Department of Justice to release the files and even signed onto a discharge petition, along with Democrats and three of her Republican colleagues, demanding the files be made public. 

	











	Trump has since called the congresswoman a “traitor” on Truth Social, and on Friday, pulled his endorsement and support of Greene.

	“I can't believe I'm saying this, but I finally have something in common with Marjorie Taylor Greene,” observed Meyers on his show. “You know, Trump's really bringing the country together. The only difference is, she got a cool nickname: ‘Marjorie Traitor Greene' is way cooler than ‘Marble Mouth Meyers.'”


	Meyers previously mocked Trump over how his administration has been responding to the recently released batch of Jeffrey Epstein emails, in which Epstein claimed that Trump “knew about the girls” in Epstein's sex trafficking case. As the House prepares to vote Tuesday, Trump dropped his longstanding resistance and said he would sign a bill that would order the DOJ to release all the files tied to the convicted sex offender.

The two actors previously played Jon Snow and Sansa Stark on eight seasons of the HBO Emmy-winning series.

Kit Harington will likely be in charge of future reunions with his Game of Thrones sister Sophie Turner. 


	The actors star in Natasha Kermani's new gothic horror movie, The Dreadful; however, they play love interests in the film, which Harington described as “a bit weird.” Prior to this, they played half-siblings Jon Snow and Sansa Stark on eight seasons of the HBO Emmy-winning series.




	“She was [the] one that sent that movie to me and somehow didn't see what I saw in it,” Harington recently told E! News. “I was like, ‘These guys, these are lovers, right?' I felt very odd about that.”

	He added, “It was slightly embarrassing, having to get on an apple box to kiss her because she's about a foot taller than me. But other than that, my dignity was pretty intact.”

	Despite the awkwardness while filming romantic scenes in the film, Harington admitted it was still nice to reunite with Turner after Game of Thrones wrapped in 2019.


	“It was a good chance to be with her again and work together,” the Industry actor said. “What was lovely is that we got on set together and our friendship completely ignited again. It felt like being with family. It really did.”


The Dreadful follows Anne (Turner) and her mother-in-law, Morwen (Marcia Gay Harden), who live a solitary, harsh life on the outskirts of society. But when a man, played by Harington, from their past returns, he will set off a sequence of horrifying events that will change Anne's life forever.

After attempting to bend the knee to the Trump administration, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has agreed to restore its $36 million, three-year contract with NPR and fund its satellite distribution service for local radio stations. Per NPR, the settlement ends litigation between NPR and the CPB over the Corporation's refusal to distribute congressionally allocated funds for “interconnection purposes,” i.e., the distribution system. NPR accused its decades-long partner of reneging on the contract days after Trump ordered the defunding of public media; CPB claimed it canceled the contract with NPR to award it to Public Media Infrastructure (PMI), a new consortium of public radio organizations. The judge wasn't buying what CPB was selling and decided it hadn't made a credible argument for breaking the contract.

“The settlement is a victory for editorial independence and a step toward upholding the First Amendment rights of NPR and the public media system in our legal challenge to [Trump's] Executive Order,” Katherine Maher, President and CEO of NPR, said in a statement. “While we entered into this dispute with CPB reluctantly, we're glad to resolve it in a way that enables us to continue to provide for the stability of the Public Radio Satellite System, offer immediate and direct support to public radio stations across the country, and proceed with our strong and substantive claims against this illegal and unconstitutional Executive Order. We look forward to our day in court in December.”

Trump issued Executive Order 14290 (“Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media”) on May 1, ordering CBP to cease funding NPR and PBS. Of course, executive orders aren't laws, so there's no legal reason for the CPB to adhere to them, especially when they might be unconstitutional. After all, Congress established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to funnel congressional funds to public media and prevent the government from, well, doing exactly what it's attempting to do. The goal of his order came to fruition in Congress, when Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill passed over the summer and rescinded $1.1 billion previously allocated to public media. NPR, along with three Colorado public radio stations, has filed suit against the White House, claiming the executive order violates the First Amendment. Hearings will begin in December.

Penn Badgley and his wife, Domino Kirke, almost separated following two devastating miscarriages.

The “You” star detailed the losses in his new book of essays “Crushmore: Essays on Love, Loss, and Coming-of-Age.”

“This was our second loss together. A time when it did not feel as though the cycle would break,” he wrote. “My wife and I neared separation as many do after losses like that.”

He added that the separation largely came about because the couple felt “isolated” in dealing with the losses because we live in a “culture that doesn't talk much about these things or know how to support those going through it.”

Badgley, 39, added, “Seeing our still baby in that tripped out black-and-white sono imagery is a dreadful memory I can't shake every time we go for a sonogram now.”

He reiterated the need for openness and talking more about miscarriages on the “Totally Booked” podcast on Sunday.

“That sort of loss is really common, and we should — I don't know if talking about it alone is what we need,” he said. “We at least need to start by talking about it more … They do happen all the time, and they can be really, really painful. Well, I would say they universally are painful. Maybe not everybody's fully allowed to feel that way.”

Though it's unclear when the miscarriages occurred, the actor and Kirke, 41, are parents to son James, whom they welcomed in August 2020. 

Additionally, Kirke gave birth to twin sons in September

When Kirke announced she was pregnant in February, she admitted to being “stunned” via an Instagram announcement.

“Spontaneous twins are beyond magical,” she wrote at the time.

Kirke is also the mother to a son named Cassius from a previous relationship.

“It's funny because I wrote this before the twins were born, and now I feel like I am — and I mean this with love — but I feel like I'm drowning in children,” Badgley said on the podcast. 

“So, it's harder to get in touch with that feeling of loss because my cup truly runneth over.”

The “Gossip Girl” alum shared that he was grateful that he and Kirke didn't give in to the “gravity” of separating. 

Kirke and Badgley started dating in 2014 and tied the knot in February 2017 at a New York courthouse.

They exchanged vows once again that June.

In what appears to be a career first for Christopher Nolan, the Oscar-winning filmmaker claims his upcoming adaptation of Homer's epic, The Odyssey, features “usable sound.” Taking after one of his cinematic heroes, Michael Mann, Nolan has long been a proponent of having his characters mumble through scenes as large bombs and engines muddy up the mix. Since the director prefers shooting on large-format film, which requires a noisy, cumbersome camera, and refuses to re-record audio during post-production, incoherent dialogue has since become a hallmark of Nolan's auteurism. That was until science finally caught up with the director. IMAX recently developed “the blimp,” a casing for its cameras that reduces camera noise, allowing Nolan to record clean audio, to the delight of his massive viewership, which spends a good portion of his movies wondering what that guy just said. Despite “the blimp” being essentially the same technique filmmakers used in the 1930s as talkies took over, Nolan called the technology “a game-changer.” “You can be shooting a foot from [an actor's] face while they're whispering and get usable sound,” Nolan tells Empire. “What that opens up are intimate moments of performance on the world's most beautiful format.” Nolan did not specify whether “blimp” technology could adequately capture the dulcet tones of Tom Hardy speaking through a mask with the same clarity.

In addition to coherent line readings, Nolan also promises he didn't break a single IMAX camera on the set of The Odyssey. “I did not destroy an IMAX camera on this film,” Nolan says. “I have destroyed several in my time, but these ones survived The Odyssey.”

Usable sound? Unbroken IMAX cameras? Has Christopher Nolan lost his edge? Odyssey star and certified “that guy” James Remar recently indicated that he has not. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Remar tacitly confirmed that Nolan's long-running feud with chairs and cellphones on set continues unabated. “No cell phones on set, and the man never sits down,” he said. “He stands next to the camera for every single shot. He did that in Iceland, too. We were on the beach shooting in Iceland; I never saw him sit down once for 12 hours out there. Every single day. It was freezing. Everybody was freezing.”

Swift recorded namesake songs for seven of her 12 studio albums.


													By
												

	Denise Warner



	With 12 full-lengths under her belt, Taylor Swift has released seven albums that include songs that reflect each album's name: “Fearless,” “Speak Now,” “Red,” “Lover,” “evermore,” “The Tortured Poets Department” and “The Life of a Showgirl.” Right now, only three – “Fearless,” “Red” and “Lover” – became official singles. The rest linger in the deep cuts, but certainly fan favorites, of her work.


	Spanning her career from 2008's Fearless to 2025's The Life of a Showgirl – currently enjoying its sixth week atop the Billboard 200 – her title tracks show the breadth and depth of her sonic evolution, from her country roots to her pop superstardom, with her signature storytelling lyricism on display.


	(And don't worry about the five albums without a title track: She shows them love in other ways. Debut doesn't mention her name, but she later shouts herself out on both “22” from Red and “Clara Bow” from The Tortured Poets Department; 1989 never received a lyrical callback, but her famous introduction to its world tour does: “My name is Taylor and I was born in 1989!”; Reputation tracks “End Game” and “Delicate” as well as Speak Now's “Superman” reference reputation; evermore's “gold rush” includes “My mind turns your life into folklore”; and mentions of midnight abound throughout her catalog, but only “Anti-Hero” and “Midnight Rain” from Midnights and Rep's “New Year's Day” contain the actual word.)Read below for Billboard's ranking of the seven title tracks, as well as their peaks on the Billboard Hot 100. (And check out all of her lead singles ranked and her biggest Billboard hits too.)


Year: 2020Hot 100 Peak: 57


	The album's closer – exclusive of the deluxe version – offers a piano-laden ballad of heartbreak and confusion (“I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone / Trying to find the one where I went wrong / Writing letters / Addressed to the fire,” Swift sings) with Justin Vernon's angsty falsetto floating through the bridge. It's a gorgeous duet held back only by their superior pairing on “exile” and its quieter existence in the Swift universe.


Year: 2025Hot 100 Peak: 8


	The grandiose duet reflects on fame and what it takes to rise – and stay on top. “I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck / I paid my dues with every bruise, I knew what to expect,” Swift states proudly. “Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins? / They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away,” Carpenter lilts with a sweet but vicious edge.


Year: 2010, 2023 (Taylor's Version)Hot 100 Peak: 8, 33


	Swift expertly captures the panic of watching someone walk down the aisle to the wrong person in the emotionally charged “Speak Now.” “There's a silence, there's my last chance / I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me / Horrified looks from everyone in the room / But I'm only lookin' at you,” she sings with a baited apprehension on the country-rock tune.


Year: 2019Hot 100 Peak: 10


	On the tender and romantic serenade – perfect for a wedding day dance – Swift professes her desire to capture a partner's heart “forever and ever.” Despite the overlying tension of the questions: “Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close?,” the beauty of the deeply confessional rumination rings true.


Year: 2008, 2021 (Taylor's Version)Hot 100 Peak: 9, 71


	All the feelings of the rush of a first romance that makes you brave, this country sparkler dazzles in its earnest recounting of what makes young love so powerful. “And I don't know how it gets better than this / You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless / And I don't know but with you, I'd dance / In a storm in my best dress, fearless,” she chants boldly.


Year: 2024Hot 100 Peak: 4


	Rife with modern-day imagery (“You smoked then ate seven bars of chocolate / We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist”) and flush with the anxiety of a fleeting relationship, Swift swells to an uneasy admission: “And who's gonna hold you, like me?” As she says, “No f—ing body.”


Year: 2012, 2021 (Taylor's Version)Hot 100 Peak: 6, 25


	An anthemic mix of guitars and banjos with an outsized synth-pop overlay, Taylor wrenches open her feelings and lets them free on “Red” – a poetic masterpiece of frenzied, colorful passion. “Losing him was blue, like I'd never known / Missing him was dark gray, all alone / Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met / But loving him was red,” she sings.

Danny Masterson is blaming his lawyer for failing to summon key witnesses during his 2023 rape trial as he tries to overturn his conviction.

According to new court documents obtained by Page Six, the “That '70s Show” alum claims his attorney Philip Cohen — who took over for the actor's former lawyer due to scheduling issues — only questioned two out of potentially “more than 20 potential witnesses” that could've spoken in his defense.

Per the filing, Cohen allegedly didn't attempt to contact the witnesses, who he claimed had given “prior statements to the police and to investigators.”

Masterson also alleges in the docs that Cohen chose not to refute the prosecutor's allegations about Scientology.

Among the allegations was that the church threatens women if they report high-profile members to authorities.

Masterson claims in the filing that Cohen was advised by attorneys for the Church of Scientology to call members to fight back against the allegations, but he allegedly failed to do so.

Per the filing, “the jury saw only the tip of the iceberg of available defense evidence in the form of the complaining witnesses' inconsistent statements while the wealth of directly exculpatory evidence went unused for no viable tactical reason.”

Cohen wasn't immediately available to Page Six for comment.

Masterson was arrested in June 2020 on three charges of rape that occurred between 2001 and 2003.

While the actor pleaded not guilty in January 2021, he was found guilty of raping two of three women in May 2023.

Masterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison and is currently serving time at the California Men's Colony facility.

In December 2024, the “Ranch” alum appealed his conviction, arguing that there were several errors in his trial, which violated his “rights to confrontation and a fair trial.”

Amid his ongoing legal proceedings, Masterson's ex Bijou Phillips filed for divorce in September 2023 shortly after his sentencing.

The actress had notably stood by Masterson's side throughout the trial, though an insider previously told People that she went through “a very difficult time” after his conviction.

At the time, Masterson agreed to give Phillips full custody of their daughter, Fianna Francis.

Most recently, Phillip requested to remove his last name from the 11-year-old's surname last month.

Moana is the latest Disney Vault escapee to receive the obligatory “live-action remake” treatment, and to its credit, the trailer does contain live-action elements. Moana, for one, as played by Catherine Laga'aia, taking over for Auli'i Cravalho, who voiced the character in the two animated versions, is a flesh-and-blood human. That's more than we can say for Dwayne Johnson's Maui, who we only get a look at from the back. The sand and, occasionally, water look real, too. Still, released earlier today, the teaser features more “photorealistic” versions of cartoon characters that looked better in their natural, animated state.

﻿

Aside from the cynical calculations of charging audiences twice for the same movie, the obvious hit on these remakes, notably the billion-dollar-grossing Lion King and its all-but-forgotten follow-up, Moufasa (which only made $720 million), is that they aren't that live-action. In fact, one could say they're 3-D animated movies. But the speed at which animated classics become live-action advertisements for the animated film on Disney+ is ramping up, too. At least Lilo & Stitch took 25 years to reach the remake stage. In contrast, the original Moana came out less than a decade ago.

If the last year is any indication, Disney might stop trying so hard to remake its golden-era classics, like Snow White and Pinocchio, and stick to its recent output, especially as it runs out of Disney Renaissance titles to reinterpret. Despite all the finger-pointing at Rachel Zegler, Snow White's failure has more to do with the fact that the kids aren't as familiar with 1939's Snow White, and the parents bringing them have more nostalgia for The Little Mermaid than the magic mirror. The same might be true for Pinocchio and Peter Pan & Wendy, which vanished onto Disney+ after reportedly costing more than $150 million each. Given how well Moana 2, a TV show forced into movie shape, and Lilo & Stitch, a TV-movie that became Hollywood's only billion-dollar grosser of the year, it's fair to anticipate another quick payday for the Mouse House. We're still waiting to see one we like, though. Thus far, none of Disney's “live-action remakes” has generated better than a C+ from The A.V. Club‘s critics.

Moana opens on July 10, 2026.

Chronicling the Colorado poet laureate's relationship, work and battle with cancer, Ryan White's Sundance-premiering film is available to stream on Apple TV.


							By 

	Jourdain Searles



	If there's one thing audiences will get from Ryan White's new documentary Come See Me in the Good Light, it's that it's a truly beautiful love story. Poets Andrea Gibson and Megan Falley found each other through the beauty of words and honest, emotional expression. Their life together in Colorado is full of friends, fun and humor. In an increasingly hostile world, these two queer people were able to carve out an existence for themselves that is happy and authentic to them. Andrea and Megan are gentle with each other throughout the film, even as it becomes clear that cancer puts an expiration date on their domestic bliss.

	Andrea died in July of this year in Megan's arms, a devastating ending to their story. Come See Me in the Good Light (available on Apple TV) premiered at Sundance several months before and thankfully, Andrea was able to see it on the big screen. It's difficult to imagine what it must have felt like to watch their whole life in living color, already knowing that it was likely going to end.

The Bottom Line

Release date: Friday, Nov. 14 (Apple TV)Featuring: Andrea Gibson, Megan FalleyDirector: Ryan White

								1 hour 49 minutes			






	It takes incredible strength to embark on making a film while one's health is deteriorating rapidly. And yet Andrea is a delightful and funny presence onscreen, whether they're trying to fix their broken mailbox, working on a poem or just joking around with Megan. Andrea's sincerity and fearlessness serves to lighten the heaviness of their story. We quickly learn that Andrea has ovarian cancer and are forced to watch their body deteriorate before our eyes. But thankfully Andrea's spirit remains intact as they tell the story of their life and their journey with spoken word poetry. Their poems are simple in language with an undeniable emotional complexity, vulnerably embracing sentiment. A chunk of the film focuses on Andrea's desire to perform spoken word poetry on stage in front of a crowd one last time. When we finally see them take the stage, it's a moving, triumphant moment.

	











Come See Me in the Good Light is relentlessly emotional and intentionally uplifting, with an intimate quality that makes it feel like a home movie. We are rarely treated to such an affectionate portrait of a treasured queer artist embracing the last days of their life with a loving spouse. Knowing how personal the project was to everyone involved — from participants to producers and even the director — wraps the whole film in a palpable sense of warmth. These circumstances make the doc difficult to evaluate in any objective sense — it's a wonder that it was made at all, and so tenderly. 


	White skillfully captures a portrait of a queer poet who wanted the world to know how much they loved and were loved by those around them. It's an unapologetically sentimental film, knowingly pulling at every single heartstring, encouraging us to open up the emotional floodgates and give ourselves over to Andrea's resilient positivity. Come See Me in the Good Light wants to be life-affirming more than anything else, especially for artists in queer and marginalized communities. The streaming era has not been kind to intimate documentaries like these, buried under mountains of flashier content. Andrea hoped the film would help people in the future, and there's no doubt that it will, as long as they know where to find it.

	After months of delay tactics and attempted strong-arming by Republican leadership, the House is set to vote Tuesday on legislation that would force the Justice Department to release the so-called Epstein files. The vote, which is expected to pass with the support of over a dozen Republicans, marks a bipartisan rejection of President Donald Trump, who urged his party to move on from Epstein and vote against the resolution before reversing course over the weekend after it had become clear the resolution would pass. 


	This historic vote — and the months-long battle to bring the bill to the floor — caused rifts between Trump and some of his closest allies, while continuing to raise questions about the president's relationship with one of the most notorious sex offenders in American history. 


	As lawmakers prepare to cast their ballots, here's everything you need to know about what they will actually be voting on, what is already public, and what questions they hope to answer by releasing new information. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The documents referred to as the “Epstein files” are the evidence and testimony collected by the Justice Department and FBI over the course of two investigations and criminal cases against Epstein. 


	Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring and soliciting prostitution from a minor in a controversial sweetheart deal with federal prosecutors. He died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 after being charged with sex trafficking of minors in a separate investigation. The files held by the DOJ and FBI reportedly contain thousands of pages of witness and survivor testimony, digital evidence, communications between Epstein and others, as well as potentially videos and images of sexual abuse against minors. 

	











	Since Epstein died in prison, only his close associate and long term partner — Ghislane Maxwell — has been tried and convicted in connection with the trafficking ring run by Epstein. The lack of subsequent investigations and prosecutions into others named by survivors as participants in their abuse has generated widespread public interest in the contents of the files, and the reasons behind federal prosecutors' failure to pursue additional indictments.

	Conservatives and right-wing commentators spent years calling for transparency regarding the government's Epstein investigations, while insisting Trump would release the files upon returning to office. In July, after a public stunt in which prominent MAGA influencers were photographed at the White House with binders supposedly containing a portion of the files, the DOJ and FBI pulled the rug out from under their own movement, announcing that they would not be releasing any additional indictments, and that evidence related to the case would not be made public. 


	The resulting backlash has persisted for months, and the slow, continuous trickle of information related to the case has placed increased scrutiny on the president. Shortly after the DOJ made its announcement, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had been warned by the Justice Department that his name appears in the files.  


	Trump has repeatedly called the scandal a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats. On Saturday,  he demanded that Attorney General Pam Bondi launch investigations into other men named in Epstein-related documents, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. Bondi quickly agreed.   


	The House will vote Tuesday on “The Epstein Files Transparency Act,” which would require the DOJ to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Attorneys' Offices,” related to the cases against Epstein and Maxwell. These include flight logs and travel records, records on corporate entities associated with Epstein, the identities of individuals “named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities, civil settlements, immunity or plea agreements, or investigatory proceedings,” as well as internal communications among government agents discussing the case.

	The act would allow the DOJ to redact sensitive information pertaining to the identity of survivors, as well as material depicting child sexual abuse, other violent crimes, or material that would jeopardize an ongoing investigation. 


	Critically, there is some evidence in the DOJ's documents on Epstein that cannot be released without judicial approval, primarily sealed grand jury transcripts. Judges have recently rejected bids by the DOJ to unseal grand jury testimony related to Epstein's case, although it is not unheard of for transcripts to be made public.     


	So, if Congress has to force the DOJ to release all these materials, where are things like Trump's page from Epstein's  “birthday book,” and the Epstein emails released earlier this month coming from? 


	They're from an entirely separate source: the Epstein estate. 


	Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, led by Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), have been working with Epstein's estate, as well as survivors, to release  evidentiary documents held by representatives of the late sex offender. 


	These include the so-called “birthday book” — a collection of over 50 congratulatory letters that included a lewd missive from Trump — and thousands of emails between Epstein, Maxwell, and other individuals the Oversight Committee released last week. The trove of over 20,000 emails included allegations that Trump knew of Epstein's activities with underage girls. Epstein wrote in 2011 that Trump “spent hours” at his house with one of his victims, said he was the man who could “take down” Trump, and described Trump as “the dog that hasn't barked.”In another email, Epstein tells a reporter to look into reports that Trump was so enthralled while ogling young women in Epstein's pool that he ran face-first into a glass door. 


	On Sunday, Garcia appeared on MS NOW and reaffirmed that the Oversight Committee will continue to seek additional materials from the Epstein estate and other sources.  


	“What we've received pales in comparison to the documents that actually exist in the Department of Justice,” he said. “Just stay tuned, because there's a lot more information that is going to be released, more documents that we're going to get, and we're going to continue to demand that they do the right thing and get us that release from the Department of Justice.”

	











	Trump again accused Democrats on Sunday of pushing the “Epstein Hoax” as a way to “deflect from all of their bad policies and losses.” 


	“Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem! Ask Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, and Larry Summers about Epstein, they know all about him, don't waste your time with Trump,” he wrote. 


	Hours later, Trump flipped his position on the vote, writing on Truth Social that “Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax.” 


	The 180 came after Trump's efforts to kill the discharge petition — the mechanism through which House members are able to force a vote on the files over the  objections of leadership — failed. Last week, the White House reportedly summoned Rep. Lauren Boebert (D-Colo.) to the Situation Room and attempted to convince her to remove her name from the petition, a similar unsuccessful effort was made to convince Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) to withdraw her support.

	Now that Trump says he's supportive of the petition, it bears remembering that — just as he can order the DOJ to investigate his political rivals — he could order Bondi to release the files without the intervention of Congress.


	Like any other bill, it will be sent up to the Senate, where — if leadership decides to bring it to a vote — it would require only a simple majority to pass. It would then head to Trump's desk. The president has already indicated he would sign the bill if it does. “I'm all for it,” he said as part of his response to a question on Monday about whether he'd sign the bill.

The iconic horror franchise gets a theatrical makeover in the spooky stage play Paranormal Activity. This new story mirrors the style, structure, and escalating dread of the six-film series. But make no mistake: while there's an emotional spine holding the narrative together, it's the special effects designed by illusionist Chris Fisher (the mastermind behind the jaw-dropping moments in Stranger Things: The First Shadow and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child) that audiences will be buzzing about long after they've exited the theater. This production is built on “how did they do THAT?” energy, and it delivers.

The plot centers on Lou (Cher Alvarez) and James (Patrick Heusinger), an American couple who've just relocated to London for James's job. They've been placed in a lovely craftsman-style home, the sort of quaint London dwelling that practically begs to be haunted. And as far as Lou is concerned, there's already enough to deal with. They're putting an ocean between themselves and James's mother, Carolanne, played by Shannon Cochran, with an enjoyably meddling edge. (And yes, naming her after “Carolanne” is a delightful wink to Poltergeist.)



Carolanne's anxiety isn't entirely unwarranted. There's a history with Lou's mental health, a series of incidents back in Chicago that still cast a shadow. But Lou insists she's fine, and for a brief moment, the newly arrived couple actually believes they're about to embark on a fresh start.

Then the creepy stuff begins.

At first, it's the small things: power outages, water faucets turning on by themselves, doors that refuse to stay closed. But as Lou becomes convinced something supernatural is inside the house – and as James tries very, very hard to be the rational one – the audience watches their grip on reality begin to slip. Once James finally accepts that something is happening, they call in the wonderfully quirky ghost-hunting podcaster Etheline Cotgrave (Kate Fry). Let's just say her visit doesn't go well, and the haunting escalates into a full-force assault. Along the way, the couple's buried secrets snap to the surface, offering clues to who or what might be tormenting their home.

To be clear, the story of Paranormal Activity isn't breaking new ground. A couple moves into a house. Weird things occur. Trauma resurfaces. Something sinister demands attention. It's Horror 101. But seeing this kind of story unfold live gives it a fresh charge. One of the defining traits of the films is the found-footage style that encourages audiences to scan every corner for a flicker of movement. The stage production cleverly replicates that feeling. With Gareth Fry's sound design building the franchise's signature low, ominous rumble (the audio clue that a scare is coming), the entire house set becomes a minefield of suspense. The two-story design ensures the audience's eyes are constantly darting, trying to anticipate which hallway, staircase, or shadowy nook will erupt next.



And many of those moments truly land. The audience I saw it with screamed, gasped, clutched strangers, and occasionally laughed just to release the tension. I won't spoil a single effect, but several of them are as impressive as anything I've seen in a Broadway-scale thriller.

As directed by Felix Barrett (Sleep No More) and restaged by the show's playwright Levi Holloway (The Grey House), the pacing is tight, the atmosphere immersive, and the commitment to the franchise's tone surprisingly faithful. There are, however, a few drawbacks. The actors' volume is often so low that major plot points get swallowed, perhaps intentionally, to make the audience lean in before a scare hits with a jump-worthy jolt. Effective, yes, but occasionally frustrating. (This tactic was used purposely in the horror classic The Exorcist.)  The second act is also dimly lit to the point of murkiness, which contributes to the mood but sometimes makes it difficult to see who's where and what's happening.

Still, those issues don't sink the production. If anything, they feel like growing pains for a show experimenting with how far live theater can push 21st-century horror. And as someone who genuinely loves the Paranormal Activity films, I wasn't convinced the franchise would translate to a stage. Turns out, it absolutely does.

For fans of the movies, this is a must-see. For theatergoers looking for something different, atmospheric, and seasonally spooky, this is a wildly entertaining night out. Paranormal Activity isn't just a theatrical adaptation; it's a reminder that live theater, with the right team, can still find thrilling new ways to make an entire audience jump out of their seats.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The 27-year-old long-term girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel will be issued a security detail in light of the growing number of death threats waged against her.

“Ms. Wilkins is receiving a protective detail because she has faced hundreds of credible death threats related to her relationship with Director Patel, whom she has been dating for three years. Out of respect for her safety, we will not be providing additional details,” the FBI said in a statement.

The decision to grant Wilkins' a security detail is quite unusual. Even former FBI Director Christopher Wray's wife Helen Wray didn't have her own personal security detail. She was only given security protection when she travelled with Wray, MS NOW reported. Wilkins and Patel also don't share a residence together. Wilkins lives in Nashville, Tennessee, and Patel splits his time between Washington D.C. and Las Vegas. The couple have been dating since 2023.

Wilkins' security detail will consist of agents  who are a part of the SWAT team assigned to the FBI Nashville's field office. Sources familiar with the FBI told MS NOW that by having these SWAT agents assigned to Wilkins it could cause delays in their response to critical situations such as mass shootings or terrorist attacks.



The reported increased death threats waged against Wilkins comes amid an ongoing conspiracy theory that Wilkins is an Israeli intelligence asset, who is only dating Patel to extract information. Wilkins, who is neither Israeli or Jewish, filed a lawsuit against Kyle Seraphin, an ex-FBI turned YouTuber. He is the main conspirator behind these allegations against Wilkins.

Just a few weeks ago, Seraphin revealed that Patel had used the FBI private jet to fly to see Wilkins perform at an event in Pennsylvania. FBI Directors are required to use the private FBI plane even for personal travel, but they are required to reimburse the government for the commercial price of a flight. However, Patel was previously highly critical for Wray's use of the private jet for travel. Patel took to X to defend Wilkins amid the news of his travels to see her. 

“I've always said — criticize me all you want. But going after the people doing great work, my personal life, or those around me is a total disgrace,” he wrote earlier this month on the social platform X. “The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis — a true patriot and the woman I'm proud to call my partner in life — are beyond pathetic. She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes. I'm so blessed she's in my life.”

US Representative Anna Paulina Luna has intensified her push for transparency around UFO and UAP programmes, alleging that critical footage and data are being concealed under a classified 'black congressional budget.'

Luna, who chairs the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, argues that lawmakers and taxpayers are being shut out of programmes that may involve advanced aircraft and unexplained phenomena.

Her comments, made during interviews with The Joe Rogan Experience, FOX 13 Tampa Bay, and the Hindustan Times, have reignited debate over how the US government handles sensitive UAP material — and whether elected officials truly have oversight.

Luna told Joe Rogan that she has viewed classified photographs inside a secure federal facility, claiming the objects depicted were 'not made by mankind.' She said whistle-blowers and military personnel have repeatedly described encounters with craft capable of manoeuvres that defy physics.

Several sources, she insisted, referred to the operators of these craft as 'interdimensional beings' — entities capable of moving 'outside of time and space.'

Luna clarified that she has not seen aliens or open portals herself, but said: 'I have seen photographic evidence in a SCIF, where I was briefed.' She suggested that descriptions from ancient texts, including missing biblical writings, may echo similar encounters.

She argues that congressional oversight is being obstructed by limited access to both the data and funding behind these projects, according to Hindustan Times.

In an interview with FOX 13 Tampa Bay, Luna pressed: 'Why can't we see some of these classified videos and information that seem to be operating under a black Congressional budget? ... Congress is not being given access to money that we're spending.'

She added that the lack of access is both a national security and democratic accountability issue: 'If these are programs ... responsible for ... billions of dollars being lost ... that could be going towards other things.'

Luna described questioning whistle-blowers and military personnel about the unknown craft, and she recounted that 'the repeated answer was that these were interdimensional beings—they defy conventional physics.'

She emphasised caution, clarifying, 'I have never seen a portal open or a full alien spaceship, but I have seen photographic evidence in a secure, compartmented information facility, where I was briefed.'

She suggested a possible link between ancient texts and modern phenomena, asserting that '[descriptions in the missing books of the Bible] may echo the encounters I'm investigating.'

Luna recounted a confrontation at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, saying that "despite being on a congressional delegation, we were denied access to pilots and evidence."

She claimed the base commander cited insufficient security authorisation. Luna said she challenged the commander, insisting that as elected officials, they are entitled to oversight.

Luna's push for declassification is not without controversy. She has expressed frustration with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, asserting that a 'protective complex' exists to keep these phenomena secret.

Yet she remains determined, calling for more congressional hearings, oversight, and public accountability. Her stated goals are 'to prove that humans are not alone, and to ensure taxpayers know how money is being used in highly secretive defence programmes.'

As the debate over UAP disclosure intensifies, Luna's demands spotlight the ongoing tension between national security and democratic transparency, raising questions that extend far beyond Capitol Hill.

[NOTE: The following true story was told live by Juliet Pokorny, during the West Side Stories performance that took place on Wednesday, November 12 at the Polly Klaas Community Theater. This was one of several stories shared that evening. At the end of the show, the audience selected this one as their favorite. The theme for November was “Sour Grapes.”]

Have you ever had a supernatural experience? Like, maybe a voice that's not in your head, but also not a real person out there, but you hear it anyway, something in that regard? I'm about to tell a story about four supernatural experiences that happened over many years – that I didn't realize were connected until much, much later.

It started when I was about 21, when I was invited to a Spiritualist Church. I don't know if you've ever been to one, but it's just like a regular church, except the ministers are psychic, and at the end, instead of putting money in a dish, you put in a note, and they give you feedback on a question that you might have.

It was my first time, so I put a note in that said, “Whatever you think I need to know.”

Of course, I did not think that my note would be pulled. Towards the end of their giving feedback to people, the psychic pulled a note out and I immediately knew it was mine because I could feel a pulse inside me. He looked around the room, saw me, and said, “Your brother is going to need you. Not now, not soon, but much later, and when he does, you will be there for him.”

And he looked at me directly and said, “Got it?”

It kind of freaked me out, but I said, “Uh huh,” and I will tell you, I then completely forgot about this message after I left, and never thought about it again.

That's number one.

About 25 years later, my brother calls me to tell me he has cancer. He called all of the family, each one of us separately, and when I think about how excruciating that must have been for him, because we were all upset and there he was consoling us, right? Telling us he's going to be fine, he's going to have surgery, and then radiation, and he'll be okay.

So that's what we all were told.

And a few months later, I get a call from one of his closest friends, Schaefer, who's a retired nurse. She's gentle, and has a sweet gentle voice, and she says, “Juliet, I need to tell you Wayne's dying, and he'll never tell you that. He has about three months to live. I want you to know this so you can make some decisions on how you want to spend time with him.”

And in that moment, I hear a voice – not in my head, but not really out there, but somewhere in between that – and the voice said, “This is it. This is what the psychic was telling you. It's your time.”

That's number two.

I immediately went into action. I changed my schedule, and started I driving down to Watsonville two or three times a week to have dinner with him.

It was pre-legal marijuana, so I made marijuana butter and I put it in all his food and we watched movies, and I brought my girls down every weekend so they could see him, right up until that last month. And his wife Helen asked me if I'd move in with them and be one of his primary caretakers, which was sad and hard, but truly one of the most beautiful gifts that could be given … to help somebody cross over.

The day before he passed, his shaman came to the house. She moved everything out of his room, off his shelves, and she put these soft cloths over everything to make it very simple, and not busy when he was looking around. And then she sat down and quietly talked to him about the next things he could expect while he was about to cross over. And lastly, she took out a little tiny bag, and from it she took out some rice and some wheat or something, and she opened his hand and put it in and closed it, and she said, “You don't want to go to the other side without having something to offer them.”

He nodded … and then the next day he passed, surrounded by his friends and his family, and we left his house and walked around the premises of a vineyard that he was a farmer at. He'd built this vineyard. He was a farmer. SO we walked around it and just admired the grapes on the vines – and I finally got to go home.

I stood in the shower, finally alone, and then there was this voice, it was like Siri on crack or something, and it said, “You need to go across the street to your neighbor Stacey's house.”

So, I got out of the shower and Dave said, “Stacey just came over. She wants you to go over to her house.”

Okay. So we go over, and we sit down, and she pours two glasses of wine. And I get to talk about Wayne. I talk about what a beautiful, gentle spirit he was, how much he loved farming and how much he loved the Earth. And I told her about us walking around the vineyard after his passing and she said, “Well, what's his wine?”

And I said, “Oh, you've never heard of it. It's only in, like, five-star restaurants.” She said, “Well, what's it called?” And I said, “Clos LaChance,” and she says, “Really?” And she reaches over and shows me the label.

And we've been drinking my brother's wine.

So that's number three. Here's number four.

Cut to about two-and-a-half months ago, and Wayne's wife Helen has just passed. Her brother calls me and says, “Come to the house, and I want you to pick up any of Wayne's things that you want.” I say okay. A couple of days later, I wake up in the morning, ready to go, and it's like my brother is sitting on the bed, and he says to me, “You need to go underneath the house, and you need to get my wine.” He said, “This is where it is. You open the door, there's going to be a bike. You're going to turn left, then you're going to turn right, and that's where my wine is.”

And I sort of nod. There's nobody there, but I nod. And he said, “You absolutely must insist.”

And I say, out loud, “Okay!”

So, I get there, and I bring my daughter Alexis. I've told her this story. We get in there and I say to Helen's brother, “Is there any chance I can go down underneath the house?”

And he said, “There's nothing under there but an old bike.”

My daughter says, “Well, we'd still like to get the key, if that's okay.”

He says, “Sure. Go ahead.”

We go down. We open the door. There's the bike. We turn left, We turn right. And lo and behold, there are, like, three cases of his wine. I go upstairs and the brother goes, “See. I told you. Nothing.”

And I said, “Nope. Actually, I found three cases of his wine.”

My brother, through all these years, wanted to make sure I had his wine.

And it was not sour grapes.

Conspiracy theories flooded social media when Cloudflare suffered an outage early Tuesday, causing problems for users on platforms including X, Donald Trump's Truth Social platform and ChatGPT.

In an email shared with Newsweek, a spokesperson for the internet services company said: "Many of Cloudflare's services experienced a significant outage today beginning around 10:20 UTC. It was fully resolved at 14:30 UTC. The root cause of the outage was a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic."

The issue was fixed in six hours, but that didn't stop the conspiracy theorists, who linked the outage with the Epstein files vote in Congress.

The outage occurred the same morning that the House of Representatives was preparing to hold a vote on the release of files relating to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender found dead in a cell in August, 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Though his death was ruled a suicide, it has long been at the center of conspiracy theories due to his well-documented connections to public and powerful figures, including President Donald Trump.

The outcome of the procedural votes and debates on the Epstein Files Transparency Act, authored by representatives Thomas Massie, R-Ky, and Ro Khanna, D-Calif, could have significant implications for transparency regarding one of the most high-profile criminal cases in recent decades, and it marks a rare bipartisan push for greater government disclosure.  

The Cloudflare outage occurring on the same day as the vote sparked conspiracy theories online, and social media users attempted to draw a connection between the two events.

One post on X, from the account @GermanicFren, which has over 50,000 followers, reads "Oh you're gonna vote on releasing the epstein files??? Shut down the internet!!"

Another post, from the account @leave_not_liv reads "if you're having issues with this app or other websites today, it's because cloudflare is having a software issue causing mass outages today interesting that this is happening as the Epstein files goes to a vote and a potential release may happen."

A spokesperson for Cloudflare, which delivers multiple websites on its global cloud network, told Newsweek the configuration file that caused the outage "grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare's services." 

The account @Patriot7712pt3, which has over 10,000 followers on X, posted: "It's no coincidence Cloudflare went down right before the vote on releasing the Epstein case files."

The account @iArtSoometimes, which has over 20,000 followers on X: "Cloudflare outage same day as Epstein House vote…coincidence? I THINK NOT!"

Cloudflare, in a statement to Newsweek over email: "To be clear, there is no evidence that this was the result of an attack or caused by malicious activity. We expect that some Cloudflare services will be briefly degraded as traffic naturally spikes post incident but we expect all services to return to normal in the next few hours. A detailed explanation will be posted soon on blog.cloudfare.com. Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable. We apologize to our customers and the internet in general for letting you down today. We will learn from today's incident and improve."

Procedural votes and debates were scheduled to get underway in the House at 10 a.m.

Laura Lynne Jackson says she was 11 years old when she discovered her psychic abilities. One summer day while she was swimming and playing with her siblings, she remembers, Jackson's mother said she was heading out to visit their grandparents. Jackson says she was seized by a sudden sense of panic; she knew she had to go with her mom and see her grandfather. They had a wonderful day together, and two days later, he was admitted into the hospital. She never saw him again.

She says she was riddled with guilt: Was I complicit in his death? Her mom pushed back. “No normal kid is supposed to know when somebody they love so profoundly is going to die,” Jackson says. “But she said to me, ‘Laura, no part of you is dark or cursed or broken. This is just an extra ability you have, and it's a beautiful part of you. You don't need to be scared of it. Just accept it and embrace it.'”

It took decades, but eventually Jackson did just that. She studied to become an English teacher, but after she had her first daughter, Jackson says she couldn't ignore her gift anymore and she started studying to be a certified medium. Now, she's one of the world's most famous psychics. Her clients include Gwyneth Paltrow and Kim Kardashian, and she has written two New York Times best-selling books — perhaps most famously Signs: The Secret Language of the Universe, which shows readers how to recognize messages from loved ones who have died and, most recently, Guided: The Secret Path to an Illuminated Life, which was published on November 11. (How did she feel, I wondered, about the TikTok video Kardashian posted after our interview saying that four unnamed psychics were “fucking full of shit” because they told her she was going to pass the bar exam and she didn't? Jackson's representatives declined to provide a comment.)

In Guided, Jackson encourages her readers to be open to messages and guidance from the other side. In order for these signs to even reach us in the first place, she says we have to remain receptive to the possibility that there are forces greater than us who are wanting and willing to give us whatever help we're looking for. We just have to ask. I took that invitation literally and called up Jackson at her home on Long Island to ask about her new book, her backstory, and what she'd say to the skeptics among us.

One of the major messages in your books is that we all have psychic abilities and are able to connect with the other side. What do you mean by that?I'm actually a huge skeptic; I'm always raising an eyebrow at certain things. But I want to normalize this because this is a very inherent part of all of us. We have this doorway within us that's so beautiful — that connects us to our “Team of Light,” connects us to our soul, our higher self — and the guidance is right there inside.

I think what happens to most people is they distance themselves from their spiritual self. They distance themselves from trusting their intuition. That's where I come in. You do not need to go to a psychic or a medium or a psychic medium or anybody to open that up. You don't need anybody to activate it for you. I still see myself as a teacher. I happen to be a psychic medium, but I'm teaching people how to access this inside of themselves.

The No. 1 thing you just have to do is you have to set the intention in your thoughts. You don't have to say it out loud — you can if you'd like to — but you just set the intention with your Team of Light and you say, I'm ready. I'm open. Please guide me. Show me my abilities. Help lead me to the people and the experiences and the books and the situations that I'm meant to experience on my journey to help open me up. Once you open your mind and your heart to this truth, magical things happen.

What do you mean by “Team of Light”?I believe we all have a Team of Light on the other side. It's made up of three parts: It's God energy, it's what I refer to as spirit guides — throughout history, these might be referred to as guardian angels: these angelic beings who are your teachers and your mentors, who your soul contracts with before you come here to Earth School, and they're just there to guide you — and then the third part of that is your Team of Light on the other side.

How do you suppose people can connect to that?Light energy can manipulate small metallic objects, like putting coins in our path — pennies, dimes, or nickels. They love to also mess with electrical devices, anything from making the lights go wonky to shutting the TV on and off. They will send creatures that navigate this world using electromagnetic fields, like butterflies, dragonflies, deer, fox, and every type of bird there is. Sometimes they'll send their initials or their names on license plates. They'll put stuff in your social-media feed that they want you to experience or that's going to remind you of them.

That's what they're creating with you, but in order to develop this language together, you need to ask for something really specific. I always encourage people to create four different ways the other side can communicate with them. Pick an animal, but I always say make it a little different because when you get your animal, your logical mind is going to be like, Oh, that's a coincidence. That was too easy. Pick a number sequence. Pick a phrase — it could be anything that was important to you from when you were younger or one that just pops in your mind right now. Then pick a song. And now you have created four different ways your Team of Light can communicate with you.

I think the greatest way we can honor those signs and that communication and that connection is to tell someone else about our sign story or to tell somebody else about the guidance we felt. That's how we honor that ongoing relationship.

What would you say to someone who might be skeptical and think those signs are just, well, coincidences?That's a great thing, that they are questioning themselves, because that means they are a seeker and they're a critical thinker. I think that we have been taught to fear and doubt any spiritual experience we have. We have been taught to disempower ourselves by labeling it “woo-woo,” by being scared of it, by not giving it credence, and by not honoring it. If people say to themselves, I asked for this sign, and I got it — could that be a coincidence?, I always say to those people, “Ask for another one, and you're going to get it.” Just keep trying the language. Change the sign; ask for a new sign. You're going to get that. I think what happens for people when they keep having these experiences — they have to own it as their own truth. I think it can be so beautiful when we have this reawakening.

Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Gwyneth Paltrow blurbed Guided. How did you connect with them? I've never advertised my services in all my life. The only way you could ever find me is if somebody had a reading with me or if you came to the Forever Family Foundation, where I volunteered.

One thing that I've always been aware of is what a gift it is to have a platform and help the world. Every single person you just mentioned, and everybody I have been so blessed to get to know, I met organically. It was never anything I tried to make happen. I was guided to those people — or you could say they were guided to me. I know there are always perceptions about outward persona, tabloid fodder, this or that, but I will tell you everybody that you've mentioned is so loving, kind, and supportive. So many people think Hollywood is vapid, but no — it's not. People are so loving and kind to one another. It's incredible.

I think, also, because they've had their own experiences with the other side, they know it's the truth — and so they're going to share that to help others. I've always said the greatest part of my life journey is who I've met along the way. That doesn't just mean celebrities; there are so many relationships I hold sacred that I've met through this work that have become such a big part of my heart. I think we're guided to the people on the path we're meant to know.

In Guided, you emphasize that in order to receive signs and messages from the universe and the other side, we have to start by being open to it. What tangible steps do you think people can take to do this?The most important step to living a guided life is just by simply setting your intention in your thoughts that you want to be guided. It is that simple. Our thoughts are more powerful than we can even fathom, and that every thought we have, we're either putting more light into the world or more darkness.

Step two is opening your mind and your heart to being able to recognize the guidance and being able to tell your logical mind to sit down, be quiet, and honor the truth of that guidance. One way you can do that is by talking to others, by telling your story, saying, “I experienced this. I want to tell you about my connection.” Just those two little things: Setting the intention, and then being in a state of openness to recognize and receive that guidance, is phenomenal. It can change small things or it can change big things in your life. You can ask for guidance on everything, from being guided to a good parking spot to being guided into your career change or the next relationship.

Guided is about what happens when you get rid of the fear — when you master the doubt and you are in a state of connectivity with your Team of Light and you trust what you're getting. That's when the magic happens.

Cynthia Erivo channeled the dark side of her character, Elphaba, in a theatrical black gown from Balenciaga. The dress featured a drop waist silhouette with a voluminous skirt. The bodice was fitted, with fabric contrast from a soft tone to a glossy sheen. Twirling feather motifs featured along the bustline, while the long sleeves included a glove element to frame the Oscar-nominated actress' nails.

Makeup for Erivo's look was provided by Joanna Simkin, with nail tech by Shea Osei. The actress' look was curated by stylist Jason Bolden.

Ariana Grande turned to a design by Schiaparelli's creative director, Daniel Roseberry. The custom haute couture dress featured a ballgown silhouette with a black ruched crepe and satin bustier, which laced up the back. The bodice also included delicate side bows and the Italian fashion house's signature keyhole embroidery at the bustier. The voluminous skirt was crafted with 200 meters of silk organza and tulle split into 20 ruffles.

Grande accessorized her look with jewelry pieces by Swarovski, for which she serves as a global brand ambassador. Makeup artist Michael Anthony and hairstylist Alyx Liu provided glam for the actress, with image architect Law Roach curating the Oscar-nominated star's look.

Michelle Yeoh wore the voluminous final look from Givenchy's fall 2025 ready-to-wear collection designed by Sarah Burton. The ample frame of the dress created a quasi-bubbled effect in a light yellow shade with layers of tulle fabric. Yeoh accessorized with a bold statement necklace with her hair coiffed in a pixie cut.

Marissa Bode opted for a design by Anne Barge for her red carpet attire. The strapless dress evoked the Wicked Witch of the West in its dark shade of forest green. Styled by Alexandra Mandelkorn, Bode accentuated her “Wicked”-inspired attire with a pair of silver sparkling Christian Louboutin shoes akin to the memorable ruby red slippers from “The Wizard of Oz.”

Colman Domingo wore a look by Dolce & Gabbana. The Oscar-nominated actor's attire wholly evoked The Cowardly Lion from “The Wizard of Oz,” with a statement furry coat with long sleeves and an exaggerated lapel. Domingo also wore a flowing cream shirt, light beige pants, and brown loafers with tassels. The actor's look was curated by styling team Wayman Bannerman and Micah McDonald.

Jeff Goldblum channeled his Wizard of Oz character in a custom Prada look. Harkening back to the 1939 costumes for the original “Wizard of Oz,” Goldblum's look, styled by Andrew T. Vottero, featured a green vest atop an emerald dress shirt, coordinated with a velvet blue, long-sleeve coat. A gold watch accessorized the waist of Goldblum's attire, which was capped off with a pair of neutral gray trousers.

“Wicked: For Good” is the sequel to the 2024 film based on the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, which follows the relationship between Glinda, The Good Witch of the North, played by Grande, and Elphaba, The Wicked Witch of the West, played by Erivo, as Dorothy Gale crash lands into Oz. The film hits theaters Friday.

A machine learning framework can distinguish molecules made by biological processes from those formed through non-biological processes and could be used to analyze samples returned by current and future planetary missions. The findings are published in the journal PNAS Nexus.

José C. Aponte, Amirali Aghazadeh, and colleagues analyzed eight carbonaceous meteorites and ten terrestrial geologic samples using two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Using this data, the authors developed LifeTracer, a computational framework that processes mass spectrometry data and applies machine learning to identify patterns distinguishing abiotic from biotic origins. A logistic regression model trained on compound-level features achieved over 87% accuracy in classifying samples as meteoritic or terrestrial.

The analysis identified 9,475 peaks in meteorite samples and 9,070 in terrestrial samples, with statistically significant differences between the two sample types in molecular weight distributions and retention times, which describes how long it takes the compound to move through the chromatograph's two columns. Organic compounds in meteorite samples showed significantly lower retention times, consistent with higher volatility in abiotically formed materials.

The framework identified polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and alkylated variants as key predictive features, with naphthalene emerging as the most predictive compound for abiotic samples. According to the authors, the approach enables scalable, unbiased biosignature detection and could be a powerful tool for interpreting complex organic mixtures that will be returned by current and future planetary sample return missions.

If it weren't for an Ashkenazi Jew named Stanton T. Friedman, the world might have long ago forgotten what's come to be known simply as the “Roswell incident.”

Instead, countless books, documentaries and made-for-TV dramas have explored the 1947 discovery of mysterious materials found on a New Mexico ranch that Friedman argued were the relics of extraterrestrials. A wave of successors, including a prominent Israeli-American physicist, continue to press the case for alien contact. And this dusty desert town has been transformed according to an unusual paradox: It's shaped by conspiracy theories, yet is home to virtually no Jews.

Roswell's only synagogue, Congregation B'nai Israel, closed up and moved to Albuquerque five years ago.

“They didn't have a rabbi and they only met twice a month, on Fridays,” said Leslie Lawner, who made the move with her husband in 2020, reducing Roswell's tiny Jewish population by two. “There was really nothing we could do for them.”

The Lawners left behind a town that is largely defined by what happened in the summer of 1947, when local rancher W.W. “Mac” Brazen found rubber strips, tin foil, thick paper and other debris on his property and shared the material with Sheriff George Wilcox of Roswell.

The sheriff brought the unusual artifacts to the attention of the Roswell Army Air Field, which on July 9 of that year announced that it had recovered the remains of a “flying disc.”
The outrageous RAAF claim was quickly denounced as erroneous by local military officials who said the debris was actually the wreckage of a crashed weather balloon and related equipment.

That would have been the end of it, if not for Friedman, a nuclear physicist and highly regarded “ufologist” who revisited the incident in the 1970s, devoting the rest of his life to proving the existence of flying saucers. In 1987, Friedman — who died six years ago — told The New York Times that federal officials had engaged in a “cosmic Watergate” to cover up the truth.

Now, this remote city of 47,000, located east of the White Sands Missile Range and about a three-hour drive southeast of Albuquerque, is known for one thing and one thing only: flying saucers.

Here in Roswell, those saucers are ubiquitous — beginning with one atop the “Welcome to Roswell” sign east of town along U.S. 380. There's also a UFO-shaped McDonald's, along with a bug-eyed little green alien relaxing under an umbrella in front of the nearby Western Inn.

Another extraterrestrial creature reclines on a bed in the display window of White Mattress, not to mention yet another, even more tacky, E.T. proudly holding up the Dunkin Donuts marquee along Main Street. Not surprisingly, Martians are a common theme in Halloween displays here.

In 1997, the Air Force — attempting to dispel rumors that had persisted for decades — released a 231-page report concluding that alien bodies recovered at the Roswell crash site weren't aliens at all, but dummies used in parachute tests. It also said that the “spacecraft” that had fallen to Earth on Brazen's ranch was really an Air Force balloon used in a top-secret program code-named Project Mogul to monitor the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests.

Asked at the time if the new report would finally put the matter to rest, retired Air Force Col. Richard Weaver told NBC's Today show: “No, I doubt it. This has become a religion to many people. It's almost a cult. Certainly, an unbelievable financial opportunity for many folks. So I think this is going to endure.”

Now, the town has taken on added prominence with the Pentagon's recent establishment of an All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office. President Donald Trump is a known skeptic of UFOs. But in a 2020 campaign video, he said, “Roswell's a very interesting place with a lot of people that would like to know what's going on.”

In a town forged around the religion of aliens, Jewish life is virtually nonexistent. There aren't enough Jews here to make a minyan — let alone support a synagogue — and the few who did live here have mostly died off or moved away.

Lawner and her husband Bob rarely attended services at Congregation B'nai Israel, located a block from their house at 8th and Washington, during their 27 years in Roswell. But Lawner did help develop a curriculum on Holocaust studies for Sidney Gutierrez Middle School, which she helped found and where she taught for 17 years.

It was an area of inquiry that overlapped with one outlandish but persistent theory about the Roswell incident. Annie Jacobsen claims in her 2012 book, “Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base,” that just before the Roswell crash, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin recruited Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele — the infamous Auschwitz “angel of death” — to create “grotesque, child-size aviators” to pilot a plane in order to trigger widespread panic throughout the United States.



The obsession with aliens has divided Jewish voices. An Orthodox Jewish rabbinical authority, Rabbi Pini Dunner of Beverly Hills, California, has called the Roswell incident “nonsense.”

“Most people don't believe any of this, nor, for that matter, do we entertain the claims of those who maintain that the Apollo moon landings were all an elaborate hoax, or that Denver International Airport stands above an underground city that serves as a headquarters for the masonically inspired New World Order,” Dunner wrote in an online post. “It's not that any of these conspiracy stories can be categorically disproved, but we feel they do not need to be. The question is: why would any intelligent person believe such nonsense to be true?”

But some Jews are attached to the idea that aliens are out there — including one of the most prominent scientists making the case today. The Israeli-American physicist Avi Loeb, who runs a lab at Harvard University, argues that some objects and phenomena in space cannot be explained except as evidence of extraterrestrial technology.

Loeb has emphasized the appeal of aliens and space exploration on Jewish grounds. “It is reasonable to imagine the absence of antisemitism in interstellar space,” he wrote earlier this year, noting that anything traveling from the other side of the Milky Way would have had to set out before there were Jews.

This month, Loeb released new data that he said suggested that an object in space that will come within 269 million kilometers of Earth later this year may have extraterrestrial origins. The resulting frenzy has embroiled U.S. transportation officials and even Kim Kardashian.

Loeb's argument is rooted in theoretical physics. But here in Roswell, aliens are experienced in concrete terms. Factual or not, this past July, Roswell marked 78 years since the mysterious 1947 event, with an annual Roswell UFO Festival that lures thousands of tourists from all 50 states and beyond.

Every year, sidewalk vendors do a brisk business selling funnel cakes, alien salt-and-pepper shakers and other trinkets, while tourists happily pay $5 each to visit the downtown International UFO Museum and Research Center.

“These exhibits are designed not to convince anyone to believe one way or another about their subjects,” says a sign at the museum's entrance. “Visitors are encouraged to ask questions.”

Local merchants don't seem to care much what really transpired that night in 1947. They're just grateful for all the desperately needed cash this festival generates.

“Roswell didn't have a tourist industry and one of my friends was telling me about this UFO stuff. So we started the UFO Festival,” said Tim Jennings, the town's mayor. “I don't know what happened, but something definitely happened. It's not unreasonable. We live out in the middle of the desert, and without a lot of bright lights, at night you can see a lot.”

Added Todd Wildermuth, Roswell's public information officer: “I don't have an opinion about it. I haven't really given it any deep thought.”

To say Roswell is remote is a vast understatement. Some 140 miles from the nearest interstate highway, the town is also unbearably hot and dry. One quickly learns not to go anywhere without a water bottle; it's even better to stay inside where there's air-conditioning.

Roswell is certainly not the kind of place to visit if you don't like reptiles and other poisonous creatures. At the local Home Depot, two of the biggest-selling items, along with plywood and barbecue grills, are Harris Scorpion Killer and Snake-A-Way pellets.

These days, only a handful of Jews remain in Roswell. A Google search for “Roswell” and “Jewish” reveals three synagogues in Roswell, Georgia — a suburb of Atlanta — one of which is a Messianic church.

“There was never a large community here,” said Cymantha Liakos, a Philadelphia native who wasn't raised as a Jew but recently took a DNA test and discovered she has Jewish ancestry. Liakos, a former geologist, settled in Roswell with her husband, William, a doctor.

Her 23-year-old son, John, a graduate of the nearby New Mexico Military Institute, visited Israel in 2022 as the first Roswell native (and quite possibly the last) ever to participate in Birthright, the program that takes young Jews to Israel on free trips.

Today, the corner structure that had housed B'nai Israel since its establishment in the 1940s is a medical clinic.

“The building was deteriorating and there was no one within the group who knew how to keep it up,” said Judy Stubbs, B'nai Israel's former treasurer. “Since there was so few of us left, we decided it was in our best interests to sell it.”

The community's Torah, meanwhile, has found a new home at Congregation Nahalat Shalom in Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city and home to many of the state's estimated 25,000 Jews. In 2018, Roswell's dwindling Jewish community agreed to “indefinitely loan” Nahalat Shalom the sacred scroll, which had been rescued from a small town in Czechoslovakia by the Karnowsky family during World War II.

In 2018, Nahalat Shalom's spiritual leader, Rabbi Min Kantrowitz, led a special Simchat Torah dedication service in the presence of Kathryn Karnowsky and her Jewish friends from Roswell.

So what do the handful of Jews remaining in Roswell think about the 1947 “incident” that made their town famous?

“My husband is from a ranching family with longtime roots in this area, and all of their ranch neighbors strongly believe it is not a hoax,” said Liakos. “There was an incident, and a government cover-up. Both of us are scientists, and we're not shrugging it off as ridiculous.”

Stubbs, a longtime resident of Roswell and former city council member, agrees with her friend.

“People ask me that all the time,” said Stubbs, who remains active in politics. “With all the continued hype, I believe something must have happened. A lot of people come here to find out, but no one has the answer. Unless the federal government chooses to open the records, it's a question that will never be answered.

A private investigator working on the Amy Bradley case claims he has bombshell new evidence. On November 14, 2025, PI Jim Carey revealed that an ex-cop demanded $50,000 ransom to locate the missing woman. The family agreed to pay but the deal collapsed unexpectedly.



Netflix's “Amy Bradley Is Missing” documentary reportedly omitted crucial details about this shocking revelation. The case involves a police clerk from Curaçao who signed an Interpol contract for Amy's safe return.

Herman Goilo, a police clerk in Curaçao, first contacted the Bradley family in 1999. He claimed he had seen Amy Bradley alive on the island. Goilo insisted he could locate her but demanded $50,000 for her release.

According to PI Jim Carey, the family agreed to pay. They worked with Interpol to arrange the exchange. In June 2000, Interpol drafted a contract for Amy's safe release, and Goilo signed it.

However, when agents arrived with a cashier's check, everything fell apart. Goilo refused to accept a check—he wanted cash. The family couldn't carry $50,000 onto an island legally.

The deal collapsed, and decades of mystery followed. Carey told NewsNation that Goilo broke into the Interpol agents' hotel room looking for the money. This incident ended the negotiation permanently.

When Carey, his son Brodie, and two investigators traveled to Curaçao in October 2024, they confronted Goilo again. His response was stunning. He claimed Amy was still alive but “a very different woman.”

Goilo stated she was hooked on drugs and last seen in 2016. Carey says they gave Goilo multiple chances to come clean during their confrontation. The investigator finds the Netflix documentary's omission of this story baffling.

The series focused on accident-versus-trafficking theories. It missed potential leads about the ransom deal and police involvement. This has created controversy around the documentary's completeness.

Carey has been working unpaid since 2021. He relies on GoFundMe donations to fund his ongoing investigation. He believes several critical leads remain unexplored by official channels.

Carey's primary theory suggests Amy was trafficked. He points to a band member from the cruise ship as a potential suspect. The trafficking network may have extended throughout the Caribbean islands.

The involvement of a police clerk suggests possible corruption. This could explain why the investigation faced obstacles in Curaçao. Goilo's continued silence supports this theory.

Forensic analysts are examining escort website photos from 2005. Some images bear a striking resemblance to Amy Bradley. The analysis remains ongoing but shows promise.

Every year at Christmas and Thanksgiving, someone logs onto the campaign website from Bridgetown, Barbados. This pattern suggests someone is monitoring the investigation closely. It could be Amy's captors.

The Amy Bradley case remains one of America's most haunting unsolved mysteries. The newly revealed $50,000 ransom deal adds a troubling layer to this decades-long investigation. Despite official declarations, dedicated investigators continue pursuing leads that suggest she may still be alive.

Amy Bradley disappeared on March 24, 1998. She vanished from the Royal Caribbean cruise ship Rhapsody of the Seas. The ship was docked near Curaçao at the time.

Private investigator Jim Carey revealed a failed $50,000 ransom deal. A Curaçao police clerk named Herman Goilo signed an Interpol contract for Amy's return in 2000. The deal collapsed when he demanded cash instead of a check.

No, the documentary omitted this crucial information entirely. Investigator Jim Carey expressed frustration about this omission. He finds the documentary incomplete regarding key investigative leads.

The primary theory suggests she was trafficked by a cruise ship band member. She may have been moved through a Caribbean trafficking network. Some evidence suggests she could still be alive.

Yes, the case remains open with an active $25,000 FBI reward. Private investigators continue working on new leads. The case was officially declared dead in 2010 but investigations persist.

Herman Goilo refused to accept a cashier's check from Interpol agents. He demanded physical cash instead. He then broke into their hotel room searching for the money, ending negotiations.
