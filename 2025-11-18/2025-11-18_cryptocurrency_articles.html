                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vitalik Buterin wants Ethereum to stop changing. Speaking at the Devconnect conference in Buenos Aires, Buterin openly declared that the blockchain's base layer should ossify — locking down core features to prevent changes that could introduce bugs into the ecosystem. “We have a much lower rate of surprises now.” Indeed, for years, Ethereum's ability to change was its main selling point — developers could build anything, and the protocol itself would evolve to support new use cases. Now, Buterin reckons that stability matters more than adaptability. “It's good to maintain some flexibility,” he said. That means layer 2 rollups, wallets, privacy tools, and user-facing applications — not fundamental protocol changes. Layer 2s already handle most of Ethereum's transaction volume. The more activity that moves there, the more space opens up on layer 1 for settlement and security. “It's healthy to move attention out of L1 and into the surrounding ecosystem,” Buterin said. But Buterin admitted the shift comes with tradeoffs. Ethereum's early days had a “spirit of exploration” that has largely disappeared as the ecosystem took unsavoury turns with the surge of memecoins, and simultaneously maturing with the arrival of institutional players. “There is too much of the space that has gone in the direction of ‘if you want to succeed, be a fast follower and copy what's already working,'” he said. Towards the end, Buterin issued a stark warning. Elliptic curve cryptography, the foundation of Ethereum — and Bitcoin's — security, won't last forever. “Elliptic curves are going to die,” he said, pointing to a prediction that the ability of quantum computing to break Ethereum's underlying security model could come before the next US presidential election in 2028. That gives Ethereum roughly four years to migrate to quantum-resistant cryptography — a timeline that assumes quantum computers advance on schedule. But if Buterin's vision holds, those changes will happen at the edges — not in Ethereum's increasingly unchangeable core. Pedro Solimano is DL News' Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI-powered simulation game Dino Tycoon (TYCOON) just posted a massive 123% overnight gain, leading the entire Play-to-Earn (P2E) sector even as the broader crypto market stumbles. But the next project gearing up to take the spotlight is a new crypto mining game that blends P2E mechanics with a fresh mine-to-earn model: PepeNode (PEPENODE). The project has already raised $2.1M in its presale and continues to gather momentum. For the next 48 hours, PEPENODE remains priced at $0.0011546 per token; after this period, the next round begins at a higher price. The game features classic tycoon-style gameplay, where players manage assets, resources, and visitor flow – all wrapped in a blockchain layer that lets them earn TYCOON tokens. What makes TYCOON's surge even more surprising is the market backdrop. Bitcoin recently slipped below $90,000 (a level not seen since February) before bouncing to $91,000 as of writing. It is possible that investors are shifting their focus toward projects with higher breakout potential, rather than relying on sluggish top-cap assets. Still in presale and already raising millions, it carries the hallmarks of a project capable of drawing users back into crypto one player at a time. PepeNode could attract a new inflow of crypto users because it reimagines mining, which is something familiar to the community yet increasingly inaccessible to everyday investors. This is because competing with today's industrial-scale miners requires massive capital, specialized rigs, and soaring electricity costs. Every player starts in an empty virtual server room, and from there, they have full control over how their mining operation evolves. Using PEPENODE tokens, which are currently available only in presale, players can begin building out their mining rigs by purchasing nodes. Each node is unique, which introduces an element of strategy and randomness. Combine the right nodes, and you suddenly have a meme-coin-generating machine. PepeNode isn't repeating the same mistakes that Axie Infinity, StepN, and so many early P2E projects made. Those games collapsed because they ignored the most important element of any Play-to-Earn ecosystem: sound, sustainable tokenomics. Most P2E tokens lost value over time because players primarily used them for one purpose – cashing out to fiat. And here's the real game-changer (literally) – 70% of all PEPENODE used for upgrades is permanently burned. Anyone who wants to ramp up their mining potential and chase top meme-coin rewards will eventually have to buy PEPENODE at a higher price. Players are incentivized to spend PEPENODE, not sell it, especially when spending it leads to earning top meme coins like PEPE and FARTCOIN, rather than fiat. It's no wonder crypto influencer CryptoTV says PEPENODE could be a 100x play once the presale ends. Now's your chance to get in early as blockchain games start heating up again and secure tokens from a project that's actively avoiding the mistakes of the last P2E cycle. Grab your PEPENODE tokens while the presale is still live. PepeNode is already listed inside Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens feature, making it easy to buy, track, and claim once the game goes live. PepeNode also offers its own staking protocol, letting holders earn yield even before launch, with a dynamic APY currently at 596%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market is falling again on Tuesday, following a sell-off that swept Asia and Europe, as Nvidia, bitcoin and other Wall Street stars keep swinging on worries that their prices shot too high. The S&P 500 dropped 0.7% and pulled further from its all-time high set late last month. What Nvidia does matters disproportionately to savers' 401(k) accounts because it's the most influential stock on Wall Street due to its immense size. It single-handedly steers the direction of the S&P 500 some days, after fervent demand for its artificial-intelligence chips helped it briefly top $5 trillion in total value. The U.S. stock market's recent struggles are a sharp turnaround from a nearly relentless rally since April, when Wall Street last sold off after President Donald Trump shocked the world with stiff tariffs. That rally, though, was so strong that critics said it may have carried prices too high, too fast and left the market at risk of a sharp drop. Nvidia's price more than doubled in four of the last five years, for example, while Palantir Technologies' stock more than doubled in the first six and a half months of this year. 1 risk for the market is, one with a lower probability of happening but a chance of very big damage, 45% pointed to an AI bubble. That beat out potential trouble in the bond market, inflation and trade wars. A record percentage of investors is also saying companies are “overinvesting,” according to the survey. The worry is that all the dollars pouring into AI chips and data centers worldwide may not produce the kind of revolution that AI proponents have been predicting, or at least not as profitable a one. Other high-flying areas of the market with their own evangelists have also been struggling lately. Bitcoin's price briefly fell below $90,000 in the morning, down from nearly $125,000 last month. It later recovered some of its losses and moved above $93,000. Home Depot also helped drag the market lower after falling 4%. Chief among them was a lack of storms, which would have driven customers to buy more home-improvement supplies. Reporting stronger profits is one of the ways a company can make its stock price look less expensive, because stock prices tend to track with earnings over the long term. That's raising the stakes for Wednesday's profit report from Nvidia, which could either help halt its stock's slide or worsen it. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Cloudflare fell 2.4% after an earlier issue at the internet infrastructure provider had caused global outages for ChatGPT and other services. It did not fill in data for the prior three weeks, though. The dearth of data has helped raised doubts about whether the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December, something that traders had earlier seen as very likely. The Fed has cut rates twice already this year in hopes of shoring up a slowing job market. In stock markets abroad, indexes tumbled across Europe and Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 3.2% after feeling extra pressure from a jump in Japanese government bond yields, reflecting rising risks as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to boost government spending and push back the timetable for bringing down Japan's huge national debt. South Korea's Kospi sank 3.3%, and France's CAC 40 fell 1.9% for two of the larger drops worldwide. AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's steep sell-off might have finally run its course, according to Geoffrey Kendrick, the head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered, who argues the pullback follows a familiar pattern and is likely nearing exhaustion. Bitcoin BTC$93,561.27 plunged below $90,000 on Tuesday, extending a drawdown that's erased nearly 30% from the currency's all-time high above $126,000 set in early October. As part of his thesis, Kendrick highlighted key sentiment and valuation metrics that have now reset to levels historically associated with market bottoms. One of those is bitcoin treasury firm Strategy's (MSTR) modified net asset value (mNAV) — a gauge of the firm's bitcoin holdings relative to its share price — which has dropped to parity at 1.0. "A number of other metrics have collapsed to absolute zero levels," he said, suggesting seller exhaustion and capitulation. His outlook echoed recent commentary from analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex. They noted that the pace of short-term holder realized losses begun to slow with onchain capitulation signals emerging, typical markers of a market bottom forming. BTC bounced to just shy of $93,000 on Tuesday, up 3.8% from the overnight lows. LINK could target $14.50 if momentum sustains, CoinDesk Research's analysis tool suggested.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has extended its decline toward a critical higher-timeframe demand zone around $3K. While the broader trend remains pressured, the current location aligns with major liquidity pools and potential areas of interest for large players. A decisive reaction here will determine whether ETH enters a relief phase or continues to deepen toward macro demand levels. This area also aligns closely with the lower boundary of the falling wedge, a pattern typically associated with late-correction phases rather than trend initiation. This shift reflects weakening medium-term momentum, but the clustering of confluence factors around the $3K zone suggests that sellers may soon face diminishing dominance. Should Ethereum stabilise and form a higher low structure within this region, a corrective phase toward $3.4K–$3.55K becomes plausible. On the lower timeframe, Ethereum is moving inside a clearly defined descending channel, with each successive lower high showing weakening volatility. The most recent swing low penetrated beneath the mid-channel liquidity cluster before sharply reversing, a classic liquidity sweep that often precedes short-term relief rallies. The $3K–$3.1K level has now been tested multiple times, forming a near-textbook reaction zone where algorithmic activity is typically concentrated. This configuration appears similar to previous phases where retail capitulation formed near-cycle lows and larger market participants accumulated during structurally discounted price zones. Although there is not yet a clear surge in whale-sized futures orders, the absence of aggressive selling from big hands suggests that the current downturn may reflect forced-liquidation pressure more than deliberate institutional distribution. This interpretation aligns with the futures liquidation heatmap, which shows a dense band of liquidations absorbed around $3K. Historically, such concentrated wipeouts often precede at least a temporary structural recovery as excess leverage is cleared. If Ethereum can defend the current demand region and spot flows begin to reflect larger-size orders, the setup would resemble the early formation of a base before a broader corrective upswing. However, if this region breaks decisively, the next meaningful liquidity concentration lies significantly lower, implying that the market has not yet concluded its deleveraging phase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Major European fintech firm Revolut is teaming with Ethereum scaling network Polygon to power crypto remittances and stablecoin payments via the Revolut app, the network announced on Tuesday. First integrated last December, the network has facilitated more than $690 million in trading volumes via Revolut thus far. "This integration with Revolut represents exactly the kind of real-world utility for everyday people we've been building toward," said Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron, in a statement. "By making blockchain payments invisible to the end user, integrated with everyday traditional payment experiences, and delivering superior speed and cost efficiency, we're seeing the future of finance unfold." Polygon's collaboration with Revolut enables the fintech firm's customers in the UK and European Economic Area (EEA) to make crypto remittances in stablecoins USDC and USDT, as well as POL (formerly MATIC)—the network's native token. "One key way of judging success is by how well our infrastructure continues to meet new and developing regulations," Aishwary Gupta, Polygon's global head of payments, exchanges, and RWA, told Decrypt. "We want to show lawmakers not only how fintechs and banks can be compliant, but to show them what's possible when payments are made on the blockchain." The European neobank has more than 65 million users across 160 supported countries and regions, according to its website. Last month, the firm secured a MiCA license in Cyprus, potentially positioning it to launch its own stablecoin. (Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt parent company, Dastan).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Making his debut in the Ken Ghosh directorial Ishq Vishk, alongside Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao, Malhotra has actually made a name for himself during his journey as an entrepreneur. He talked about his exit from Bollywood after filmmakers refused to offer him the sort of work he wanted to do. He said the same people who wanted to cast him in his films only had two words for him when he asked to be cast as more than hero's friend: No. While appearing as one of the speakers during TEDx, Malhotra shared in-depth stories from his time as an actor, television anchor and businessman. She came right up to me and said, ‘We are looking for the face of our channel; would you be interested?' ALSO READ: ‘Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol are scared of me, they don't sit with me': When Dharmendra talked about being friends with his kids, said his father felt the same Malhotra would then go on to star in films like Jannat and Kismat Konnection before falling out of favour with certain producers and directors. During a separate interview with Hindi Rush, Malhotra had talked about being ostracised from the industry and said, “When I asked for a different role, that big producer took it on his ego. When a powerful person like that dismisses your capability, you are finished. He also said that early discipline when it came to investing helped him survive the tough phase. She said whatever you are giving me today, you will be able to buy a house in five years with this money. After a stint as a television anchor, Malhotra finally put his foot down and decided to go into business for himself, a decision that ultimately proved lucrative for his acting career as well. Recalling his early days in business, Malhotra said, “I opened my own ad agency and made a lot of ad films. Went into business with the biggest retailers in India, like Reliance. That is why I delved into NFTs, and I became the first Indian actor to create and sell an NFT.” Malhotra talked about his exit from cryptocurrency as well and said, “As Covid ended, many people suggested I sell my NFTs, as there were rumours going around that the Indian government was going to ban cryptocurrency. What I got back was a good amount of pocket change, and that amount was perfect for a film that I had written. So then I wrote, produced and directed my first feature film, Ilm, which became the world's first film completely funded by an NFT.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Val Vavilov cofounded his Bitcoin mining company, Bitfury, in 2011, the original cryptocurrency was worth less than $30, a sliver of its roughly $91,000 price today. Since then, Bitfury's mining ventures spun off into two Nasdaq-listed companies whose combined worth tops $9 billion, while also launching two companies that offer AI infrastructure. The company announced on Tuesday that it would launch a $1 billion investment initiative, where it aims to support mission-driven founders. “We were ourselves mission-driven entrepreneurs that embraced Bitcoin, and we brought the power of Bitcoin to the world,” said George Kikvadze, the executive vice chairman, in an interview with Fortune. Bitfury is not the first company to invest in both crypto and AI. Major tech companies like Google, Apple, and X—all racing for superiority in AI—are exploring blockchain technology, as President Donald Trump's administration has loosened regulation of the crypto sector. Bitfury says it doesn't have an exact list yet of the companies it hopes to invest in. However, it plans to invest in ethical companies involved in AI, quantum computing, and transparent decentralized systems, among other categories. It also aims to invest in self-sovereign identity, which is a way for people to have complete control of their own data using cryptography. Vavilov, Bitfury's CEO, says that this technology will be important as AI avatars become universal, and it becomes ever more difficult to determine who is real and who is fake. “We're big fans of [the American architect] Buckminster Fuller, who said, ‘You never change things by fighting the existing reality. Vavilov said his company is pivoting into this investment fund because of the recent convergence of AI and crypto. Because AI is taking over, and we see the big synergy between AI and decentralized systems,” he said. “We believe that the future will be a combination of AI and decentralized systems working together, and we have huge experience in the crypto space and in AI.” Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy | CA Notice at Collection and Privacy Notice | Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information FORTUNE is a trademark of Fortune Media IP Limited, registered in the U.S. and other countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spain's development finance institution, the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO), and Garanti BBVA, BBVA's Turkish franchise, signed the first financing agreement aimed at boosting the activity of companies with Spanish interests in Türkiye for up to $100 million. This agreement marks the beginning of ICO's financing activities in Türkiye under the International Channel Facility, which will support projects with Spanish interests across the Eurasian continent, given Türkiye's strategic geographic location connecting Europe and Asia. In addition to backing export and commercial business between Spain and Türkiye, this agreement expands the scope of the International Channel Facility to include companies based in the Turkish market with commercial and investment activities connected to Spain. To mark the signing of this financing agreement, an informative session was held for the business community at Garanti BBVA's headquarters in Istanbul. The event featured opening remarks by Cristina Latorre, the Spanish Ambassador to Türkiye, Mahmut Akten, CEO of Garanti BBVA, and Fernando Salazar, Director General of International Corporate Finance, Intermediation and State Funds at ICO. During the opening session, Sinem Edige, Head of BBVA Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) in Türkiye, underscored the significance of the collaboration with ICO in providing more favorable financing opportunities for companies with a strong international presence. She stated: “Through this agreement, we will offer new, ICO-backed funding opportunities to companies in Türkiye that have commercial or investment relations with Spain. In doing so, we not only strengthen the economic cooperation between the two countries but also contribute to our clients' growth journey by providing an international source of financing. We see this partnership as an opportunity to leverage the global strength of the BBVA Group to create further value for the Turkish economy, and we are proud to be a trusted financial partner for foreign investors operating in our country.” This step enables us to continue supporting Spanish enterprises in their international expansion, and to strengthen our presence in new markets beyond those that have already been established through this program, such as Latin America and the Caribbean, the U.S. and North Africa.” The ICO International Channel Facility is designed to boost the business activity and project financing of Spanish companies with an international presence in other markets through intermediation with local financial institutions. This program transfers the operating scheme of ICO Facilities to multilateral, public development or private banks located abroad, simplifying application procedures for companies, and adding the benefit of the financial institution's local market expertise. This latest agreement with ICO illustrates BBVA's commitment to supporting its institutional clients, working in close collaboration to promote projects that foster economic development, sustainability and the international expansion of Spanish businesses. These agreements reinforce public-private partnerships, enhancing support for Spanish companies abroad.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spot bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds in the U.S. reported a combined daily net outflow of $437 million yesterday, extending their recent negative flow trend. According to SoSoValue data, spot bitcoin ETFs saw $254.5 million worth of outflows on Monday, led by $145.5 million leaving BlackRock's IBIT fund. Other ETFs from Grayscale, Fidelity, Ark & 21Shares, Bitwise and VanEck also posted sizable outflows. Monday marked the fourth consecutive day of net outflows for the spot bitcoin ETFs, which have shed nearly $1.9 billion over that period. These outflows were partially offset by roughly $13 million in inflows into Grayscale's ETHE and ETH funds. Spot ether ETFs have now logged five straight days of net outflows, with $911.4 million exiting the funds in that period. "​​The outflow underscores a deepening caution among institutional investors, reflecting broader macroeconomic headwinds like fiscal uncertainty and elevated interest rate expectations that are eroding the 'store of value' narrative for these legacy assets," said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. Since late October, bitcoin and ether have been steadily declining as record-length U.S. shutdown drained liquidity from markets, compounded by fading optimism for a December interest rate cut. Late Monday night, bitcoin had fallen below $90,000 to its seven-month low. It is now trading at $91,253, down 4.44% over the past 24 hours, while Ethereum dropped 4% to $3,056, according to The Block's crypto price page. "This [outflow] trend signals a maturing yet risk-averse crypto market, where BTC and ETH are increasingly viewed as vulnerable to equity selloffs," Ruck said. "If outflows persist, we could see intensified price pressure pushing bitcoin and Ethereum even further down, potentially triggering a wider altcoin correction and reduced overall market liquidity." Canary's spot Litecoin ETF also saw $2 million in net inflows. Spot Solana ETFs had $8.26 million in net inflows, with funds going into Bitwise's BSOL and Grayscale's GSOL, while VanEck's newly launched VSOL recorded no flows on its first day. Meanwhile, two more Solana ETFs are scheduled to launch on Tuesday — SOLC from Canary and FSOL from Fidelity — according to Bloomberg Analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart. "Positive flows into Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs point to early signs of capital rotation toward altcoins with clearer regulatory paths and potential to gain higher market capitalization, a diversification strategy that could accelerate if altcoin ETF approvals continue in the near future," Ruck told The Block.
