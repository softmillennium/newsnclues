                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration says it will transfer much of the U.S. Department of Education's programs to other agencies, a move experts say is part of President Donald Trump's directive to dismantle the agency. During a press call with reporters on Tuesday, a senior administration official said the administration had signed agreements with four other federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to begin managing programs currently under the Education Department. Trump signed an executive order in March aimed at closing the Education Department, which oversees the country's $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio, provides funding to low-income students and enforces civil rights in classrooms across the country. Only Congress can unilaterally eliminate the Education Department. But the Trump administration may be trying to use a workaround by contracting with other agencies to perform the department's tasks. "They are attempting to hollow out the U.S. Department of Education, leaving behind a shell of the original organization," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Earlier this year, the Trump administration laid off nearly half of the Education Department's staffers. "We'll peel back the layers of federal bureaucracy by partnering with agencies that are better suited to manage programs," Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon wrote in a recent op-ed in USA Today. The government shutdown "underlined just how little the Department of Education will be missed," McMahon said. Former President Jimmy Carter established the current-day Education Department in 1979. Since then, the department has faced other existential threats, with former President Ronald Reagan calling for its end and Trump, during his first term, attempting to merge it with the Labor Department.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta won its high-profile antitrust case against the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused the company of holding a monopoly in social networking. In a memorandum opinion released Tuesday, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said the FTC failed to prove its argument. The case, initially filed by the FTC five years ago, centered on Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. A judgment so stating shall issue this day." Boasberg dismissed the case in 2021, saying the agency didn't have enough evidence to prove "Facebook holds market power." In August of that year, the FTC filed an amended complaint with more details about the company's user numbers and metrics relative to competitors like Snapchat, the now-defunct Google+ social network and Myspace. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former operating chief Sheryl Sandberg, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom and other current and former Meta executives all testified in the trial, which began in April. The stock is up about 2% for the year, badly underperforming broader indexes and most of its megacap tech peers. The FTC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The ruling comes a little over two months after Google avoided the harshest possible penalty from an antitrust case it lost last year. While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided the company would not be forced to sell its Chrome browser, bucking the Department of Justice's request. Google was, however, ordered to loosen its hold on search data. The commission also alleged that there were no major alternatives for apps like Facebook and Instagram that people use to communicate with friends and family in a online, social space. However, a major challenge for the FTC, according to the judge, was in proving that Meta is breaking antitrust law today, not years ago when the primary use of social networks was very different and based on sharing other kinds of content. "To win the permanent injunction that it seeks here, the FTC must prove a current or imminent legal violation," he wrote. Boasberg ultimately sided with Meta's argument that the technology industry has evolved since the early days of Facebook, and the company now faces a wide variety of competitors like TikTok. "While each of Meta's empirical showings can be quibbled with, they all tell a consistent story: people treat TikTok and YouTube as substitutes for Facebook and Instagram, and the amount of competitive overlap is economically important," Boasberg wrote. "Against that unmistakable pattern, the FTC offers no empirical evidence of substitution whatsoever." Much of Judge Boasberg's conclusion was built on the transformation that's taken place in the social media market in recent years and Meta's changing position within it. User trends have moved heavily in the direction of video, where TikTok and YouTube have massive user bases and huge network effects. "The most-used part of Meta's apps is thus indistinguishable from the offerings on TikTok and YouTube," Boasberg wrote. "Meta is not a monopolist insulated from competition," he wrote. Boasberg also cited various documents and testimony from "industry insiders" that show how other tech companies like TikTok and YouTube viewed Meta as serious competition. "TikTok and YouTube tracked Meta's products as competitive threats," Boasberg wrote. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brian Chukwuisiocha, a 22-year-old computer science student based in the Washington metropolitan area. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I worked there in my sophomore year from May 2024 to August 2024 as an intern. It was a great experience, and it really aligned with my original motivation for getting into software engineering: to make things that people can use and help them in everyday life. They liked the amount of knowledge I had in coding for iOS apps, and I was interviewed for four different positions. After two to three rounds of interviews, I ended up on the Apple Fitness+ team. But when it came time to start thinking about post-graduation employment, I didn't end up applying for an entry-level role at Apple. Instead, I accepted a full-time job offer from my most recent internship. It's fostered an atmosphere of creativity that's led to their most iconic products. It just took me a minute to learn what's what with all of the secrecy and privacy that Apple is known for. For example, they have trails for walks or jogs, and the gym is the coolest gym I've ever seen in my life. The only thing it's missing is a place to sleep. It's so closed off that you don't hear the outside world, like an ambulance passing by. For me, as a Nigerian man, it was hard to find my community there. Apple Park probably couldn't exist in New York, though, so I understand why the West Coast is appealing for tech companies. It makes sense for Big Tech, but I'm a multifaceted person. I have interests outside of tech, and it felt like I couldn't grow my other passions in the Bay Area. In my years of programming, I've learned that new grads can have a tougher time standing out at Big Tech companies. Many undergrads just don't have enough experience to differentiate themselves from the rest of the applicants hoping to land a full-time position. They can end up being just a number at some tech firms, and I didn't want that to happen to me. But that doesn't mean I'm out on Big Tech. I have a long career ahead of me, and Apple isn't off my radar. Contact this reporter, Jordan Hart, from a non-work device and email at jhart@businessinsider.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of his nation, on Tuesday brushed off questions about bin Salman's involvement in the 2018 killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. "Things happen," Trump said when asked about Khashoggi's killing by a reporter as he sat next to bin Salman in the Oval Office. Trump called the ABC News reporter "fake news" after she asked about Khashoggi, about claims by families of 9/11 victims that Saudi Arabia bankrolled the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and about the propriety of Trump's business investing in Saudi Arabia. "You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial," Trump said of Khashoggi. "A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen," Trump said. Referring to bin Salman, Trump said, "But he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that." "You don't have to embarrass our guests by asking a question," Trump said. Bin Salman has denied ordering Khashoggi's killing. But in February 2021, a month after then-President Joe Biden took office, the United States' director of national intelligence released a report that said bin Salman approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi. On Tuesday, bin Salman said, "You know, I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America. But, you know, we have to focus on reality." "Reality based in CIA documents, and based on a lot of documents that Osama bin Laden used Saudi people in that event, for one main purpose, is to destroy this [relationship], to destroy the American-Saudi relation," bin Salman said. "It's really painful to hear .... anyone that been losing his life for you know, no real purpose or ... not in a legal way," bin Salman said, referring to Khashoggi. "And it's been painful for us in Saudi Arabia," the prince said. "We did all the right steps of investigation ... in Saudi Arabia, and we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. At the same time as the report implicating bin Salman in Khashoggi's death, then-Secretary of State Anthony Blinken imposed visa restrictions on 76 Saudis who were "believed to have been engaged in threatening dissidents overseas, including but not limited to the Khashoggi killing. "President Trump looks forward to welcoming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to the White House, where the two leaders will participate in an official working visit," White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said in a statement. "Thanks to our Dealmaker-in-Chief, the United States secured $600 billion in historic investments during the President's visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, and Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more," Kelly said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions of federal student loan borrowers who graduated in the spring will need to start repaying their debt for the first time soon. That's because the six-month grace period that the Department of Education allows students after they finish school is winding down for May graduates. "It's time to start making payments on your student loans." Outstanding federal education debt in the U.S. exceeds $1.6 trillion, and more than 40 million people hold these loans. Between 4 million and 5 million federal student loan borrowers enter repayment each year, mainly during November and December, Kantrowitz said. The typical monthly student loan payment is around $350. This year, borrowers begin repayment amid a challenging time for the lending system. More than 5 million people are in default on student loans, and President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" phases out several repayment plans that were intended to make payments more affordable. Here's what you need to know about starting repayment on your student debt. Student loan borrowers are more likely to miss their first bill than any other payment, Kantrowitz said, because their debt has been "out of sight, out of mind, for six months." Recent graduates are also often balancing other new expenses, including rent, a car, and new work clothes, Kantrowitz said. As a result, he said, "I tell students to put a reminder in their calendar two weeks before payments are supposed to start." You should get your first bill at least 21 days before your payment is due, according to the Education Department. To avoid being late, borrowers can enroll in automatic payments with their loan servicer. If you don't know which company is managing your student loans on behalf of the government, you can find out at Studentaid.gov. As for the right plan, "there's no simple answer," said Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit. "It can be very borrower-specific," Mayotte said. Both are income-driven repayment plans, which means they set your monthly bill based on income and family size, and lead to debt forgiveness after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. (However, recent legislation will phase out PAYE and ICR as of July 1, 2028.) Starting July 1, 2026, student loan borrowers will have access to one more option, the "Repayment Assistance Plan," or RAP. Meanwhile, the Standard Repayment Plan is a good option for borrowers who are not seeking, or are not eligible for, loan forgiveness and/or can afford the monthly payments, experts say. There are several tools available online to help you determine how much your monthly bill would be under different plans. Borrowers should also be able to change into a different repayment plan at any time. The start of student loan repayments may cause financial hardship for many borrowers. Struggling borrowers should first see if they qualify for a deferment, experts say. Those who qualify for a hardship deferment include people receiving certain types of federal or state aid and anyone volunteering in the Peace Corps, Kantrowitz said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft made it easier for corporate workers to make AI agents that go off and do work. The software, named Agent 365, provides a list of artificial intelligence agents inside companies' systems, even if they're from other companies, Microsoft announced Tuesday. The company will present the product to business leaders and information technology practitioners at its Ignite conference in San Francisco this week. "In the same way you provision an identity for a new employee or a contingent worker, you'll provision identity and access controls for your agents," Judson Althoff, CEO of Microsoft's commercial business, told CNBC in an interview. With Agent 365, administrators will be able to approve new agents, see which ones are becoming popular and find out how many hours of employee time they're saving each week. They'll also be able to spot security risks and block agents. End users will be able to analyze agents' activities. Following the ascent of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, software companies have built AI agents capable of developing software, generating ads and performing other simple tasks. Agents from Adobe, Cognition, Databricks, Glean, ServiceNow and Workday will automatically show up in Agent 365. The software will also display agents that customers have built with Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio. Other companies that sell AI agents can integrate with Agent 365, said Ray Smith, vice president of autonomous agents at Microsoft. EY, one of the world's top accounting firms, had built an internal catalog of its AI agents, but has started implementing Agent 365 to gain more control, said Mark Luquire, a managing director for the company. Companies selling cybersecurity software recognize the complexity that might result from agents proliferating. Customers enrolled in Microsoft's Frontier program for receiving early access to AI features can request to try Agent 365, Smith said.

Google's Gemini 3 is here — and you can start playing with it right away. The search giant said its new AI model, which will be widely available on Tuesday, takes a "massive jump" in reasoning, is more creative than Gemini 2, and is better able to combine text, image, and video. For Google, the weight of expectations hangs heavy on Gemini 3. After GPT-5's modest arrival earlier this year, the pressure has been on for Google to deliver something much better. It's also an opportunity for Google to reassert itself as an AI leader and cement a turnaround that's been three years in the making. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis described the latest updates to Gemini as going from "simply reading text and images to reading the room." Google said Gemini 3 is an improvement in both reasoning and multimodal abilities. "It doesn't just process text or images separately," said Tulsee Doshi, product lead for Gemini, on a roundtable with reporters this week. Google says this is strengthened by the model's coding abilities, meaning it can create a presentation or an interactive graphic to explain a complex idea. Google DeepMind's CTO, Koray Kavukcuoglu, said he thinks this will be a big deal not just for coders, but for students and anyone trying to use AI as a learning tool. Google's flexing its distribution advantage by rolling out Gemini 3 to search on launch day — with a catch. Out of the gate, any US users who pay for Google's Pro or Ultra Gemini tiers will see a new "Thinking" option in Google Search's AI Mode, which will use Gemini 3 if you choose it. Google says it will soon make Gemini 3 in search available to all. The new model should perform better searches by breaking down your query into even more pieces, Google said. Robbie Stein, VP of Search, said that people have been asking Google more complex questions as it's rolled out new AI capabilities. Gemini 3 will also be capable of building more visualizations and interactive graphics right onto the AI Mode search page. AI companies often boast about how their models outperform others on various benchmarks. These aren't always super useful to the average person, and the real test for Google will be in how users receive and use its new model. However, one notable figure Google shared was that Gemini 3 scored 37.5% without tool use on Humanity's Last Exam, a test for AI models comprising 2,500 questions across a wide range of subjects. Doshi said this makes Gemini 3 better at solving maths and science problems "with a very high degree of reliability." So far, it's been fairly primitive, but Google is now launching the next step — simply called "Gemini Agent — which it says will be able to carry out multi-step tasks from within Gemini. One of those is creating generative interfaces using something called "dynamic view,' where you might ask Gemini for information about a famous historical figure, and it can generate a fully interactive website with clickable widgets and tabs. The company is tapping those advantages with a new platform it's launching called Antigravity, which takes vibe coding to another level by having an autonomous agent perform most of the work for you.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Parts of the internet went down again on Tuesday. A network issue at web security business Cloudflare disrupted internet services and took down sites such as ChatGPT and X for many users for around three hours on Tuesday morning. A Cloudflare spokesperson told Business Insider that the company first saw "unusual traffic" to one of its services at 6:20 a.m. ET, with a status update on its website around 30 minutes later saying it was experiencing "internal service degradation." After initially saying it did not know what had led to the "spike in unusual traffic," Cloudflare said that the cause of the outage was "a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic." "The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare's services," it added. "I won't mince words: earlier today we failed our customers and the broader internet," Dane Knecht, Cloudflare's CTO, said in an X post. The company added that it would soon share a detailed explanation of what went wrong on its blog. Business Insider found that during the outage, some affected sites were sporadically back online, only to stop working shortly afterward. ET, Business Insider was able to access X, ChatGPT, and other online services previously affected by the outage, such as Spotify, as well as Downdetector, a site that tracks website outages — which was also down for periods on Tuesday morning. The outage came around the same time as scheduled maintenance was taking place at data centers in several locations, including Atlanta and Los Angeles, according to Cloudflare's status page. X, OpenAI, and Spotify could not immediately be reached for comment. Internet outages are becoming a frequent issue for users, as the vast majority of websites rely on a handful of content delivery networks. "We're seeing outages happen more frequently, and they're taking longer to fix," said Jacob Bourne, an analyst at EMARKETER. "That's a symptom of strained infrastructure: increased AI load, streaming demand, and aging capacity all pushing systems past the edge." EMARKETER is owned by Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company.</p>

The Morgan Stanley headquarters in New York.

As digital-asset prices unravel, Morgan Stanley has drawn outsized demand from wealthy clients for a complex, new Bitcoin-linked product.

The bank this month sold $104 million of structured notes tied to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), in a deal five times larger than the next most popular crypto-linked note currently outstanding in the US, according to data from Structured Products Intelligence, part of WSD. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft on Tuesday announced new strategic partnerships with Nvidia and the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, the latest sign that the company is working to reduce its dependence on OpenAI. As part of the agreement, Microsoft will invest up to $5 billion into Anthropic, while Nvidia will invest up to $10 billion into the startup. The investments have pushed Anthropic's valuation to the range of $350 billion, up from its $183 billion valuation as of September, according to a source close to the deal who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. Anthropic has also committed to purchase up to one gigawatt of compute capacity with Nvidia's Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. "This is a dream come true for us," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a video on Tuesday. "You know, we've admired the work of Anthropic and Dario for a long time, and this is the first time we are going to deeply partner with that Anthropic to accelerate Claude." Nvidia and Anthropic are collaborating to "support Anthropic's future growth" for the first time, the blog post said. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet in recent years following the launch of its ChatGPT chatbot. OpenAI completed a recapitalization last month, and Microsoft formally outlined its partnership with the startup. Microsoft holds an stake in OpenAI's for-profit business that is valued at $135 billion, or roughly 27% of the company on an as-converted diluted basis. Anthropic was founded by former OpenAI research executives, including its CEO Dario Amodei, in 2021. The Amazon-backed company is best known for developing a family of large language models called Claude. Amazon will continue to serve in both of those roles, Anthropic said Tuesday. "As an industry, we really need to move beyond any type of zero sum narrative or winner take all hype," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in the video. "What's required now is the hard work of building broad, durable capabilities together so that this technology can deliver real, tangible local success for every country, every sector and every customer. The opportunity is simply too big to approach any other way." Nvidia is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.
