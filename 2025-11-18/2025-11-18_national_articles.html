                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal court Tuesday blocked Texas from using its newly drawn congressional map in next year's midterms, ruling that the map is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling, which is likely to be appealed, is a major setback for President Donald Trump and Republicans, who had made Texas the centerpiece of a national campaign to redraw maps ahead of the midterms. Republicans in Texas had aimed to produce as many as five more seats favorable to Republicans next year at the president's behest. US District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed to the bench by Trump in 2019, wrote that the challengers were “likely to prove at trial that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.” The three-judge panel that heard the case split 2-1, with Obama appointee David Guaderrama joining Brown. Reagan appointee Jerry Smith opposed the decision. “A federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, who leads the Texas House Democrats. Greg Abbott, who called the special sessions for the legislature to create the new map, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This is a developing story and will be updated. CNN's Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Attorney General, Letitia James, speaks after pleading not guilty outside the United States District Court on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025, in Norfolk, Va. (AP Photo/John Clark,File) ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge has dismissed a Trump administration legal challenge to New York policies that block immigration officials from arresting people at state courthouses, saying the federal government can't force states to cooperate with those enforcement efforts. U.S. District Judge Mae D'Agostino late Monday granted New York's motion to dismiss the government's lawsuit, one of several legal actions from the Republican administration targeting state and local policies over immigration enforcement. The law, called the Protect Our Courts Act, was approved in response to enforcement actions at courthouses during President Donald Trump's first term. D'Agostino, though, found that New York's decision not to participate in enforcing civil immigration law is protected by the 10th Amendment, which sets boundaries on the federal government's powers. “Fundamentally, the United States fails to identify any federal law mandating that state and local officials generally assist or cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. “No such federal laws exist because the Tenth Amendment prohibits Congress from conscripting state and local officials and resources to assist with federal regulatory schemes, like immigration enforcement.” The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a Tuesday email seeking comment about the ruling, including whether it plans to appeal. New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose office argued for the lawsuit to be dismissed, said she was fighting for the “dignity and rights of immigrant communities.” “Everyone deserves to seek justice without fear,” James said in a statement. “This ruling ensures that anyone can use New York's state courts without being targeted by federal authorities.”</p>

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to invest $1 trillion into the U.S. economy over the next year. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman committed his country to increasing his planned investment into the U.S. economy to nearly $1 trillion over the next year on Tuesday. Trump initially stated that the investment would amount to "at least" $600 billion, but the Saudi leader confirmed the higher amount during his remarks. "You've agreed to invest $600 billion into the United States and because he's my friend, he might make it a trillion, but I'm going to have to work on him. But, that number could go up a little bit higher," Trump said Tuesday. And what it really means for everybody, what really counts is jobs. We have a lot of jobs," Trump added. US President Donald Trump meets with Crown Prince and Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on November 18, 2025. Bin Salman vowed to meet the $1 trillion number just minutes later during comments to the press. Today and tomorrow, we are going to announce that we are going to increase that, that $600 billion to almost $1 trillion of investment, real investment and real opportunity in many areas," he said. President Donald Trump welcomes Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House, Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025, in Washington. We're doing numbers that nobody's ever done. And in all fairness, if you didn't see potential in the U.S, you wouldn't be doing it," Trump replied. "You don't want to lose money," Trump joked. It represents a return to the fold for Saudi Arabia after the country was largely shunned under former President Joe Biden's administration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Saudi meeting: President Donald Trump downplayed potential conflicts of interest while hosting Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. • Epstein vote: The House will soon vote on a bipartisan bill to compel the DOJ to release all of its case files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. At a news conference earlier, GOP Reps. Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene urged the House to advance the legislation as Epstein abuse survivors shared their stories. • Johnson and Trump express support: House Speaker Mike Johnson said this morning he will support the bill, though he raised concerns with how it is written. This comes after Trump, in a stark reversal, encouraged House Republicans to vote in favor and said he would sign a measure to release the Epstein files. President Donald Trump dismissed a question about the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, claiming that the Saudi dissident journalist was “extremely controversial” and that raising the subject in his meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was meant to embarrass his visitor. “You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. Whether you liked him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “Things happen,” Trump said later, going on to insist Prince Bin Salman — who the CIA assessed likely ordered the murder — wasn't involved. You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump said. President Donald Trump downplayed potential conflicts of interest between his family's business and the country of Saudi Arabia, saying in part that he has “nothing to do with the family business.” “I have nothing to do with the family business. They've done very little with Saudi Arabia. Actually, I'm sure they could do a lot, and anything they've done has been very good,” the president said. The White House has repeatedly downplayed any appearance of a conflict of interest with the president's family business. “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt had previously told CNN. He added, “The American people have waited long enough and they want to see what's in it.” In a separate statement just before speaking with reporters, Schumer said that if Senate Majority Leader John Thune “tries to bury the bill, I'll stop him.” Asked about Speaker Mike Johnson's argument that the bill needs some changes, Schumer replied, “We've waited long enough.” President Donald Trump began his remarks in the Oval Office by praising Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's record on human rights. “We have a extremely respected man in the Oval Office today, and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine, and I'm very proud of the job he's done,” Trump said as their meeting was starting. Tuesday is Prince bin Salman's first visit to the White House since 2018, the same year the Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. Human rights groups have also criticized the kingdom for its extensive use of the death penalty and restrictions on free expression. As President Donald Trump was escorting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman into the Oval Office today, they lingered along the West Colonnade, where Trump has installed a lineup of presidential portraits he dubs the “Presidential Walk of Fame.” The display features images of Trump's predecessors, except for President Joe Biden, whose spot is taken by an image of an autopen. It's an allusion to Trump's accusations that Biden didn't approve some of his own policies, something the former president denies. Trump has personally been fixated on Biden's autopen use, CNN previously reported, and in June ordered an investigation into his actions and autopen use in a memorandum that cites Biden's “cognitive decline.” The “Walk of Fame” is one of many gold-trimmed additions Trump has made to the White House — features many have noted bear resemblance to gilded palaces in places like Saudi Arabia. In fact, a few months ago, the Oversight Committee put in place a subpoena for all of the files through the Department of Justice, and still they have released nothing,” Garcia said during a news conference on Capitol Hill. “So, at the end of day Donald Trump can, today, bring justice to the survivors and he refuses to do so,” he added. Garcia also slammed the president for his stark reversal in the matter and raised concerns about Trump's ultimate end game. He continued, “We're not going to forget his opposition. “We got a little bit more work ahead of us. But my hope is that Leader John Thune will do the right thing and bring this legislation to the floor of the Senate, and allow a vote,” Kelly said at a news conference on Capitol Hill. “We're going to need your help on the other side of the Capitol, making sure that Senate leadership doesn't delay this any further,” he said to advocates. Grijalva – who was the decisive signature on a petition to force a House vote on the matter – said the House “vote, this transparency and accountability are long overdue.” To them, I say: You cannot call it a hoax when real survivors are standing right here,” the Arizona Democrat said. House Speaker Mike Johnson had long refused to bring the bill to the House floor, arguing it would not sufficiently protect victims of Epstein's crimes, and acknowledged a successful discharge petition was the driving force behind it coming up for a vote. But he said Tuesday he spoke with Senate Majority leader John Thune about changing the bill to address those issues. “I called my counterpart in the Senate, Leader Thune, and I talked him through this with him and shared our deep concerns and of course they share those concerns as well. And so I'm very confident that when this moves forward in the process, if and when it is processed in the Senate – which it's no certainty that that will be – that they will take the time methodically to do what we've not been allowed to do in the House, to amend this discharge petition and to make sure that these protections are there,” Johnson told reporters. There was lots of people that went and pleaded with them to fix it so that everybody could be together because we've been for maximum transparency.” He continued: “But again there's a reason you have rules and processes here to ensure this is not done haphazardly. But I've been for maximum transparency from the very beginning. A line of mounted dark horses escorted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's limo up the White House driveway, kicking off an elaborate diplomatic display that is essentially a state visit in everything but name. Delegations from both countries lined an orange carpet, and an honor guard stood at attention as Prince bin Salman emerged from his Mercedes to greet Trump. As the House prepares to vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, President Donald Trump is welcoming Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. Agreements on artificial intelligence, nuclear energy and defense sales are expected to emerge from today's meetings, a senior US administration official said ahead of the talks. The visit cannot be classified as an official state visit as Prince bin Salman is not Saudi Arabia's head of state. That position is occupied by his 89-year-old father, King Salman. Trump has worked to cultivate a close relationship with the kingdom's de facto ruler in the hopes he will decide to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, which would be a major advancement of the president's signature Abraham Accords — a longtime goal. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky argued President Donald Trump's reversal in favor of releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files bolsters his support within the party. “What he's doing this week is strengthening his position by coming on board, and we're glad to have him,” Massie said on Tuesday when asked if he thought Trump has diminished his appeal to the GOP base over how he's handled the Epstein files. I suppose he didn't approve of my recent marriage.” The president called Massie a “loser” in a Truth Social post late last week and mocked him for getting remarried recently after his late wife passed away last year. “I'm sorry I didn't invite you to the wedding,” Massie said he would tell Trump, adding, “I'm glad you're on board today and make sure this bill gets through the Senate without getting mucked up.” I think some of them would like to amend the bill to protect the pedophiles, and if we see any inkling of that, that bill needs to be killed immediately,” he said. House Speaker Mike Johnson says he plans to support releasing all of the Jeffrey Epstein files when it comes to a vote in the House later today. Johnson said he'd support the bill even though he raised serious concerns with how the legislation is written. Johnson has called the effort a “moot point,” given the House Oversight Committee has its own extensive investigation into Epstein underway, and he has raised concerns over whether the legislation as written properly protects victims. This post has been updated with additional developments. Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva and other members of Congress are standing with abuse survivors ahead of a House vote on a bill to compel the Justice Department to release its case files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Grijalva provided the decisive 218th signature that allowed a bipartisan effort to force a vote on the measure to move forward. Agreements on artificial intelligence, nuclear energy and defense sales are expected to emerge from Tuesday's meeting between President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a senior US administration official said ahead of the talks. On Monday, Trump said he was planning to approve sales of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, a step that could cause consternation in Israel, the only nation in the Middle East with the American-made jets. “Thanks to our Dealmaker-in-Chief, the United States secured $600 billion in historic investments during the President's visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, and Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie called arguments that his legislation doesn't protect Jeffrey Epstein's victims a “red herring,” when asked about House Speaker Mike Johnson's calls for the Senate to amend the bill. The survivors have always been in favor of this legislation. And there's a provision in there you could read, if he would just read it, that protects them,” he said at a press conference on Capitol Hill with Epstein abuse survivors. It could be just another delay tactic,” he said. Giuffre, one of the most prominent and outspoken survivors of Epstein's abuse, died by suicide earlier this year. “Today we find ourselves in a place of deep sorrow, shattered by the loss of our beloved sister, yet we are honored and privileged to carry her voice forward and continue her relentless fight alongside her fellow survivor sisters,” Roberts said, before reading a passage from Giuffre's memoir. In emotional remarks remembering his sister, Roberts spoke on the “monumental impact” she had on this effort to bring justice. “We demand justice, accountability, and support for survivors,” Roberts said. He said justice starts by first acknowledging that what happened is true. My sister is not a political tool for you to use. These survivors are not political tools for you to use. I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files, and I'm grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill. I can't help to be skeptical of what the agenda is. You have put us through so much stress,” she said. He stole a lot from me … at 14. So just a little reminder there for everybody,” Jones said, growing emotional during her remarks and holding up a photo of herself at age 14. Jones and many of the survivors gathered on Capitol Hill this morning brought photos to show how young they were when they met the late convicted sex offender. ET vote series on the bill that would compel the Justice Department to release all of its Jeffrey Epstein case files. During the same series, lawmakers will vote on a measure from Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington sanctioning her colleague Rep. Chuy García of Illinois for the timing of his decision to retire. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky addressed the difficult odds he and other lawmakers faced in bringing the discharge petition to force a House vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein case files. Most discharge petitions never make it,” he said, remarking on the “long odds” of getting to this point. He also thanked the Epstein abuse survivors for coming forward and giving hope to other survivors of sex crimes. He also commended the Republican women – Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace – who signed onto the petition and stood firm with them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National Public Radio (NPR) on North Capitol Street in Washington, April 15, 2013. WASHINGTON (AP) — National Public Radio will receive approximately $36 million in grant money to operate the nation's public radio interconnection system under the terms of a court settlement with the federal government's steward of funding for public broadcasting stations. The settlement, announced late Monday, partially resolves a legal dispute in which NPR accused the Corporation for Public Broadcasting of bowing to pressure from President Donald Trump to cut off its funding. On March 25, Trump said at a news conference that he would “love to” defund NPR and PBS because he believes they are biased in favor of Democrats. NPR accused the CPB of violating its First Amendment free speech rights when it moved to cut off its access to grant money appropriated by Congress. NPR also claims Trump, a Republican, wants to punish it for the content of its journalism. On April 2, the CPB's board initially approved a three-year, roughly $36 million extension of a grant for NPR to operate the “interconnection” satellite system for public radio. NPR has been operating and managing the Public Radio Satellite System since 1985. The agency redirected federal interconnection funds away from NPR to an entity that didn't exist and wasn't statutorily authorized to receive it, NPR says. CPB attorneys denied that the agency retaliated against NPR to appease Trump. They had argued that NPR's claims are factually and legally meritless. The settlement doesn't end a lawsuit in which NPR seeks to block any implementation or enforcement of Trump's executive order. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss is scheduled to preside over another hearing for the case on Dec. 4. The settlement says NPR and CPB agree that the executive order is unconstitutional and that CPB won't enforce it unless a court orders it to do so.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration It represents a major step forward for the administration's dismantling of the department, which has mainly involved cutting jobs since President Donald Trump called for its elimination with an executive action in March. Six new agreements signed by the Education Department will effectively move billions of dollars in grant programs to other agencies. Most notable is one that will put the Department of Labor over some of the largest federal funding streams for K-12 schools, including Title I money for schools serving low-income communities. Department officials said the programs will continue to be funded at levels set by Congress. They did not say whether the changes would bring further job cuts at the department, which has been thinned by waves of mass layoffs and voluntary retirement offers. The action leaves in place the Education Department's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio and its funding for students with disabilities, though McMahon has suggested both would be better managed by other federal departments. McMahon and her staff have spent months hammering out the deals, which allow the department to lop off large parts of its footprint without action from Congress. It's being done through formal agreements that agencies often make with one another when their work overlaps. Under the new plan, Labor will oversee almost all grant programs that are now managed by the Education Department's offices for K-12 and higher education. Along with the $18 billion Title I program, that includes smaller funding pools for teacher training, English instruction and TRIO, a program that helps steer low-income students to college degrees. Two major roles of the postsecondary office will remain with the Education Department: oversight of student loan policy and the accreditation of colleges for eligibility to receive students' federal financial aid. States and schools should not expect any disruptions in their funding, the department said, but their federal money will now come from the Department of Labor. Another deal will put Health and Human Services in charge of a grant program for parents who are attending college, along with management of foreign medical school accreditation. The State Department will take on foreign language programs. Interior will oversee programs for Native American education. Opponents have urged against such a shake-up, saying it could disrupt programs that support some of the nation's most vulnerable student populations. Some argue that other agencies don't have the expertise that schools and families rely on at the Education Department. Some also question the plan's legality, noting that legislation requires the Education Department to oversee some of its operations in-house. Department officials say their plan is legally sound and argue it will make programs more efficient. In its 45 years, she says it has become a bloated bureaucracy while student outcomes continue to lag behind. Her vision would abolish the Education Department and give states wider flexibility in how they spend money that's now earmarked for specific purposes, including literacy and education for homeless students. The new deals are part of a broader plan to prove that America's schools and colleges can operate without the department. As part of the plan, officials say McMahon will continue touring the country to highlight the successes of local schools — and she will also spend more time making her pitch to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright discusses renewable energy demands, gas prices and artificial intelligence needs on 'Special Report.' Mike Dunleavy and accelerated by President Donald Trump stands to deal a huge blow to China's dominance in the nanotechnology, energy and automotive sectors as the GraphiteOne project near Nome uncovered vast reserves — for which Beijing previously accounted for 90% of production. But, this week's announcement that REEs were discovered in addition to the graphite lode portends a step-up that the U.S. can take against the CCP through Trump's "American energy dominance" agenda, according to a source familiar with the situation. Donald Trump says 600,000 Chinese students could be allowed into the U.S. to study at its colleges pending a potential trade agreement with China. Batteries, renewable energy technology, fiberoptics, lights, magnets and consumer electronics like phones and tablets rely on REEs, which often places the U.S. at a manufacturing disadvantage — accentuated by China's 2024 export limits on magnet-related REEs, according to PRNewswire. GraphiteOne President Anthony Huston said the Nome discovery is proof of a "truly generational deposit" at the Graphite Creek site. Some of the materials from the site will be shipped to an advanced graphite and battery anode material plant in Ohio. Huston confirmed the presence of two Defense Production Act-qualifying materials and said that given the "robust economics of our planned complete graphite materials supply chain, the presence of Rare Earths at Graphite Creek suggests that recovery as a by-product to our graphite production will maximize the value." REEs found include neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, along with ore rock containing garnet deposits. The site's chief geologist noted that garnets can absorb certain REEs into their mineral structure. In his State of the State address earlier this year, Dunleavy praised the GraphiteOne project as the largest such in North America and encouraged it to continue moving forward with the support of both Juneau and Washington. Huston said Dunleavy rightly understood the role of Alaska as a crucial American source of metals and minerals "transforming the 21st century" and making the U.S. less reliant on foreign sources, including "entities of concern." Outside of Alaska, REEs have been discovered in Pennsylvania, with then-Rep. Lou Barletta, a Republican, trying to draw attention to them during his time in Congress in the 2010s. Antracite coal deposits of Appalachian Pennsylvania have been found to contain as many as 17 different REEs, which could strike another blow to Chinese dominance. Barletta told Fox News in 2018 that funding had been secured for a pilot program to look into extracting REEs from coal wastewater, as long-abandoned mines dot the landscape from Shamokin to Audenried, the latter falling in the aptly-named Carbon County. While little has been done in Pennsylvania when it comes to extracting such minerals, compared to Alaskan efforts in the time since, researchers at Penn State said in September they had developed methods to recover cobalt, manganese and nickel from acid mine drainage and fly ash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This combo shows Jeffrey Epstein, left, and U.S. economist Larry Summers. BOSTON (AP) — Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard University who once served as U.S. treasury secretary, says he will step back from public commitments after the release of emails showing he maintained a friendly relationship with Jeffrey Epstein long after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008. “I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said. However, the Center for American Progress, a progressive DC-based think tank, confirmed Tuesday that Summers was “ending his fellowship at CAP.” A spokesperson for the Budget Lab at Yale also said Summers is no longer a member of the organization's advisory group. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, declined to say Tuesday if Summers was stepping down from its board of directors, referring questions to Summers spokesperson Kelly Friendly who said she did not have anything to add “beyond his statement.” Summers joined the OpenAI board in Nov. 2023, part of an effort to restore stability at the nonprofit and bring back its CEO Sam Altman after its previous board members fired Altman days earlier. Summers' announcement came just days after President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would ask the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Summers' relationship with Epstein, along with former President Bill Clinton and LinkedIn founder and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman. Emails made public last week showed many in Epstein's vast network of wealthy and influential friends continued to stay in touch long after his 2008 guilty plea. A 2019 email to Epstein showed Summers discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing that “I said what are you up to. Epstein, who often wrote with spelling and grammatical errors, replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. When asked about the emails last week, Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life” and that his association with Epstein was a “major error in judgement.” Summers served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Clinton. He was Harvard's president for five years from 2001 to 2006. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, from Massachusetts, told CNN she believes Harvard should severe ties with Summers, saying he “cannot be trusted” with students. “For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,” Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor, told CNN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Citizen Ballot Protection Act, spearheaded by Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL) and Rep. Gary Palmer (R-AL), would codify states' ability to require proof of citizenship on mail voting applications. The proposal would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which says voter registration forms submitted by mail may not include “any requirement for notarization or other formal authentication” and is intended to empower states to enact citizenship requirements for mailed applications. The Supreme Court in 2013 struck down an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship when registering to vote, concluding that states could not create new requirements for federal elections under the NVRA. Noncitizen voting does occur in federal elections, but documented cases are extremely rare. Recent reported cases include six green card holders who were indicted last year for alleged illegal voting in Ohio and a student from China at the University of Michigan who was charged last year with noncitizen voting. A state audit in North Carolina conducted after the 2016 elections revealed that 41 green card holders voted out of nearly 4.8 million votes cast. Democratic lawmakers and voting rights advocates typically oppose such legislation, arguing it amounts to voter suppression that blocks more U.S. citizens from casting ballots than it does the number of noncitizens. Republicans, meanwhile, say the bill and those like it are safeguards that instill confidence in elections. “It should not be controversial that states have the legal right to prevent noncitizens — including illegal aliens and oﬃcial representatives of foreign adversaries — from voting in state and federal elections,” Britt said. “Americans deserve to know their elections are secure,” Palmer said in a statement. The bill has garnered early support from several GOP senators, including past and present members of leadership. Original co-sponsors include Britt's fellow Senate Rules Committee members: Chairman Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and John Boozman (R-AR).</p>

Abdul Carter received a rude awakening Sunday when the New York Giants sidelined him for their first defensive series against the Green Bay Packers. Interim head coach Mike Kafka said it was a coach's decision, prompting speculation about a potential punishment. Kafka added he wanted to "just keep the rest of that in-house," and Carter himself told reporters that he had done something wrong in the week leading up to the game. Sure enough, it turns out it was indeed a punishment for missing a team walkthrough while sleeping at the team facility, according to multiple reports. New York Giants linebacker Abdul Carter gets ready for a play against the San Francisco 49ers at MetLife Stadium on Nov. 2, 2025. (Julian Leshay Guadalupe/NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network via Imagn Images) The Athletic also reported that Carter has been "late to meetings," and former head coach Brian Daboll was letting it "slide." Daboll was fired last week after the Giants blew their third double-digit, fourth-quarter lead of the season. Carter, though, denied those reports on Tuesday. The rookie said he made an "honest mistake" in not realizing a change in the normal practice times following Kafka being tabbed as interim head coach, so he was getting treatment instead. "I own the fact that it was an honest mistake. And it also wasn't a trend. This was the only time it happened." Carter was the third overall pick out of Penn State this past April, but he quickly drew the ire of the Big Blue faithful when he asked Lawrence Taylor if he could wear his famed No. New York Giants linebacker Abdul Carter reacts to a play against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. Carter then sought permission from Phil Simms to wear No. 11, the same number he wore at Penn State and a badge of honor for the Nittany Lions. To make matters worse, in 11 games, Carter has just one half-sack. Burns' 13 sacks are two behind Myles Garrett for the league lead. That goes to show that a market correction is in play for Carter, but it's becoming apparent he needs to start posting actual statistics fast before he stays on fans' bad side.

Brian Walshe, the 50-year-old convicted fraudster accused of killing his wife Ana in their suburban Boston home after learning of an affair, switched his plea on two lesser charges Tuesday morning, just before jury selection in his murder trial was set to begin. Walshe pleaded guilty to counts two and three of his three-count indictment, admitting to misleading police officers and unlawful conveyance of a human body. As prosecutors outlined their case against him, his defense attorney said that he admitted to the lesser allegations but continued to deny the murder charge against him. This split image shows Ana Walshe in an undated selfie photo and her husband and accused killer, Brian Walshe, in court on Monday, Nov. 17, 2025, at the final hearing before his murder trial. Walshe's lawyer said he was not admitting to murder and denied putting her remains in a dumpster and denied that he had a role in incinerating her remains. There was a moment of contention after prosecutors called out Walshe for telling the judge he was still married while under oath.

Judge Diane Freniere told potential jurors that prosecutors allege that police found the following items in a dumpster by Walshe's mother's house: Ana Walshe's clothing, her COVID vaccination card, towels with "red-brown stains," a hatchet, and a hacksaw. In court Monday, prosecutors also revealed that a rug from the Walshe's home was discovered in the dumpster. Stick with Fox News Digital for updates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's one practical, non-trolling reason President Donald Trump has encouraged third-term talk despite the clear language of the 22nd Amendment: He is trying to stave off lame-duck status. A critical mass of Republican lawmakers appears likely to break with Trump on the Jeffrey Epstein files, leading the president to reverse course; Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) is actively seeking a post-Trump identity; the clash with Indiana Republicans over redistricting; and prominent Make America Great Again social media influencers aren't exactly focused on topics beneficial to the White House or GOP. This may have more to do with poll numbers and the off-year election results than term limits, but Republicans and Republican-adjacent voices are starting to contemplate life after Trump. His detractors inside the party are weak and marginal. Most prominent Never Trumpers are now functionally Democrats, many of them increasingly left-wing. He had won the popular vote for the first time in three tries, and some polls showed a small majority actually approving of him. Trump was seen as delivering on his campaign promises at a frenetic pace, even if there were some questions about how durable some of these changes would prove without legislative reinforcement. Trump didn't extend Musk's DOGE contract — the two fell out shortly after his departure, and, other than rescissions, the whole project has taken on a lower profile post-Musk. But Trump supporters were less divided than some prominent MAGA voices predicted. The strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities were seemingly successful and did not metastasize into a wider war. Trump is now contending with multiple issues that divide his base and encourage would-be successors to chart their own course: H-1B visas, Epstein, multiple threatened military interventions, and the actual drug-boat strikes. None of these has remotely dented his popularity with Republicans or self-described MAGA movement members, though they may hurt Trump's party at the margins with low-propensity voters. But they have depressed enthusiasm for Trump among allies who were helpful in 2024. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) has so far retained more grassroots support than any of Trump's previous intraparty foes. Trump-Massie tensions date back to the president's first term. The markets had jitters after “Liberation Day” but eventually settled down. But the tariffs face an uncertain future before the Supreme Court and have been folded into the broader cost-of-living crisis that now threatens Republicans, several years after inflation hit a 41-year high under former President Joe Biden. Democrats were able to campaign successfully on affordability in November. We are less than a year into Trump's second term, and he has survived many political predicaments that would have done in almost anyone else. While his numbers are down, a 42.6% job approval rating in the RealClearPolitics polling average is higher than that of former Presidents George W. Bush or Barack Obama at a comparable point.</p>

CEO Alexander Berger on how the funder's second act aims to show that effective giving can scale up Working closely with Good Ventures — the foundation built by Facebook and Asana co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna — Open Philanthropy has directed more than $4 billion since 2014 across a wide portfolio, from global health to housing to frontier science. Its money has backed philanthropic efforts estimated to have saved 100,000 lives, helped catalyze the YIMBY movement in California, fought to improve conditions for billions of farmed animals, and supported research that went on to win a Nobel Prize. Whatever you think about “effective” giving as a label — or effective altruism, the movement that Open Philanthropy is inescapably associated with — this is one of the clearest experiments we have in what analytically minded, effectiveness-obsessed philanthropy can do at scale. Now, as it enters its second decade, Open Philanthropy is changing its name — and changing some of what it does. It will now call itself Coefficient Giving, a rebrand meant to signal that the organization is moving from primarily serving one anchor donor — Moskovitz and Tuna — to advising and deploying capital for many. In practical terms, that means converting internal programs into multi-donor funds that other philanthropists can join — among them the $125 million Lead Exposure Action Fund and the $120 million Abundance and Growth Fund — while continuing core work in areas that benefit global health and development. The group says it directed more than $100 million from donors beyond Good Ventures in 2024, and has already more than doubled that number in 2025. As CEO, Alexander Berger, puts it in my conversation with him, “coefficient is a multiplier”: the “co-” nods to collaboration with other givers; the “efficient” is a reminder of the north star of effectiveness. Berger, who has helped steer the organization through years of bets on global health, AI risk, and “abundance and growth,” is a pragmatic optimist. In the conversation that follows, we dig into what the name change means in practice: how pooled funds will make decisions, how they're weighing AI and near-term global health, and where philanthropy's comparative advantage really lies in a world of volatile public budgets and accelerating technology. Consider this a map to Open Philanthropy's — sorry, Coefficient Giving's — second act, and a test of whether the multiplier effect can deliver more impact, faster. This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. You've said the last two years marked a significant shift, moving from a single anchor funder toward partnering with other donors. What problem didn't the old setup solve, and what will feel different with the new name and approach? There's not a problem that it's trying to solve — it's really about sort of delivering on the original goal that we launched Open Philanthropy with way back in the day. The ambition was to sort of be a resource for other people who would come along, who would be in Cari and Dustin's shoes, sort of asking that question: Where can I give my resources in a way that it's going to have the most impact for other people? We basically spent our first decade trying to build up to the point where we were sort of on track to hit Cari and Dustin's goals of giving away their resources in their lifetime. Because the “co” signals interest in collaboration and working with others. “Efficient” is a nod to the focus that we've always had on cost-effectiveness. And so we think that speaks to our focus on ROI [return on investment] and being able to help multiply the impact of others. But Open Philanthropy was known for its transparency and publishing detailed explanations of the reasoning behind its funding — including when things didn't go well. We don't see this as a change in terms of our level of openness relative to the status quo. But there were a lot of other organizations that had “open” in the name, and you would be surprised by how often we got confused with them. Because the “co” signals interest in collaboration and working with others. “Efficient” is a nod to the focus that we've always had on cost-effectiveness. In our earliest days, we would write these long posts about every grant that we made, and that just didn't scale with the organization. We're different from GiveWell — GiveWell's model is that they're really trying to explain all of their reasoning in public because they're trying to sell their recommendations to retail donors. We're not trying to make literally everything available on the website in the same way, and we haven't been for a long time. It's a strange moment: public-health budgets slashed and turmoil around USAID. What's the job only philanthropy can do — and how does that shape your second decade? The number one framework that we use for picking what causes to work on is the importance, tractability, neglectedness framework. Often, we think of that being a place where there's a structural imbalance in power or resources, and someone's interests are structurally not represented. For example, a lot of our giving goes to develop new medical technologies for some of the world's poorest people who are suffering from diseases that just aren't a problem in the rich world. I think that's true of a lot of our more abundance-oriented work, such as enabling more housing to get built in the most productive places. One important part of the answer is that most people — most high-income Americans — should be giving a lot more. The average American gives something like 2 percent of their income to charity. The pie of charitable dollars just could be bigger because there are so many good things to do and so many ways to be helpful in the world. When it comes to replacing government dollars, the NIH [National Institutes of Health] is such an overwhelming and powerful funder of scientific research. USAID is so large compared to even the biggest foundations. We are looking and have been doing active funding to fill specific gaps in some places where public funding has pulled back, even though, of course, it's really regretful that we're now in this world where the funding that used to be there isn't anymore. Over time, are there more things that we could do to try to get more leverage and try to have public policies that are more supportive of some of these good things? What's the positive case that attention to AI doesn't crowd out global health and poverty? Those are some of the toughest questions that we face. One important part of the answer is that most people — most high-income Americans — should be giving a lot more. The average American gives something like 2 percent of their income to charity. The pie of charitable dollars just could be bigger because there are so many good things to do and so many ways to be helpful in the world. One of the reasons why we're excited to be rebranding as Coefficient Giving and doubling down on work with other donors is because we think we shouldn't have to make the trade-offs alone. Being able to connect people with high-impact opportunities or some of these funds that we've developed has been a way to help relieve that sort of zero-sum issue. As you convert in-house programs into multi-donor funds — the lead exposure fund, the abundance and growth fund — what happens if donors disagree? So far for the pooled funds, the answer has been that basically people are giving money to Coefficient Giving to allocate within that area based on what we see fit. And actually, a couple of our external partners have given us a push to say, “don't let people have too much governance control. So we've been really lucky so far to find partners who didn't want to sign up for every cause that Coefficient works on, but they do agree and are excited about some specific area like lead or like abundance. There's a group of core donors who are coming together to help start something together or make it multi-donor. And then other folks come in because they're interested in the space but not able to give at the anchor level. Over time, I'd be excited to eventually have other partners on an industrial scale and to think about whether those kinds of people eventually become board members or something. You've funded AI safety and governance for years. Where's your point of leverage in this environment, and what would count as progress in the next year or so? We've been investing in this space for a long time. Going back to 2015, we helped build up the space of academic and think tank research on AI risks and safety. We were quite prescient there, but I think we generally don't see ourselves as trying to achieve some specific policy goal in the next 12 to 18 months. We want people across the spectrum to be paying attention to these risks and taking them seriously, and thinking about how we can mitigate these risks while capturing some of the potentially enormous upsides. When we look at some of the things that have come out of the administration, like the AI action plan, we actually see a lot of areas for agreement or potential agreements. Our hope is that there will be ongoing space for bi-partisanship. You've supported abundance-oriented policy and housing reform for years. What does “it's working” look like in those areas? We've been funding the abundance and growth movement for about 10 years. One of the lessons there is that you really can't evaluate it on too short of a timeline. For instance, California YIMBY, which this legislative session helped pass California's SB 79 to make it a lot easier to build multi-family housing near transit, that bill has failed two or three times going back to, I think, 2018. If five years into our funding you had looked around and said, “What have you achieved, how many units have been built?” I don't know that you would have been able to point to very much. That importance, neglectedness, and tractability framework has always been your north star. After a decade of giving, has it gotten harder to find causes that fit those criteria? When we started off, we were looking for those causes that were important, tractable, and neglected, but we were really, really uncertain about how to weigh those different criteria against each other. If you think about the importance of different health problems or different diseases, it just varies by so many orders of magnitude. Over time, we've been impressed with the returns in the causes that we picked for seeming extremely important and extremely neglected. The things that seemed tractable — or maybe we were pushing on an open door — often we were wrong, or the tractability environment would shift. Our aim — and so far we've seen some success — is being a resource to people who have never heard of effective altruism or are not interested in it or don't find it very motivating or welcoming. Your ability to predict tractability is so much lower. I hope that we'll prioritize continuing to double down on some of our existing causes that we think are really important, and continuing to look for ones that are really neglected and could be an outlier. How do you see that relationship going forward? But I do think effective altruism as a community isn't necessarily something that is very appealing to everybody. Our aim — and so far we've seen some success — is being a resource to people who have never heard of effective altruism or are not interested in it or don't find it very motivating or welcoming. You've talked about being open to failure in pursuit of outsized impact — something philanthropy talks about more than it practices. There's a lot of rhetoric in philanthropy about being open to failure and taking risks and pursuing high-risk, high-return opportunities. It can be really hard, within the confines of most organizations, to actually make those bets and see them fail and then iterate. But we have felt like the returns to being able to take those risks have been really high. I don't think we would have been able to fund a lot of the scientific research that we funded over the last decade without accepting that most of it isn't going to end up having a big humanitarian impact. We've been funding David Baker at the University of Washington for a long time, on applying AI and ML to design proteins — and he won the Nobel Prize along with the Google DeepMind leaders in chemistry last year. When I started, I kind of had an idea of, you either want to be in the maximally high-risk space or in the GiveWell space. But I think over time we've seen a lot of success in the middle space, where you're making progress on something important on a reasonable guess. Our current view is that you can really do effective philanthropy, and the returns can look similar in some ways across that risk spectrum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  This account of events surrounding the deadly Camp Mystic flooding in Hunt, Texas, is based on lawsuits, official statements and other reporting from CNN and its news affiliates. Weeks before 8-year-old Eloise “Lulu” Peck was carried off by the violent Texas floods that swallowed Camp Mystic in a surge of darkness and debris, she had suddenly begun to fear the forces that would one day claim her. She filled a page in her notebook with a drawing of rising water, black skies and the kind of creeping dread that children rarely have words for. In the pitch-black, storm-lashed hours before dawn on Independence Day, surging floodwaters ravaged Hunt and Kerr County in central Texas, including the summer camp filled with sleeping children. Four months' worth of rain fell in just hours and the nearby Guadalupe River rose to 30 feet, sweeping homes, cars, campers and cabins downstream. The catastrophic flooding killed 27 girls and counselors at Camp Mystic. Lulu's family, along with the families of 17 oth﻿er campers and two counselors, have filed lawsuits against the all-girls Christian camp and its owners, accusing them of gross negligence. The four lawsuits, filed last week, are the first attempt by grieving parents to seek accountability for the flood that turned a haven of faith and childhood friendships into a scene of unimaginable loss. “The conditions surrounding their deaths were marked by absolute horror, physical pain, and emotional distress, all of which were foreseeable and preventable had Defendants acted with even minimal care for their safety,” the Peck family lawsuit said. They held on, blind to whatever threats drifted beneath the murky surface. “Some victims survived for a period of time, while trapped within the cabins, enduring prolonged physical suffering, panic, and terror as the water level rose beyond their reach,” the Peck family lawsuit alleges. Families of 15 Camp Mystic flood victims file lawsuits claiming gross negligence after 27 girls and counselors died They climbed through windows, dragging terrified girls into the deluge, running across mud-slicked ground to the top of a hill. Hours passed as they waited, soaked and shivering in the relentless rain, listening “to screams for help from other cabins that housed their friends and fellow campers,” says the lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors who perished: Anna Margaret Bellows, Lila Bonner, Chloe Childress, Molly DeWitt, Katherine Ferruzzo, Lainey Landry and Blakely McCrory. Five other cabins were evacuated to Rec Hall, an older, two-story structure on higher ground than the lower lying cabins, according to that lawsuit. Those cabins are where little girls had been sleeping, mere steps from the swelling river. In the Twins cabins, girls startled awake by thunder begged Edward Eastland, a camp director and the co-owners' son, to allow them to evacuate. Several girls decided to swim out to avoid drowning in the cabin, and others were swept out by rushing waters. Some girls never made it out of the cabin,” stated that same lawsuit. About 30 minutes later, Eastland and several girls were washed out to a tree nearby, where they held on through the night. Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts told CNN that despite spotty cell coverage and chaotic conditions, Eastland and his father, Richard “Dick” Eastland, were actively helping evacuate campers within 2 hours of receiving the first warning, emphasizing that the camp had moved 166 girls to safety during those critical hours. Dick Eastland, who co-owned Camp Mystic with his wife, Tweety, died trying to save some of the girls, a family spokesperson has said. It was Texas' deadliest freshwater flooding in more than a century. Camp Mystic's owner warned of floods for decades. Yet, Camp Mystic failed to build adequate warning systems, evacuation routes, or modern flood safeguards, the victims' family lawsuits allege. Eastland warned for decades about the hidden dangers of the beautiful but volatile Guadalupe River, a peril he saw firsthand while running his family's youth camp alongside its banks. He successfully pushed for a new flood warning system after 10 children at a nearby camp were swept to their deaths in 1987, and in recent years served on the board of the local river authority as it supported renewed efforts to improve warnings on the Guadalupe. “I'm sure there will be other drownings,” Eastland said in a 1990 interview with the Austin American-Statesman. Eastland has been praised as a hero for his efforts to save campers and remembered as a beloved figure by generations who spent their summers in the idyllic riverside refuge. About a decade after it was installed, the warning system Eastland had championed in the late ‘80s had already become antiquated and broken. Yet periodic attempts to adopt a more modern flood-monitoring system, including one with warning sirens that might have alerted campers last week, repeatedly failed to gain traction – stalled by low budgets, some local opposition and a lack of state support. Most of the cabins had been located in FEMA's 100-year “Special Flood Hazard Area” up until 2013. “Since July 1932, Camp Mystic knew that cabins that housed defenseless little girls sat in the bullseye of potential flood waters from the Guadalupe River and never said a word about it to trusting parents,” the Peck family lawsuit says. “Since that date, Camp Mystic continued to play Russian Roulette with the lives of the little girls, disregarding what Camp Mystic knew would be an unspeakable tragedy when the flood hit those cabins.” Camp Mystic plans to reopen after flooding killed 27 people The original maps, with all due respect to the forefathers of FEMA, were kind of done on paper and crayon. We have elevation to a 10th of an inch. While Camp Mystic sympathizes with the grieving families, “We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well,” camp counsel Jeff Ray said in a statement last week. In their final hours, Camp Mystic's young campers, many of whom likely still slept with stuffed animals and needed help braiding their hair, faced a terror their parents can barely bring themselves to imagine. Others spent their last panicked moments in darkness, surrounded by cries and the roar of a river that had swallowed the world outside. His car was submerged and found the next day, appearing to have been “smashed against a tree. Camp Mystic's ‘littlest souls' were nurtured in Bubble Inn. “Their parents are left to live every single day for the rest of their lives with the intense grief de and the thoughts of what their babies endured that fateful night,” says the lawsuit filed by the families of Virginia “Wynne” Naylor, Hadley Hanna, Virginia Hollis, Jane “Janie” Hunt, Lucy Lee Dillon, and Kellyanne Lytal. What haunts them most is the belief that their daughters didn't have to die. Even as floodwaters breached the cabins, no order to flee was given until it was far too late — despite the fact that safer ground was just a few hundred feet away. A hill only 20 yards from Bubble Inn could have been reached “in a matter of seconds,” one of the lawsuits says. Camp Mystic's entire emergency plan fit on a single page, offering a few instructions for all potential disasters, according to the same lawsuit. The last two lines of the document instructed children to remain inside their cabins during flooding and reassured them that “all cabins are constructed on high, safe locations.” Watts told CNN that the camp's decision to keep everyone sheltered in place followed long-standing safety guidance from local and national authorities, who warned against moving through floodwaters. Counselors and campers, they say, were left to improvise. “We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area.” Camp Mystic has announced plans to partially reopen next summer for its 100th anniversary. While parents remain frozen in the darkest chapter of their lives, still waking to the nightmares of what their daughters endured, still fighting for answers, they say Camp Mystic has already begun turning the page. Linnie Anne McCown, Abby Lynn Pohl, Margaret Gaffney Sheedy, Mary Barrett Stevens and Greta Katherine Toranzo were just 8 to 10 years old when floodwater swept them away. Months after the flood, the families say they have yet to hear meaningful acknowledgment or responsibility from those in charge. The lawsuits describe an institution concerned more with its reputation than its reckoning — fixated on reopening a for-profit camp while parents struggle through a grief that has no end date. The world may be ready to move on. CNN's Curt Devine, Casey Tolan, Pamela Brown, Shoshana Dubnow and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) is soon to come face-to-face with difficult political decisions thanks to the actions of House Republicans. The House plans to pass legislation this week to compel the release of the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files that will come on the heels of a last-minute reversal by President Donald Trump, which has been a contentious point of debate among Republicans for months. The lower chamber is also expected to pass a separate measure to roll back a controversial provision tucked into the shutdown-ending funding bill entitling Republican senators whose phone records were surveilled in connection to the 2021 Capitol attack to each sue the federal government for $500,000 or more. A forced Senate vote in September by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to release the files ended in defeat mostly along party lines, with only two Republicans, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Rand Paul (R-KY), siding with all Democrats to vote against tabling the measure. The House's forthcoming vote is being forced against the wishes of Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) after a majority of representatives signed a discharge petition. But don't talk about it too much because, honestly, I don't want to take it away from us. Email correspondence released by House Democrats last week revealed conversations in which Epstein alleged that Trump, prior to becoming president, “spent hours at my house” and “of course he knew about the girls.” Thune's office did not comment on how he intends to handle the Epstein files or legislation on the DOJ surveillance operation known as “Arctic Frost.” As the majority leader, Thune can block most roll-call votes. Johnson has softened his opposition to a provision Thune slipped into recent government funding legislation that greenlights a legal payout to the eight GOP senators whose phone records were subpoenaed without notice by former special counsel Jack Smith in his Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot investigation. It allows those affected lawmakers to sue the DOJ for $500,000 or more in damages and prompted wide-ranging criticism from Republicans, particularly in the House. But after seeking clarity from Thune, Johnson said Senate Republicans' “motivation was pure” and endorsed tweaking the provision so that it only applies to future cases rather than advocating a full repeal. “They were trying to put teeth into the provision of law that prevents these abuses like Jack Smith and these rogue prosecutors who weaponize the DOJ and go after political enemies,” Johnson said on Fox News Sunday. “There ought to be a penalty so we can deter further action like that in the future.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The longest government shutdown in US history shook travel plans across America earlier this month as a shortage of air traffic controllers resulted in thousands of delayed or canceled flights. While AI does have some practical uses in aviation like crunching data on weather patterns or aircraft trajectories, experts highlighted a range of reasons why the technology won't be a substitute for air traffic controllers anytime soon – or likely ever. “It's a human system, and it's human-centered for sure because it demands almost near perfect performance,” said Ross Sagun, a former pilot and air traffic controller with more than 50 years of flight experience. “The smallest mistakes can turn into giant disasters.” Air traffic controllers play a critical role in aviation, guiding jets safely both on the ground and in the air, ensuring safe distances are maintained between aircraft and communicating with pilots – skills that require multitasking, quick decision-making and intense concentration. The Federal Aviation Administration says it handles more than 44,000 flights a day, and 5,500 are in the sky at peak operational times. Hearing emotion and stress in a pilot or fellow controller's voice is a key signal that something is wrong and it's unclear whether AI can detect those cues. “That's where you jump in, you scream for help, and we get people over there to take over the situation,” he said. The rate at which AI is evolving and changing would also make it hard to certify the technology, he added. There's little to no margin for error in air traffic control given the safety risks. Even if the technology were to be used for automating the process of guiding aircraft as they land or take off, human workers would still need to manage unforeseen circumstances, according to Amar Gupta, a research scientist with MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. And some research as far back as the early 2000s suggests that type of arrangement, in which a human worker intervenes in the event of an emergency or automation error, may not always be effective. One study from 2005, for example, found that controllers were more likely to detect incidents manually than when using an automated tool that wasn't 100% reliable. Air traffic controllers might not be as vigilant if automation were to play a bigger role in their jobs since they wouldn't be as actively engaged in the environment, according to Michael McCormick, associate professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Experts say there is a place for AI to help with air traffic control, but it would just be to assist with duties rather than replacing jobs. With many air traffic controllers either retiring or finding other jobs during the shutdown, such help may be welcome. Air traffic controller staffing has plummeted since 2012, according to data cited by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), and the Federal Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan indicates the number of certified professional controllers fell below targets in 2024. AI could be useful for helping controllers understand weather patterns, potentially helping to predict the possibility of storms, according to Sagun. The FAA is working toward an upgraded system that uses AI to help analyze trajectories from aircraft in flight, estimate possible conflicts and provide recommendations to controllers, according to McCormick, though he says it is still years from testing and implementation. Searidge Technologies, owned by United Kingdom-based air traffic control services provider NATS, has developed an AI system for monitoring ground movements and facilitating communication with pilots. The technology is being used at London's Heathrow Airport to track aircraft exiting the runway and Florida's Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to monitor gate occupancy. It's seeing “strong global interest” in its system and expects more “operational rollout and demonstration sites in the coming year,” Ron Reddick, vice president of global sales for Searidge Technologies, said in an emailed statement to CNN. But don't expect major upgrades to happen overnight in the United States. Implementing new technologies into air traffic control requires rigorous testing and is a lengthy ordeal, backed by infrastructure designed to last for decades. The Department of Transportation plans to upgrade the FAA's air traffic control system by 2028 with “all new hardware” and “all new software,” Secretary Sean Duffy said in May. But those upgrades are now going to take longer than initially planned, Duffy recently told reporters at a press conference. “The entire process takes years,” said McCormick when asked how long it would take to implement AI in current air traffic control systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? On Monday, the UN Security Council approved a US-drafted plan that calls for an international security force and that at least keeps the door open for eventual Palestinian statehood. Some 268 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the ceasefire began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, on top of those killed by Hamas. But there's been no return to the full-scale combat that persisted for two years. An acute risk to warfare resuming centers around dozens of Hamas fighters — perhaps as many as 200, though no one knows exactly — who have been trapped in underground tunnels behind Israeli lines since before the ceasefire, cut off from their compatriots and likely running low on food and water. They were likely responsible for the two ambushes that killed three IDF soldiers in October, each prompting Israeli retaliatory strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip. Along with the ongoing dispute over whether Hamas is doing all it can to return the bodies of deceased hostages, the trapped Hamas fighters are also proving to be a diplomatic stumbling block, preventing the sides from moving on to larger issues: Israel wants the fighters to turn over their weapons and surrender; Hamas wants them to be given safe passage back to Hamas-controlled territory; the Trump administration wants the whole thing to go away. Five weeks after the ceasefire deal went into effect, Gaza is effectively divided in half: Israeli forces have withdrawn behind the so-called “yellow line,” but they still control a thick and largely depopulated swathe along Gaza's external borders with Israel and Egypt. Hamas has not only not disarmed, it has reasserted control over the areas it controls, carrying out gun battles with rival armed gangs and executing accused collaborators with Israel. Though much of Hamas's leadership in Gaza was wiped out during the war, its rank and file appear surprisingly well-equipped. That's going to be tough, as even White House officials admit in private. Several Muslim-majority countries including Azerbaijan, Indonesia, and Pakistan have expressed interest in contributing troops to the new security force. (Turkey has as well, though that's a non-starter for Israel.) But these countries are not interested in having their troops try to forcibly disarm Hamas, which could involve actual combat with the group amid the rubble of Gaza. And there's little indication that Hamas is interested in disarming on its own. The Israeli government, meanwhile, is not all that interested in moving forward to the later stages of the US peace plan that envision the Palestinian Authority taking control of Gaza and a new push toward a two-state solution. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is hoping to avoid a right-wing exodus that could bring down his government, vowed on Sunday to oppose any attempt to establish a Palestinian state, ahead of the UN vote on the US-drafted resolution, which calls for a “credible pathway” toward statehood. At the moment, the biggest threat in the region may be inertia: Grim as the status quo is, the current leaders of both Hamas and Israel seem to prefer it to moving forward with a political process that would leave Hamas disarmed, politically neutered, and replaced with a Palestinian Authority in a more credible position to demand statehood. Ironically, this is in many ways a return to the situation prior to October 7, 2023, when Hamas and Israel were tacitly working together to marginalize the PA and undermine Palestinian unity. Inertia might be driving both sides into a frozen conflict with each retreating behind the yellow line, but it will be harder to keep conflict frozen with a few dozen armed Hamas militants trapped behind enemy lines. Some see the situation as a potential off-ramp that could allow the peace plan to move forward: Israel could agree to let them go only under the condition that Hamas begin turning over its weapons. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff has suggested that the fighters themselves could be granted amnesty and that this could be a “model” for what they're trying to achieve in the rest of Gaza. The issue reportedly came up in recent talks between Netanyahu and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. As with Hamas and Israel broadly, the current situation can't last forever and efforts to forestall the inevitable may lead to catastrophe. Given the massive retaliation Israel has carried out in response to deadly attacks on its forces over the past month, we may soon be faced with the question of just how much fighting there can be in Gaza while we're still saying a “ceasefire” is in place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Party for Socialism and Liberation chapter, known for its left-wing protests, led a mass uprising in Charlotte this weekend against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Protesters were seen waving Mexican flags and chanting “Chinga La Migra,” a Spanish slogan that roughly translates to “F*** ICE.” Asha Patel, a PSL leader, told WCNC Charlotte that her group is trying to drive deportation officers out of the city, similar to the anti-ICE pressure campaign seen in Chicago. Patel credited these counter-efforts as the reason why Border Patrol withdrew from Chicago late last week. “It's not a coincidence that Border Patrol was forced out of Chicago,” she said. “It was through a mass movement of people demanding that they leave. And so that is what we're doing here today.” PSL Charlotte also held an organizing meeting on Sunday afternoon in a rented office space uptown to strategize on how to disperse federal forces from the city. PSL Charlotte began circulating call-to-action material days before Border Patrol made landfall in North Carolina. PSL Triangle, which covers the cities of Chapel Hill, Raleigh, and Durham, will host an informational event on Thursday night at Nuestro Barrio Liberation Cafe, a coffee shop “dedicated to resistance” near North Carolina Central University's campus, for comrades to learn about how to join the socialist collective. The Network Contagion Research Institute, a watchdog organization that tracks geopolitical influence, previously reported on the PSL's connections to the CCP through its billionaire benefactor, Shanghai-based businessman Neville Roy Singham, a Maoist megadonor known for backing CCP-praising nonprofit organizations and media entities that echo pro-Beijing propaganda. With the stated objective of overthrowing America's capitalist system, PSL calls on its city-specific chapters to stage disruptive protests across the country. PSL's members participated in the anti-Israel encampment on Columbia University's campus. According to authorities, the mob blocked doors and adjacent roads. When the summer riots in Los Angeles erupted, PSL activated followers from all corners of the country to rise up in solidarity, orchestrate parallel protests, and even intimidate ICE agents. For example, PSL's Los Angeles branch gathered Angelenos on the steps of City Hall to get “ICE Out of LA,” a rallying phrase that has since been repurposed for cities targeted by federal immigration officials. PSL's San Antonio arm explained to the San Antonio Express-News that they believe the more cities that oppose ICE operations through these mass mobilization campaigns, the more difficult a federal crackdown will become. Hawley cited “credible reporting,” suggesting that the PSL provided financial resources or logistical support to individuals engaged in “lawless mob actions.” The senator's letter, addressed to PSL leadership, noted that knowingly financing unlawful protest activity is considered aiding and abetting criminal conduct.</p>
