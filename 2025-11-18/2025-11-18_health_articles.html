                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center found that patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) may benefit from receiving immunotherapy earlier in the course of treatment. Results from the phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03521830), presented Oct. 20 at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual meeting, show that first-line nivolumab, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, produced an objective response rate (ORR) of 52% in 29 patients with inoperable BCC. Our results show that we can improve the likelihood of tumor response in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma by administering anti-PD-1 in the front line, rather than after hedgehog pathway inhibitors. We look forward to further investigating these findings in larger, randomized trials." Govind Warrier, M.D., M.P.H., assistant professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and co-leader of the study Investigators also explored whether adding relatlimab, an anti–LAG-3 immune checkpoint inhibitor, to nivolumab could induce tumor regressions in patients whose disease had progressed on nivolumab alone. The rationale for testing this combination was based on promising results in melanoma studies, where adding anti-LAG-3 to anti-PD-1 helped overcome resistance to single agent anti-PD-1, and from work at Johns Hopkins revealing that LAG-3 may be an important immune checkpoint in BCC. LAG-3 was first co-characterized by scientists at the Bloomberg–Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Nivolumab is FDA-approved for patients with melanoma and several other cancers. Relatlimab in combination with nivolumab is FDA-approved for melanoma and is being tested in patients with a variety of other cancer types. Current first-line treatment with hedgehog pathway inhibitors is often limited by short-lived responses and intolerable side effects. "These findings highlight important opportunities to improve outcomes for patients with advanced BCC, a population with few effective treatments," Warrier said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study investigating neuroinflammation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain, a small, midbrain dopaminergic region, has found that acute and chronic depression are associated with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. The findings from this new study in Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, published by Elsevier, help clarify the VTA's role as a potential target for developing more targeted and state-specific treatments for depression. Depression affects approximately 300 million individuals worldwide, making it a leading cause of disability. Inflammation has consistently been linked to depression in both clinical and population studies. Disruptions within this reward circuitry are thought to underlie core depressive symptoms such as anhedonia and low motivation. "Our study focused on the VTA because it is at the core of the mesocortical and mesolimbic systems, which are both strongly associated with depression due to their central roles in reward processing, motivation, and emotional regulation. However, because of its small size and complex structure, the VTA has been relatively neglected in neuroimaging research," notes co-lead investigator Lena K.L. The researchers wanted to determine whether the VTA could reveal biological differences in individuals with a history of depression (chronic state) or current depressive symptoms (acute state). They analyzed MRI markers sensitive to inflammation and brain microstructure, specifically measures of extracellular and intracellular water content in the VTA, using a large and diverse sample from 32,495 UK Biobank participants, including 3,807 individuals with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)-diagnosed depression. Co-lead investigator Sarah Khalife, PhD candidate, School of Psychology, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, explains, "We found that individuals with a history of major depression showed higher MRI markers associated with neuroinflammation (free water and isotropic volume fraction) in the VTA, suggesting increased extracellular inflammatory processes. In contrast, current depressive symptom severity was associated with distinct microstructural changes (higher intracellular volume fraction and orientation dispersion, but lower isotropic volume fraction), indicating that acute and chronic depression may involve different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms." "By focusing on the VTA and using updated brainstem atlases, the investigators were able to map the VTA more precisely and contribute to the limited body of human imaging research on this region, illuminating the VTA's role as a potential future therapeutic target for depression," concludes Editor-in-Chief of Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging Cameron S.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) will host its first Digital & AI Summit in Berlin on 21-22 November, bringing together global experts in cardiology, technology, and healthcare. This two-day event will spotlight the latest artificial intelligence (AI) developments and explore how digital innovation can drive life-saving progress in cardiovascular care. The summit's 61 sessions will include three roundtables in which academic and industry experts, along with patient representatives, will discuss trustworthiness and user friendliness of AI, as well as issues surrounding regulation, cost and policies for integrating the technology. "Clinical implementation of AI is currently the final frontier we are trying to reach, yet some 90% of what we have so far are developments, proof-of-concept studies and early validations," says Summit co-chair Associate Professor Nico Bruining, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands. "Few AI tools are in clinical use today because they still need validation, regulatory approval, and financing. Post-market surveillance, ethical safeguards, patient acceptance, and clinician education are also essential for successful implementation." They also aim to inform policymakers and media, whose accurate reporting is essential for public understanding as AI evolves." The first roundtable, Trustworthiness of AI, will include a talk by Frank Rademakers, Emeritus Professor of Medicine at KU Leuven, Belgium, who says: "AI tools should not be treated differently from other diagnostic and therapeutic agents that we use in medicine. They should be evaluated for their intended purpose in the intended population and context with appropriate clinical investigations, including but not exclusively randomised controlled trials. In contrast with most drugs and medical devices, however, AI software can 'drift' during use., and also further learn and improve with use; so more emphasis should be placed on post-market continuous evaluation of each AI tool during its real-world use in specific environments." The roundtable on User experience with AI will include a presentation by David Duncker, Head of the Hannover Heart Rhythm Center, Germany. "Clinician trust is key to successfully using AI in ECG diagnostics. For example, Holter ECG analysis by AI is already implemented into clinical practice. But while prediction of future atrial fibrillation in sinus rhythm ECGs worked in some studies, it is not yet ready to use for clinical decision-making," Duncker says. Professor Fraser says: "Referring uncritically to the potential of 'artificial intelligence' in general is not constructive; we should consider each application more precisely. Innovation in healthcare led by technological advances looking for clinical applications is misguided. AI has already shown great promise in cardiology, but trust, usability, cost, safety and regulations are key to integrating it into clinical practice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers led by investigators at Mass General Brigham have discovered that over the last 25 years, heat and cold-related deaths have caused more than 69,000 deaths in the U.S., disproportionately affecting certain populations. "Prior research, many of which was ecological, modeling or forecasting in nature, has examined heat- and cold-related deaths separately, but this study provides a real, observed nationwide and contemporary assessment of deaths related to non-optimal temperatures at both ends of the spectrum and across key demographic subgroups," said senior author Shady Abohashem, MD, MPH, investigator at the Cardiovascular Imaging Research Center of Massachusetts General Hospital and Mass General Brigham Heart and Vascular Institute. Abohashem is also an instructor at Harvard Medical School. For their study, Abohashem and his colleagues analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) platform, specifically looking for death certificates that recorded temperature as a contributing or underlying cause of death based on codes from medical records. Between 1999 and 2024, there were 69,713,971 U.S. deaths, of which 69,256 (1 out of every 1,000) had extreme temperature exposure recorded as an underlying or contributing cause (35% heat-related and 65% cold-related). Crude estimates indicated that temperature-related mortality rates were higher in more recent years. "Our findings show that both heat and cold exposure continue to claim thousands of lives every year in the United States, deaths that are largely preventable," said Abohashem. "While most temperature-related deaths are still driven by cold exposure, heat-related deaths are expected to rise as climate change accelerates." Older adults (≥65 years) and males had higher temperature-related mortality compared with their counterparts. Cold-related adjusted mortality rates were likewise greatest for Blacks, followed by Whites and Hispanics. "Climate change increases risks of severe weather events, and our findings underscore the need for targeted adaptation strategies, like improving housing quality, access to cooling and heating, and early-warning systems, to protect vulnerable groups as climate extremes intensify," said Abohashem. "The results help us understand which populations may be disproportionately affected so public health strategies can shift accordingly."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Biology have identified a unique mechanism involved in the aging of the immune system – along with a framework for enhancing its function in older individuals. The study, published in Nature Aging, was led by Assistant Professor Noga Ron-Harel and doctoral student David Ezuz. In addition to serving as the body's main reservoir of white blood cells, the spleen contains a specialized region responsible for breaking down defective red blood cells and recycling their iron-rich components. This essential process becomes less efficient with age, leading to the accumulation of iron deposits and toxic by-products in the spleen. These create an oxidative environment that damages T cells. The researchers found that even brief exposure of young T cells to an "aged spleen" impairs their immune effectiveness. In response to this toxic environment, and in an effort to protect themselves, T cells reduce their iron uptake and sequester the iron already present within the cell in protein complexes that lower its availability. However, this protective mechanism has a downside: since available iron is essential for T-cell activation, their ability to respond is significantly weakened. In experiments on elderly mice, this intervention improved the activation of aged T cells and enhanced the immune response of older mice to vaccination.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 10 of Aging-US on October 3, 2025, titled "Growth hormone excess drives liver aging via increased glycation stress." In this study, led by first author Parminder Singh alongside with corresponding authors Pankaj Kapahi from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and Andrzej Bartke from Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, researchers investigated how elevated growth hormone (GH) levels contribute to liver aging and dysfunction. The study suggests that managing glycation stress may help prevent or treat liver diseases linked to abnormal hormone levels. Excess GH is known to cause different disorders, but its long-term impact on internal organs like the liver has remained unclear. "Pathological conditions such as acromegaly or pituitary tumors result in elevated circulating GH levels, which have been implicated in a spectrum of metabolic disorders, potentially by regulating liver metabolism." The team found that young mice with GH overexpression showed molecular and cellular patterns similar to those in naturally aged livers. On one hand, the metabolic changes were associated with the buildup of advanced glycation end products, harmful compounds formed when sugars attach to proteins or fats without proper regulation. On the other hand, the immune and inflammatory changes reflected a process known as "inflammaging," a form of chronic, low-grade inflammation commonly associated with aging. Importantly, the team showed that reducing glycation stress can reverse many of these negative effects. Mice treated with a compound that lowers glycation levels demonstrated improved liver health, reduced insulin resistance, and enhanced physical function. This intervention also corrected several abnormal genetic patterns caused by excess GH. The findings point to a potential therapeutic strategy for liver diseases associated with aging and hormonal imbalances. Overall, this research identifies glycation and its byproducts as key contributors to liver damage caused by excess GH.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the University of Tokyo developed an experimental method to induce a strong physiological response linked to psychological pressure by making participants aim for a streak of success in a task. Their findings suggest this approach reproduces pressurelike conditions in a laboratory setting more effectively than traditional methods, affording easier access to the study of this state. Whether in an exam hall or on the field, to "crack" under pressure is a common trope. But the path to study such ideas is far from simple. Being rigorous in the field of psychology is extremely difficult, as there are limitless factors that can impact different people in different ways. Previous experimental methods have been limited in that they failed to induce strong physiological arousal. Driven by such limitations and an urge to better understand the impacts of pressure on performance, Professor Kazutoshi Kudo and his team at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences set out to devise a better method. Their aim was to find how to produce strong physiological arousal in subjects in ways that allowed them to isolate the effects of different kinds of tasks, so that the nature of the tasks, settings and other variables could be methodically measured and accounted for. It was also important for them that their method could exist at larger scales than is often possible for tests and trials in this field. The takeaway is that how we frame a goal can strongly shape both arousal and performance." The team set up two simple tasks and had 30 participants try them. In the first "streak-goal" experiment, 15 people had to press a sensor with a specific amount of force, not too much nor too little, and they had to try and get it right 10 times in a row. In the second "totals-goal" test, a group of 15 were tasked with getting 100 successes overall, but they did not have to be consecutive. During the tests, participants' heart rates were measured to gauge their state of arousal. Kudo and team found that in the first experiment, people's heart rates rose rapidly the longer they maintained their streaks, showing they were feeling more pressured. What was a little surprising, though, was that their performance - the ability to accurately reproduce an equal amount of force with their finger each time - improved rather than dropped. In the second experiment, heart rates and performance levels remained far more consistent. All this implies the sense of pressure only really came when the idea was to keep a streak of successes going. "The streak goal produced a large, escalating rise in heart rate as people approached longer streaks, on the order of about 20 beats per minute in our lab setting, much larger than in typical lab experiments," said Kudo. "Also, under the streak goal, performance improved steadily rather than dropping, at least for this simple task. To many these findings will seem intuitively obvious; racing a clock, or performing contingent rather than independent actions will naturally make some feel more pressured. But what the point of these experiments was to demonstrate that this method can tease out the differences in responses in a controlled and measurable way. The "consecutive success" method gives scientists a simple and efficient way to create psychological pressure in a lab environment without needing external drivers such as rewards or audiences, which have been used in the past. The streak frame does exactly that, as the streak grows, each trial matters more, so we asked whether this would more faithfully capture real‑world pressure and how it relates to performance." This idea could also evolve into tools to study athletic training, mental health, stress management, education and even musical performance. Though, before then, the team aims to build upon these early experiments. Because our arousal manipulation is simple and nonverbal, it could even extend to animal studies, enabling comparative research on the neural mechanisms underlying performance changes during high-arousal situations," said Kudo.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigella sativa (black cumin), the spice that boosts the flavor of curries like korma and paneer also has another use: its seeds have long been used as a medicinal plant in traditional medicine for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Now, a clinical trial led by Osaka Metropolitan University suggests that they also have anti-obesity benefits. To investigate these effects, a team led by Associate Professor Akiko Kojima-Yuasa of the Graduate School of Human Life and Ecology used cellular experiments and human clinical trials. In the human clinical trial, participants who consumed 5g of black cumin seed powder daily-roughly a tablespoon-for 8 weeks showed significant reductions in blood triglycerides, LDL ('bad') cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels. Improvements in blood lipid profiles like these are associated with a lower risk of heart problems and premature death. They found that black cumin seed extract inhibited adipogenesis-the formation and maturation of fat cells-by blocking both fat droplet accumulation and the differentiation process. "This study strongly suggests that black cumin seeds are useful as a functional food for preventing obesity and lifestyle-related diseases," Professor Kojima-Yuasa said. "It was so gratifying to see black cumin comprehensively demonstrate actual, demonstrable blood lipid-lowering effects in a human trial." "We hope to perform longer-term and larger-scale clinical trials to investigate the effects of black cumin on metabolism," she added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a surprising discovery, a 'sticky molecule' that occurs naturally in our blood vessels could be both a culprit behind blood clots and organ failure during COVID and long COVID and the key to new treatments to counter COVID-related viruses. "P-selectin is expressed on platelets – the cells that cause blood clots – and it promotes virus and platelet complexes that can cause dangerous blood clots, a major driver of death in severe COVID infection, and also a likely cause of long COVID," said lead researcher Dr. Cesar Moreno from the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre and Faculty of Science. But P-selectin also normally controls white blood cell migration through our body., and our study found that during COVID infection, P-selectin also captures SARS-CoV-2 virus in the blood, holding the virus in blood vessels and blocking its ability to infect our cells." Importantly, when the researchers created an mRNA-based therapy that could drive P-selectin expression in the absence of inflammation, it provided broad protection against coronavirus infection. "Since P-selectin can catch the virus and block its ability to infect our cells, we took advantage of this to create a broad-acting mRNA therapy that can protect against known and most likely emerging coronavirus pandemic strains," said Dr Moreno. Beyond P-selectin, they found 33 other new genes that can protect us from SARS- CoV-2, and these genes can likely also be used as protective therapies against coronavirus and probably also other major viral infections. "Vaccines have significantly reduced disease severity and deaths, but whether it's coronavirus or other strains, at some stage new pandemics will pose a threat to us. Having broad, easily manufactured mRNA therapies ready can help mitigate these risks," said senior author Professor Greg Neely, Head of the Dr. John and Anne Chong Lab for Functional Genomics at the University of Sydney. "In some cases people can't get vaccinated, and for these people our strategy can provide another source of protection from current or emerging viral threats," "We now have a realistic strategy to future-proof against the next pandemic."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Successful root canal treatment could reduce inflammation linked to heart disease and improve levels of blood sugar and cholesterol. In the first of its kind research, a clinical study by King's College London tracked changes in blood chemistry following root canal treatment for a common dental infection (apical periodontitis). The team discovered that successful root canal treatment was associated with: The study followed the health of 65 patients from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust over two years after root canal treatment. Scientists analysed molecules in the blood of patients to reveal how the body processes sugar, fat, other key substances, and responds to disease and treatment. The findings suggest that monitoring blood metabolic markers, such as glucose, fats known as triglycerides, and the protein tryptophan, could help assess recovery and risk after dental treatment. Our findings show that root canal treatment doesn't just improve oral health – it may also help reduce the risk of serious health conditions like diabetes and heart disease. Long-standing root canal infections can allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream, trigger inflammation, and increase blood glucose and fats levels – raising the risk of serious health issues like heart disease and diabetes. It is vital that dental professionals recognize the wider impact of these root canal infections and advocate for early diagnosis and treatment. We also need to move towards integrated care, where dentists and general practitioners work together to monitor the risks through these blood markers and protect overall health. Dr. Sadia Niazi, Lead Author, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Endodontology, King's College London While more research is needed to confirm these effects in larger populations, the study opens exciting new doors for understanding how oral care can support general health and wellbeing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The likelihood of high blood pressure is clearly higher among people who have both sleep apnea and insomnia. This is shown by a study from the University of Gothenburg. High blood pressure is one of the most important risk factors for heart attack and stroke. Elevated blood pressure can have many underlying causes, such as obesity, stress, or kidney disease. Sleep apnea is already known as a contributing factor - but for the first time, this study shows that the combination of sleep apnea and insomnia represents the strongest risk factor for uncontrolled hypertension. Insomnia refers to long-term sleep difficulties - such as trouble falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night, or waking too early in the morning. Participants underwent extensive health examinations, including blood pressure measurements and an overnight home sleep study. Blood pressure readings above 140/90 mmHg were considered high. Mio Kobayashi Frisk, physician at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and doctoral student at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, is lead author of the study: "We see that it is specifically the combination of sleep apnea and insomnia that is most clearly linked to high blood pressure. This is important knowledge for identifying patients who are at the greatest risk and need closer monitoring in healthcare," says Mio Kobayashi Frisk. Good sleep is now part of the international recommendations for protecting heart health. For patients with both sleep apnea and insomnia, treatment with a breathing mask may not always be enough - support with sleep habits or cognitive behavioral therapy can also be important to reduce the risk of high blood pressure."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the Neuroscience 2025 conference, Bruker Corporation today announced the release of the xView Module for Ultima 2Pplus multiphoton microscopes to significantly extend imaging scale and experiment flexibility for advanced neuroscience research. This patent-pending upgrade enhances the field-of-view (FOV) of Ultima systems by more than 2.5 times to enable high-resolution imaging of neural activity across larger brain areas, without compromising speed or sensitivity. Engineered to meet the growing demands of systems neuroscience research, the xView Module empowers researchers to visualize more expansive neural circuits in tandem with optogenetic activation, using Bruker's NeuraLight 3D Ultra Module for holographic photostimulation. This unprecedented commercial pairing of a vast imaging FOV with complementary large-volume optogenetics makes it possible to study input-output relationships and manipulate widespread neuronal networks for insights toward brain-wide connectivity and function. The xView Module is particularly suited for broader imaging studies of epileptic activity across the brain and circuit mapping for understanding mechanisms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. “Over the past months I have been using xView to study the spatial and temporal properties of circuits across cortical brain regions, where the increase in FOV has been critical to achieve meaningful data,” said Associate Professor Caroline Runyan of the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Neuroscience. “I am excited to be able to combine this new capability with 3D optogenetics on our Ultima 2Pplus microscopes.” The xView Module unlocks a new scale of imaging for neuroscience. By expanding the FOV while maintaining optical precision, we are continuing to build upon the Ultima platform's success and research capabilities and push the limits of imaging instrumentation. We are looking forward to seeing the benefits and discoveries this helps bring to the scientific community.” Xiaomei Li, Ph.D., Vice President and General Manager, Bruker's Fluorescence Microscopy Business Please use one of the following formats to cite this article in your essay, paper or report: Bruker launches xView Module for Ultima 2Pplus multiphoton microscopes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scottish Brain Sciences (SBS), a leading clinical research organization dedicated to transforming the early detection and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, today announced that it has opened a new state-of-the-art clinical research center at ONE BioHub, Aberdeen. By establishing a presence within ONE BioHub, a launchpad for start-ups and high potential life science companies looking to rapidly scale and grow, SBS joins a growing network of research-driven companies including NovaBiotics and Genomes.io already based at ONE BioHub. From ONE BioHub, SBS will play a central role in connecting brain health research with clinical and commercial pathways, strengthening Scotland's position as an international hub for brain health innovation and further contributing to the country's wider life sciences growth strategy. The Aberdeen site was officially opened on 14th November by Aberdeen-based research participant, Lynne Carroll and was also attended by Richard Lochhead MSP, Minister for Business and Employment, who will highlight the Company's investment as a boost to Scotland's innovation economy and public health landscape. This new site will help ensure that people here can take part in trials, receive advanced assessments, and contribute to discoveries that could change the future of Alzheimer's disease. Inviting one of our research participants to officially open this center reflects our belief that progress begins and ends with the people who volunteer to take part. Lynne Carroll, Scottish Brain Sciences research participant, added: "It took several years to receive my Alzheimer's diagnosis, and that is the reality for so many people. By being part of research that aims to detect and treat Alzheimer's earlier, I hope I can help make the path a little clearer for others in the future. When they shared plans to open a research site in Aberdeen, I was thrilled, as it means I will be able to take part in trials that may require regular visits. It is a privilege to be involved in today's opening, and I would encourage anyone locally affected by Alzheimer's to connect with the team." Dr Deborah O'Neil OBE FRSE, Chair, ONE Life Sciences and BioAberdeen Ltd: "We are delighted that Scottish Brain Science is expanding at ONE BioHub. Their focus on advancing understanding and treatment of neurological conditions adds important strengths to our growing life sciences cluster. The north east has a vibrant community of life science innovators and it is wonderful to see our first tenant growing and scaling within ONE BioHub."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by University of Toronto researchers has shown that immune cells in the gut follow an atypical pathway to produce antibodies that provide long-term protection against viruses. While COVID-19 and flu vaccines reduce the risk of severe complications of illness, they are less effective at preventing infections at the outset. If you could make a mucosal immune response that's durable, that's the Holy Grail because then you're blocking entry of the virus. One of the biggest challenges in developing a mucosal vaccine has been figuring out how to create a long-lasting IgA response. Gommerman says that previous research, including a 2020 study from her group in collaboration with Anne-Claude Gingras, have shown that even though natural infections with viruses like SARS-CoV-2 do generate a local immune response, those responses fade quickly. "When we looked at the key IgA antibody that protects us against infection, those antibody levels really don't last," she says. At the same time, researchers also knew that a long-lasting, vaccine-induced IgA response was possible. "We know that oral vaccination against rotavirus and polio gives you lifelong immunity, so we hypothesized that maybe there was something about the oral route and the small intestine that could allow for a long-lived IgA response," says Gommerman. To test their hypothesis, the research team, led by postdoctoral fellow Kei Haniuda, turned to a mouse model of rotavirus infection with the goal of better understanding how virus-specific IgA immune responses are generated. "The IgA response was shockingly long lived," says Gommerman. "Despite the virus being cleared within about 10 days, the response continued to improve over time, so you end up having IgA antibodies that are very, very good at recognizing rotavirus." She thinks there may be something unique about the gut environment - for example, its anatomy and rich microbial community - that enables it to generate such a durable and effective immune response. These findings support the potential of oral vaccination as a strategy to protect against respiratory viruses, but Gommerman notes that there are also significant hurdles to creating an oral vaccine. Building on this work, she recently submitted a funding application to pursue the development of an oral vaccine against highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. Her lab is also exploring a complementary approach using the microbiome to make current flu and COVID-19 vaccines - which are delivered by injection - more "mucosal-friendly" and hopefully leading to a stronger IgA response. "We learned how the immune cells get activated, how we can detect them and what signals are critical for their development," says Gommerman. "We can now apply that knowledge to developing better vaccines." Mucosal viral infection elicits long-lived IgA responses via type 1 follicular helper T cells.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Because many cases go undetected and untreated until acute symptoms occur, the Association is scaling up its efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment of HCM. Despite its serious implications, care for HCM remains fragmented, with inconsistent standards and limited early detection. To further address these gaps, the American Heart Association is expanding its existing initiative to improve HCM systems of care and standardize how people with HCM are identified, assessed, referred and treated. With new support from Cytokinetics, the program will grow to include: The new, matching support from Cytokinetics builds on a national effort designed to unify and elevate consistent standards of care for HCM patients financially supported by founding sponsor Bristol Myers Squibb. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be an insidious disease, with some people having no obvious symptoms, while others may only feel symptoms with exercise or exertion. This initiative represents an essential step toward a unified approach to HCM care, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes, enhance quality of life and reduce the risks associated with the disease. Integrated commitment across the system of care is critical to success." "Our longstanding commitment to tackling cardiovascular diseases by discovering and developing innovative medical therapies compels us to support the American Heart Association on this important initiative to create a consistent standard of care for people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy," said Fady I. Malik, M.D., Ph.D., Cytokinetics' executive vice president of research and development. "Because HCM can be complex to identify and treat, we are proud to support the initiative's focus on advancing care and improving outcomes for those affected."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) significantly increased the number of people at risk of HIV diagnosis who were prescribed preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a preventative medication taken in pill or injectable form, according to Rutgers Health–led research. Researchers found rates of PrEP prescribing increased overall and significantly increased relative to the number of new HIV diagnoses across all demographic groups, potentially because of overall increases in PrEP access and decreases in HIV diagnoses. Medicaid expansion is a powerful tool for improving HIV prevention. But the disparities we observed underscore the need to intentionally address barriers that may be limiting access to PrEP for Black and Hispanic communities specifically." Elizabeth Stone, lead author of the study and core member of the Rutgers Center for Health Services Research at the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 35,000 to 40,000 new HIV infections are reported annually in the United States and it is estimated that 36% of people who could benefit from PrEP receive the prescription. Common PrEP medication brands include Truvada and Descovy. When broken down by race, however, disparities are evident. Rutgers researchers said that progress made in HIV prevention through Medicaid expansion is at risk of being lost because of recent policy changes. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, eliminates the increased federal funding for Medicaid expansion populations and introduces additional barriers, including work requirements and more frequent eligibility determinations for enrollees. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over the next 10 years, 7.5 million people will lose Medicaid coverage because of these changes. In their study, researchers found the strongest increases in the ratio of PrEP prescriptions to new HIV diagnoses occurred among men, individuals ages 25 to 34, and white populations. In contrast, Black, Hispanic and Latino populations, who bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV diagnoses, experienced smaller gains. "These disparities highlight the limitations of relying solely on state-by-state insurance expansion to close gaps in HIV prevention," said Stone, an instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New evidence suggests that regularly consuming flavonoid-rich foods, such as berries, citrus, cocoa, and tea, may gently improve mood by supporting brain chemistry and neuroplasticity, offering an accessible dietary strategy for everyday emotional resilience. Study: Effects of Dietary Flavonoids on Mood and Mental Health: A Systematic Review. In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition Reviews, researchers at the University of Reading, UK, evaluated how dietary flavonoids from commonly consumed foods and beverages affect mood and mental health across the lifespan in physically healthy people. Food-based strategies are accessible and familiar, making them easily integrated into daily routines at school, work, and home. However, study results are inconsistent, with varying doses and methods, so clearer evidence is needed to identify what truly helps. Eligibility was guided by the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design framework. Experimental human trials of any age, sex, or ethnicity were included when at least one flavonoid-rich food containing at least fifteen milligrams per one hundred grams or milliliters was provided as whole food or lyophilized powder, and at least one mood or mental health outcome was assessed. Trials using flavonoid extracts, alcohol confounds such as red wine, or clinical conditions influencing physical health or hormone balance were excluded to focus on physically healthy populations. Searches spanned PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus to October 2024. The United States Department of Agriculture and Phenol Explorer databases were used to estimate flavonoid dose when not reported. Parallel and crossover trials were eligible without restrictions on duration or blinding. A total of 38 experimental datasets, involving 1,972 participants, met the criteria. Interventions included wild blueberries, mixed berries, purple grape juice, orange juice, cocoa or dark chocolate, green tea, peppermint, nuts, soy, and apples, with cocoa and wild blueberries being the most studied. Chronic trial durations ranged from five days to twelve months. Mood outcomes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Profile of Mood States, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Bond-Lader visual analogue scales, Beck Depression Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire 9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale 10. Five of the thirteen studies reported benefits, particularly with anthocyanin-rich foods. Three acute wild blueberry datasets showed an increase in Positive Affect in children, young adults, and emerging adults. Several cocoa-based acute trials showed no change, suggesting that dose, food matrix, or expectancy may influence the detection of the impact. Overall, acute responses appear to be possible but inconsistent across different foods and time points. Twelve of twenty-five studies favored flavonoid supplementation, including wild blueberry for depressive symptoms in adolescents, cherry for anxiety and alertness, cocoa for lower negative affect in select designs, as well as peppermint, orange juice, walnuts during exam stress, green tea, and multi-food patterns. Benefits were most common in anthocyanin-rich choices consumed daily over weeks. Null results were also reported, indicating that population factors, baseline diet, dose ranging from 30 to 774 milligrams of anthocyanins per day, duration of at least three to four weeks, and outcome tool selection shape the observed results. Biological plausibility is supported by known mechanisms. Flavonoids can cross the blood-brain barrier, act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, influencing the levels of serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline, and modulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a key driver of neuroplasticity. Observational data, including analyses from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, link anthocyanidin intake with lower prevalence of depression. Meanwhile, intervention studies show that a diet combined with activity programs can improve well-being. These signals align with the idea that habitual food-based flavonoid intake may support mood. For daily life, this translates to making repeated choices, such as adding berries to breakfast, swapping a sugary snack for citrus, or opting for high-cocoa dark chocolate in mindful portions. These strategies may be particularly helpful during exam stress or acute mental stress, when timing and cognitive load can significantly influence outcomes. To summarize, in physically healthy populations, dietary flavonoids exhibit promising yet heterogeneous benefits for mood, with stronger evidence from chronic interventions rich in anthocyanins. Effects are modest and context-dependent, but align with plausible neurobiological pathways, including monoamine oxidase inhibition and brain-derived neurotrophic factor support. More straightforward dosing guidelines, standardized outcomes, and more diverse samples are needed to guide practice and policy.
