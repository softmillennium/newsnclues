In the last few minutes Cloudflare has confirmed it is aware of a major issue affecting its Global Network, which is causing widespread internet outages ranging from platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to ChatGPT, and, ironically, Downdetector. A wave of other websites and services are also experiencing outages. Cloudflare's latest update says: "Update - We continue to see errors drop as we work through services globally and clearing remaining errors and latency." Looks like this one is winding up folks, with most errors and disruption now cleared. I won't mince words: earlier today we failed our customers and the broader Internet when a problem in Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us. The sites, businesses, and organizations that rely on Cloudflare depend on us being available and I apologize for the impact that we caused. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services. That issue, impact it caused, and time to resolution is unacceptable. Work is already underway to make sure it does not happen again, but I know it caused real pain today. The trust our customers place in us is what we value the most and we are going to do what it takes to earn that back. Don't worry if you have issues, this is a planned scheduled maintenance and not part of the global outage. Which should hopefully be coming to an end. Scheduled - We will be performing scheduled maintenance in SYD (Sydney) datacenter on 2025-11-18 between 15:00 and 19:00 UTC.Traffic might be re-routed from this location, hence there is a possibility of a slight increase in latency during this maintenance window for end-users in the affected region. For PNI / CNI customers connecting with us in this location, please make sure you are expecting this traffic to fail over elsewhere during this maintenance window as network interfaces in this datacentre may become temporarily unavailable.You can now subscribe to these notifications via Cloudflare dashboard and receive these updates directly via email, PagerDuty and webhooks (based on your plan): https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/notification-available/#cloudflare-status.Nov 18, 2025 15:00-19:00 UTC The team will look for issues and ask for reports from a number of sources with which they have close ties. Update - Some customers may be still experiencing issues logging into or using the Cloudflare dashboard. At 14:19 GMT, there were a reported 11,145 Cloudflare issues logged to the site. Monitoring - A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. This is a little worrying, but according to TunaTops in the comments for this story, PADS (Personnel Access Data System) a background check site for nuclear plants is also impacted by the Cloudflare outage. This means that visitor access to their respective nuclear plant is currently not available. PADS is software used in the US commercial nuclear industry to manage access authorization for workers. This includes tracking their fitness for duty and training. PADS has nothing to do with running the nuclear power station, but it does impact who is working there. But dear reader, there is nothing to worry about. Cloudflare's latest update has restored dashboard services, but outages remain. Update - We've deployed a change which has restored dashboard services. We are still working to remediate broad application services impactNov 18, 2025 - 14:34 UTC Update - We are continuing to work on a fix for this issue.Nov 18, 2025 - 14:22 UTC Not even lunch is safe from Cloudflare's current outage, according to one Reddit user. Our colleagues at TechRadar acquired a statement directly from CloudFlare itself, as the service continues to investigate the ongoing downtime. "We saw a spike in unusual traffic to one of Cloudflare's services beginning at 11:20 UTC. That caused some traffic passing through Cloudflare's network to experience errors. OpenAI has issued an update on its status page that the incident is "caused by an issue with one of our third-party service providers". No prizes for guessing which provider that might be. The ongoing Cloudflare outage isn't only affecting services, but also websites like The Register, Notebookcheck, and Videocardz, which all display an Error 500 message when attempting to access them. Stay tuned to Tom's Hardware for more updates. Another update, but nothing to get excited about, yet! Update - We are continuing working on restoring service for application services customers.Nov 18, 2025 - 13:35 UTC We don't know because the status page is also down. Stewart is not having a good day, he uses it to check our deals. Lets take another look at Downdectors graph of reported Cloudflare issues. As we know, the sys admins at Cloudflare are working on the issue, so it is now just a matter of time, and a constant of supply of coffee until the teams have things up and running again. The old adage of "Don't put your eggs all in one basket" is once again being proven by another Internet outage. Could this indicate that things will soon be working again? Error levels for Access and WARP users have returned to pre-incident rates. We have re-enabled WARP access in London.We are continuing to work towards restoring other services.Nov 18, 2025 - 13:13 UTC Canva, the online design suite is also impacted by Cloudflare. "During our attempts to remediate, we have disabled WARP access in London. Sadly not, Cloudflare's WARP is seemingly a tool to secure internet connections by encrypting all traffic from a user's device. It is mainly used as a privacy tool for consumers and corporate customers. Just a couple of months ago, Cloudflare blocked a record-setting 11.5Tbps DDoS attack two months after the previous record-setting DDoS attack It seems that this could be another attempt to launch a DDOS on Cloudflare. Update - We are continuing to investigate this issue.Nov 18, 2025 - 12:53 UTC Because they are still investigating the issue, and because the incident management team will have to provide timely updates for their service level agreement. Even 3D printer enthusiasts are feeling the sting of Cloudflare's outage. I visited Printables and Thangs to search for some fish bone models to print (long story) and both have the dreaded HTTP 500 error code. My browser and the X servers are both working, but Cloudflare's infrastructure is not. An error code 500 confirms that it is a Cloudflare server issue. Services have started to recover, but there will be higher than normal error rates while the sys admins work on fixing the issue. Downdetector, the outage monitoring site saw 11,201 reports of issues at 11:37AM GMT today. X (formerly Twitter) has been experiencing intermittent issues as a result of the outage. Cloudflare says "We are working to understand the full impact and mitigate this problem. Cloudflare was previously undergoing scheduled maintenance at 10am UTC, according to the company's website. However, the latest update into Cloudflare's System Status states: Cloudflare is aware of, and investigating an issue which impacts multiple customers: Widespread 500 errors, Cloudflare Dashboard and API also failing. In the last few minutes Cloudflare has confirmed it is aware of a major issue affecting its Global Network, which is causing widespread internet outages ranging from platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to ChatGPT, and, ironically, Downdetector.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Nicholas Rudder built his last startup, an educational marketplace called ScholarSite, he kept running into the same problem: tax. “Marketplaces are liable for tax on their entire GMV (gross merchandise value) not just their take rate, so every new country meant a maze of registrations, filings, deadlines, and risk,” Rudder told TechCrunch. As he and co-founder Adrian Sarstedt were looking to shut down ScholarSite (later calling it Sphere), Rudder decided to keep the name but turn the product into something new. “The world was going global, but compliance infrastructure hadn't kept up,” Rudder said. The company targets Series B to IPO stage companies with a global customer base, Rudder said. “We help companies collect tax on customer transactions,” he continued, explaining that companies have to collect tax on purchases and remit it to authorities each month or quarter. Sphere helps “automate registration, calculation, filing, and remittance obligations for companies,” he said. Sphere spent two years in stealth before officially launching, and clients now include the vibe coding platforms Lovable and Replit, as well as the AI voice company ElevenLabs. Rudder says the product takes less than 24 hours to set up. It has integrations into major billing platforms, like Stripe and Campfire, allowing Sphere to pull a company's transaction data and assess global tax exposure, he said. Calculating the taxability of a transaction is where Sphere's AI tax review and assessment model engine comes in, he said — or, in other words, TRAM. Sphere's human team reviews and approves the outputs of TRAM, and approves them so that it can be pushed into a tax engine that applies tax to transactions in real time. “Once they submit a registration, we send that information to the tax authorities and let the company know when their registration is processed and when they can start collecting tax in that region,” Rudder said. “Sphere is one of only three tax vendors globally with a native integration to Stripe's Billing and Checkout products,” he said, adding that the company also has use cases that Stripe doesn't have, such as being able to fulfil the end-to-end compliance lifecycle. “When we met a16z and heard what they'd done for similar companies in the compliance and fintech space, we knew they were the right partner,” Rudder said. Marc Andrusko, a partner at a16z, said the VC firm first met Rudder back when he was working on ScholarSite. “While we didn't get all the way to a term sheet for that business, it was clear Nick had the horsepower, grit, and drive needed to be an exceptional founder,” Andrusko told TechCrunch. “It took all of five minutes to put together that it was Nick's new business post-pivot, and we immediately reached out to get the update.” The fresh capital will be used to build out more infrastructure to connect with more local tax authorities; expand its AI and engineering team, and build out an international sales team.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Smith said there's a huge amount of expertise around smart AI adoption at the UW, “and what I really want to do is connect all of that, bring it together, map out what people already know and are doing, cast the light on it so we can all learn from each other more effectively and accelerate it.” Professors are eager — perhaps even desperate — for support navigating AI's role in education. “If you ask faculty what's the one question on their minds right now, it's: ‘My students are using AI. The UW's response is setting a path where AI assists students by answering questions or prepping study tools, but doesn't do the work for them. Smith is advocating for conversations and transparency in helping students find the balance where AI complements their academic journey, but doesn't replace their education. A key component of AI@UW is its grant program — SEED-AI, which stands for Supporting Educational Excellence and Discovery. The grants will provide funding to faculty across the university who have innovative, exploratory approaches for using AI in their courses that could be widely adopted. UW President Robert Jones said the initiative and new vice provost role will help the university maintain its “strategic advantage” as a leader in AI. “The Simonyi gift,” he said, “is going to set us ahead.” University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines. Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Satya Nadella recently foreshadowed a major shift in the company's business — saying the tech giant will increasingly build its products and infrastructure not just for human users, but for autonomous AI agents that operate as a new class of digital workers. At its Ignite conference this week, the company is starting to show what that means. Microsoft is unveiling a series of new products that give IT departments a way to manage and secure their new AI workforce, in much the same way as HR oversees human employees. The big announcement: Microsoft Agent 365, a new “control plane” that functions as a central management dashboard inside the Microsoft 365 Admin Center that IT teams already use. Its core function is to govern a company's entire AI workforce — including agents from Microsoft and other companies — by giving every agent a unique identification. This lets companies use their existing security systems to track what agents are doing, control what data they can access, and prevent them from being hacked or leaking sensitive information. The AI agent market is expanding rapidly, with Microsoft citing analyst estimates of 1.3 billion agents by 2028. Google, Amazon, and Salesforce have all rolled out their own agentic platforms for corporate use — Google with its Gemini Enterprise platform, Amazon with new Bedrock AgentCore tools for managing AI agents, and Salesforce with Agentforce 360 for customer-facing agents. Microsoft is making a series of announcements related to agents at Ignite, its conference for partners, developers, and customers, taking place this week in San Francisco. As a backbone for the announcements, Agent 365 leverages Microsoft's entrenched position in corporate identity and security systems. Instead of asking companies to adopt an entirely new platform, it's building AI agents into tools that many businesses already use. For example, in the Microsoft system, each agent gets its own identity inside Microsoft Entra, formerly Active Directory, the same system that handles employee logins and permissions.

Yet, for now the investigation is focused on finding out whether there was an intentional or unlawful transfer of TSMC's trade secrets to a foreign entity. However, instead of enjoying life, he unexpectedly surfaced at Intel in late October. Furthermore, he allegedly took a large collection of confidential materials related to TSMC's leading-edge process technologies with him, reports Liberty Times. Wei-Jen Lo reportedly rejoined Intel as 'vice president of R&D' in late October, about three months after departing TSMC, according to a TrendForce report. But before leaving TSMC, Lo allegedly used his authority as the senior vice president of corporate strategy development to instruct subordinates to provide him copies of restricted technical documents covering TSMC's N2, A16, A14, and post-A14 process technologies and their derivatives, according to Liberty Times. Since Lo was a high-ranking executive, such requests appeared routine, so no internal security flags were raised at the time, Liberty Times asserts. If the report from Liberty Times is to be believed, then Wei-Jen Lo is responsible for 'advanced equipment and module development from R&D up to pre-mass-production' at Intel, which does not look like a description of a 'VP of R&D' position. However, if the information is correct, it essentially means he is overseeing new production equipment and process modules before they are handed over to full-scale production. However, as equipment tuning and the right tool settings are incredibly important for semiconductor performance and yields, Intel might establish a position overseeing new fab tools before they are used for mass production. Intel's 18A process technology is already in mass production, and only Intel engineers can tune it to get lower defect density, improve CD uniformity, etc. Furthermore, 18A is different from both N2 and A16 across so many aspects (e.g., 18A uses pattern shaping, N2 does not, A16 uses Super Power Rail backside power delivery that connects power directly to each transistor's source and drain, 18A's PowerVia delivers power to transistor contacts) that TSMC's experience is hardly significantly valuable for Intel's engineers, but is valuable for the company's competitive analysis team. As for information about more sophisticated nodes, Intel's 14A and TSMC's A14 will again be very different, as the former plans to use High-NA EUV lithography tools for critical layers, whereas the latter will rely on Low-NA EUV litho tools and multipatterning. Meanwhile, as one of the leaders of advanced technology development at TSMC in recent years, he could bring valuable cultural input to Intel's process development, process integration, and manufacturing organization Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. TSMC held a farewell event honoring his 21 years of service, and after leaving, he received the ITRI Fellow distinction, presented in person by Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim. Since TSMC believed he was retiring, it appears he was not asked to sign a non-compete agreement, a customary requirement for departing executives that expressly forbids employment at competing firms for 18 months, with half-salary compensation. However, now TSMC is reportedly investigating whether Lo indeed took trade secrets with him. Most recently, Wei-Jen Lo served as senior vice president, overseeing technology development within the R&D organization at TSMC. He joined the company in 2004, initially taking charge of Operations II as a vice president. From 2006 through 2009, he led the R&D division, after which he transitioned into a role managing the firm's Advanced Technology Business along with manufacturing-technology operations. Lo held senior technical and production roles at Intel, including oversight of the company's development site in Santa Clara between 1997 and 2000, according to The Org.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A wide range of websites (including our very own gizmodo.com) were down on Tuesday morning due to an outage involving internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare. According to DownDetector, other websites affected by the outage were X, Spotify, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Trump's social media website Truth Social, gay dating app Grindr, online design platform Canva, and the movie rating app Letterboxd. Even DownDetector's own website was briefly impacted by the outage. Some services may be intermittently impacted,” Cloudflare said in a status update shortly before 7 am ET. At 8:09 ET, the company shared that the issue had “been identified and a fix is being implemented,” but recovery was somewhat patchy. Dashboard services were restored at 9:34 ET, according to Cloudflare. Cloudflare told Gizmodo that prior to the first status update being issued, they saw “a spike in unusual traffic” to one of their services. After that, we will turn our attention to investigating the cause of the unusual spike in traffic,” Cloudflare said in a statement. Cloudflare provides the infrastructure and security for many websites worldwide. One of the company's main areas of service is protecting websites against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which occur when multiple bad actors flood a website or network with traffic requests to overload it and degrade performance or cut off access. Tuesday morning's outage comes less than a month after an Amazon Web Services outage that took sites like WhatsApp, Venmo, Coinbase, and more offline for more than two hours. The outage caused minor chaos at airports and hit online banking. Just a week after the AWS incident, the internet had to contend with yet another outage, this time coming from Microsoft Azure. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince calls it the "Black Mirror possibility." Cloudflare, a company that runs 20% of the web, just flipped a switch that could end the open internet as we know it, forcing AI companies to pay for the content they've been taking for free. It is part of an effort by the company to improve its customer service. The sites look very official, but they just steal your money and don't deliver any toys.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sufferer of chronic back pain,  she first started working in physiotherapy, thinking it was helping make a difference in the lives of others. Yet the traditional physiotherapy model never quite lit a spark in her. Meanwhile, in her spare time, she became a content creator, sharing her perspective online about “proactive” and “holistic” ways people can get rid of pain. She now has more than 130,000 followers on Instagram, a company called Athletic Rebuild, which provides rehab and performance coaching for athletes, and now, a platform called Rebuildr, a HIPAA-compliant and mentorship app to help rehab professionals run their own businesses online, set to launch early next year. “I wasn't trying to build a business; I was just putting my brain on the internet and helping people rethink what care could look like.” Cannon and her works caught the eye of Slow Ventures, which announced on Tuesday that it invested $1.1 million as a seed round. She is one of the first creators to receive a check from Slow Ventures' $60 million Creator Fund, which seeks to back content creators and influencers making an impact online. She credits what most content creators do for her success — remaining authentic and sharing unfiltered but genuine thoughts. Expanding a brand on social media is not without challenges, however. “I couldn't keep scaling something that depended solely on me. I had to build something that could grow without me,” she said, adding that she ended up hiring people to help her with her projects. She also grew her strategy when she moved from just talking about what's broken in the world of rehab and started working on solutions to help fix it. I wasn't even preparing a deck.”  Still, she connected with Megan Lightcap, an investor at Slow, and told her about what she was building with Rebuildr. Others personal trainer software out there include TrainHeroic, Trainerize, and Everfit. Rudder hopes that her product, Rebuildr, fundamentally reshapes the rehab industry. “I want to make high-quality rehab accessible anywhere in the world, not limited by geography, insurance, or 30-minute appointments,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WhatsApp's mass adoption stems in part from how easy it is to find a new contact on the messaging platform: Add someone's phone number, and WhatsApp instantly shows whether they're on the service, and often their profile picture and name, too. Repeat that same trick a few billion times with every possible phone number, it turns out, and the same feature can also serve as a convenient way to obtain the cell number of virtually every WhatsApp user on earth—along with, in many cases, profile photos and text that identifies each of those users. One group of Austrian researchers have now shown that they were able to use that simple method of checking every possible number in WhatsApp's contact discovery to extract 3.5 billion users' phone numbers from the messaging service. For about 57 percent of those users, they also found that they could access their profile photos, and for another 29 percent, the text on their profiles. Despite a previous warning about WhatsApp's exposure of this data from a different researcher in 2017, they say, the service's parent company, Meta, still failed to limit the speed or number of contact discovery requests the researchers could make by interacting with WhatsApp's browser-based app, allowing them to check roughly a hundred million numbers an hour. In a statement to WIRED, Meta thanked the researchers, who reported their discovery through Meta's “bug bounty” system, and described the exposed data as “basic publicly available information,” since profile photos and text weren't exposed for users who opted to make it private. “We had already been working on industry-leading anti-scraping systems, and this study was instrumental in stress-testing and confirming the immediate efficacy of these new defenses,” writes Nitin Gupta, vice president of engineering at WhatsApp. Gupta adds, “We have found no evidence of malicious actors abusing this vector. As a reminder, user messages remained private and secure thanks to WhatsApp's default end-to-end encryption, and no non-public data was accessible to the researchers.” Nor is their work the first time that WhatsApp has been warned about its exposure of phone numbers and associated profile data. Fully eight years ago, in 2017, Dutch researcher Loran Kloeze wrote a blog post pointing out that the phone number enumeration technique was possible and that it could be used to obtain phone numbers, profile photos, and also the times when a user was online. Kloeze described a scenario in which the data exposure could be combined with face recognition to create a giant database of personally identifiable information. Meta, then Facebook, responded to his findings, arguing that WhatsApp's privacy settings were still working as designed—users can choose to make their profile information accessible only to their chosen contacts—and even told him he wasn't eligible for a bug bounty reward for his work at the time. When WIRED asked Meta what rate-limiting measures it instituted over the last eight years to prevent the technique Kloeze demonstrated, the company responded that it has, in fact, implemented evolving defenses against scrapers, including rate-limiting and machine-learning techniques to ban scrapers. Yet the University of Vienna researchers were able to not only replicate Kloeze's work, but take it further, actually enumerating all 3.5 billion registered WhatsApp phone numbers—far more than the service had in 2017. They also addressed WhatsApp's argument about privacy settings by measuring how many users publicly exposed personal information in their profiles, breaking down the results by country. They found that 44 percent of the 137 million phone numbers they collected for Americans displayed photos, and 33 percent showed public “about” text, for instance. For countries where WhatsApp is even more widely used, a smaller fraction of the population turned on its privacy settings: In India, where the researchers counted nearly 750 million numbers, 62 percent of accounts publicly displayed a profile photo. For the 206 million Brazilian numbers they found, 61 percent had profile photos exposed. One interested audience for the exposed phone number data, the researchers point out, would be scammers and spammers who are seeking a database of potential targets. Muslims in China, according to some reports, have been detained merely for having WhatsApp installed on their phones. They found that a surprising number of accounts used duplicate keys—a security issue given that anyone who has the same key as another user would also be able to decrypt messages sent to them. On closer examination of some of the accounts with repeated cryptographic keys, they also noted that they looked like scammer accounts, suggesting that some scam operations that exploit WhatsApp may use a client with broken encryption features. Aside from the lack of rate limiting, the researchers argue that their findings point to a more fundamental issue with services like WhatsApp: Phone numbers, they say, don't actually have enough randomness to be used as a unique identifier for a service with billions of users. That leaves rate-limiting as the only available measure to prevent user data from being scraped en masse, and one that will never be fully secure against privacy leaks if WhatsApp prioritizes convenient contact discovery for users.

It's a brute-force method to bring down services that can be particularly effective if safeguards aren't in place. Just this year we've seen record-breaking attacks that delivered 7.3 Tbps of traffic in June, followed by a larger 11.5 Tbps attack in September. Those have now been dwarfed by the scale of this latest attack, which reached 15.72 Tbps at its peak. NetworkWorld quotes security analyst, Sunil Varkey, who highlights that DDoS attacks are becoming far more akin to hit-and-run incidents. Attacks are conducted with incredible intensity over short periods of time. This can make it hard for defences to react in time, though in this case it appears Microsoft's Azure was able to keep the lights on while mitigating the effects. As fiber offers far greater upload speeds and growing numbers of IoT devices increase attack vector options for hackers, the ability for them to infect and utilize more devices has exploded. Security cameras, appliances, Wi-Fi range extenders, video doorbells, smart thermostats, and a range of other smart home devices can all be used to send traffic to endpoints as part of botnet attacks. It's often hard to spot if they've been infected, too. As long as they continue to function normally, device owners may not be aware that their device(s) have been compromised and potentially used in future attacks. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. “This isn't just a technical issue,” Varkey said. It is a large army of compromised and easily compromisable devices waiting for the command to initiate. He called on enterprises to employ layered defences of their networks and endpoints, using traffic-rate limiters, DDOS scrubbers, and robust network stress testing through DDOS simulation to dry-run attacks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft states that agents read files in an isolated runtime When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Today, we have our first look at what that eventuality could look like, with AI agents working by your side in the background in Windows 11 Insider Build 26220.7262, as detailed by the Windows Insider Blog. Think of it like Windows Sandbox; still isolated from the rest of the system, but Microsoft says it's supposed to be more efficient than virtualization. Unfortunately, Agent Workspaces are not functional right now beyond a simple toggle. The idea behind this concept stems from agents in ChatGPT or Copilot Actions. They're little digital assistants carrying out mundane tasks on your behalf, such as scrolling through documents, pointing and clicking at various things, and maybe even booking a flight for you. Previously, features like these operated in the cloud in a virtualized window, but now Microsoft wants them to run locally on your computer. Each time an AI workspace is created, a different AI agent is in charge of that, with its own customized access to "known folders" like Downloads and Desktop. Because the Agent Workspace is its own separate entity, everything is logged with a clearly traceable path of everything the agent saw or performed. "Known folders" are six of the most common, standard directories inside Windows that can be automatically backed up and synced to a cloud service like Microsoft's OneDrive. AI agents are turned off by default, so creating Agent Workspaces is a deliberate choice that even Microsoft acknowledges has some tradeoffs, advising users to only opt in if they're comfortable with letting agents poke around within the PC's data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intuit has signed a multi-year contract worth more than $100 million with OpenAI, enabling its tax and financial apps to operate within ChatGPT and expanding the company's use of OpenAI's models across its products. Intuit said its tools, such as TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks and Mailchimp, will be accessible through ChatGPT, allowing users to ask questions and complete tasks such as estimating tax refunds, reviewing credit options, or managing business finances. With users' permission, Intuit's apps will be able to access their financial data to generate responses and complete tasks, like sending marketing messages or issuing invoice reminders. OpenAI in October introduced a way to let developers build apps accessible through ChatGPT. But Intuit's integration differs from existing ChatGPT apps, as it will be used for tasks that can directly influence financial decisions. Such uses have raised concerns about the reliability of AI systems, which can produce incorrect or misleading outputs. Intuit employs multiple validation methods and utilizes large domain-specific datasets to minimize the risk of errors or “hallucinated” responses, Bruce Chan, a spokesperson for Intuit, told TechCrunch. In 2023, the company introduced Intuit Assist, an AI assistant that works across its products. Intuit said the partnership will give it access to new audiences through ChatGPT, adding another distribution channel for its small-business and consumer finance tools.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you read any of WIRED's recent AI edition, you know that lots of people are spending lots of time talking about how the technology is revolutionizing pretty much everything—from coding to writing to accounting. You've also probably heard by now, from us or somebody else, that we might very well be in an economic bubble of AI origin, one wherein the billions and billions of dollars being funneled into the industry is creating an untenable economic scenario that could turn catastrophic. I'm still not sick, though, of asking other people about it—especially when they're much smarter about this stuff than I am. Enter Joe Weisenthal, the cohost of Bloomberg's fantastic Odd Lots podcast, and a former coworker of mine. Trust me: As someone who spent a year listening to Joe lose his mind in the office—loudly!—anytime the economy hiccuped, few people think more about our country's, and our planet's, financial circumstances than Joe does. And right now, Joe's concerns aren't strictly about what happens if or when that AI bubble bursts. His worries are more focused on what's going right and wrong with the US economy writ large. For this week's episode of The Big Interview, Joe and I talked about weird market indicators, US competition with China, and whether or not we should all prepare for an AI economic apocalypse. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Joe Weisenthal, welcome to The Big Interview. We were just talking about how [you] and I worked together—what was that, like nine years ago? I think you were there 2014, 2015, so maybe 10 years ago or something? So we always start these conversations with some very fast questions. What is the latest you've slept in this year? This year, on a weekday, probably no later than seven, but that's because of kids. You know, I'm getting a little bit soft in my old age. There used to be times when I was waking up at 4:00 am every single day. I still get up early a lot, but I let myself slide a little bit now. What's the weirdest market indicator you actually take seriously? We did a really good episode of our podcast about a month or two ago about cardboard boxes, which are very important. I don't know how weird they are. I guess it's kind of intuitive because of ecommerce, but you can really dive deeply into cardboard box volume sales, the types of cardboard boxes that are hot right now. Like are they ones that go for individual packages? Are they more of the larger grocery-oriented ones? Cardboard boxes are top of my mind these days. But I think they've clamped down on that and it's not as useful as an indicator these days. If you could ban one financial cliche from headlines forever, what would it be? I could go on and on, but I would say “the stock market is not the economy” is one that I've hated for a long time, and I would say a very timely one. What is a chart you would get tattooed? You know why it's a fun chart? It's just one of my favorite charts, because it's one of the—if you see this chart and you never knew what it was, you could probably figure out what it was because there is a little spike every 10 years, and that's additional hiring for the census collection. So I've always just enjoyed this chart because if you really think about “OK, what is this indicator that always spikes right at the turn of every decade?” There's one thing that happens in the economy every 10 years—1990, 2000, 2010—and that's the census. You might be able to figure it out. I do think the story of the last several years is: How many people's brains have been broken because things that are perceived to make sense or relationships that they had assumed to be stable, et cetera, have not held? You just see people—there are other factors, but people who are in this space, going crazier and crazier year after year because they have such a difficult time reconciling what they see on their screen. You are seeing these people go crazy? I don't know if it's outward signs of, you know, literal insanity, but I think in markets you see this sort of intense frustration. For almost my entire career—at least the last 10 years—people have said, “Oh, tech stocks can't go any higher.” Or, “When are we gonna rotate out of tech stocks?” Everyone is all-in on this already, and yet these trends just persist month after month. Most people pride themselves in some way on not being part of the herd. Or taking some sort of contrarian viewpoint, or finding something that everyone else doesn't know about. You could have made a lot of money over the last couple years just buying Nvidia. I think this phenomenon really breaks a lot of people's brains because the industry, to some extent, is supposed to encourage people to seek out information that others don't have. You get to have dinner with one economist living or dead, who is it? Very interesting character, hung out with all sorts of artists and dancers and I love his writing. Maybe one day the AI-generated, reanimated corpse of John Maynard Keynes. Let's talk about the big picture for a second. I know firsthand that you really care about this stuff. But you've said the thing that really interests you is quote, “figuring out what's actually happening underneath the headlines.” What's going on underneath the headlines right now? I think probably what's less discussed is maybe some of the crowding out effects of this. We had this guy on our podcast who is a real estate developer for drive-through coffee shops. So like, Starbucks, when they want a new drive-through location. In recent years, really basic electrical equipment that would be required to build a new facility has been in short supply because there's all this physical capital that's been going into data centers. You hear about that all the time. But just think about that: Where were these things going to go instead? So the ISM manufacturing report, that's a monthly economic indicator. One of the things that they always ask their survey respondents is: What is in short supply right now? With the exception of maybe two months, electrical equipment has been in short supply for five straight years. I'm not trying to dismiss it as being wasteful or anything per se. But I do think that it's interesting to think of some of these second-order effects of who is not able to get natural gas turbine equipment, who is not able to get electrical gear equipment because some big data center operator is just willing to pay top dollar for it in order to get these things online. I think that's one of the most interesting stories right now. In a market economy, the way allocation of capital goods works, of course, is price signals. And the builder of the data center is gonna pay more for that same piece of gear than someone who is building a drive-through coffee shop. If you're thinking about how it would be done in China, they would just say, “OK, look, right now we are prioritizing data centers for drive-through coffee shops. That is where we want to direct our resources.” We do it through the price system, which works well, but if some of these investments don't pan out, it's interesting to think what type of economic activity was constrained because it didn't have access to capital goods during this incredible boom. Other types of goods relevant to these build-outs are also in short supply. Why has supply not increased to meet the obvious increase in demand that exists? I think there's a couple of things. I think at the margins there has been more supply. But in times of uncertainty, building a big factory or building a new facility is very risky, right? You don't really know how long any boom is going to last. So if there are, say, three companies that are the makers of some widget that's very crucial in the economy and it's costly, why not keep supply where it is and just raise your … Then you have an order book that's consistent out to the year 2030, in some cases at top dollar. It's very difficult to get out of that equilibrium because that's very nice if you're one of the sellers in this environment. The alternative is to build another factory, make a big bet on upfront capital outlays. So that's money going out the door, and that's uncertain, and you're expanding supply so the price is going to be softer than it otherwise would've been. I think another good example of that is housing. All these home builders went out of business because housing prices collapsed and so forth. So there was just not that much new housing activity. When you look at the surge in home prices now, especially post-pandemic, part of what we're experiencing now is the price that we paid for under-investment in the 2010s. I think you can really go across a range of industries and find this phenomenon that when the economy lies fallow and the economy is soft, investment goes down. Then when you get this boom, either across the economy like we got in 2021 or 2022, or in specific sectors like we've seen in 2024 and 2025 with data centers, you run into a supply crunch pretty quickly. That brings me to tariffs, which have been, I think for me and probably for many people, one of the most insane, confusing, befuddling phenomena of this year, of the Trump administration. Can you explain to us what is going on with the global supply chain with regards to tariffs right now? The tariffs are not high enough to induce a massive amount of domestic investment in some area. The tariffs aren't high enough that it makes a lot of sense to build big furniture factories in the United States, but the tariffs may be high enough that someone who had been importing them from China or Vietnam, maybe they're looking for a supplier in India. By and large, there aren't massive shortages of things in the US economy right now the way people might have thought there would have been in early April. Part of it is that those early tariff levels, they all came [down]. Maybe we would've had more persistent actual shortages had those initial tariff rates stayed in place, but they didn't. I think the administration saw they were unsustainable. So then there's this switching where, OK, we're gonna maybe switch some vendor sources. We're gonna move to a lower-cost country. So anyone who's in the business of importing, maybe they can keep prices roughly stable. But there is this costly process of: OK, now we have to spend money finding a new supplier, building a new relationship with them, changing our trade routes, figuring out all these things, figuring out how they operate. But then this new supplier, they don't know the customer as well. They may be reluctant to make long-term commitments with the customer because they don't know what the tariff rate is gonna be. This is a worry for suppliers, that they're gonna make this furniture, these gardening goods, these holiday goods, and then the tariff rate is gonna go up and then the customer walks away from them. So the way I think about tariffs overall, outside of some niche areas, is not that they've raised the cost of specific goods dramatically, though in some cases they definitely have, it's more that they've really raised the cost of doing business in the United States. If I wanna understand what is going on with the economy right now, I'd say there's basically two things: There's this slice of the economy that's doing phenomenally well, which is anything to do with big tech and AI; then there's this economy that's sort of creaking and, I don't know, like the rest of the economy, is it in recession? I would say that hiring is certainly pretty mediocre right now. We're recording this on a day that we would've gotten a jobs report had the government been open. But we're pretty sure that hiring is certainly not booming. I wouldn't say they're the entire story, but they've raised the cost of doing business for the entire economy, even if not directly in goods, just in the effort that companies have to do to reorient their supply chains. I have a lot of questions for you about AI, especially in terms of the chatter about a bubble. There are varying degrees of hysteria around this notion. How is artificial intelligence affecting the global economy right now? Are there some examples that you can give to bring this down to earth a little bit? I would start by saying I'm very skeptical that AI as a tool is having a significant impact on the global economy, including hiring. Now, I will caveat that a little bit. One way that you could sort of demonstrate that you're using AI and getting value is to just cut head count. And then you go back and say, “Oh, because we adopted some AI workflow, we were able to reduce hiring by 10 percent.” That doesn't mean that the AI tool actually allowed you to do the same amount of work with only 90 percent. I just don't see the technology being equipped to eliminate 10,000 white collar jobs right now. So anytime I ask about actual implementation I say, “Don't give me the stuff about how your coders are using it, because I know that's well-established.” The other connection is, OK, there is this mandate or there's this impulse to spend more on AI. So you're thinking about your budgetary allocations for the year 2026. We did an episode today and our guest was talking about this, that perhaps it's a matter of, OK, we know we're gonna spend more on AI tools and services in 2026, so that means we're gonna allocate less to hiring in 2026. I don't think there's a lot of evidence for it. That means seed rounds will be more valued. You know, Keynes talked about that, speaking of my ideal dinner guest. So this has been understood for a very long time, that financial markets have this accelerant, that they're a force of production, so to speak, within the economy in a very real way. I do think that the big rise that we've seen in asset prices, in stocks in particular, it's been related to technology and AI is a big part of the economic story. When you look at Nvidia stock, for example, which is just through the roof, when you look at how AI is a significant factor in the stock market right now, and then combine that with the fact that you are having a hard time finding tangible examples of corporate productivity being enhanced by this technology, what does that mean? What happens when those things are both happening simultaneously? Intuitively, it's really hard to imagine that these big AI companies, whether we're talking about Nvidia or Google, that the AI premium that they're receiving, the AI activity that they're receiving, can persist forever if there aren't more clear-cut examples of companies saying, “This is a valuable thing that I want to keep paying more and more for.” One possibility is that the productivity-enhancing use cases will be found, which is certainly possible. Well, Joe, do you use AI to enhance your productivity? I certainly use it for interview prep. I don't know, it's a really good question. I think many people would say that they actually use ChatGPT, or [an AI tool] almost every day for something. But whether I can actually point to something and say “now I'm more productive” is really tough. Like, “this is my killer use case,” you know what I mean? I've been thinking about this question, which is that the internet has obviously changed our lives. We didn't have some mega productivity boom in the ‘90s. Intuitively, the world changed because we all have an iPhone, but has there been some measurable productivity boom that we can find in the aggregate in economic statistics associated with the iPhone? Part of the puzzle of figuring out where the productivity measures are going to show up with AI may mean we just put aside the AI conversation for a while and go back to the 20 years of technological gains, which have completely changed society. But then the other possibility, of course, is that companies pull back and they don't spend as much and then you get a stock market crash. I've been wondering in the last few months as we've seen more discussion around this idea of an AI bubble: How does that affect psychology? People start reading about this, it becomes part of the narrative, and then you do see a crash, right? That's maybe less related to a lack of efficiency gains and more related to people flipping out a little bit. I think there's a famous George Soros quote, which is something like when he sees a bubble, he runs towards it. Some people it's like, No, I wanna ride this bubble and I wanna make a lot of money. Yeah, I've always thought that bubbles, when I read about historical ones, are stressful because if you're not in it, you're jealous that your neighbor or your friend is making a ton of money. If you are in it, you're probably kicking yourself for not having invested more in it, right? Then if you actually have a decent allocation such that the increase in the monetary value has changed your life, then you're really stressed out about timing the sale correctly. Bubbles are something that you run toward. In March 2020, when the stock market plunged due to Covid, it worked out really well. So it's possible that the psychology of anytime there's red on the screen, it's a good time to buy could last a lot longer than people think. I just cover them in an adjacent way. But I would like to live in a country that is in a financially healthy place. So the AI bubble, let's say it bursts. You're not a tarot card reader, but what does that potentially look like for the United States? I think the scary thing for the United States is like, what else is working right now? So we know that the auto sector, which probably hasn't really been a particular load-bearing sector for the overall US economy for a while, is obviously having a very difficult time with global competition to say the least. The pharmaceutical industry for the United States—here's another area where internationally, again, particularly in China, there is much more competition than there has been in the past. So I think the scary thing is for the United States is it doesn't feel like our growth drivers are particularly diversified right now. There is one sector that's doing phenomenally well, and look, it's not even just AI. And then I think, you know, there are serious structural issues facing the economy. We didn't get a jobs report today, but one thing that we've seen is that almost every month for years and years now, the number of people who work in healthcare goes up. So there's this very intense strain that's being placed on the labor force overall simply because of shifting demographics. Obviously as a society it's important that the elderly are cared for and so forth, but these are low productivity areas, they're low productivity jobs. When we think about real wealth as an economy, placing that greater strain on younger workers who theoretically could be used in some more productive areas, there's some deep, deep stresses being placed on the US economy. So you look at an economy that's under a lot of strain, but there isn't a lot of slack. When you look at it that way, there's not a lot to be particularly excited about. Well, that was actually my next question: What should I, or a WIRED reader, look to for optimism, economic optimism, in this moment? I don't really think that's true, and I think one of the things that I've been struck by is just—and maybe this sounds a little bit corny—but America is just such an insanely wealthy country. I mean, the sheer material wealth of this country is … Also the natural resources that we're endowed with. These great lands of ours are really extraordinary. But I also think if there's one country in the world that probably could completely be self-dependent in some respects, it would be the United States. I do think we would be poorer for it, but I think if there's one country in the world that could probably live off of everything that's within its borders, it's probably the United States. Let me try to bring together the supply chain and tariff conversation with the AI one. How are global supply chains changing with the use of AI? Where do those two things come together? I think that where they really come together is in a lot of the energy demand. We did an episode recently with the famed energy historian and economist, Daniel Yergin. He wrote this book, The Prize, about the history of oil, and he was talking about if you go to any maker of natural gas turbines right now, they're sold out for years and years. I think this affects everyone outside of AI all around the world. Part of it was the war in Ukraine. Obviously, the US became this huge exporter of liquid natural gas, but there were these huge auctions that were going on among all the world's countries to get their hands on any gas. So when you think about where AI really intersects with international trade, it's the energy dimension that immediately comes to mind, because the needs are so intense because everyone wants it. Part of the thing with AI, obviously, is it's wrapped up in this national competition. There's this feeling that every country in the world needs their own, if not their own model, per se, at least their own data centers and so forth. So there's this very intense idea that national sovereignty could be on the line for some countries if they're not somewhere playing in the AI space. Therefore, they have to be playing in the energy space, and therefore they have to take their energy needs really seriously. And that brings me to asking you about China. China is the big boogeyman in a lot of conversations, but with AI in particular there's talk about this arms race around AI. There's debate about export controls on chips. There's this talk of AI brain drain here in the US because of the Trump administration's stance on immigration and visas. Everyone is keeping a very close eye on China and what they're doing in the AI space. I think there are some pretty real reasons for US companies to be concerned about international competition. I guess there is an element of hysteria. But also, when you think about the basics of, again, sovereignty and national defense and so forth, it's hard to imagine a country truly being sovereign without manufacturing capacity. Even if you don't have manufacturing capacity for everyday industrial goods or consumer goods, there is a good chance that eventually you lose the manufacturing capacity for weapons and arms because historically these things have been integrated, and being able to build anything means you're able to build more things, if that makes sense. One of the things that worries me a lot is: Why have we gotten worse at building airplanes in this country? When you think about the struggles that Boeing has had, in particular, there is emerging competition. So China has a civil aviation jet maker called Comac. The reason that Boeing is struggling is because somehow over 20 years they got worse at building planes. Broadly, we're losing the muscle to build things in this country. Therefore, that eventually creeps up the chain to a company like Boeing, which has all kinds of niche specialty suppliers in all kinds of areas. If you don't have that whole ecosystem surrounding it, then eventually Boeing itself becomes worse at doing its job. Now, I don't know specifically what the Boeing story is, and other people will say something different. Other people will say, oh, it's about, you know, they brought in the bean counters who just care about Wall Street … I want that story to be true because it's so satisfying. If the story of Boeing struggles is that they just started caring too much about Wall Street, that's a very delicious story, right? Not that we as a country are losing muscle. Then we can blame finance for it. We can blame investors and so forth. I think maybe there's something deeper going on about the ability of an advanced manufacturer in the US to thrive. It's the same really with Intel, and we know the massive struggles that they have had. They seem to have hit the end of their line in their ability to construct factories, or fabs, for the most advanced semiconductors. They design semiconductors and they manufacture them, as opposed to, say, Nvidia, which uses TSMC to manufacture their chips and so forth. I think that's where the deeper China conversation comes in, which is, OK, did the hollowing out of these lower value areas eventually creep up and affect the higher areas? And can the US be a secure, sovereign nation without advanced manufacturing in things like airplanes and whatever else? I think it's something that people need to take seriously, the fact that industrial competition has created vulnerabilities for the US. That's a much more thoughtful and informed answer than, “Well, if they get super intelligent AI first we're all dead.” It's like, what are you talking about? Well, it's always so funny because there are so many flavors of the AI apocalypse conversation that you can have. There are obviously some people, and I'm sure you've talked to them and WIRED has covered them a lot, who think the moment there is some sort of super intelligence, we're all dead. I mean, I've talked to academics and they have been in tears talking to me about this. And I get that to some extent, but it's also very funny. It's like, Oh, and we're worried that China is gonna get there first? Here's this machine that's gonna kill us all and we have to build it first … I mean, if anyone is gonna kill everyone, let it be the United States. American exceptionalism, right up until the end. Well Joe, let me ask you one more question. We pay a lot of attention to what's happening in the United States. Maybe we're looking abroad a little bit. I think one thing that hasn't gotten enough attention is the future of Europe. Or I would say two things, maybe the future of Europe and which path is Europe going to go down? It's very literally in between the US and China, but also figuratively, because Europe has its own share of industrial powerhouses that have struggled with intense competition from Chinese competitors, most notably Germany. Intuitively, Europe should be in part of a larger trading bloc with the United States. Then the other option is Europe needs to integrate more deeply within itself, right? In order to achieve scale in production, it needs to go further on the project of deepening integration between all the European countries. The problem is, I don't really know if there's politics for that, because we live in this very nationalistic time and we see nationalist politicians rising pretty much everywhere where there's elections, right? Even probably in places where there aren't elections, there's been more of a nationalist tilt. Then, related to that, what are these other emerging markets? Which path are they going to go down? Think of Indonesia or Vietnam or Brazil, and they've seen their trade with China boom, but they also have concerns about national sovereignty and they also have domestic champions and their domestic steel companies, or their domestic nickel companies or so forth that are doing really well. The question is, are they gonna be undercut? And what do they want their relationship with China or the US to be? So some pretty big open questions right now on how they're going to orient their economies with the rest of the world. We're gonna play a very quick game. I was supposed to prepare for this … So the question is, what piece of tech would you control? What piece would you alt, or alter? Do you have a problem with sports gambling? I don't, but I really worry about it and don't want it in my face all the time. No, but it's not a problem for you. I would probably alter social media in some respects. I love Twitter, but maybe like an hour a day for everyone I think that would be good. We haven't talked about crypto at all in this podcast. I think that probably there is going to be a lot of real economic use, activity running through stable coins and perhaps tokenization of equity and so forth. I think that's pretty real and legit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This public notice issued by SSA makes that official, months after the fact. The notice is known as a system of record notice (SORN), a document that outlines how an agency will share the data it has, with whom, and for what purpose. Normally, SORNs are issued before any data is shared between agencies, giving the public and government officials sufficient time to offer comment. But WIRED found that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was pulling in data from across DHS, SSA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and state voter data, among other sources, based largely on the US Citizenship and Immigration Service's (USCIS) Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database. “There are laws that require the government to inform the public about their use of various kinds of databases and other surveillance technologies,” says Adam Schwartz, privacy litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital privacy and free speech. Leland Dudek, who served as acting commissioner for the Social Security Administration between February and May 2025, led the agency when members of DOGE first appeared. Dudek says he was initially supportive of DOGE and acted as a bridge between SSA staff and members of the DOGE team before becoming disillusioned. Dudek tells WIRED that though there had been agreements to share data with DHS before—mostly Social Security numbers—the scope of the recent SORN seems unprecedented. Normally, says Dudek, DHS is able to check certain Social Security numbers against SSA data, within a limited scope. But he says that the SSA does not have a way to deactivate a Social Security number, meaning that it can't be used to allow someone to work or collect government payments, unless that person has died. Dudek says what appears to have changed within the new SORN is that there is now “a special indicator code that identifies types of questionable data or special circumstances concerning an application for an SSN.” This, he says, appears to mean that there would now be a way to essentially flag a Social Security number and take it out of use, without marking them as deceased. The administration has canceled Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from countries in Africa and Latin America; deployed the National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement; and claims to have deported more than 500,000 undocumented immigrants. The administration has also sought to collect more data on immigrants, particularly those using government services like housing assistance or food benefits, and Republicans have renewed an effort to add a citizenship question to the US Census. “It seems that DHS was dead set on creating a national citizenship data bank, and for whatever reason, they determined that the Social Security Administration had the largest set of citizenship data across any agency in the government,” says Nikhel Sus, deputy counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). CREW is part of a group of organizations currently suing the US government, claiming that the Trump administration is unlawfully consolidating sensitive data across agencies. The government also previously held that Social Security data shouldn't be used for citizenship purposes. In a 2023 letter from the SSA to the Fair Elections Center, a nonprofit focused on voting rights, SSA lawyer Jessica Vollmer wrote that “while SSA records provide an indication of citizenship, they do not provide definitive information on U.S. citizenship,” and that “SSA does not have citizenship information for all individuals who have been issued an SSN.” That authority lies with DHS. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin tells WIRED that “USCIS remains dedicated to securing the nation's electoral process—by allowing states to efficiently verify voter eligibility, we are reinforcing the principle that America's elections are reserved exclusively for American citizens. We encourage all federal, state, and local agencies to use the SAVE program.” Davisson also says that the legal statute that the SORN cites as justification—one that dates back to when immigration was handled by the now defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)—does not actually support unrestricted data sharing with DHS. “It essentially says you cannot obstruct an otherwise lawful disclosure of citizenship- or immigration-related information. But Davisson says that doesn't mean there are no restrictions at all. Experts tell WIRED that because Social Security data was never collected with the goal of being used for citizenship or immigration purposes, it is also likely to include inaccuracies. For instance, if someone receives a Social Security number and later becomes a naturalized citizen, Social Security data would not necessarily reflect that change. “There are a lot of reliability concerns when you match disparate data sets across agencies, especially when the data was collected for different purposes,” says Sus. You could have the wrong people's records being incorrectly linked together.” This could mean that people who are legally in or are citizens of the United States could lose their ability to vote or work due to data matching errors. Dudek, like Sus, says that SSA data is not a reliable way to determine citizenship and could risk disenfranchising people. “I'm not aware of it being done, and that concerns me.” Big Story: How Gen Z toppled Nepal's leader and chose a new one on Discord Event: Join some of the most influential voices in tech and beyond WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You don't always get to know the real reason someone leaves their job—not even the guy in the video below, Abidur Chowdhury, an Apple industrial designer who played a “key role” in developing the iPhone Air, and acted as its spokesman when it was introduced, but who has, according to Bloomberg, left Apple for an AI startup. With that in mind, the Information reported a little over a week ago that the iPhone Air is such a flop that Apple has delayed rolling out the next model. (Bloomberg's story on Chowdhury notes that a second iPhone Air will still happen, but not until 2027) Gizmodo's largely positive review of the device found it too lightweight for its own good, with less-than-ideal battery life, and noted that if it “ends up going the way of the dodo like the iPhone Mini and Plus,” it might turn out to be a “testbed for miniaturizing components into a smart glasses form factor” and may include components of a foldable iPhone still to come. Bloomberg's story on Chowdhury's departure (attributed to anonymous “people familiar with the move”) is from Bloomberg's intrepid Apple scoop-getter, Mark Gurman, who has hastened to imply that he does not think the iPhone Air is some sort of corporate disaster that merits Chowdhury being forced out. “His exit is unrelated to the debut of the phone, which has seen its design praised despite underwhelming sales,” Gurman tweeted. His exit is unrelated to the debut of the phone, which has seen its design praised despite underwhelming sales. According to reports, that period would have coincided with the company's attempts to recover from the slow-motion meltdown that ensued when Ive seemingly lost his faith in Apple due to disagreements over what the Apple Watch was supposed to be, and then mostly stopped coming to work, and let his department basically atrophy.

Flagship phones provide experiences that justify their premium price points, packing in superior cameras, faster processors and features that budget phones just can't match. This Galaxy S25 Ultra represents the best offering from Samsung with a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 512GB of storage, and camera hardware that captures professional-quality photos even in challenging conditions. Amazon has quietly cut the price to $1,069 from the usual $1,419 (25% off), a new record low that rarely sees flagship devices that have just recently hit store shelves. This is an unlocked model that works on any carrier and includes a full one-year US warranty. The peak brightness hits 2600 nits which means you can read the screen relatively easily under direct sunlight, whereas many other phones become dim and washed out. Scratch and drop resistance has been improved over prior generations with the Corning Gorilla Armor glass protecting the screen while an anti-reflective coating reduces glare in bright conditions. The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is Qualcomm's most powerful mobile chip, delivering performance that handles demanding tasks without slowdown. The processor includes dedicated AI cores that accelerate machine learning tasks, improving everything from photo processing to voice recognition. The camera system includes a 200-megapixel main sensor that captures extraordinary detail in well-lit conditions and maintains quality when cropping into or zooming photos. Light entering through its larger sensor outperforms typical camera phones, capturing cleaner images with less noise in darker environments. AI Night Mode improves low-light photography by stitching together multiple exposures and intelligently brightening shadows, all while taming highlights Advanced image stabilization keeps video smooth even when you're walking or moving fast and directional microphones record clean audio and reduce wind noise. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts a full day of heavy use including streaming, gaming, photography, and constant connectivity. Adaptive battery learning adjusts power management based on your usage patterns, optimizing background processes to extend runtime. Fast charging reaches wired speeds of 45W that take the battery from empty to full in under an hour. At $1,069, you save $350 on Samsung's flagship while getting the full 512GB storage configuration that normally commands top dollar. This record low pricing brings premium smartphone tech within reach at a discount that none of its competitors can offer with similar specs and features.</p>

Dead car batteries always seem to happen at the worst time and leave you stranded in parking lots or stuck at home when you're running late. Jump starters resolve that by allowing you to restart your car without the need for another vehicle or a wait for roadside assistance: The NOCO Boost GB40 packs 1000 amps of lithium power into a compact unit small enough to fit in your glove box, and it's capable of jump-starting vehicles up to 20 times on a single charge. Amazon has dropped the price for early Black Friday to $99, down from its usual $124, which is the lowest price ever for one of the most popular jump starters available. The lithium battery technology maintains its charge far better than traditional lead-acid jump starters and holds power for months between uses. You get up to 20 jump starts from a single charge which means you can help multiple stranded drivers or restart your own vehicle repeatedly if you're dealing with a stubborn battery issue. Reverse polarity protection prevents damage in case you connect the positive and negative clamps backward-a mistake made more often than people care to admit. With the built-in power bank function, the NOCO Boost GB40 becomes an emergency charging station for your devices: The USB ports can recharge phones, tablets, portable speakers, and any other USB-powered gear when you are away from outlets. That dual function means the jump starter does double duty as backup power on camping trips, outdoor events, or during a power outage. The integrated 100-lumen LED flashlight provides seven different lighting modes, including steady beam, SOS signal, and emergency strobe. The steady mode lights up your engine bay while you make connections in the dark or helps you locate that dropped tool during roadside repairs. The strobe setting's good for making yourself visible to traffic when you're stuck on the shoulder of a highway at night. The entire package weighs just 2.5 pounds and measures small enough to tuck into a glove compartment or center console. At $99, you're paying less than a roadside assistance call for a tool that eliminates the need for those services entirely. This all-time low price makes it easy to keep one in every vehicle you own.</p>
