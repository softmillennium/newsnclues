                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Maher is putting a pause on stand-up comedy, and one of his reasons is due to the intense political division in the country. Maher told Patton Oswalt on his Club Random podcast Monday that he decided to stop touring at the end of 2024 because, “I don't want to be out there in this country, in this political atmosphere. I could get shot by the left or the right,” adding “Its a good time not to be out there.” He did acknowledge though, that there are other reasons. "Quiet, Piggy": Donald Trump Lashes Out At Female Reporter Who Asked About Jeffrey Epstein Files Appeals Court Rejects Donald Trump's Attempt To Revive Lawsuit Against CNN “Not that I didn't sell a lot of tickets and do great theaters — but I didn't sell arenas,” Maher added. “And some people did, who, frankly, are not that great. But, you know, when the audience is 35 to 45, they don't wanna see somebody 70… I just did my 13th HBO special. I feel like that's a good body of work… I felt they all, they basically got better as it went along. “Lemme first say to all of the people who treated this like it was some kind of summit meeting, you're ridiculous… like I was gonna sign a treaty or something,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The “Jumanji” star took to social media on Monday, November 17, to announce the devastating news. “Nate you are a legend in this game of comedy…. He continued, “You taught me so much about this business… ur loyalty and dedication was unmatched…. Hart went on to thank Smith for his years of friendship. “Thank you for all that u did …. One of the best to ever do it!!!!! Fans of the comedian were quick to flood the comments section with thoughts and prayers for Hart and his late friend, as many felt a connection to Smith due to his constant presence in Hart's sets. “I remember watching this, wishing him peace 🕊️” one fan commented. “I'm so sorry Kev, keep keeping his memory alive the way you do. “Prayers for you, Nate and those who love him 😇 🫂” a third follower added. The “Night School” actor often told stories of his relationship with Smith, including in his 2010 comedy special, “Seriously Funny.” “My road manager and I are very close,” Hart began to a roaring audience. He's been around me for years. He was with me before money even came into the picture. He's the one scrambling up for me. He then delivered the punchline, “I don't like the way he sneezes… I never saw nobody catch they breath from a sneeze.” “My Road Manager of 12yrs Nate Smith walked into his home and found a nice surprise in his garage. We argue like cats and dogs but ur loyalty has never been in question,” Hart captioned a video of the sweet moment. “I love your old ass man….Thank you for your help in making another tour a major success!!!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Teyana Taylor was honored at Monday night's Elle Women in Hollywood event, wearing a gold look that included little more than a skirt and a hood. Crafted in a lustrous metallic fabric, Taylor's Balmain outfit featured a gathered skirt that was accented by a belt at her thighs. A rippling layer of fabric was precariously placed on her chest to avoid any unwanted wardrobe malfunctions, showing off her sternum tattoo and navel piercing while leaving her back totally exposed. She stacked chunky gold rings on her fingers and wore artistic gold drop earrings in a warm hue similar to her dress. The dress was presented as part of Olivier Rousteing's Resort 2026 collection back in June. It was one of his final collections for the house, following the announcement that Antonin Tron would be replacing him at the helm. Holding the latest iPhone, she chatted with Elle on the red carpet about her obsession with a wallet phone case; her dress had no room for pockets. “I don't like carrying purses. One thing I'm never going to do is lose my phone. Taylor has just concluded a whirlwind press tour for her latest Hulu show, “All's Fair,” where the group certainly brought the jaw-dropping fashion, which the actress happily continued through this event last night.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a joint press conference with survivors of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, House lawmakers bashed President Donald Trump and Republican leadership ahead of the lower chamber's vote to compel the release of the so-called “Epstein files.” “I wasn't ‘Johnny come lately' to the MAGA train,” Greene said. The president — whose was once close friends with Epstein and whose name reportedly appears in the files — recently revoked his endorsement of Greene, and repeatedly bash her as a “traitor” to his movement. “I gave him my loyalty for free,” she said. A bipartisan coalition of House members, led by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), bucked House leadership and Trump's efforts to silence calls for the administration to follow through on its campaign promise for transparency regarding the cases against Epstein. The members spent months shoring up support for a discharge petition that would allow them to bring “The Epstein Files Transparency Act” to a floor vote without the approval of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La. When it became clear the petition would be coming to a vote, Trump flipped his position, encouraging House Republicans to vote yes. I want to send a clear message to you: while I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files — and I'm grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill — I can't help to be skeptical of what the agenda is.” “You have put us through so much stress: the lockdowns, the halting of these procedures that were supposed to have happened 50 days ago. Survivors and lawmakers who spoke called on the Senate to also pass the resolution, and criticized lawmakers — including Johnson — who only decided to lend their support after it became clear the vote had enough momentum to pass. “I think the speaker wants to save face,” Massie said. In a subsequent press conference, Johnson said “if and when” the legislation makes it to the Senate — Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-Mont.) Elon Musk Fires Back After Billie Eilish Calls Him a ‘Coward' for Wealth Hoarding Jon Stewart Questions Trump References in Epstein Emails: ‘Which Bubba Was He Blowing?' Selena Quintanilla's Autopsy Report Revealed 30 Years After Her Death Johnson expressed worry that releasing the files “could ruin the reputations of completely innocent people, such as those who may just have known Epstein but knew nothing of his crimes or whose names he exploited and used to try to get close to his intended victims.” The American justice system exists precisely as the mechanism to try those accused of crimes, and fear of reputational damage is no reason to continue denying Epstein's survivors the justice they deserve.

The standard time for Broadway intermissions ranges between 15 and 20 minutes, long enough to stretch your legs, maybe grab a snack, and hit the washroom. In preparation for my return to the Land of Oz, I caught up on my review of the first film. I refreshed myself on my big quibbles: That it was hard to know what any of these people really wanted (even if they did sing about that stuff a lot) and that Oz as a location felt far too flat, lifeless, and confusing. The smaller ones, too: “Odd missteps, hinky plotholes, and confounding questions,” many of them about the very nature of magic in this world. I made sure to note the things I did enjoy, particularly the performances of both Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, plus some whimsically mounted musical sequences. Related Stories ‘The Chronology of Water' Trailer: Kristen Stewart Makes Directorial Debut with Character Study of a Troubled Swimmer ‘A Poet' Trailer: Colombia's Oscar Entry Is a Hilariously Caustic Character Study in Daniel Clowes Mode Despite drawing out the combined running time of both films to nearly five hours (the musical runs two hours and 45 minutes, with a 15 minute intermission), big questions still remain (and they will persist). But Chu's choice to kick off “Wicked: For Good” with little in the way of catch-up is a refreshing one, albeit short-lived in its boldness. The film opens in impressive fashion: It's some months after Elphaba (Erivo) and Glinda (Grande) chose distinctly different paths during a heartbreaking parting in the Emerald City, and both remain firmly locked into their respective roles. Elphaba is now fully the Wicked Witch of the West — aided in part by the tireless work of her former mentor Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), who has dedicated herself to spreading horrific misinformation to all Ozians, in service to propping up a despot loser (Jeff Goldblum as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, bored) — which sees her taking on wild missions in service to her aims to unseat the Wizard and undo his many misdeeds. Top of mind for Elphaba is freeing the Animals, who have been conscripted into terrible slavery, mostly because the Wizard keenly understands that to keep people together, a common enemy (real or imagined) is the true golden ticket. As a broom-riding Elphaba sweeps over the currently-in-construction Yellow Brick Road to free the Animals, it's hard not to feel a big thrill. Here's our heroine, doing the tough work (with a big dash of magic) to make things right in Oz. As the Animals — in this case, massive bison-like folks — fight their way free, it's also hard not to be very much on their side. We're rooting for you, Elphie, and what kind of story would this be in, what sort of fairy tale, if you didn't succeed on your altruistic mission? If Elphaba has embraced her role as Oz's baddie, Glinda has taken things a step further as the land's number one goody-two-shoes. As Glinda the Good Witch, she spends her days swanning around Oz (soon enough, in her very own bubble), trying to cheer up a population that has been made to blindly fear her own best friend. Both Elphaba and Glinda have been forced into roles that, while they may generally suit them (Elphaba is a natural fighter and leader, Glinda places real value on making people feel good), only really serve to divide, scare, and hurt. As one established fan of the musical commented to me after her screening, “no plot but it somehow goes on forever.” Another sagely noted that Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox's script (itself based on Holzman's own musical book) has taken all of the musical's laugh lines and “turned them into deadly serious ones.” That's not to say that there is not serious stuff afoot here, and Chu and his writers aren't at all afraid of digging into the terrible political implications of dishonest messaging, violent politicking, raising charlatans to power, and abusing those who are somehow “different,” but it butts heads with the lighter stuff at every turn. Yes, it's hard to feel too seriously about a film that includes a song with the lyrics “There are bridges you cross/You didn't know you crossed/Until you've crossed.” At what point did this cross into gobbledygook, we wonder? The Emerald City and Munchinkland still figure prominently, and even good ol' Shiz University appears in flashback (unnecessary, along with another flashback to Glinda's charmed childhood). Brief forays to Elphaba's forest hideout are a welcome change of scenery (as the location of a much-vaunted love scene between her and Jonathan Bailey's Fiyero, the less said, the better), as is another visit to a far-off stretch of the Yellow Brick Road, but these change-ups are few and far between, and so very missed. Even scenes that involve bigger explorations of our known spaces, including a number set in the Emerald City, feel somehow off, in thrall to odd blocking that doesn't allow the audience to see the full scope of a location and weirdly obscure key focal points. The same applies to a key sequence in which Fiyero is forever altered, and which appears to have been shot from five miles down the Yellow Brick Road. Yet another shot of sweeping tulip fields does not a true trip to Oz — or “Wicked” — make. The same quibbles, but just writ larger (and, yes, longer). Still, what holds these two films together is difficult to deny: the power and talent of leads Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Much like “Wicked,” “Wicked: For Good” works its way up to a massive duet between the pair, so emotionally resonant than even the most wicked of audience members will still likely shed a tear (the song is, of course, “For Good”). Maybe, why couldn't the entire film feel that way? Universal Pictures will release “Wicked: For Good” in theaters on Friday, November 21.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The night started with two of Reba McEntire's country artists duking it out onstage — rural Minnesota's Cori Kennedy and Aaron Nichols of Bakersfield, California. During rehearsals, Kennedy told McEntire and Mega Mentor Joe Walsh of the Eagles that she'd never played with a full band backing her until making it onto “The Voice.” So she decided to take advantage of the opportunity by breaking out of her country wheelhouse to do a rock version of Lady Gaga's “You and I.” The coaches loved both artists' performances, but McEntire decided to move forward with “Aaron Cold as an Icicle Nichols,” as Snoop Dogg nicknamed him due to his vocal “control” and “grit.” McEntire called Kennedy a “powerhouse,” but said Nichols' years of performing in Nashville had paid off in his onstage presence. He even received McEntire's coveted “Mic Drop,” which means he'll be one of four artists (one from each team) that viewers will vote on to determine which singer will get to perform during the Rose Bowl Parade on New Year's Day. Nineteen-year-old Carolina Rodriguez had her first mentoring session with Snoop (and his Mega Mentor Zac Brown), since he stole her from coach Niall Horan during the Battles. Maryland's Mindy Miller, 35, told Snoop and Brown that she decided to sing Jamey Johnson's “In Color,” calling it “one of the finest pieces of storytelling in music.” Miller tearfully said she was dedicating her performance to her grandparents, who lived across the street from her as she was growing up and “taught me so much about music and life and love.” Though Snoop told Rodriguez she was “amazing,” especially at her age, he decided to move forward with Miller, whom he said “touched my heart tonight, and that's what music is supposed to do.” Ramdell decided not to sing in Spanish this time, opting for Bon Jovi's “It's My Life.” McKenzie, meanwhile, decided to sing Smokey Robinson's “Cruisin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. “The Chronology of Water,” a new biographical drama from Kristen Stewart, has released its first trailer. Adapted from the 2011 memoir of the same name by writer Lidia Yuknavitch, “The Chronology of Water” stars Imogen Poots as Lidia, recounting her story of attempting to escape an abusive home through competitive swimming. When her hopes are derailed due to alcohol and drug addiction, she navigates her troubled life and goes on a journey of sexual discovery all while finding healing through the power of writing. Reviews for the film were largely positive. In a review for IndieWire, critic David Ehrlich gave the film a “B+” and praised Stewart's direction, saying “There isn't a single millisecond of this movie that doesn't bristle with the raw energy of an artist who's found the permission she needed to put her whole being into every frame, messy and shattered as that might be.” Aside from Poots, “The Chronology of Water” stars Thora Birch, Jim Belushi, Earl Cave, Tom Sturridge, Charlie Carrick, and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth fame. The film is produced by Maggie McLean, Dylan Meyer, Michael Pruss, Rebecca Feuer, and Charles Gillibert, and will be released by independent distributor The Forge. After the release of her directorial debut, Stewart will next star in the upcoming stoner comedy “The Wrong Girls.” She has also been announced to star in an '80s vampire thriller “Flesh of the Gods” from “Mandy” director Panos Cosmatos, alongside Oscar Isaac. Her recent film credits include “Sacramento” and “Love Lies Bleeding” from 2024. “The Chronology of Water” will receive an awards-qualifying December 5 release in New York and Los Angeles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Kimmel returned to the airwaves Monday, Nov. 17, after taking several days off following the death of his longtime friend and Jimmy Kimmel Live bandleader, Cleto Escobedo III. Escobedo died suddenly on Nov. 11, with a cause of death later revealed to be cardiogenic shock following complications related to a liver transplant. Kimmel went ahead with his show that day, delivering an emotional tribute to Escobedo during his monologue, before taking the rest of the week off to grieve. On last night's show, Kimmel didn't directly address Escobedo's death. As Kimmel recalled in his monologue last week, he met Escobedo not long after his family moved from Brooklyn to Las Vegas. When Kimmel was offered the chance to do his own late-night show, he immediately knew he wanted Escobedo to be his bandleader. “We grew up watching Dave and Paul, and the idea that anyone other than him would lead the band was terrifying,” Kimmel said, referring to David Letterman and his longtime bandleader Paul Shaffer. Kimmel went on to call Escobedo the “nicest, most humble, kind, and always funny person,” adding: “He loved me. There's no one in my life I felt more comfortable with.” Elon Musk Fires Back After Billie Eilish Calls Him a ‘Coward' for Wealth Hoarding Jon Stewart Questions Trump References in Epstein Emails: ‘Which Bubba Was He Blowing?' Selena Quintanilla's Autopsy Report Revealed 30 Years After Her Death Speaking with Rolling Stone, Escobedo's bandmate, the keyboardist and musical arranger Jeff Babko, said, “I don't think I've ever seen television like Jimmy's monologue the other night. We were all feeling a lot, and I think it really showed what kind of family Jimmy created over there. Over the weekend, Kimmel launched two fundraisers in Escobedo's memory. One was for UCLA Medical Center, where Escobedo was being treated, and the other was for the Animal Foundation in Las Vegas, in honor of Escobedo's love of animals and rescue dogs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Cable pioneer and ex-Viacom CEO Tom Freston is out with a new book, "Unplugged," and some amazing stories. Despite his 26 years in a traditional media job, ultimately rising to CEO of what was then Viacom, Tom Freston had no interest in writing a traditional business book. Instead, Unplugged: Adventures From MTV to Timbuktu, published by Gallery Books, is a story of one former mogul's adventures around the world. “Most people who are executives or have been executives write a ‘how to do business better' type book,” he explains. It's a fitting approach for a man who's lived as much of his life off the grid as he has on it. The 79-year-old logged years in such far-flung locales as India and Afghanistan, where, at one point, he had a multimillion-dollar clothing export business. He tended bar in the Virgin Islands, built an orphanage in Burma and, later, centered his focus on Africa as board chair of The ONE campaign, an anti-poverty advocacy organization co-founded by Bono, one of Freston's famous pals. Richard Armitage, Bel Powley, Henry Rowley Narrate Audiobook for Alice Feeney's 'My Husband's Wife' (Exclusive First Listen) Jon Stewart on Entertainment Execs: "I Don't Know That You Feel the Other Humans in the Room Anymore" In between, Freston returned to the U.S., and landed a gig at a new, scrappy startup, the Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment Co., which had just launched two cable networks, Nickelodeon and The Movie Channel. Determined to have cable do for TV what FM radio had done for AM, the company would launch a music channel next, and Freston, a music fanatic, joined its founding team as marketing chief, soon rising to president. From there, he swiftly climbed the corporate ladder, adding other brands like VH1 and Comedy Central to his purview. By late 2005, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone, who had acquired the company years before, was so impressed by Freston's consistent results, he elevated him to CEO. Of course, he fired him eight months later, furious that he hadn't scooped up Myspace as Redstone rival Rupert Murdoch had, paying $580 million for the social networking service at the time. (When the latter famously collapsed in 2011, Murdoch offloaded it for $35 million; not doing that deal had saved Viacom more than $500 million. As Freston writes, “I'm still waiting for a thank-you note.”) In early November, Freston, a father of two whose globe-trotting continues, hopped on a Zoom to recount a few of his wildest tales, including an infamous sex tour with Redstone, and sound off on David Ellison, David Zaslav and the fate of MTV. I can't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday, and somehow, in your book, you're recounting conversations you had in your 20s and 30s. Had you kept journals along the way? When I was living in Afghanistan and India, I did, and they were pretty precise. When I was working [at Viacom], I had a diary and some notes, but when I left, I didn't take anything other than a few pieces of paper and a chainsaw [a gift from the heavy metal band Anthrax]. It's remarkable how your memories come back. I suspect there were some stories that felt like “musts.” One of my favorites is how, in order to get David Bowie to do an “I Want My MTV” commercial in the early '80s, you flew to Switzerland and met him on the ski slopes in Gstaad. You then proceeded to ski with him, ultimately ending the day in a sauna with him and Paul McCartney. I've been dining out on that story for years. I'll admit I'm still processing another story you share about taking Sumner Redstone and his mistress to sex clubs in Asia. At his request, you'd watch people fornicate onstage. I'm guessing you didn't need a journal entry to recall that trip? I figured that had to go in there. On one hand, he's a brilliant businessman, bold and unstoppable. I mean, who wants to start a conglomerate when they're, like, 65 or whatever he was? And then, in the end, after I leave [the company], he's spending, like, $150 million on hookers. I thought, maybe that thing in Bangkok kind of set him off on a new trail. But taking him through there and just looking at the look on his face — I had to get out of there, and he had to move up [to get a closer look]. I hadn't seen that side of him before because he was always with his wife, Phyllis. I never knew he had this longing. You also included a wild story about how Comedy Central was born. There were so many Comedy Central stories to choose from, but I thought it would be good just to say how we did it. And what we did is the kind of thing you can't do these days. “Hey, HBO is starting a comedy channel. Well, we should start one this afternoon. We'll be in all the news articles.” And it worked like a charm. That thing became worth billions of dollars. Well, I wanted to keep a fun tone, so I had a couple of stories [that we cut]. There was one about when I was working in Liberia with ONE and Red, and I met this cannibal warlord guy named General Butt Naked. The guy killed, like, 10,000 people, ripping hearts out of kids. There was another one about when I brought a case to the Supreme Court for special needs kids, for my son, but it just didn't fit. [My editors] were like, “Hey, keep it at 300 pages. As you write in the book, you got your job at MTV because Bob Pittman liked your checkered past. In fact, he was convinced you'd been a hashish smuggler. He recognized I had done other things, too. He wasn't just like, “Oh man, let's get a dope smuggler in here.” (Laughs.) But I'm curious how you think your lack of a traditional path or any TV experience, for that matter, served you in that job? Because we were inventing it from the ground up, so there was no legacy. Those early days at MTV, everybody was a music fanatic and no one really cared about how much money we were making, which is a good thing because no one was making any. But even now, whenever I run into somebody, they say how much they loved working there. We have a Facebook group called, “I worked at MTV when MTV was cool.” I mean, people couldn't wait to come to the office in those days. Well, yes, there were also hookers and tequila girls and whatever else was going on in those offices. We had a receptionist who sold cocaine, but he didn't last that long. Are there moves you wouldn't have made had you come in with traditional TV background? I mean, we'd fly Don Henley and John Mellencamp to Denver to the TCI headquarters and we'd try and rabble-rouse these bottle-wielding youths, who were our fan base, to storm the cable system. I saw that recur in the Jimmy Kimmel episode. Everyone talked about “Poor Bob [Iger],” who I love, but the missing piece of the equation was the young fan base that's rabidly in love with Jimmy Kimmel. You don't just take something away from them. They're going to hurt you, reputationally and business-wise. You saw that: They canceled all those Hulu and Disney+ [subscriptions]. And that was not in the equation. It was like, “Well, do we listen to the FCC? We don't want Trump [to retaliate].” But to get back to your question, [we probably would have been more concerned about] offending our distributors instead of just burning down their cable system or having a rock band out in their parking lot. You ultimately rose to CEO of Viacom, but that was never a job you wanted. I wanted to be like Lorne Michaels, who's seen 50 regimes come and go and he's still there doing his thing. I mean, you're dealing with serious business — with Wall Street and bankers and financial statements. Not that I don't know those things, but it wouldn't be as enjoyable a job. Have you ever regretted accepting the job? And who knows where that would lead me. By the way, Les and I always got along pretty good. But by [the time Redstone approached him about taking over for Mel Karmazin], I'd been there for, like, 20 years, I was around 60, and I figured being the head of a public company is a big honor. Who would've thought I'd be ringing the bell on Wall Street? So I decided I wanted to do it, and then the funny thing was that I'd told Sumner I needed 24 hours to think about it, and then when I came back to him to say yes the next day, he said, “I already gave the job to Les.” I was like, “It's only been 17 hours!” [Redstone ultimately made Freston and Moonves co-presidents in 2004; by late 2005, he split the company in two and named Freston CEO of Viacom.] It sounds like Paramount chief David Ellison is going to make a go at rebooting MTV. It was due diligence on their part. We don't know what's happened?” I said, “First of all, when they sawed the ‘music television' off the bottom of the logo, they lost me.' But all the music people had left and MTV didn't have any real value as a music brand. I don't know if you can resurrect it, but I think you might be able to. One, they have a huge library of shows. They also have a huge library of music videos and MTV News — everything that happened from 1980 on. So, why couldn't you do some kind of digital curation thing? Anyway, I'm really happy to see Ellison there. I mean, if someone was going to buy Paramount, the Ellisons got my vote. If a private equity company came in there, they'd sell it for parts, and it would disappear. Ellison will have to go through some rough times now. What did the new leadership team ask of you? It was like, “If you were me, what would you do?” But first, they laid out the situation as they saw it. But we're buying this company, we don't want to spin it out into one of these Shit Cos., as people call them. We'd like to see if we could resurrect [the brands], and what ideas do you have?” And yeah, they're asking a bunch of older people how to make it a cool, fun place to work and have a good business plan that people could line up and salute — but at least we've been there. Of course, the answer is you really should tap into young kids and find someone like John Mayer. He has this amazing channel on Sirius. And he's better at directing some 20-year-olds than we would be! Looking out at the entertainment landscape, who's doing a good job right now? I love the folks at Fox Searchlight. I love A24, they find something with some edge, and they're able to mainstream it in their own specialty-label way. You famously got fired by Sumner for not buying Myspace. Can you describe the emotional whiplash that must have occurred between your firing and the flash mob of sorts that occurred in the lobby as you exited? I'd seen him fire both Mel Karmazin, who was wonderful, and Frank Biondi, who was fantastic, for doing their jobs. Then the elevator door opened and I couldn't believe it. It was packed, and it was a big lobby, and they started chanting my name. I mean, they followed me out the door. What was going through your head at the time? I started to well up — all the people I love, they were all there and touching me. And then they aired it on CNBC. I've been faking it all these years, and now I've been caught and I'm going to leave in disgrace.” Then all of a sudden you get this hero's sendoff, and it was extraordinary. You'd mentioned in the book that one of the first people you heard from was Tom Cruise, whom Redstone claimed he had fired as well. And Tom didn't even work there! Yeah, he called up, and I had a good relationship with Tom. [In 2006, Paramount Pictures terminated its 14-year relationship with Cruise over his offscreen behavior, notably the couch-jumping incident on Oprah.] And Tom was very kind, he said, “I'm sorry to see you go,” and I think he was sincere. You were approached about a lot of different traditional CEO jobs after that but opted to take none of them. I took my friends and my wife on the “Tom Got Fired” tour to Burma. At the time, I had my lawyer saying, “You better get another job right away or you're going to be gone.” It was Bob Pittman who said, “You're in no condition to make a decision right now. Go away and clear your head, and if you come back, I'll give you an office in my new place and you can figure out what you're going to do.” Bob gave me the permission to go and I did, I got clarity. I was never into the job for money. So, I went back to Afghanistan, which was exhilarating and meaningful because the networks there were all about socially connecting the Afghans to the world and to each other, gender equality, all these things that you sort of believe in. In many ways, your involvement as an investor in and adviser to Vice legitimized the company and its larger-than-life leader, Shane Smith. He could sell ice to the Eskimos, that guy. And the HBO show that we did was exhilarating. We were going everywhere, doing everything, and Shane was great at piecing these stories together. They were building their own little MTV Networks. They're kind of going out of style, these linear networks.” But he was always on a quest for a bigger deal and more money. And he'd convinced all these people to partake, and he was making good stuff, it just wasn't profitable enough, particularly when the revenue started to drop. But I had a lot of fun with him. I'll still get a text or two. They come at, like, 5 in the morning: “Hey, buddy. I love you.” And you go, “Oh, it's Shane.” When Paramount Pictures came under your purview, you'd go to Bob Daly's home in Bel-Air a few times a week and, as you put it, you became a student at the Bob Daly Film School. I'm curious what the Tom Freston leadership school curriculum would entail? I'd have to be a professor emeritus at this point. But I'd try to teach people that it's about risk-taking — while still keeping your costs under control. So, let's not get ahead of your skis, but take risks. I don't want to be going head-to-head with all the major studios or all the big cable networks. 1 in some category over on the left here, I'm removing myself as much as possible from the forces of supply and demand. Beyond Ellison and Shell, how often are people still calling you for advice these days? Oh, it's decreasing at an increasing rate. I guess you sell [Warner Bros.] for the highest price. He went out to Hollywood, and he indicated a love for the form and actually made real friends like Spielberg out there. That's a hard cult to break into, and he did it. I imagine in writing this, you thought a lot about your own legacy. I certainly took a lot of left-hand turns, and if there's a lesson to teach younger people, it's that you don't have to stay on the straight and narrow, particularly when you're young. You see too many kids today, they get out of school and a week later they're working at Goldman Sachs or wherever, and they're having panic attacks and depression episodes. It doesn't have to be that way. I'd like to be an example of someone who did that and it paid off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eilish called out the world's richest man last week while urging him to be more charitable amid news that he could soon be the planet's first trillionaire. Borrowing a page from his former DOGE boss Donald Trump's book of sexist insults targeting women's intelligence, Musk posted a message responding to Eilish's graphic, saying, “She's not the sharpest tool in the shed.” Game Awards 2025 Nominations Led by 'Clair Obscur: Expedition 33' With Record 12 Nods Eilish's post came amid news last week that Musk, 54, could soon become the world's first-ever trillionaire. The 23-year-old “Bury a Friend” singer has had America's wealth gap on her mind lately, including at WSJ Magazine‘s 2025 Innovator Awards last month, where late night host Stephen Colbert presented her with the honor, noting that she has raised more than $11.5 million for organizations addressing food insecurity and climate change through her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour. Eilish then proceeded to lay down the gauntlet for American billionaires — including Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg (net worth $228 billion), who was in the room — suggesting that perhaps they could use some of their cash to help others in need. But it was what she said last week about Musk that appeared to get under his skin. Eilish posted the series of infographics suggesting the world of good that Elon could do with his money, including spending $40 billion every year to end hunger by 2030 or provide universal safe clean water for the planet for the next seven years with for $140 billion, save all 10,443 critically endangered species by spending $1-$2 billion annually to bring them all down to endangered status, or rebuild war-ravaged Gaza and the occupied West Bank for $53.2 billion. Eilish doubled-down on her suggestion last Thursday (Nov. 13), specifically slamming Musk in her Instagram Story, calling him a, “f–king pathetic p–sy b–ch coward.” Billie's remarks came after a shareholder vote paved the way for Musk — already the world's richest man with a net worth of $465 billion — to rake in $1 trillion in Tesla stock if he delivers on specific performance goals over the next decade. While Musk reportedly donated nearly $1.9 billion shares of Tesla to unnamed charities in 2022 — as well as $5.7 billion worth of shares in 2021 — a March 2024 New York Times story said that unlike fellow billionaire Bill Gates, who has used his massive wealth to improve health care across Africa, Musk's philanthropy has “been haphazard and largely self-serving, making him eligible for enormous tax breaks and helping his businesses.” The paper reported that Musk has seeded his charity with tax-deductible donations of more than $7 billion in stock since 2020, noting that the foundation housing the money has “failed in recent years to give away the bare minimum required by law to justify the tax break.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

Staff at Lilliput Church of England Infant School in Dorset explained to parents that demons are associated with "spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness."


							By 

	Lily Ford



	A Christian school in England has barred its students from singing along to KPop Demon Hunters amid concerns over references to demons.


	Lilliput Church of England Infant School in Dorset sent a note to parents and carers for the pupils, aged from four to seven, saying some members of the community are “deeply uncomfortable” with specific song lyrics in Netflix‘s smash hit film.




	According to BBC News, the initial note asked parents to encourage their children “not to sing these songs at school out of respect for those who find the themes at odds with their faith”. Staff explained that demons are associated with “spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness,” and therefore attempts must be made to foster and uphold the school's “Christian ethos.”

	In a new letter made public on the school's website Monday, acting head teacher Lloyd Allington wrote to parents and carers: “For some Christians… even fictional or playful use of this language can conflict with their faith, which emphasises rejecting evil rather than engaging with it — even in entertainment.”


	However, he did also mention that he had received positive feedback from some parents about KPop Demon Hunters, who have said that the songs encourage values like teamwork and kindness.


	“We want to reassure you that we are not asking parents to tell their children that there is anything wrong with enjoying the film or its songs if it aligns with your own views and beliefs, and this will not be the messaging we share in the school either,” the letter continued.


	“Our role will simply be to help children understand that some of their peers may hold different views and to explore how we can respect and support those peers in upholding their faith.”

	











	The movie follows K-pop girl group and demon-hunting trio Huntr/x. It was released to widespread acclaim in June this year and swiftly became the streamer's most-watched original title in Netflix history, with a sequel already in the works.


	It was also the first film soundtrack on the Billboard Hot 100 to have four of its songs in the top ten and earned an impressive five Grammy nominations.


The Hollywood Reporter‘s review called KPop Demon Hunters a “dazzlingly animated, infectiously soundtracked treat.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After attempting to bend the knee to the Trump administration, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has agreed to restore its $36 million, three-year contract with NPR and fund its satellite distribution service for local radio stations. NPR accused its decades-long partner of reneging on the contract days after Trump ordered the defunding of public media; CPB claimed it canceled the contract with NPR to award it to Public Media Infrastructure (PMI), a new consortium of public radio organizations. The judge wasn't buying what CPB was selling and decided it hadn't made a credible argument for breaking the contract. “The settlement is a victory for editorial independence and a step toward upholding the First Amendment rights of NPR and the public media system in our legal challenge to [Trump's] Executive Order,” Katherine Maher, President and CEO of NPR, said in a statement. “While we entered into this dispute with CPB reluctantly, we're glad to resolve it in a way that enables us to continue to provide for the stability of the Public Radio Satellite System, offer immediate and direct support to public radio stations across the country, and proceed with our strong and substantive claims against this illegal and unconstitutional Executive Order. Trump issued Executive Order 14290 (“Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media”) on May 1, ordering CBP to cease funding NPR and PBS. Of course, executive orders aren't laws, so there's no legal reason for the CPB to adhere to them, especially when they might be unconstitutional. The goal of his order came to fruition in Congress, when Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill passed over the summer and rescinded $1.1 billion previously allocated to public media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In what appears to be a career first for Christopher Nolan, the Oscar-winning filmmaker claims his upcoming adaptation of Homer's epic, The Odyssey, features “usable sound.” Taking after one of his cinematic heroes, Michael Mann, Nolan has long been a proponent of having his characters mumble through scenes as large bombs and engines muddy up the mix. Since the director prefers shooting on large-format film, which requires a noisy, cumbersome camera, and refuses to re-record audio during post-production, incoherent dialogue has since become a hallmark of Nolan's auteurism. That was until science finally caught up with the director. IMAX recently developed “the blimp,” a casing for its cameras that reduces camera noise, allowing Nolan to record clean audio, to the delight of his massive viewership, which spends a good portion of his movies wondering what that guy just said. “What that opens up are intimate moments of performance on the world's most beautiful format.” Nolan did not specify whether “blimp” technology could adequately capture the dulcet tones of Tom Hardy speaking through a mask with the same clarity. In addition to coherent line readings, Nolan also promises he didn't break a single IMAX camera on the set of The Odyssey. “I did not destroy an IMAX camera on this film,” Nolan says. “I have destroyed several in my time, but these ones survived The Odyssey.” Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Remar tacitly confirmed that Nolan's long-running feud with chairs and cellphones on set continues unabated. “No cell phones on set, and the man never sits down,” he said. “He stands next to the camera for every single shot. We were on the beach shooting in Iceland; I never saw him sit down once for 12 hours out there.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swift recorded namesake songs for seven of her 12 studio albums. With 12 full-lengths under her belt, Taylor Swift has released seven albums that include songs that reflect each album's name: “Fearless,” “Speak Now,” “Red,” “Lover,” “evermore,” “The Tortured Poets Department” and “The Life of a Showgirl.” Right now, only three – “Fearless,” “Red” and “Lover” – became official singles. (And don't worry about the five albums without a title track: She shows them love in other ways. Debut doesn't mention her name, but she later shouts herself out on both “22” from Red and “Clara Bow” from The Tortured Poets Department; 1989 never received a lyrical callback, but her famous introduction to its world tour does: “My name is Taylor and I was born in 1989!”; Reputation tracks “End Game” and “Delicate” as well as Speak Now's “Superman” reference reputation; evermore's “gold rush” includes “My mind turns your life into folklore”; and mentions of midnight abound throughout her catalog, but only “Anti-Hero” and “Midnight Rain” from Midnights and Rep's “New Year's Day” contain the actual word. )Read below for Billboard's ranking of the seven title tracks, as well as their peaks on the Billboard Hot 100. It's a gorgeous duet held back only by their superior pairing on “exile” and its quieter existence in the Swift universe. “Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins? / They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away,” Carpenter lilts with a sweet but vicious edge. On the tender and romantic serenade – perfect for a wedding day dance – Swift professes her desire to capture a partner's heart “forever and ever.” Despite the overlying tension of the questions: “Can I go where you go? “And I don't know how it gets better than this / You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless / And I don't know but with you, I'd dance / In a storm in my best dress, fearless,” she chants boldly. Rife with modern-day imagery (“You smoked then ate seven bars of chocolate / We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist”) and flush with the anxiety of a fleeting relationship, Swift swells to an uneasy admission: “And who's gonna hold you, like me?” As she says, “No f—ing body.” An anthemic mix of guitars and banjos with an outsized synth-pop overlay, Taylor wrenches open her feelings and lets them free on “Red” – a poetic masterpiece of frenzied, colorful passion.
