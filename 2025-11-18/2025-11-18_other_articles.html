                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This production is built on “how did they do THAT?” energy, and it delivers. The plot centers on Lou (Cher Alvarez) and James (Patrick Heusinger), an American couple who've just relocated to London for James's job. They've been placed in a lovely craftsman-style home, the sort of quaint London dwelling that practically begs to be haunted. They're putting an ocean between themselves and James's mother, Carolanne, played by Shannon Cochran, with an enjoyably meddling edge. (And yes, naming her after “Carolanne” is a delightful wink to Poltergeist.) But Lou insists she's fine, and for a brief moment, the newly arrived couple actually believes they're about to embark on a fresh start. At first, it's the small things: power outages, water faucets turning on by themselves, doors that refuse to stay closed. But as Lou becomes convinced something supernatural is inside the house – and as James tries very, very hard to be the rational one – the audience watches their grip on reality begin to slip. Once James finally accepts that something is happening, they call in the wonderfully quirky ghost-hunting podcaster Etheline Cotgrave (Kate Fry). Let's just say her visit doesn't go well, and the haunting escalates into a full-force assault. To be clear, the story of Paranormal Activity isn't breaking new ground. But seeing this kind of story unfold live gives it a fresh charge. One of the defining traits of the films is the found-footage style that encourages audiences to scan every corner for a flicker of movement. The stage production cleverly replicates that feeling. With Gareth Fry's sound design building the franchise's signature low, ominous rumble (the audio clue that a scare is coming), the entire house set becomes a minefield of suspense. The two-story design ensures the audience's eyes are constantly darting, trying to anticipate which hallway, staircase, or shadowy nook will erupt next. And many of those moments truly land. The audience I saw it with screamed, gasped, clutched strangers, and occasionally laughed just to release the tension. I won't spoil a single effect, but several of them are as impressive as anything I've seen in a Broadway-scale thriller. The actors' volume is often so low that major plot points get swallowed, perhaps intentionally, to make the audience lean in before a scare hits with a jump-worthy jolt. The second act is also dimly lit to the point of murkiness, which contributes to the mood but sometimes makes it difficult to see who's where and what's happening. Still, those issues don't sink the production. If anything, they feel like growing pains for a show experimenting with how far live theater can push 21st-century horror. And as someone who genuinely loves the Paranormal Activity films, I wasn't convinced the franchise would translate to a stage. For fans of the movies, this is a must-see. For theatergoers looking for something different, atmospheric, and seasonally spooky, this is a wildly entertaining night out. Paranormal Activity isn't just a theatrical adaptation; it's a reminder that live theater, with the right team, can still find thrilling new ways to make an entire audience jump out of their seats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wilkins is receiving a protective detail because she has faced hundreds of credible death threats related to her relationship with Director Patel, whom she has been dating for three years. Out of respect for her safety, we will not be providing additional details,” the FBI said in a statement. The decision to grant Wilkins' a security detail is quite unusual. Wilkins and Patel also don't share a residence together. Wilkins' security detail will consist of agents  who are a part of the SWAT team assigned to the FBI Nashville's field office. Sources familiar with the FBI told MS NOW that by having these SWAT agents assigned to Wilkins it could cause delays in their response to critical situations such as mass shootings or terrorist attacks. The reported increased death threats waged against Wilkins comes amid an ongoing conspiracy theory that Wilkins is an Israeli intelligence asset, who is only dating Patel to extract information. Wilkins, who is neither Israeli or Jewish, filed a lawsuit against Kyle Seraphin, an ex-FBI turned YouTuber. He is the main conspirator behind these allegations against Wilkins. Just a few weeks ago, Seraphin revealed that Patel had used the FBI private jet to fly to see Wilkins perform at an event in Pennsylvania. “I've always said — criticize me all you want. But going after the people doing great work, my personal life, or those around me is a total disgrace,” he wrote earlier this month on the social platform X. “The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis — a true patriot and the woman I'm proud to call my partner in life — are beyond pathetic. She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Representative Anna Paulina Luna has intensified her push for transparency around UFO and UAP programmes, alleging that critical footage and data are being concealed under a classified 'black congressional budget.' Luna, who chairs the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, argues that lawmakers and taxpayers are being shut out of programmes that may involve advanced aircraft and unexplained phenomena. Luna told Joe Rogan that she has viewed classified photographs inside a secure federal facility, claiming the objects depicted were 'not made by mankind.' She said whistle-blowers and military personnel have repeatedly described encounters with craft capable of manoeuvres that defy physics. Luna clarified that she has not seen aliens or open portals herself, but said: 'I have seen photographic evidence in a SCIF, where I was briefed.' She suggested that descriptions from ancient texts, including missing biblical writings, may echo similar encounters. In an interview with FOX 13 Tampa Bay, Luna pressed: 'Why can't we see some of these classified videos and information that seem to be operating under a black Congressional budget? ... Congress is not being given access to money that we're spending.' She added that the lack of access is both a national security and democratic accountability issue: 'If these are programs ... responsible for ... billions of dollars being lost ... that could be going towards other things.' Luna described questioning whistle-blowers and military personnel about the unknown craft, and she recounted that 'the repeated answer was that these were interdimensional beings—they defy conventional physics.' Luna recounted a confrontation at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, saying that "despite being on a congressional delegation, we were denied access to pilots and evidence." Luna said she challenged the commander, insisting that as elected officials, they are entitled to oversight. She has expressed frustration with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, asserting that a 'protective complex' exists to keep these phenomena secret. Yet she remains determined, calling for more congressional hearings, oversight, and public accountability. As the debate over UAP disclosure intensifies, Luna's demands spotlight the ongoing tension between national security and democratic transparency, raising questions that extend far beyond Capitol Hill.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[NOTE: The following true story was told live by Juliet Pokorny, during the West Side Stories performance that took place on Wednesday, November 12 at the Polly Klaas Community Theater. This was one of several stories shared that evening. The theme for November was “Sour Grapes.”] Have you ever had a supernatural experience? Like, maybe a voice that's not in your head, but also not a real person out there, but you hear it anyway, something in that regard? I'm about to tell a story about four supernatural experiences that happened over many years – that I didn't realize were connected until much, much later. I don't know if you've ever been to one, but it's just like a regular church, except the ministers are psychic, and at the end, instead of putting money in a dish, you put in a note, and they give you feedback on a question that you might have. It was my first time, so I put a note in that said, “Whatever you think I need to know.” Of course, I did not think that my note would be pulled. Towards the end of their giving feedback to people, the psychic pulled a note out and I immediately knew it was mine because I could feel a pulse inside me. He looked around the room, saw me, and said, “Your brother is going to need you. He called all of the family, each one of us separately, and when I think about how excruciating that must have been for him, because we were all upset and there he was consoling us, right? So that's what we all were told. He has about three months to live. And in that moment, I hear a voice – not in my head, but not really out there, but somewhere in between that – and the voice said, “This is it. This is what the psychic was telling you. I changed my schedule, and started I driving down to Watsonville two or three times a week to have dinner with him. It was pre-legal marijuana, so I made marijuana butter and I put it in all his food and we watched movies, and I brought my girls down every weekend so they could see him, right up until that last month. And his wife Helen asked me if I'd move in with them and be one of his primary caretakers, which was sad and hard, but truly one of the most beautiful gifts that could be given … to help somebody cross over. She moved everything out of his room, off his shelves, and she put these soft cloths over everything to make it very simple, and not busy when he was looking around. And then she sat down and quietly talked to him about the next things he could expect while he was about to cross over. SO we walked around it and just admired the grapes on the vines – and I finally got to go home. I stood in the shower, finally alone, and then there was this voice, it was like Siri on crack or something, and it said, “You need to go across the street to your neighbor Stacey's house.” So, I got out of the shower and Dave said, “Stacey just came over. And I told her about us walking around the vineyard after his passing and she said, “Well, what's his wine?” And I said, “Oh, you've never heard of it. And we've been drinking my brother's wine. Cut to about two-and-a-half months ago, and Wayne's wife Helen has just passed. Her brother calls me and says, “Come to the house, and I want you to pick up any of Wayne's things that you want.” I say okay. A couple of days later, I wake up in the morning, ready to go, and it's like my brother is sitting on the bed, and he says to me, “You need to go underneath the house, and you need to get my wine.” He said, “This is where it is. You open the door, there's going to be a bike. You're going to turn left, then you're going to turn right, and that's where my wine is.” And he said, “You absolutely must insist.” We get in there and I say to Helen's brother, “Is there any chance I can go down underneath the house?” My daughter says, “Well, we'd still like to get the key, if that's okay.” I go upstairs and the brother goes, “See. Actually, I found three cases of his wine.” My brother, through all these years, wanted to make sure I had his wine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conspiracy theories flooded social media when Cloudflare suffered an outage early Tuesday, causing problems for users on platforms including X, Donald Trump's Truth Social platform and ChatGPT. In an email shared with Newsweek, a spokesperson for the internet services company said: "Many of Cloudflare's services experienced a significant outage today beginning around 10:20 UTC. Though his death was ruled a suicide, it has long been at the center of conspiracy theories due to his well-documented connections to public and powerful figures, including President Donald Trump. The outcome of the procedural votes and debates on the Epstein Files Transparency Act, authored by representatives Thomas Massie, R-Ky, and Ro Khanna, D-Calif, could have significant implications for transparency regarding one of the most high-profile criminal cases in recent decades, and it marks a rare bipartisan push for greater government disclosure. One post on X, from the account @GermanicFren, which has over 50,000 followers, reads "Oh you're gonna vote on releasing the epstein files??? Another post, from the account @leave_not_liv reads "if you're having issues with this app or other websites today, it's because cloudflare is having a software issue causing mass outages today interesting that this is happening as the Epstein files goes to a vote and a potential release may happen." A spokesperson for Cloudflare, which delivers multiple websites on its global cloud network, told Newsweek the configuration file that caused the outage "grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare's services." The account @iArtSoometimes, which has over 20,000 followers on X: "Cloudflare outage same day as Epstein House vote…coincidence? Cloudflare, in a statement to Newsweek over email: "To be clear, there is no evidence that this was the result of an attack or caused by malicious activity. We expect that some Cloudflare services will be briefly degraded as traffic naturally spikes post incident but we expect all services to return to normal in the next few hours. A detailed explanation will be posted soon on blog.cloudfare.com. Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable. We apologize to our customers and the internet in general for letting you down today. Procedural votes and debates were scheduled to get underway in the House at 10 a.m.</p>

They had a wonderful day together, and two days later, he was admitted into the hospital. “No normal kid is supposed to know when somebody they love so profoundly is going to die,” Jackson says. You don't need to be scared of it. It took decades, but eventually Jackson did just that. Now, she's one of the world's most famous psychics. Her clients include Gwyneth Paltrow and Kim Kardashian, and she has written two New York Times best-selling books — perhaps most famously Signs: The Secret Language of the Universe, which shows readers how to recognize messages from loved ones who have died and, most recently, Guided: The Secret Path to an Illuminated Life, which was published on November 11. (How did she feel, I wondered, about the TikTok video Kardashian posted after our interview saying that four unnamed psychics were “fucking full of shit” because they told her she was going to pass the bar exam and she didn't? Jackson's representatives declined to provide a comment.) In order for these signs to even reach us in the first place, she says we have to remain receptive to the possibility that there are forces greater than us who are wanting and willing to give us whatever help we're looking for. I took that invitation literally and called up Jackson at her home on Long Island to ask about her new book, her backstory, and what she'd say to the skeptics among us. One of the major messages in your books is that we all have psychic abilities and are able to connect with the other side. What do you mean by that?I'm actually a huge skeptic; I'm always raising an eyebrow at certain things. But I want to normalize this because this is a very inherent part of all of us. We have this doorway within us that's so beautiful — that connects us to our “Team of Light,” connects us to our soul, our higher self — and the guidance is right there inside. I think what happens to most people is they distance themselves from their spiritual self. They distance themselves from trusting their intuition. I still see myself as a teacher. I happen to be a psychic medium, but I'm teaching people how to access this inside of themselves. 1 thing you just have to do is you have to set the intention in your thoughts. What do you mean by “Team of Light”?I believe we all have a Team of Light on the other side. It's made up of three parts: It's God energy, it's what I refer to as spirit guides — throughout history, these might be referred to as guardian angels: these angelic beings who are your teachers and your mentors, who your soul contracts with before you come here to Earth School, and they're just there to guide you — and then the third part of that is your Team of Light on the other side. How do you suppose people can connect to that?Light energy can manipulate small metallic objects, like putting coins in our path — pennies, dimes, or nickels. They love to also mess with electrical devices, anything from making the lights go wonky to shutting the TV on and off. They will send creatures that navigate this world using electromagnetic fields, like butterflies, dragonflies, deer, fox, and every type of bird there is. They'll put stuff in your social-media feed that they want you to experience or that's going to remind you of them. That's what they're creating with you, but in order to develop this language together, you need to ask for something really specific. I always encourage people to create four different ways the other side can communicate with them. Pick an animal, but I always say make it a little different because when you get your animal, your logical mind is going to be like, Oh, that's a coincidence. Pick a phrase — it could be anything that was important to you from when you were younger or one that just pops in your mind right now. I think the greatest way we can honor those signs and that communication and that connection is to tell someone else about our sign story or to tell somebody else about the guidance we felt. What would you say to someone who might be skeptical and think those signs are just, well, coincidences?That's a great thing, that they are questioning themselves, because that means they are a seeker and they're a critical thinker. If people say to themselves, I asked for this sign, and I got it — could that be a coincidence?, I always say to those people, “Ask for another one, and you're going to get it.” Just keep trying the language. I think what happens for people when they keep having these experiences — they have to own it as their own truth. I think it can be so beautiful when we have this reawakening. Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Gwyneth Paltrow blurbed Guided. The only way you could ever find me is if somebody had a reading with me or if you came to the Forever Family Foundation, where I volunteered. One thing that I've always been aware of is what a gift it is to have a platform and help the world. Every single person you just mentioned, and everybody I have been so blessed to get to know, I met organically. It was never anything I tried to make happen. I know there are always perceptions about outward persona, tabloid fodder, this or that, but I will tell you everybody that you've mentioned is so loving, kind, and supportive. So many people think Hollywood is vapid, but no — it's not. People are so loving and kind to one another. I think, also, because they've had their own experiences with the other side, they know it's the truth — and so they're going to share that to help others. I've always said the greatest part of my life journey is who I've met along the way. That doesn't just mean celebrities; there are so many relationships I hold sacred that I've met through this work that have become such a big part of my heart. In Guided, you emphasize that in order to receive signs and messages from the universe and the other side, we have to start by being open to it. What tangible steps do you think people can take to do this?The most important step to living a guided life is just by simply setting your intention in your thoughts that you want to be guided. Our thoughts are more powerful than we can even fathom, and that every thought we have, we're either putting more light into the world or more darkness. Step two is opening your mind and your heart to being able to recognize the guidance and being able to tell your logical mind to sit down, be quiet, and honor the truth of that guidance. One way you can do that is by talking to others, by telling your story, saying, “I experienced this. I want to tell you about my connection.” Just those two little things: Setting the intention, and then being in a state of openness to recognize and receive that guidance, is phenomenal. You can ask for guidance on everything, from being guided to a good parking spot to being guided into your career change or the next relationship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Theatricality was the fashion memo for the “Wicked: For Good” premiere in New York City on Monday night, featuring designer looks worn by Oscar-nominated stars Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande and more. Ariana Grande Returns to Her Signature Glinda Whimsy in Custom Thom Browne at 'Wicked: For Good' Singapore Premiere Cynthia Erivo channeled the dark side of her character, Elphaba, in a theatrical black gown from Balenciaga. The actress' look was curated by stylist Jason Bolden. Ariana Grande turned to a design by Schiaparelli's creative director, Daniel Roseberry. The custom haute couture dress featured a ballgown silhouette with a black ruched crepe and satin bustier, which laced up the back. The voluminous skirt was crafted with 200 meters of silk organza and tulle split into 20 ruffles. Grande accessorized her look with jewelry pieces by Swarovski, for which she serves as a global brand ambassador. Makeup artist Michael Anthony and hairstylist Alyx Liu provided glam for the actress, with image architect Law Roach curating the Oscar-nominated star's look. Michelle Yeoh wore the voluminous final look from Givenchy's fall 2025 ready-to-wear collection designed by Sarah Burton. The ample frame of the dress created a quasi-bubbled effect in a light yellow shade with layers of tulle fabric. Styled by Alexandra Mandelkorn, Bode accentuated her “Wicked”-inspired attire with a pair of silver sparkling Christian Louboutin shoes akin to the memorable ruby red slippers from “The Wizard of Oz.” Domingo also wore a flowing cream shirt, light beige pants, and brown loafers with tassels. The actor's look was curated by styling team Wayman Bannerman and Micah McDonald. Jeff Goldblum channeled his Wizard of Oz character in a custom Prada look. Harkening back to the 1939 costumes for the original “Wizard of Oz,” Goldblum's look, styled by Andrew T. Vottero, featured a green vest atop an emerald dress shirt, coordinated with a velvet blue, long-sleeve coat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A machine learning framework can distinguish molecules made by biological processes from those formed through non-biological processes and could be used to analyze samples returned by current and future planetary missions. José C. Aponte, Amirali Aghazadeh, and colleagues analyzed eight carbonaceous meteorites and ten terrestrial geologic samples using two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Using this data, the authors developed LifeTracer, a computational framework that processes mass spectrometry data and applies machine learning to identify patterns distinguishing abiotic from biotic origins. A logistic regression model trained on compound-level features achieved over 87% accuracy in classifying samples as meteoritic or terrestrial. The framework identified polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and alkylated variants as key predictive features, with naphthalene emerging as the most predictive compound for abiotic samples. According to the authors, the approach enables scalable, unbiased biosignature detection and could be a powerful tool for interpreting complex organic mixtures that will be returned by current and future planetary sample return missions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If it weren't for an Ashkenazi Jew named Stanton T. Friedman, the world might have long ago forgotten what's come to be known simply as the “Roswell incident.” Instead, countless books, documentaries and made-for-TV dramas have explored the 1947 discovery of mysterious materials found on a New Mexico ranch that Friedman argued were the relics of extraterrestrials. And this dusty desert town has been transformed according to an unusual paradox: It's shaped by conspiracy theories, yet is home to virtually no Jews. Roswell's only synagogue, Congregation B'nai Israel, closed up and moved to Albuquerque five years ago. “They didn't have a rabbi and they only met twice a month, on Fridays,” said Leslie Lawner, who made the move with her husband in 2020, reducing Roswell's tiny Jewish population by two. The Lawners left behind a town that is largely defined by what happened in the summer of 1947, when local rancher W.W. “Mac” Brazen found rubber strips, tin foil, thick paper and other debris on his property and shared the material with Sheriff George Wilcox of Roswell. In 1987, Friedman — who died six years ago — told The New York Times that federal officials had engaged in a “cosmic Watergate” to cover up the truth. proudly holding up the Dunkin Donuts marquee along Main Street. Not surprisingly, Martians are a common theme in Halloween displays here. In 1997, the Air Force — attempting to dispel rumors that had persisted for decades — released a 231-page report concluding that alien bodies recovered at the Roswell crash site weren't aliens at all, but dummies used in parachute tests. It also said that the “spacecraft” that had fallen to Earth on Brazen's ranch was really an Air Force balloon used in a top-secret program code-named Project Mogul to monitor the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests. In a town forged around the religion of aliens, Jewish life is virtually nonexistent. There aren't enough Jews here to make a minyan — let alone support a synagogue — and the few who did live here have mostly died off or moved away. Lawner and her husband Bob rarely attended services at Congregation B'nai Israel, located a block from their house at 8th and Washington, during their 27 years in Roswell. But Lawner did help develop a curriculum on Holocaust studies for Sidney Gutierrez Middle School, which she helped found and where she taught for 17 years. It was an area of inquiry that overlapped with one outlandish but persistent theory about the Roswell incident. Annie Jacobsen claims in her 2012 book, “Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base,” that just before the Roswell crash, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin recruited Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele — the infamous Auschwitz “angel of death” — to create “grotesque, child-size aviators” to pilot a plane in order to trigger widespread panic throughout the United States. An Orthodox Jewish rabbinical authority, Rabbi Pini Dunner of Beverly Hills, California, has called the Roswell incident “nonsense.” “Most people don't believe any of this, nor, for that matter, do we entertain the claims of those who maintain that the Apollo moon landings were all an elaborate hoax, or that Denver International Airport stands above an underground city that serves as a headquarters for the masonically inspired New World Order,” Dunner wrote in an online post. The question is: why would any intelligent person believe such nonsense to be true?” The Israeli-American physicist Avi Loeb, who runs a lab at Harvard University, argues that some objects and phenomena in space cannot be explained except as evidence of extraterrestrial technology. Loeb has emphasized the appeal of aliens and space exploration on Jewish grounds. “It is reasonable to imagine the absence of antisemitism in interstellar space,” he wrote earlier this year, noting that anything traveling from the other side of the Milky Way would have had to set out before there were Jews. The resulting frenzy has embroiled U.S. transportation officials and even Kim Kardashian. Factual or not, this past July, Roswell marked 78 years since the mysterious 1947 event, with an annual Roswell UFO Festival that lures thousands of tourists from all 50 states and beyond. Every year, sidewalk vendors do a brisk business selling funnel cakes, alien salt-and-pepper shakers and other trinkets, while tourists happily pay $5 each to visit the downtown International UFO Museum and Research Center. “These exhibits are designed not to convince anyone to believe one way or another about their subjects,” says a sign at the museum's entrance. Local merchants don't seem to care much what really transpired that night in 1947. They're just grateful for all the desperately needed cash this festival generates. “Roswell didn't have a tourist industry and one of my friends was telling me about this UFO stuff. We live out in the middle of the desert, and without a lot of bright lights, at night you can see a lot.” Added Todd Wildermuth, Roswell's public information officer: “I don't have an opinion about it. Roswell is certainly not the kind of place to visit if you don't like reptiles and other poisonous creatures. These days, only a handful of Jews remain in Roswell. “The building was deteriorating and there was no one within the group who knew how to keep it up,” said Judy Stubbs, B'nai Israel's former treasurer. The community's Torah, meanwhile, has found a new home at Congregation Nahalat Shalom in Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city and home to many of the state's estimated 25,000 Jews. In 2018, Roswell's dwindling Jewish community agreed to “indefinitely loan” Nahalat Shalom the sacred scroll, which had been rescued from a small town in Czechoslovakia by the Karnowsky family during World War II. In 2018, Nahalat Shalom's spiritual leader, Rabbi Min Kantrowitz, led a special Simchat Torah dedication service in the presence of Kathryn Karnowsky and her Jewish friends from Roswell. “My husband is from a ranching family with longtime roots in this area, and all of their ranch neighbors strongly believe it is not a hoax,” said Liakos. Both of us are scientists, and we're not shrugging it off as ridiculous.” Stubbs, a longtime resident of Roswell and former city council member, agrees with her friend. “People ask me that all the time,” said Stubbs, who remains active in politics. “With all the continued hype, I believe something must have happened. A lot of people come here to find out, but no one has the answer. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A private investigator working on the Amy Bradley case claims he has bombshell new evidence. On November 14, 2025, PI Jim Carey revealed that an ex-cop demanded $50,000 ransom to locate the missing woman. Netflix's “Amy Bradley Is Missing” documentary reportedly omitted crucial details about this shocking revelation. The case involves a police clerk from Curaçao who signed an Interpol contract for Amy's safe return. They worked with Interpol to arrange the exchange. In June 2000, Interpol drafted a contract for Amy's safe release, and Goilo signed it. However, when agents arrived with a cashier's check, everything fell apart. The family couldn't carry $50,000 onto an island legally. The deal collapsed, and decades of mystery followed. When Carey, his son Brodie, and two investigators traveled to Curaçao in October 2024, they confronted Goilo again. He claimed Amy was still alive but “a very different woman.” Goilo stated she was hooked on drugs and last seen in 2016. Carey says they gave Goilo multiple chances to come clean during their confrontation. It missed potential leads about the ransom deal and police involvement. This has created controversy around the documentary's completeness. He relies on GoFundMe donations to fund his ongoing investigation. He believes several critical leads remain unexplored by official channels. The involvement of a police clerk suggests possible corruption. This could explain why the investigation faced obstacles in Curaçao. Some images bear a striking resemblance to Amy Bradley. Every year at Christmas and Thanksgiving, someone logs onto the campaign website from Bridgetown, Barbados. This pattern suggests someone is monitoring the investigation closely. The Amy Bradley case remains one of America's most haunting unsolved mysteries. The newly revealed $50,000 ransom deal adds a troubling layer to this decades-long investigation. Despite official declarations, dedicated investigators continue pursuing leads that suggest she may still be alive. Private investigator Jim Carey revealed a failed $50,000 ransom deal. A Curaçao police clerk named Herman Goilo signed an Interpol contract for Amy's return in 2000. The deal collapsed when he demanded cash instead of a check. No, the documentary omitted this crucial information entirely. He finds the documentary incomplete regarding key investigative leads. The primary theory suggests she was trafficked by a cruise ship band member. She may have been moved through a Caribbean trafficking network. Yes, the case remains open with an active $25,000 FBI reward. The case was officially declared dead in 2010 but investigations persist. Herman Goilo refused to accept a cashier's check from Interpol agents. He then broke into their hotel room searching for the money, ending negotiations. iNews covers the latest and most impactful stories across entertainment, business, sports, politics, and technology, from AI breakthroughs to major global developments.
