                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A funny thing happened to the U.S. in what they thought was going to be a 1-0 victory over Trinidad & Tobago on May 7, 1989. Thirty-six years ago, Wednesday, on  Nov. 19, 1989, the U.S. men's national team, qualified for its first World Cup in 40 years by defeating host Trinidad & Tobago in the final qualifier for Italia 90. A funny thing happened to the U.S. in what they thought was going to be a 1-0 victory over Trinidad & Tobago on May 7, 1989. They gave up the tying goal in the waning minutes, a goal that almost came back to haunt them. Instead of walking away with two points, the Americans had to split them with their rivals from the Caribbean. Trinidad's Brian Williams took control and knocked a long pass toward Hudson Charles, who ran into opened space, drawing defender Trittschuh with him. Two players raced for the ball – U.S. captain Mike Windischmann with an outstretched foot and Trinidad forward Marlon Morris, who got there first to gently head it to Charles, who had only goalkeeper Dvid Vanole to beat. “We kind of had a letdown,” Trittschuh said. We weren't tired, but I could feel us letting down.” It was still early and the U.S. got an opportunity to redeem itself against Guatemala in New Britain, Conn. on June 17 – a 2-1 victory behind goals by Eric Eichmann and Bruce Murray. “I think even if we had tied this game, it would have been disappointing.” Costa Rica (3-2-1, seven) led with Guatemala (1-2, two), Trinidad & Tobago (0-2-1, one) and El Salvador (0-0-0, 0) trailing. Next up was El Salvador on July 9 (“It's going to be like hell going down to El Salvador in July,” U.S. forward Bruce Murray said) – or so everyone thought. The Americans' July 25 match in El Salvador was postponed until Sept. 17, to be played at a neutral site in Tegucigalpa, Honduras because of unruly fans stopped El Salvador's qualifier on June 25 with Costa Rica. The Ticos enjoyed a 4-2 advantage with six minutes remaining. Fans from the capacity crowd of 50,000 threw fruits, bottles and pennants onto the field to protest their team's poor performance. Meola had acquitted himself well in the Marlboro Cup, an exhibition tournament, against the Peru national team and Benfica (Portugal). The U.S. could not have planned the worst time for a scoring drought, playing host Guatemala on Oct. 8 and El Salvador at the St. Louis Soccer Park on Nov. 5 to back-to-back scoreless draws. The U.S. (3-1-2, eight) remained in third place behind Costa Rica (5-2-1, 11), which clinched a berth with the result, and Trinidad & Tobago 3-1-3, nine). “It feels like a loss,” said Murray, who had two of the best scoring chances for the U.S. during a five-second span in the first half, but goalkeeper Ricardo Piccinini made a pair of bang-bang saves on point-blank shots. We're going to need them for the stretch run.” “The most depressing thing about it was we have an incentive for Italia '90, they didn't.” For a team eliminated in September and rebuilt within the past couple of weeks, Guatemala (1-4-1, three) acquitted itself quite well. There wasn't much local interest in this match, as one newspaper headlined the game “Futbol de la consolacion” — consolation soccer. Although ticket prices were as low as 80 cents, $2 and $3.20, a crowd of only 4,723 turned up at the 45,000 seat Estadio Nacional Mateo Flores that featured a field better suited for growing rice than playing soccer because of torrential rain the past several weeks. El Salvador, which had been eliminated, brought in what was an experimental team, played the Americans to a scoreless tie.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You may have thought Qatar and Russia were tournament lows. You didn't account for the US president and his Fifa soulmate, Gianni Infantino “It's very clear,” claimed haunted Fifa cue-ball Gianni Infantino not so long ago, “that politics should stay out of football and football should stay out of politics.” But is it clear? On Monday, the worst man in world sport was – yet again – to be found in the Oval Office, this time nodding along to Trump's declaration that games could be moved from host cities for next summer's World Cup if the US president deems there's “a problem” with security or that the cities are non-compliant in some other way. In practice, that seems to mean if they're run by a Democrat/“communist”. How could we have ended up with an even bigger horror in charge of world football's governing body than the various ones who went before? When Sepp Blatter was thrown from a moving gravy train in 2015 amid an explosive corruption scandal, it would have felt like a genuine feat of sporting excellence to have beaten his record for craven awfulness. Back in May, he attended the US president's Middle East peace summit, causing him to be so late for Fifa's own congress that even Uefa accused him of prioritising “private political interests” and staged a delegate walk-out. He spent yesterday grinning along while Trump announced things such as the possible ordering of “strikes” on one of the US's 2026 World Cup co-host nations, Mexico. Back then, in January, Infantino looked like a competition winner. It used to be host governments that got co-opted into Fifa's supra-national edicts – I remember South Africa being forced to set up highly dubious “Fifa World Cup Courts” for errant fans during the 2010 tournament. But now Fifa is a wholly owned tool of whoever will have it. Like all parasites, it relies on its host organisms. Football fans considering buying expensive tickets and making even more expensive travel arrangements should consider that they are journeying somewhere so apparently volatile that even its own president talks its safety down. Or, indeed, watching no match at all, because Seattle's mayor has been deemed less politically acceptable than anyone connected to the leadership of the last two host countries, Qatar and Russia. Which, by way of a reminder, were not actually even democracies. Or as Trump's White House World Cup taskforce head, nepo gimp Andrew Giuliani, put it on Monday, the next World Cup could only have happened because of Trump's “vision”, and is going to be “one of the greatest cultural events in world history”. Infantino went with different superlatives, promising that it would be “the greatest and most inclusive World Cup ever”. If you ever hear the word inclusive in what amounts to an advert, you can be sure someone's about to get done over or excluded – and in this case, would you believe, it's the fans. No doubt Infantino is patting himself on the back for all this. But his true achievement – so far – is presiding over an era in which “sportswashing” stopped being some niche critical term of art, and became something that all football fans know the minute they see it. As for that peace prize, please don't limit yourself to thinking it will be annual. So there is every chance Trump could win it again before next summer's World Cup kicks off. It's all thanks to the least political man in world sport – or certainly, the least sporting man in world politics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England have been eliminated from the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in spectacular fashion, losing 4-0 against Austria in the round of 16. At the Aspire Zone in Qatar, where the world's best teenage players have been performing for the past couple of weeks, England proved no match for an Austria side enjoying what is already their country's best ever performance at this age-restricted tournament. Then came Rodriguez's red card, which handed Austria an advantage they made sure to fully take. Johannes Moser doubled the lead from the penalty spot after 70 minutes, before adding an Austrian third less than 10 minutes later. As England collapsed, the fourth goal came from defender Ifeanyi Ndukwe in the closing stages, tapping in on the line after Porter had saved an initial attempt. Based at Red Bull Salzburg feeder club FC Liefering, Johannes Moser scored twice to help fire Austria in the quarter-finals, where they will face Japan. The 17-year-old midfielder was playing regularly at frst-team level in Austria's second tier prior to this tournament and his 2025 is only getting better. Lyon's Alejandro Gomes Rodriguez was guilty of missing a hatful of chances in England's shock opening group stage defeat to Venezuela, ironically the country he switched allegiance from to play for the Young Lions, and was again at the centre of things for the wrong reasons here. His dismissal, the result of a late challenge on Austrian goalkeeper Daniel Posch, wasn't the only reason England are out of the tournament. But it certainly didn't help, coming at a poor time right after falling behind with almost half the game still left to play.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States and Uruguay square off in an international friendly today. The Uruguayans, led by Marcelo Bielsa, have been on a strong run, remaining unbeaten in their last five matches. They secured a 0-0 draw against Mexico in their last outing, showcasing their defensive prowess. The USMNT, on the other hand, is dealing with injuries, missing key players like Tyler Adams, Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie. The USMNT has shown improvement under Mauricio Pochettino, extending their unbeaten run to five games against World Cup-bound teams. However, they were thrashed by Uruguay in their last meeting at the 2024 Copa América, losing 0-1. Urugauy is favored to win the match. Uruguay is the team to back in their international friendly against the United States today. Given Uruguay's defensive strength and the USMNT's injury issues, a low-scoring game is likely.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The final day of qualifications for the 2026 World Cup is a true whirlwind of tension and mathematical calculations, with qualification hanging by a thread in many groups across Europe and CONCACAF. The complex combinations of results and goal differences promise an unforgettable outcome for this group stage. The matches between Scotland-Denmark and Austria-Bosnia-Herzegovina are decisive. Scotland absolutely must beat Denmark to qualify directly, while a draw would suffice for the Danes to qualify. Similarly, Bosnia-Herzegovina must win in Vienna against Austria, who would qualify for the World Cup with a draw. These encounters are the epitome of "all or nothing". On the other hand, nations like Spain (against Turkey) and Switzerland (against Kosovo) have almost secured their place in the next round. These two countries must avoid a defeat by six goals or more, a scenario their opponents find unlikely. The Belgians, who face Liechtenstein, only need a victory to qualify. The CONCACAF zone is not lacking in excitement, with three direct qualifying spots and playoff spots still up for grabs. The second direct qualifying spot will be contested between Jamaica and Curaçao. The calculation is simpler: Jamaica must win to qualify, while Curaçao can settle for a draw. Haiti is in a similar situation: if both teams win, it must win by at least two goals more than Honduras. Attention is also focused on the Middle East, where the final phase of Asian qualifications is taking place. After a 1-1 draw in the first leg, everything is still possible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team don't play a competitive fixture until their World Cup opener next June, but for Mauricio Pochettino, any meeting with Marcelo Bielsa, his “hero” who is in charge of Uruguay, carries far more weight than another meaningless friendly. Midnight had long since passed when there was a knock on the door of Pochettino's family home one night in 1987. By the time he had made it to Pochettino's hometown of Murphy, driving past the city limits sign which describes itself as “Ambassadors of Good Soccer,” it was 2 a.m. Pochettino's parents welcomed Bielsa in on the condition that he not wake up a sleeping Mauricio. “They came up to my room,” Pochettino recalled years later, “lifted up the duvet and Marcelo said, ‘He has the makings of a footballer. '” And so began a relationship which is stretching towards its fourth decade. Bielsa would oversee Pochettino's blossoming into a talented center back at Newell's. It was Bielsa who then handed Pochettino his first senior call-up for Argentina. After hanging up his boots, the former Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea boss would model his entire managerial philosophy on the transformative pressing style that Bielsa has implemented throughout an itinerant coaching career, which has now led him to Uruguay's national team. Bielsa wins the Argentine top-flight at Newell's Old Boys with Pochettino in defense Bielsa and Pochettino reach the Copa Libertadores final with Newell's Bielsa becomes manager of Pochettino's Espanyol team in La Liga Bielsa gives Pochettino his first international call-up for Argentina Pochettino faces Bielsa as a manager for the first time with Espanyol vs. When he wasn't hailing his team for playing their part in a bench-emptying brawl against Paraguay, Pochettino spent much of his pre-Uruguay press conference lauding Bielsa. I cannot consider him like another normal person. “I speak with him like a man that you admire, is your hero,” he said. “He's this type of person that you wait [to] talk. “And in the same time, we are going to suffer because all the team under Marcelo's management are so tough to play.” Uruguay are one of the outside favorites for next summer's World Cup, adopting a full-throttle style which has earned notable victories over Brazil and Argentina during the qualification process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinity Rodman explains how she's leading by example for the USWNT after a 2-0 win over Brazil. ESPN sought answers from general managers (or the equivalent highest-ranking soccer executives on each team) across the league in our second annual anonymous GM survey. GMs were granted anonymity in order to speak freely about sensitive topics ranging from rule-breaking and their concerns with the salary cap, to grading league leadership and discussing the league's relationship with the U.S. Soccer Federation. While there was widespread agreement on some topics, their reasons for optimism and worry are wide-ranging. The NWSL imposes a hard salary cap on each of its teams, in stark contrast with top European leagues such as those in England, France and Spain. Two even said it needs to be abolished entirely. Competition from abroad, the GMs surveyed said, is currently only from a handful of teams, led by Chelsea and OL Lyonnes. One GM summarized that group as the perennial UEFA Champions League quarterfinalists. But the recent losses of USWNT stalwarts Naomi Girma and Alyssa Thompson to Chelsea furthered their concerns. "I'm worried that more dominoes will fall," one general manager said. The next domino might be falling sooner than expected, too, as Trinity Rodman's contract expires next month with the Washington Spirit, and interest from European clubs is at an all-time high. Rodman told ESPN's Futbol W earlier this year that she "always thought about playing overseas at some point in my career," and "it's just a matter of when." Yet negotiations with the Spirit have stalled because of cap restraints. "Right now, top talent is going only one way," another GM said. "We're not seeing that the other way around. One GM who expressed concern that the salary cap could hold the league back also worried that abolishing it would create "a bubble that could be dangerous for all of us." This GM did note that the NWSL must compete better "against that handful of teams in Europe that right now could pretty much pick any player they want and offer an amount that it would be crazy for us to offer." Another GM said, "we risk the game imploding" if spending grows too quickly, noting that European teams' "cost versus revenue is way out of balance." Two GMs defended the salary cap and said the NWSL would become one of the European leagues that NWSL execs criticize -- but "with not even an interest because there's no relegation," one said. That GM added that it would be "impossible" to reverse the decision if the salary cap were abolished. "I'm not in favor of abolishing it," another GM said, adding that instead, there should be regular reevaluation of the cap every 18-24 months. "It shouldn't be knee-jerk reactions -- every time a player leaves we say we have to look at the cap." For much of the league's history NWSL teams could -- and, in plenty of cases, did -- trade players within the league without consent. Several GMs also pointed out that it brings the NWSL in line with the global norm where players approve transfers. "I think any human should have a voice on where they're going to play and live," another GM said. The flip side is, a different GM said, is that  "We also get forced as GMs to move players who are under contract on our team. Clubs are further hamstrung in those situations, a different GM said, because "We've lost a lot of trade capital. No draft picks available, allocation money phasing out -- when you have fewer things to trade, all of that impacts the ability to make these deals." Another GM said teams now must better educate players on why they won't make a transfer. "We want to honor that as much as possible if a player doesn't want to be in that environment anymore -- for whatever reason. But there have been situations where it's almost the players are confused about not just allowing them to leave when it doesn't make sense from the club's perspective." Four GMs said that teams are not breaking rules -- up from just one saying it last year. One pointed out an issue we heard last year about how much confusion there is about what the rules actually prohibit: "I think rules are changing quickly, and I think not everybody knows what the rules are -- and that goes for the clubs and the league." Another GM said rule-breaking can be relatively minor: "The league has a couple rules where you say, why does it matter? Those are the types of rules where we know factually people are breaking the rules and it doesn't sound right, but I'm not going to turn a club in because they are buying dinner for people." Others, however, claim more egregious rule-breaking is happening. One GM added "there's a lot of questions around how some teams are bringing in the players that they have or are bringing in." I can't sign them because clubs are willing to break the rules and I'm not," a different GM said. Still some GMs noted better compliance, with one adding: "The league's interventions have been helpful. Before, I was very convinced that people were actively cheating. I feel like that has decreased significantly or potentially kind of gone away for the most part. Under Berman's leadership, valuations of NWSL clubs have gone up from $35m to over $250m, and the league signed a $240 million media rights deal (which includes ESPN). The league also ratified a new, long-term CBA last year ahead of schedule. "I think that she's navigated a very challenging time in the league's history for a variety of reasons," one GM said. That business vs. sporting dichotomy led to wide-ranging opinions in our survey. "There is a tremendous amount of focus on the commercial side and less focus on the sporting side," one GM said. Another GM said Berman's "intention and motivation and ambition for the league is absolutely right," but that they want to see more of "her openness and willingness to look at the league a little different from a sporting aspect." A different GM wants to see more collaborative decision-making. The NWSL's front office lost multiple executives this year, including the departure of chief sporting director Tatjana Haenni and chief marketing and commercial officer Julie Haddon. Berman was hired -- and recently rehired, with a new contract -- by those owners, who are ultimately the bosses of the GMs. And arguably the most important part of Berman's job is aligning a historically divided boardroom rather than making unilateral decisions. One GM complimented Berman's "unique insight and ability to coalesce a group of owners to move the league forward." Another said that Berman is simply the front-facing person for decisions made in the boardroom and this GM "tries to detach all things NWSL challenges from one person, although it's easy to fire shots at the leader." A different GM complimented Berman's tenure, comparing the job of commissioner to that of a goalkeeper: People only talk about them when something goes wrong. "Sometimes we should look 10 years backward and see how much has been done," they said. Berman said repeatedly throughout this year that the NWSL can, one day, be as big as the NFL, which has 32 teams. She recently softened that stance, saying that she wasn't "intending to state we're going to have 32 teams by some date." Most said that they could not provide an ideal number of teams due to the uncertainty around other factors like player development pipelines. The most common answer, listed by three GMs, was 20 teams. "Thirty-two is such an American thing," one GM said. It doesn't need to be 32 just because all the men's sports are. Others cited the addition of the USL Super League and Canada's Northern Super League, and how it is getting more difficult to fill out rosters. GMs were surveyed long before Atlanta was announced as the NWSL's 17th team, set to begin play in 2028, and it makes sense given that many of those polled have always been fond of the market's potential. "It's a soccer city, and they've got everything facility-wise," one GM said. Cincinnati, which was one of three finalists for the 2026 expansion slot that ultimately went to Denver, was the next most common answer. One GM said that "they should move Louisville to Cincinnati." One GM who voted for Cincinnati stressed the increasing importance of facilities. They were at the top in so many of these metrics a couple years ago, but being the third or fourth tenant [Snapdragon Stadium also hosts MLS side San Diego FC, college football's San Diego State Aztecs and other big events], I think that's the root of some of their challenges." Last year, there was a prevailing feeling among GMs that player power had "gone too far," to the point that staff couldn't properly do their jobs. This year, six general managers believe that those concerns were at least partly heard by the NWSL, although some "yes" answers were couched as "slightly." Two GMs specifically pushed back that teams need to take responsibility: "I think how that's managed internally is the most important thing," one said. "We're at a point right now where somebody can anonymously report something and they could say whatever they want, make whatever accusation. If it's just unfounded and aimed at ill will, there's nothing that happens to the player." The most common complaint centers around the NWSL's semiannual player surveys, which have always existed in the league and ask players to anonymously score their satisfaction with all aspects of their clubs. Those results might impact staffing decisions within clubs when it comes to the feedback received from players about coaching and/or team personnel. Several GMs said that the language of those surveys has been misleading in the past, but that improvements were made this year. One GM was particularly frustrated that similar language was initially used this year before further complaints led to change. Another said that the surveys are "sent at a time when if people are not being re-signed or playing a lot, it's easy to point the finger. Overall, however, feelings around the topic were far more restrained this year. A different GM also made a point to say that they disagreed with last year's prevailing frustrations from GMs, noting that players had endured horrible treatment in certain environments in the past, and "there's a reason" that such measures are in place. Another GM added that Kansas City's marketing and investment could be a blueprint for other markets: "They vomited teal everywhere and you just can't get away from it." Gotham FC also received plaudits for its smart executives and "not allowing [money] to be a crutch" in the country's most expensive market. Forthcoming expansion side Denver was name-dropped by one GM who was impressed with their plans to build a stadium and training facility. Angel City was named by one GM purely based on being "this commercial beast." Chicago Stars FC was the most common answer. But one GM took aim at recent expansion sides Utah Royals and Bay FC, who they say wasted a clean slate and major advantages like extra cash when they joined in 2024: "When you see the amount of money they spent on transfer fees and players, and what I call an advantage from their start, a fresh start, I wouldn't have bet that they would be in those positions in the standings." Racing Louisville FC's attendance struggles were brought up by the two GMs that chose them, with one saying "it's just a tough, tough market" to attract top players. One GM gave an emphatic "a thousand percent" yes to the need, because "the gap's massive" now between college players and pro-ready players. "I question the order of priorities," said one GM who still voted "yes." Another GM is "concerned that things weren't thought through," and the NWSL needs to "focus on what our actual product is" first. "Who pays for it is the big question," said a different GM, who suggested that an outside equity group could be a solution. "If players don't play on a Saturday or Sunday for a couple weeks, where are they getting that game time?" according to another GM who said "We need more meaningful competitions" like cup games. I couldn't name five players who would want to play in it." It's just a big part of our culture here. Another GM said there needs to be "a cohesive plan" between the NCAA and NWSL. A colleague said the elimination of the draft has led to increased spending on scouting, while a different GM said teams initially paid "a ton of money to get kids out of college" without knowing how they would play as pros. I think teams now will just go and get players from elsewhere that are probably at the level instead of taking the time [to develop]." Several GMs clarified that they want the new first-division USL Super League to be a partner or that "it should be a partner," with many GMs citing the number of NWSL players who have been loaned to Super League teams. "I wouldn't use the word partner," one GM said when pressed to label what sounded like that description. Their biggest issue with creating a partnership is that they have found that Super League teams are not always willing to cover the entire salary of a player the NWSL team wants to loan out, which leaves the NWSL team with a salary cap hit and doesn't help them financially. Those who viewed it as a competitor cited that term more literally, since the Super League is also sanctioned as a first division. "They're positioning themselves that way," one GM said. "I don't view it that way at all. Another GM wants to see actual competition between the leagues: "We should have some kind of cup competition with them. The federation would pull players from their clubs even outside of FIFA international windows -- including several weeks in advance of major tournaments. Those dynamics caused regular tension with NWSL teams, but the strategy paid off with the U.S. winning World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019. However, "the script has flipped," as one GM said, because NWSL teams are now paying the USWNT stars directly. "Now, we're making real investment in players where we as clubs feel protective over our players' health, loading, all these things. Half the grades issued in our survey were 4 or higher, indicating general satisfaction with how Hayes and her USWNT staff worked with NWSL clubs. "They are doing a tremendous job by trying to meet with everyone," one general manager said. "I try to connect with every national team, even where we don't have players, and I can tell you that sometimes we have to be more proactive. A different person said that Hayes has helped the NWSL by "encouraging people to know that your club play matters," referencing the high volume of first-time call-ups. "Four and trending upwards," another GM said, noting that Hayes started right before an Olympics and won it while also trying to plan the program's future. "I think when people judge things, they always look at what's happening right this second. Still, others felt there was room for improvement. Two general managers said the USWNT staff deserves high marks for intent, but they felt execution could be better, including more direct contact with Hayes. A handful of GMs also expressed concerns about the trend of top USWNT players going to Europe, with one GM saying that "continuing to really advocate for our players' development within our league is something I'd really love to see from our USWNT coach." Hayes said recently that players make individual choices and that her role is to ask the right questions rather than steer a player in any direction. Three GMs pointed out that the recent retirements of Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe have left a void in stardom in the NWSL. "They were really the needle-movers," one person said. "I think there's a massive gap right now. Historically, it's been those national team players that get the most attention. We say you can be soccer-famous and famous-famous. I don't know if we have any famous NWSLers right now. USWNT forward Alyssa Thompson just left the league. Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson have also been on maternity leave. The one candidate to become a megastar, five GMs said, is Rodman. But Rodman is out of contract with the Spirit at the end of this year, and she has publicly talked about playing in Europe one day. She could well be the next to head overseas. A common complaint among general managers is that the league and its clubs fail at storytelling. Three GMs pointed to how much better the WNBA has been at storytelling and building a media presence. "What the WNBA has done -- I don't watch basketball and names are flooding my world," one said. "The growth of the WNBA has been exactly what we need, this coverage and storytelling of our elite athletes and elite personalities," another person added. "This is about us, not I, and while I believe that marquee players are instrumental in growth, I think we also have to be mindful of the pressure that that puts on an athlete," one GM said. Two others also said that player-driven fandom is unsustainable. "I believe that clubs should be the face of the league, because players will always come and go," one GM said, noting that player-driven fandom might provide a short boost but not "long-term, sustainable growth." The NWSL was founded by U.S. Soccer in late 2012 to provide USWNT players with a strong domestic league. The gamble paid off with World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019, though recent moves by Thompson and Girma to Chelsea reignited questions about USWNT players leaving the NWSL. "I'm not worried about it," one person said. I think we spend a lot of time talking about it. I don't think it's great for our league, but I don't think it's something that we should spend so much time fighting against. If they can make more money, if there's a huge transfer fee paid for them that drives our game forward, it is what it is." A different GM said they are not worried, pointing out that the migration of players to Europe is often cyclical and happens during this gap between the Olympics and World Cup. They cited examples like Lindsey Heaps, Morgan and Tobin Heath all going overseas at different points of previous eras. But one GM is worried that "it's not going to stop" -- they felt the salary cap is part of the issue and that "we're at a crossroads" with the push and pull of Europe. A different GM is worried because "If we want to be the best league in the world, then those players should stay." What many GMs want to see is top players from Europe joining the NWSL -- and that isn't happening frequently enough for them. "We were talking to a top, top player from Europe who was willing to take a pay cut in this last window, and the pay cut would have had to have been so significant that she couldn't justify it," one GM said. "Players are even willing to take a little less salary [to play here], but we're talking about taking a third off their salary." So, we asked them to order these eight leagues -- which we chose as a small sampling of global competitions -- from best to worst, and we let them interpret that as they saw fit. "We have a grass is greener situation" where players in one league want to try the other but might realize it isn't any better, one GM said. Added another general manager, who also voted for the WSL: "We can't just keep saying we're the best. One person said France and Spain are "heading in the wrong direction," while someone else said they've seen "no growth" from those leagues. "I see Lyonnes win 8-1 and they played their second team," a third GM said. Multiple GMs praised Mexico for its investments in growth and visibility. While Japan finished last in these rankings, several GMs said that they might have the best administration of any league, and they complimented the WE League's player development. "That's why their transfer fees are going to be so high," one GM said, while another rated Japan fifth and said there is a lack of appreciation for the style of play there. The desire for top Spanish players continued this year, although answers to this question were far more diverse than they were in 2024. Alexia Putellas, two-time Ballon d'Or and FIFA Best winner, was not named by anyone this year. Both those players tied for first last year with four mentions apiece. Now, "Everyone wants to see [Aitana] Bonmatí here," one GM said. "She's so smart, talented and creative," another added. "She just makes every single person around her better. So, I'd like her on my team in the league, but I'd like her in the league." It's no surprise that reigning MVP and Golden Boot winner Temwa Chawinga (who might win both awards again) is top of mind. "This is tough, because I want to say Chawinga, but I actually think that Chawinga changes the way her teams play, and I wouldn't want my team to do that -- but it's so enticing," said one GM, who thought out the hypothetical scenario aloud in real time. A few GMs reasoned not to take Chawinga because of that concern, but this GM came around in their own thought process. USWNT forward Sophia Wilson, who recently gave birth to her first child and is an impending free agent, tied Chawinga atop the list. "Soph has all of those things [of a Chawinga] and then she can take you off the dribble," one general manager said. If Sam Coffey was Spanish, she would have been. For some reason -- Spanish player or not -- we all have our culture and we expect that from a player in that country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA secured a concession from the White House as President Donald Trump announced that match ticket-holders for next summer's World Cup will have access to advanced appointments for tourist visas at U.S. overseas consulates — but FIFA's respite was short-lived as Trump warned host cities including Seattle and Los Angeles may be in danger of having their games relocated due to “safety” concerns. In an extraordinary conference alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino in the Oval Office, in which the World Cup trophy took pride of place, Trump also said he would be prepared to launch “strikes” in 2026 World Cup co-hosts Mexico due to concerns about drug trafficking. Trump and Infantino were joined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. The event was principally called to announce the new FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (FIFA Pass) but Trump press conferences inevitably end up in different places and this one also encompassed the Epstein files and U.S.-Venezuela relations. This threatens to impact fans of nations who have already qualified for the World Cup. For some of the nations competing in the tournament, including many in Europe, as well as Japan, South Korea and Australia, access should be easier as they are part of a visa waiver program — ESTA — to enter the U.S. This system means citizens of these countries can travel without obtaining a visa, so long as their trip for tourism or business does not exceed 90 days; however, those traveling from many possible contending nations for the World Cup do require visas. This includes Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay, among many other Latin American nations, as well as large swathes of the Middle East and Africa. The cause was helped by $50million set aside “to reduce passport backlogs and reduce visa wait times” in a bill signed into law by President Biden in March 2024. At the World Cup in Qatar, visitors were able to expedite their entry into the gulf state by applying for a Hayya card, which was effectively a fan pass for World Cup ticket-holders that doubled up as the visa for the tournament. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated: “The United States is offering prioritized appointments so FIFA World Cup fans can complete their visa interviews and show they qualify.” He warned “a ticket is not a visa and it doesn't guarantee admission to the U.S.” but said those who apply with a ticket could get an interview within “six to eight weeks”. However, applicants will still be subject to the same level of stringent vetting, questioning and security clearances as any other individuals seeking to enter the country. The Athletic has reported previously that the U.S. government, even under President Biden, had been loathe to make any more concessions for FIFA, and officials, speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to talk publicly, had pointed out it was unrealistic to expect the U.S. to follow the lead of countries such as Qatar or Russia, because, they argued, those countries are not deemed globally to be desirable places for people to seek permanent residence. Regardless, it marked a concession of sorts for FIFA and a possible good news story for Infantino. Trump was asked about the new mayor-elect of Seattle, Katie Wilson, who is a democratic socialist. Trump said: “If we think — and I will have to speak to Gianni about this — the Mayor of L.A. is incompetent, everyone knows it…If we didn't go in early on, not only would you have had the fires but you would have had total insurrection in Los Angeles. If we didn't go in, (the police) said we could not have done it without the federal government. We have a lot of cities who would love to have it and would do it very safely. If we think there is a problem in Seattle, where there is a liberal, communist mayor… I watched her over the weekend, wow that is another ‘beauty' we have got there. Gianni, can I say we will move the event to some place it will be appreciated and safe?” We can see people have trust in the United States because we have record-breaking ticket sales. Tickets are almost two million sold already. People know they will be coming here to experience a safe and secure World Cup. This of course is the responsibility of the government and obviously we will discuss, we are working together, we must ensure all fans coming from abroad can experience a celebration of coming together of the sport and with 100 percent safety.” Trump was then asked if he had a timeline for relocations in mind given tickets are already on sale and host cities are selling sponsorship packages and any moves will impact local businesses. You have high crime and a place that just suffered great fires…so here is the story, I love Los Angeles. If they want help during this, I would love to send in the National Guard or whoever is necessary. “If we think there is going to be crime, if we are obstructed by the Governor (Gavin Newsom) — maybe he won't obstruct us — I would love for him to call and say we would like help. We want it totally safe for Gianni and FIFA. I would be honored to help California. We can be there in 24 hours and do a great job.” Asked for the message he would send to local businesses, Trump said: “Tell your governor to ask for federal help. Trump was then asked if he would launch strikes or place troops in Mexico. He said: “Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? Mexico is — look, I looked at Mexico City over the weekend, there's some big problems over there. You know, there's almost no drugs coming into our waterways anymore.” “We know the addresses of every drug lord. We know everything about every one of them. But we have lost hundreds of 1000s of people a year — death, and that's not talking about family destruction. “That's talking about death, and much of it comes through Mexico. So let me just put it this way. Earlier this month, FIFA announced that Infantino will present the inaugural ‘FIFA Peace Prize', which Trump is likely to receive, at the World Cup draw on December 5 in Washington, D.C. The award is designed to acknowledge “individuals who have helped to unite people all over the world in peace”, football's world governing body said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid striker Gonzalo Garcia is emerging as a target for Brighton and other Premier League sides - should the Spanish giants agree to loan him out in January. He went on to finish top goalscorer at the Club World Cup with four goals and one assist in six games and Madrid awarded him a new contract until 2030. He has remained a regular part of Alonso's squad and eager to prove his worth but, with competition for attacking places fierce, has made 12 appearances with 11 of those coming off the bench. That has alerted clubs such as Brighton to make soundings about whether he could be available in January. Much will depend on the fitness of Kylian Mbappe and Rodrygo while they also have Brahim Diaz but Madrid will assess closer to the window. Leeds and Sunderland showed interest in the summer but others also admire Garcia. Amid increasing speculation over his future, the Spain U21 international has been asked about his ambitions but he has remained committed to Los Blancos. 'My only option has always been to stay at Real Madrid. For me, it's a dream to be part of the first team. Madrid may yet believe though that his development in the short term could be best served getting more regular and competitive game time elsewhere.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Judging from statistics, Denmark are facing a challenging night when they clash with Scotland at Hampden Park tonight in the crucial World Cup qualifier which will determine who finishes first and second in Group C. If you delve into the statistics, it reveals that the Scottish national arena is actually a bit of a horror ground for the Danish national team, who have only one win to show for eight matches at Hampden Park throughout history. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg knows what's in store for the Danes Tuesday night at Hampden Park. "I'm really looking forward to it. On top of the disappointing result we got against Belarus, I experience a little extra motivation, where we can put things in place", says Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to Bold.dk. The Olympique Marseille defensive midfielder expects a close and even match at Hampden Park. "I expect 54,000 Scots will do everything they can to push their team towards the World Cup. After all, it is the first time since 1998 that they can secure entry to a World Cup finals", says the Danish national team captain. 29 October 1975: Scotland – Denmark 3-1. 12 May 1951: Scotland – Denmark 3-1</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said the US is creating a priority visa system for 2026 FIFA World Cup ticket holders, an effort to handle the large number of visitors expected for the soccer event. Trump on Monday touted the creation of a "prioritised appointment scheduling system" which he said would allow World Cup ticket holders facing long wait-times for visas to speed up that process. Under the initiative, led by the US State Department, fans holding a ticket purchased through FIFA would get priority access to visa interviews, according to a release from the international soccer organisation. The priority interviews are expected to be available in early 2026. Next year's World Cup, the first hosted by three countries – the US, Mexico and Canada – offers to draw large numbers of spectators, including international fans, and deliver an economic windfall to host cities. "I think safety and security is the number-one priority for a successful World Cup," said FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who joined Trump in the Oval Office Monday. An avid sports fan who has already attended numerous premier sporting events since returning to office, Trump has involved himself in the planning, regularly touting the upcoming event. While the president has said he will facilitate travel and visa access for World Cup teams, critics have expressed concerns that an immigration crackdown and efforts to expand federal policing of Democratically controlled cities will undermine that pledge. Last month, Trump threatened moving World Cup games out of Boston and the 2028 Olympics from Los Angeles if he thought the cities were not adequately prepared or if he deemed them unsafe. Trump has also sparred with the other host nations over trade, and last month cut off talks with Canada after he was angered by an ad from Ontario's government targeting his tariff policies. The president reiterated those threats on Monday and, when asked what his timeline would be for making such a decision, said that he would be willing to help cities that asked him for troops to maintain order. You know, in the case of California, you have a problem, you have high crime, then you have a place that just suffered great fires and everything else, and they didn't do a very good job," he added, referring to Los Angeles. If they want help during this, I would love to send in National Guard or whoever is necessary to help them. I'd love it to be in Los Angeles," Trump said. The draw will be held at the Kennedy Center, another institution that Trump has sought to put his mark on. The US president has long had a warm relationship with FIFA's Infantino, hosting him at the White House multiple times and earlier this year attending the FIFA Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium. That followed the 2024 opening of a FIFA office in Miami, Florida, which is home to the organisation's legal division.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RELATED | President Trump suggests cities deemed unsafe could lose FIFA World Cup matches Despite Infantino's reassurances, President Trump expressed concerns about potential issues in "liberal" cities, stating that if there is a "problem," he might consider relocating World Cup events from Seattle. President Trump then redirected the question to Infantino did not directly answer, but said safety and security were FIFA's number one priority and noted that early ticket sales indicate fans are not currently concerned about it. FIFA has contracts with 11 American cities and venues to host the games. FIFA also held multiple Club World Cup matches at Lumen Field this past summer, with no significant complaints. The Seattle World Cup Organizing Committee said on Monday it was business as usual in planning for the event, noting that it had team members in DC last week. We're working at every level of government, local, state, national, even international, on the border, to make sure this event comes off as the best event ever. And so we're super pleased with how it's all going," said Seattle World Cup Organizing Committee President Peter Tomozawa, who added that Wilson had pre-emptively reached out to his group to get more information and offer her excitement over hosting the global games. “President Trump's comments about moving the 2026 World Cup out of Seattle once again display his ignorance about our city and what we stand for," Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell stated. We are not going to be intimidated by political theatrics from the other Washington. Seattle – and the greater state of Washington - is all in on creating a memorable World Cup experience. Bob Ferguson also reacted with a statement, reading “Seattle will be an excellent host for the World Cup. My team has been working hard with the city of Seattle and our partners to make sure we're one of the best regions to host these games. I look forward to working with Mayor Wilson and her team. Wilson, who defines herself as a democratic socialist, won the Seattle mayoral race running on her platform of affordability, housing, homelessness, public safety, and transportation. SEE ALSO | Mayor-elect Katie Wilson urges unity, community, collective responsibility in Seattle Wilson's plan acknowledges Seattle's reliance on roughly $150 million in annual federal funding and outlines a proactive strategy to close potential budget gaps with progressive local revenue sources. Among her proposals is the implementation of a city-level capital gains tax, a recommendation she helped develop during her tenure on the city's 2023 Revenue Stabilization Workgroup. She plans to update and reinforce Seattle's sanctuary city policies, ensuring that city departments, including the Seattle Police Department, do not cooperate with civil immigration arrests or share data with federal agencies. Wilson's “Trump-Proof” agenda extends protections to the LGBTQ community and reproductive rights. Addressing concerns over government surveillance, Wilson plans to review how the city collects and stores data, especially any that could be accessed by hostile federal entities. She intends to strengthen surveillance ordinances and prevent SPD from using unapproved technologies acquired through other jurisdictions. Framing her policy as both defensive and forward-looking, Wilson said Seattle must “build resilient systems that protect our people and uphold our values” in uncertain national circumstances. As for questions regarding Seattle's World Cup safety, the World Cup Organizing Committee and city leaders have already assured the public that there are multiple plans in place for maintaining a safe environment.
