ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Online influencer Andrew Tate, a self-described misogynist who has millions of young male followers, was facing allegations of sex trafficking women in three countries when he and his brother left their home in Romania to visit the United States. But when the Tate brothers arrived by private plane in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, they immediately found themselves in the crosshairs of law enforcement once more, as Customs and Border Protection officials seized their electronic devices. This time, they had a powerful ally come to their aid. Interviews and records reviewed by ProPublica show a White House official told senior Department of Homeland Security officials to return the devices to the brothers several days after they were seized. In his written request, a copy of which was reviewed by ProPublica, Ingrassia chided authorities for taking the action, saying the seizure of the Tates' devices was not a good use of time or resources. Since entering office for a second term, Trump has urged the Justice Department to go after elected officials who investigated him and his businesses, and he pardoned a string of political allies. Ingrassia's intervention on behalf of Tate and his brother, Tristan, caused alarm among DHS officials that they could be interfering with a federal investigation if they followed through with the instruction, according to interviews and screenshots of contemporaneous communications between officials. “We don't want to be seen as handing out favors.” It's unclear why law enforcement wanted to examine the devices, what their analysis found or whether Ingrassia's intervention hindered any investigation. But law enforcement experts said it is highly unusual for the White House to get involved in particular border seizures or to demand authorities give up custody of potential evidence in an investigation. “I've never heard of anything like that in my 30 years working,” said John F. Tobon, a retired assistant director for Homeland Security Investigations, which typically analyzes the contents of electronic devices after they're seized by Customs and Border Protection. “For anyone to say this request is from the White House, it feels like an intimidation tactic.” Tobon said that even if authorities resisted the request from Ingrassia, knowledge that the White House opposed their actions could cause them to be less aggressive than they would normally be: “Anytime somebody feels intimidated or as if they're not free to follow procedure, that's going to stay in the back of their mind because of the consequences. “This is not something that would have been viewed as appropriate or acceptable prior to 2025,” Buell said. “There's a pattern here of severe departure from preexisting norms … that are being tossed aside left and right.” The Tate brothers' lawyer, Joseph McBride, said he didn't know what happened to the devices but that his clients have still not had them returned. He said it's unclear whether any investigation into their contents is continuing. His clients, he said, are innocent and there was no illicit materials on their electronics. “There have been multiple investigations against them and nothing has come of it,” McBride said. Ingrassia worked at McBride's firm before joining the White House, and McBride acknowledged speaking “to Paul from time to time” but couldn't recall discussing the seized devices with him. In a brief interview with ProPublica, Ingrassia denied trying to help the Tates, before hanging up. Ingrassia's lawyer, Edward Paltzik, said in a text message: “Mr. Ingrassia never ordered that the Tate Brothers' devices be returned to them, nor did he say — and nor would he have ever said — that such a directive came from the White House. When questioned about whether Ingrassia had asked authorities to return the devices, even if he did not order them to, Paltzik declined to comment, explaining that “the word ‘ask' is inappropriate because it is meaningless in this context. A DHS spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the intervention or any impact it might have had on an investigation, only saying in a statement that Customs and Border Protection “performed a 100% baggage examination and detained all electronic media devices when the Tate Brothers entered the country. Electronic media devices were detained and turned over to Homeland Security Investigators for inspectional purposes.” Ingrassia's work at McBride's small New York law firm included helping to represent the Tate brothers. He has praised Andrew Tate's “physical prowess” on social media along with his “willpower and spirit,” calling him “the embodiment of the ancient ideal of excellence.” Ethics experts said when government officials take actions to benefit former clients, it undermines public trust. “The rule of law cannot be carried out if it depends on cronyism,” said Virginia Canter, a former government ethics lawyer who served in the administrations of both parties. Trump had nominated Ingrassia to lead the Office of Special Counsel, but the 30-year-old lawyer's chances for Senate confirmation imploded after Politico reported that he had sent a string of racist text messages to fellow Republicans and described himself as having “a Nazi streak.” Paltzik, his lawyer, raised doubts about the authenticity of the texts but said “even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor.” In a post on X announcing he was withdrawing from his Senate confirmation hearing because not enough Republican lawmakers were supporting him, Ingrassia said he would “continue to serve President Trump and this administration to Make America Great Again.” Last week, Ingrassia announced he was moving to a new role within the administration, after Trump called him into his office and asked him to serve as deputy general counsel at the General Services Administration. A Homeland Security official, who asked for anonymity because they didn't have permission to speak publicly, confirmed that HSI agents scrutinized the contents. No other details have become public, and a spokesperson for the prosecutors' office declined to comment. In an interview with conservative podcaster Candace Owens soon after landing in Florida, Andrew Tate revealed his devices had been seized, saying they were taken after he refused to give customs officers his passwords. Tate, who was born in the U.S. but spent much of his childhood in Britain before moving as an adult to Romania, complained that his rights were violated, calling himself “one of the most innocent people on the planet.” And he said law enforcement officials wouldn't find anything on his devices: “You think I sleep with a phone full of evidence? You think I don't wipe my phone every night? In that interview, Tate made no mention of a White House official intervening on his behalf and seemingly misidentified state authorities in Florida as responsible for taking his devices. Ron DeSantis and state Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that Florida authorities had launched an investigation into the brothers. “These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying upon women around the world,” he said at the time. Tate moved to Romania a year after his brief foray in reality TV, in part, he said, because he believed authorities there investigate sex crimes less aggressively. But in 2023, prosecutors in Romania accused the Tates of operating a criminal group that trafficked women, including some who alleged the brothers led them to believe they were interested in relationships but instead forced them into filming online pornographic videos. Prosecutors also said they were investigating allegations that the Tates trafficked minors. Authorities there authorized a raft of charges against the brothers, including rape and human trafficking, based on allegations from three women. In 2024, arrest warrants were issued for the brothers, who have denied wrongdoing, but authorities said they would not be extradited to the United Kingdom until criminal proceedings in Romania were completed. A woman has also sued the Tates in Florida, accusing them of luring her to Romania to coerce her into sex work. The Tates have denied the allegations, and last month a judge dismissed most of her claims but allowed for her to refile. This year, Tate derided the allegations against him and compared himself to Trump on X. – Im one of the most mistreated men in history beside president Trump himself.” “I did not perceive this statement as pressure,” the foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, said, “just a repeat of a known stance.” Grenell told the Financial Times that he had “no substantive conversation” with Hurezeanu but supported “the Tate brothers as evident by my publicly available tweets.” Truthout relies on individual donations to publish independent journalism, free from political and corporate influence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain's domestic spy service, MI5, warned lawmakers on Tuesday that China's intelligence services are posing as recruiters to target people who work in Parliament, just weeks after the collapse of a case against two British nationals accused of spying for Beijing. In an alert, MI5 said that the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) was using websites like LinkedIn to build relationships with parliamentarians, in an effort to “collect sensitive information on the UK to gain strategic advantage.” Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the House of Commons, circulated the MI5 alert to Members of Parliament (MPs) and warned that Chinese state actors were “relentless” in their efforts to “interfere with our processes and influence activity at Parliament.” He listed two headhunters known to use LinkedIn profiles to “conduct outreach at scale” on behalf of Beijing. “Let me speak plainly: this activity involves a covert and calculated attempt by a foreign power to interfere with our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests, and this government will not tolerate it,” Security Minister Dan Jarvis told Parliament. The Chinese embassy in London dismissed the claims as “pure fabrication and malicious slander.” It said it had urged Britain to “stop this self-staged charade of false accusations,” which it said was undermining relations between the countries. MI5's warning comes after prosecutors last month abruptly abandoned a case against two British men charged with spying on MPs for Beijing, claiming that the government's evidence was missing a “critical element” which meant there was “no other option” but to collapse the case. That “critical element,” prosecutors claimed, was the government's refusal to call China an “enemy” or “national security threat.” Because the two men – Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, an academic – were charged under the Official Secrets Act 1911, they could only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. Downing Street said no minister, member of the government or special adviser was involved. Instead, Prime Minister Keir Starmer blamed the previous Conservative government, which was in power at the time of the alleged offenses, for wording its policies “very carefully” so as not to describe China as an enemy. US law firm with major political clients hacked in spying spree linked to China After the collapse, MI5 chief Ken McCallum said Chinese spies posed a daily national security threat to Britain. “When it comes to China, the UK needs to defend resolutely against threats and seize the opportunities that demonstrably serve our nation,” he said in his annual threat update in October. Jarvis, the security minister, said the latest attempts to use headhunters to spy on MPs “builds on a pattern” of hostile activity in recent years. He cited how Beijing-linked actors targeted parliamentarians' emails in 2021 and “attempted foreign interference activity” in 2022 by Christine Lee, a British lawyer accused by MI5 of spying for Beijing. MI5's latest warning comes weeks before the government must decide whether to approve a huge new Chinese embassy in London. “What message does it send when, despite an attack on this House and our Parliament, ministers are happily jetting off to stride down red carpets with the government responsible?” Kearns said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Critics accuse the US president of trying to ‘shut women journalists up' with ‘demeaning language' While the remark did not initially get much attention, it picked up some traction on Tuesday and has drawn backlash from fellow journalists, including some who have previously been attacked by Trump themselves. As Lucey started to ask why Trump was behaving the way he was “if there's nothing incriminating in the files”, Trump pointed at her and said: “Quiet. “Disgusting and completely unacceptable,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper wrote on X, sharing a clip of the incident. Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson also called the remark “disgusting and degrading”. The White House Correspondents' Association, which has released statements in the past defending journalists who faced attack from Trump, did not respond to requests for comment. Alicia Machado, who won the Miss Universe pageant in 1996, has said that Trump once called her “Miss Piggy” and told her to lose weight. April Ryan, a longtime White House correspondent, was referred to as “Miss Piggy” by Trump administration official Lynne Patton in 2018 – though Patton apologized for the remark. (Trump himself called Ryan a “loser” who “doesn't know what the hell she's doing” that same year.) That also shows how upset he is about the Epstein files. Speaking rhetorically, she said to Trump: “Be careful how you call people names when you are in the pig pen yourself getting ready to go up for the slaughter.” “President Trump's targeting of women journalists is nothing new,” she said. “His appearance-based insults are gendered attacks meant to shut women journalists up. “While name-calling may seem harmless, coming from the head of our government, it often sets in motion a torrent of abuse towards the journalist, which not only impacts her ability to work, but also sends a chilling message to other women journalists who are confronting him with hard-hitting questions.” Asked for comment about Trump's insult, a White House official blamed Lucey. “This reporter behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional way towards her colleagues on the plane,” the person claimed, offering no evidence for this allegation.</p>

Wilson, who identifies as a democratic socialist, took part in an election against incumbent Mayor Bruce Harrell two weeks ago. Infantino, who took part in the meeting, responded by saying fans would “experience a safe and secure World Cup.” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said her agencies are “communicating with all these mayors about what their responsibilities are.” Despite Trump's suggestion that Seattle would be unappreciative of the games, Seattle is considered the 13th best city when it comes to sports in the U.S., outranking Chicago, Baltimore, Houston, and more, according to an analysis from WalletHub. “People care less about labels than results,” the mayor-elect wrote in a Bluesky post on Friday. “I was elected on the promise that all Seattle citizens should have access to a dignified life, regardless of their background or income.” Within the platform outlined on her campaign website, Wilson calls for Trump-proofing the city — including sustaining vital services amid potential federal cuts “by raising new progressive revenue,” protecting immigrants and refugees from threats of deportation, defending LGBTQ communities, preserving reproductive rights, and more. Trump has threatened to slash federal funding to several cities with left-leaning leadership, including New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral election earlier this month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>María Corina Machado pens a ‘freedom manifesto' as plan to force Nicolás Maduro from power remains unclear Venezuela's top opposition leader, the Nobel laureate María Corina Machado, has declared her country “at the edge of a new era” as Donald Trump refused to rule out a ground invasion to topple its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, but also signalled he was open to talks. Machado, who has lived in hiding since her movement's candidate was widely believed to have beaten Maduro in last year's presidential election, made her claim in a “freedom manifesto” that was published on Tuesday as uncertainty continued to shroud the South American country's future. A new Venezuela is emerging from the ashes, renewed in spirit and united in purpose, like a phoenix reborn – fierce, radiant, and unstoppable,” wrote Machado, who claims to have a plan for the first 100 hours and 100 days after Maduro leaves power. Machado, who has not provided specific details of those plans, claimed a change of regime would protect Venezuela from “future oppressive tyrannies, dictatorships, and despots” and create a country where government opponents could “walk from the shadows without dread”. She predicted Venezuela was poised for a “rebirth” after years of economic chaos, environmental destruction, violence and a mass exodus that has seen an estimated 8 million Venezuelans flee overseas. But such claims have been made many times before and it remains unclear how Machado and her allies plan to fulfil their longstanding quest to force Maduro, who has ruled since 2013, from power. Since August, Trump has ordered a massive naval buildup off Venezuela's northern coast, seemingly hoping to spark a military rebellion against Maduro or convince him to quit. So far, however, there has been no inkling of a split in Maduro's regime and Trump has yet to pull the trigger on further military action. Speculation that Trump was poised to order airstrikes on Venezuela reached fever pitch last weekend. “Lots of people – even high up in the opposition … were convinced that it was about to happen, that bombs were about to fall,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for the International Crisis Group, adding: “[But] the bombs didn't fall.” Some observers read that move as an ultimatum for Maduro to decide on his future within the week. “But we know that for Trump these deadlines don't mean a lot. On Monday, Trump refused to dismiss the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Venezuela – and said he didn't “rule out anything” – but also anticipated negotiating with Maduro. Given Trump's well-known aversion to sending US troops abroad, many suspect that even if Maduro is removed – and key opposition leaders can fly home from exile – the new US-backed government will struggle to control a potentially volatile security situation or the start of an insurgency.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saab's GlobalEye proposal comes on top of its previous pitch to create Canadian jobs if Ottawa buys the Gripen fighter jet, shown here in Lindköping, Sweden, last week.Felix Odell/The Globe and Mail Swedish defence company Saab is intensifying its campaign to secure Canadian aircraft sales by offering to build the entire GlobalEye military surveillance plane in Canada if the Department of National Defence orders it. “We are offering a made-in-Canada solution by building and installing the plane's sensors there,” he said. The plane, minus its interior fittings, is flown to Linköping, where it is completely stripped down and rebuilt into an airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) plane with an array of highly sophisticated radar and sensors. The jobs created, he said, would include those in aircraft maintenance and development. This offer comes on top of Saab's previous pitch to generate 10,000 new Canadian jobs if DND were to buy the Saab Gripen fighter jet, which would be entirely built in Canada. The new factory could also make Gripens for Ukraine, whose President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has said he wants 100 to 150 of the jets. The GlobalEye military surveillance plane is based on Bombardier's 6000-series long-range business jet.Supplied In 2023, then-defence minister Bill Blair announced that Canada would purchase up to 16 P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft for about $10.4-billion. The plane is based on Boeing's twin-engine 737 Next Gen passenger jet. It's not known whether DND would buy the GlobalEye as well, though it and the Poseidon planes have different mission profiles. The Poseidon focuses on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare; the GlobalEye is a long-range aircraft detection and tracking machine. But Canada is keen on developing advanced-technology research, engineering and construction jobs, which Saab is offering to provide if Ottawa buys the GlobalEye or the Gripen or both. None of them would be built in Canada, though some 30 Canadian companies supply the aircraft with parts. None is considered a prime contractor for the aircraft. The purchase of the remaining 72 aircraft was put under review by Mark Carney shortly he became Prime Minister in March. It is broadly known that the Royal Canadian Air Force favours the F-35 and is wary of running a dual fleet of fighters. But the promise of thousands of new jobs, and building a military aerospace engineering, development and supply chain that can feed the export market, has tempted some cabinet ministers, including Industry Minister Mélanie Joly. A Gripen flight simulator is shown in November. Several years ago, the aircraft made Canada's shortlist of possible CF-18 replacements.Felix Odell/The Globe and Mail Saab will extend its sales pitch for both aircraft Tuesday through Thursday of this week during the royal visit of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia to Canada. In an interview in Stockholm last week, Mr. Jonson confirmed that he will be meeting with his Canadian counterpart, David McGuinty, as well as Bombardier CEO Éric Martel. He said that Sweden's small size means that it doesn't have the capabilities to pump out Gripens in great quantities as new orders arrive. “For us, being a smaller country, it is vital for us to share maintaining the cost of that [Gripen] platform and enhancing it during its lifecycle span.” Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

Palestinians in Gaza tell CNN that they "reject" the United Nations Security Council's passage of a US-drafted resolution aimed at reconstructing the devastated enclave and forming a lasting peace. The resolution authorized elements of the plan, including the creation of a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, according to a draft seen by CNN. Palestinians say they do not want "foreign forces on the ground" in the enclave.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, November 18. The Chess Federation of Russia (CFR) has appealed to the Ethics and Disciplinary Commission of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) to open disciplinary proceedings against Vice-President of the European Chess Union (ECU) Malcolm Pein, according to a document obtained by TASS on Tuesday. In October, the Telegraph daily published an interview with Pein, in which he spoke about how important chess was in Russia and called for resorting to all measures to uphold sanctions against Russian chess players, even using political levers of pressure. During the 2024 FIDE General Assembly in Budapest, Pein contacted "with governmental structures like the Embassies of the United Kingdom, the Untied States of America, [the US] State Department, Ukrainian Ministry of strategic procurement," the document reads. "Mr. Pein acknowledges his own involvement… in the direct influence on the decision" to keep sanctions against Russian chess teams, according to the document. "Having said all the above, CFR respectfully requests EDC to open disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Malcolm Pein and apply sanction for the conduct and statements as described above. For the sake of completeness, CFR is of the opinion that the appropriate sanction would be an exclusion from office and/or a ban on taking part in any chess-related activity for a period of 12 months, and requests to apply the said," the document added. The FIDE General Assembly rejected a proposal to reinstate in full Russian and Belarusian chess players' participation in tournaments, and allow them to play under the national flag and to the tune of the national anthem. The delegates voted in favor of conducting consultations with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), regarding a possibility of a partial admission of Russian and Belarusian players in international chess team events. In July, FIDE allowed the Russian women's national team to participate in the World Team Championship under the FIDE banner and the ECU opposed this decision.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Sunday afternoon, former U.S. vice-president Kamala Harris told a packed crowd in Toronto to stop saying “sorry” so much. For the third or fourth time that afternoon, we got to hear Harris's infectious guffaw, unscripted and light. Perhaps the most refreshing thing about Sunday's talk at Meridian Hall, a promotional event for Harris's recent memoir 107 Days, was the extent to which Harris's answers diverged from her book. Celebrity book tours have a habit of parroting whatever content's on sale at the gift shop, but that didn't happen here – many of the insights were new. Here are four revelations from Harris's Toronto tour stop that expanded on the themes of 107 Days – as well as a few brand new take-aways. “Gen Z are demographically a larger population than boomers,” she continued, rattling off stats. They lost critical phases of their education and socialization during the pandemic. It is estimated they will have, in their lifetime, 10 to 12 jobs, whereas older generations came out of college with that one job, where they then retired.” “Gen Z is not watching the evening news,” she said. “They're getting a lot of their information on TikTok and Instagram. “I have many Canadian friends,” she said, recounting her time as a high schooler in Montreal and shouting out her extended family in Mississauga. “I care deeply about this relationship between the United States and Canada.” That will carry us through these specific moments of conflict or crisis.” When asked to contrast her campaign against Trump's agenda, Harris took a swipe at the President's leadership style: “There is some perversion coming from [Trump's] camp that the measure of strength is based on who you beat down, instead of what we know to be the real measure of strength, which is who you lift up,” she said, calling Trump's rhetoric towards disadvantaged communities “garbage.” In addition to her experience of losing the 2024 election – which she discusses at length in 107 Days – Harris recalled the feeling of winning a very different Trump election nearly a decade ago. “It was a very bittersweet personal experience because I thought we were going to have our first woman president that night. While Harris experienced several career milestones while in the Senate – including Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's controversial Senate hearings – the time in office came with a number of personal sacrifices, including missing her stepdaughter Ella's high school graduation, she said. ‘I am not done': Kamala Harris considers 2028 presidential run For Canadians looking to improve the world around them, Harris suggested that they should invest their time into local non-profits, which, in the U.S. and Canada, are often stretched similarly thin. “Human behaviour has a lot to do with what people are hopeful about,” she said. “Figure out in their community where there are non-profits doing the work you care about.

The trip comes as the last publicly known direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia took place almost four months ago, with no tangible progress toward ending Russia's war despite U.S.-led efforts. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff will also visit Turkey and join possible talks with the Ukrainian president, Reuters reported on Nov. 18, citing an unnamed Turkish source. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said no Russian representatives would be present in the country, noting that "for now, these contacts are taking place without Russian participation." Zelensky said he is set to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Nov. 19, where he plans to discuss possible paths toward a "just and lasting peace" for Ukraine. "And this, I think, will be a sufficiently substantive conversation," he added. A source in Ukraine's Presidential Office offered "no comment" when asked about the possible presence of Russian representatives during Zelensky's visit. The Ukrainian president said Kyiv intends to revive prisoner of war exchanges with Moscow, stressing that the goal is to "restore" the process and "bring Ukrainian prisoners of war home." This comes just days after Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov visited Istanbul on Nov. 11 to work on "unblocking" the stalled exchange process. More than 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers are reportedly still held in Russian captivity. U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to broker a deal between Kyiv and Moscow have stalled, as Russian President Vladimir Putin refused to compromise on his demands and declined to meet Zelensky. A planned summit between Trump and Putin in Budapest was also canceled after Washington reportedly concluded Moscow would not agree to a ceasefire.

WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) – The United States will expedite visas for foreign visitors with tickets to FIFA World Cup matches taking place next year in 11 U.S. cities, President Donald Trump said on Monday. Washington will set up a scheduling system for visa-interview appointments that prioritizesforeign fans attending World Cup matches, which will take place from June 11 to July 19. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that government agencies had worked “to ensure that soccer fans from all around the world are properly vetted and able to come to the U.S. next summer easily.” The president said his administration had sped up visa issuance for people in most countries, with the wait time now 60 days or fewer. He said the World Cup could generate $30 billion and create 200,000 jobs. “The U.S. is offering prioritized appointments so fans can complete their visa interviews and show they qualify,” Rubio said. Over one million tickets have been purchased so far by fans from 212 countries, FIFA said. In a statement, the football governing body said ticket holders would receive more information about the priority visa appointment system in early 2026.

UN, November 18. /TASS/. The US resolution on the Gaza Strip, adopted by the UN Security Council, is another "pig in a poke," Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN, stated after the vote.

"President [US Donald] Trump's plan did not indicate that they would engage in the demilitarization of Gaza and the disarmament of local groups, using all available means. The resolution, however, assigns the mission such peacekeeping tasks that they could turn it into a party to the conflict and take it beyond the scope of peacekeeping. As far as we understand, none of the potential troop-contributing countries signed up for this. At the same time, we note that the council members were essentially given no time to work conscientiously and seek compromises. <…> To sum it up, the document presented by the United States is another pig in a poke. Essentially, the Council is giving its blessing to the American initiative on parole of Washington," he stressed.</p>
