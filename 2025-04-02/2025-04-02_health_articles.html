                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among the various cellular and molecular changes associated with aging, cellular senescence (a state of permanent cell cycle arrest triggered by damage or stress) has emerged as a key player. While cellular senescence plays an essential role in processes like wound healing and development, its chronic accumulation contributes to age-related dysfunction. Cellular senescence is a stress response in which cells permanently stop dividing to prevent the spread of damage. It acts as a protective mechanism, halting the proliferation of cells that have undergone deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, telomere shortening, oxidative stress, or oncogene activation. These systems block the cell cycle, ensuring damaged cells do not divide.2 Beyond growth arrest, senescent cells undergo profound changes: they remodel chromatin, reprogram metabolism, and increase autophagy. They also release a range of inflammatory molecules called the SASP, which can signal the immune system to remove them but may also harm surrounding tissues.2 Senescence is beneficial in development, wound healing, and tumor suppression. Excitingly, research shows that removing senescent cells genetically or pharmacologically can extend lifespan and reduce age-related decline, highlighting the dual role of senescence in both protecting and impairing tissue health.1,2 However, as senescent cells accumulate with age, they begin to negatively impact tissues through the SASP- a pro-inflammatory secretion profile.3 SASP includes a mix of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases. While it plays beneficial roles in acute tissue repair, immune surveillance, and developmental processes, its chronic activation leads to tissue dysfunction, low-grade inflammation, and age-related diseases. These fragments often result from reduced activity of DNA-degrading enzymes like DNase2 and Three Prime Repair Exonuclease 1 (TREX1) in senescent cells, leading to type I interferon signaling and inflammation.3 External triggers such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA)- byproducts of gut microbiota- can also induce SASP in cells like hepatic stellate cells, promoting liver cancer. Controlling SASP, including through senolysis (selective elimination of senescent cells), may offer therapeutic strategies for aging and age-associated disorders.3 While senescence initially protects against cancer by halting the proliferation of damaged cells, its chronic accumulation leads to tissue dysfunction and persistent inflammation.2 Animal studies reveal that these senescent cells accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques. Pharmacological clearance using senolytic agents like dasatinib and quercetin, or navitoclax, enhances plaque stability, improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction (heart attack), and reduces tissue damage following ischemia-reperfusion injury.2,4 In osteoarthritis, senescent chondrocytes secrete inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tissue-degrading enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases. Senescence also impairs stem cell regeneration, promotes metabolic disorders, and triggers chronic low-grade inflammation- termed "inflammaging." This contributes to osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, neurodegeneration, and other degenerative conditions. In vivo genetic mouse models, such as INK-linked Apoptosis Through Targeted Activation of Caspase (INK-ATTAC) and p16-driven Trimodality Reporter (p16-3MR), show that targeted removal of senescent cells delays age-related decline and extend health span.2,4 Therapeutic strategies targeting cellular senescence are advancing, focusing on senolytic drugs and gene therapies. Notable examples include dasatinib and quercetin; dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, while quercetin is a flavonoid, both shown to reduce senescent cell burden in preclinical studies.5 Gene therapies offer another avenue by introducing genetic material into cells to counteract aging processes. For example, BioViva has explored gene therapies to extend lifespan by targeting factors like telomerase and myostatin.6 Unity Biotechnology focuses on creating treatments to clear senescent cells, particularly in age-related diseases such as diabetic macular edema. Their investigational drug, foselutoclax (previously UBX1325), inhibits B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL), a protein crucial for the survival of senescent cells in the retina, aiming to restore vision in diabetic macular edema patients.7 These advancements underscore the growing interest in targeting cellular senescence to promote healthier aging. These therapeutic strategies represent promising approaches to mitigate age-related diseases by addressing the underlying mechanisms of cellular senescence. Cellular senescence plays a paradoxical role in health and disease. On one hand, it is essential for tissue remodeling, embryonic development, and wound healing. Transient senescence, for instance, facilitates fibrosis resolution and immune clearance, offering protection against tumorigenesis. However, when senescent cells persist, they can contribute to chronic inflammation, tissue dysfunction, and aging-related pathologies. This duality has fueled debate: should senescence be suppressed or supported? The SASP further complicates this picture, as its cytokines can be either reparative or harmful depending on context. Moreover, the lack of highly specific biomarkers hampers accurate detection and targeted therapies. To validate causality and therapeutic viability of targeting cellular senescence, large-scale, placebo-controlled clinical trials are essential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bottom line: Precancerous pancreatic lesions and some pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors harboring KRAS mutations had higher-than-normal expression of the FGFR2 protein, and FGFR2 inactivation delayed KRAS-mutated PDAC development in mice. Author: Claudia Tonelli, PhD, a research investigator in the laboratory of AACR Past President David A. Tuveson, MD, PhD, FAACR, at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory These lesions are relatively common, but only a small portion will progress to PDAC, Tonelli explained. "Understanding the additional pathways that promote progression from a precancerous pancreatic lesion to a malignant tumor could help identify more viable treatment strategies as well as cancer interception approaches to stop PDAC from developing in the first place," she added. "We know that precancerous pancreatic lesions often carry KRAS mutations," said Tonelli. "Our observation that FGFR2 expression was associated with increased KRAS signaling suggests that FGFR2 may play a key role in driving the progression of KRAS-mutated precancerous lesions to malignancy." In addition, the combined inhibition of FGFR2 and another signaling protein, EGFR, significantly reduced the formation of precancerous lesions in mice carrying mutated KRAS. While FGFR inhibitors are clinically available, Tonelli cautioned that their effectiveness in intercepting PDAC would first need to be tested in clinical trials before they could be used for this purpose. "Our study provides critical insights into pancreatic cancer development and could guide the development of strategies for the interception and prevention of pancreatic malignancies," she summarized. Study limitations: A limitation of the study is that it did not directly examine whether FGFR2 inactivation in precancerous lesions would also block or delay subsequent PDAC.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NIH-supported study reveals new risk group for future high blood pressure, heart disease. High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death. This study identified a new, previously undefined risk group of postpartum women who are not currently recognized as being at high risk for future hypertension and cardiovascular disease because they did not develop HDP during pregnancy. When the history of HDP was combined with women's early pregnancy blood pressure patterns, these data together provide a new and improved tool for risk assessment. The study followed 174,774 women who received prenatal care at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2009 and 2019. The research found that women who showed certain blood pressure patterns during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy were more likely to develop hypertension later in life. Six distinct risk groups of blood pressure trajectory were identified, ranging from ultra-low to elevated-stable patterns. Women with elevated-stable blood pressure patterns were at the highest risk. By identifying women at higher risk, healthcare providers can offer targeted surveillance and early interventions, potentially preventing future heart problems. The study showed that these blood pressure patterns could differentiate risk levels among women with and without HDP. Among groups of women who did not develop HDP, those with higher risk blood pressure patterns — including elevated-stable patterns — during early pregnancy were still 11 times more likely to develop hypertension years later than those women with less risky blood pressure patterns. Researchers suggest that this previously unrecognized risk group may warrant closer monitoring after pregnancy. Additionally, they suggest that early pregnancy blood pressure trajectories may improve predictions of cardiovascular disease risk in women.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Research Co-Autthored by Lancaster University Provides a understanding Analysis of How Ageing Affects Muscle Function, Soreness, and Biochemical Markers of Muscle Damage after Exercise. By Pooling Data from 36 Studies, Researchers Found That Older Adults Do Not Experience Greater Muscle Function Loss after Exercise Compared with Younger Individuals. One striking Discovery was that muscle soreness was consistently lower in older adults, with discounts of around 34% at 48 hours and 62% at 72 hours compared with younger individuals. Creatine Kinase Levels, An Indicator of Muscle Damage, Were Approximately 28% Lower in Older Adults at 24 Hours Post-Exercise. The Findings Suggest That, Despite Physiological Changes With Age, Muscle Resilience Remains Relatively Stable, Allowing Older Individuals to Continue Engaging in Regular Physical Activity Without Increased concern for prolonged weakness or loss of fun. Interestingly, Sex Appeared To Play A Role in Muscle Function Recovery, with Males Showing Slightly Greater Decreases in Muscle Function after Exercise Than Females. This misconception often discourage older adults from engaging in regular physical activity due to fears of prolonged soreness or weakness. If Older Individuals Experience Less Muscle Damage Symptoms Than Previously Thought, Recovery Strategies, Training Programms, and Post-Excise Care Could be Adjuded Accordly. For Example, Older Adults May Not Require significantly prolonged Recovery Periods Compared With Younger Individuals, Putentiallly Allowing for More Frequent or Intense Training Sessions, Leading to Better Long-Term Health Outcomes. Overall, this study reinforces the importance of staying active throughout life and dispels myths that ageing Equates to Frailty or Impaired Recovery. Dr. Hayes Said: "This Means Exercise has no age limit so move to live along and healthier.</p>

Coronary heart disease (CHD), the most common cause of mortality globally, poses a formidable challenge to modern healthcare systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in multiple diagnostic applications of CHD, by facilitating early intervention and personalized treatment.

This article describes the state of the art and provides clinicians with updated insights into the transformative potential of AI to enhance CHD detection. AI can be used to increase diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. However, its reliance on homogeneous numerical data might potentially lead to misdiagnoses and unnecessary radiation exposure in diagnosing CHD. Multimodal data fusion brings new potential for accurate diagnosis and personalized medicine. Unmet challenges and future research directions in ethical, regulatory, and technical aspects are discussed and the article aims to bridge the gap between AI advancements and practical applications in clinical settings, to achieve a future in which AI empowers CHD diagnosis in the context of a modern healthcare ecosystem.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among the numerous genetic factors implicated in IRD, mutations in the CRB1 gene stand out as significant contributors to severe forms of retinal degeneration, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Recent research has unveiled a novel mechanism linking CRB1 mutations to retinal degeneration through bacterial translocation from the gut to the eye, opening up promising therapeutic avenues. This bacterial translocation triggers inflammatory responses and retinal damage in CRB1-mutated eyes. Research using the naturally occurring retinal degeneration 8 (Rd8) mouse model, which carries a nonsense mutation in CRB1, has demonstrated that retinal lesions contain bacterial species originating from the gut. These findings establish a clear connection between CRB1 mutations, barrier dysfunction, and retinal inflammation. The therapeutic potential of targeting this bacterial translocation has been explored through both antibiotic treatment and gene therapy approaches. Systemic antibiotic treatment of newborn Rd8 mice effectively prevented retinal damage by reducing bacterial translocation. Similarly, gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to restore CRB1 expression in enterocytes improved intestinal barrier function and reduced retinal inflammation. These findings suggest that combining antibacterial therapy with gene correction could offer a promising treatment strategy for CRB1-associated retinal degeneration. The discovery of this gut-eye axis in CRB1-related retinal degeneration has broader implications for understanding other ocular diseases where gut microbiota may play a role. Future research should explore whether similar mechanisms operate in human patients with CRB1 mutations and investigate the potential for probiotics, prebiotics, or other microbiome-modulating therapies to complement traditional gene therapy approaches.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Proteins are essential for a wide range of cellular functions-as enzymes, transporters, hormones, antibodies, receptors, and more. They must be folded into the correct three-dimensional shape to function properly. While UPR begins as an adaptive response, it can become maladaptive-ultimately causing cell death-if ER stress persists for too long. The study reveals how ER-stressed adipocytes remotely regulate UPR activation in hepatocytes through the secretion of ceramide (Cer), a fat molecule that plays a major role in cell structure, signaling, and stress response. These findings were published in the Journal of Cell Biology on March 26. Using lipidomics analysis and functional validation, they identified Cer as the key effector molecule responsible for this process. Further investigation revealed that the UPR pathway in adipocytes does not directly regulate Cer secretion. By investigating how lipid-soluble Cer is transported between cells, the researchers demonstrated that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) serves as the primary carrier for Cer transport. Expanding on these findings, the researchers discovered that this Cer-based intercellular UPR signaling mechanism has broader applicability, offering a new theoretical framework for understanding multi-tissue coordinated stress responses. By systematically mapping the molecular pathway of UPR signal transmission between adipose and liver tissues, this study reveals a previously unrecognized form of organ crosstalk in metabolic diseases. These discoveries pave the way for lipid metabolism-targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring cellular balance and mitigating metabolic disorders.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study suggests that superbugs could kill up to 40 million people by 2050.1 The World Health Organization has identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as one of the most serious global public health issues. But what exactly are superbugs, and how did they come to be? Microbes are tiny biological organisms that exist all around us. They can be found in the air, on surfaces, in food, and even within our bodies. They are present in enormous numbers throughout the human body. The beneficial microbes in your body work together to support functions such as digestion, immunity, and reproduction. In contrast, harmful microbes (pathogens) can cause disease and illness in humans, animals, and plants. They reproduce quickly and spread easily, posing a serious threat to health. Antimicrobial medications can treat a wide range of diseases. The battle against infections (mostly bacterial infections) was believed to have been won in the late 1920s when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin (a commonly used antibiotic). This was followed by the discovery of many additional broad-spectrum and specialized antibiotics. However, with the widespread overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals, microorganisms have grown stronger than previously imagined. Superbugs are microorganisms that were once sensitive to specific antibiotics but have become resistant to them. One in every five instances of urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli is resistant to commonly used medications such as ampicillin and fluoroquinolones. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common intestinal bacterium that resists beta-lactam antibiotics, which are widely used. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major concern due to its high mortality rate and resistance to several medications used to treat common staph infections.3 Between 2017 and 2021, approximately 20 % of MRSA bloodstream infections in Canada resulted in death within 30 days of diagnosis.4 Other prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria include vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE).5 AMR is a dangerous and rapidly growing global health crisis. Understanding how it develops can provide researchers and medical staff with the tools needed to address this urgent threat. Several factors contribute to the emergence and spread of AMR, the most significant of which is the misuse and overuse of antibiotics in clinical settings. Antibiotics work by killing bacteria and/or disrupting their reproductive cycles. Incorrect use of antibiotics occurs when a patient misses one or more doses of their prescribed medication or discontinues therapy earlier than recommended. Overprescribing antibiotics for mild infections, as well as misdiagnosing viral infections, is accelerating AMR. AMR is especially concerning in low-income communities and developing countries, where inadequate sanitation, lack of access to clean water, and limited immunization programs are often the primary causes of infection. Antibiotics are often used inappropriately for these infections, even when they are unnecessary, worsening the problem. In some areas, antibiotics are widely available without a prescription, further contributing to their overuse.6 In addition, farming practices, such as the use of unnecessary antibiotics for growth promotion in livestock, contribute significantly to the spread of drug-resistant bacteria in both animals and humans. It is estimated that antibiotic use in livestock will rise by 67 % by 2030.7 Antibiotic use in agriculture promotes the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes in the soil, which eventually enter the water system as pollutants.8 A 2009 study found antibiotic-resistant genes and bacteria in the tap water supply.9 While antibiotics have an important role in agricultural production and growth, their long-term, low-dose use may contribute to the development of AMR, potentially costing the healthcare system millions of dollars in treatment. The mechanism of antimicrobial resistance is well studied and is generally divided into two categories. The first way AMR originates is through intrinsic resistance, which is a microorganism’s innate ability to withstand antibiotics. "For example, an antibiotic that affects the wall-building mechanism of the bacteria, such as penicillin, cannot affect bacteria that do not have a cell wall. Acquired resistance occurs when antibiotic-susceptible bacteria gain the ability to withstand the effects of an antibiotic, allowing them to reproduce and spread under selective pressure. This type of resistance is achieved either by modifying existing genetic material (gene mutation) or by acquiring new genetic material from another source (horizontal gene transfer). Acquired resistance genes may allow bacteria to degrade or chemically modify antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. They may also produce or upregulate efflux pumps, which actively transport antibiotics out of the cell, preventing the drug from reaching its intracellular target. Additionally, bacteria may alter the drug’s target site or develop an alternative metabolic pathway that bypasses the drug’s effects.11 This includes staying home when sick, practicing proper hygiene, and keeping up to date with vaccinations, among other precautions. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics are among the primary drivers of AMR development.12 According to a 2017 study, "up to 40 % of antibiotic prescriptions for these conditions are unnecessary." 13 This not only leads to more mutant bacteria but also harms the gut microbiome since antibiotics kill both beneficial and harmful bacteria. Doctors must accurately diagnose bacterial infections and prescribe antibiotics only when truly necessary. Patients must also take responsibility for using antibiotics properly. We must each do our part to help prevent the rise of superbugs. No, using hand sanitizer does not lead to the emergence of superbugs. Hand sanitizers contain ethanol, which kills bacteria immediately by breaking down their cell walls, whereas antibiotics inhibit bacterial growth. Hand sanitizers also evaporate quickly, preventing bacteria from developing resistance. No, bleach does not promote the emergence of superbugs. Bleach destroys microorganisms by breaking down their cell structure. It is a fast-acting disinfectant that gives microbes no time to develop resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CRC usually develops gradually, taking months or even years to spread to other parts of the body. Due to this slow progression, early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. A major challenge with CRC is that symptoms are often mild or absent in the early stages, highlighting the importance of routine screening. Gaining a thorough understanding of this disease is a crucial first step toward adopting preventive measures to reduce its impact. In the later stages of CRC, symptoms may vary depending on the tumor's size and location, but they often include: Individuals' bowel habits vary, and "normal" behaviors differ from one another. Bowel habits include how often someone has a bowel movement, as well as changes such as constipation, diarrhea, or differences in the size, shape, and consistency of stool. Blood in the stool or rectal bleeding Polyps and tumors can bleed for various reasons, including rupture of blood vessels in the gut lining, ulceration, inflammation and irritation of surrounding tissue, or physical injury from bowel movements caused by a blockage. Abdominal discomfort, such as cramping or pain Bloating and a persistent sense of fullness are possible symptoms. In women, these symptoms may resemble menstrual pain and are frequently overlooked. If you notice any of these symptoms, consult a doctor right away. Understanding the causes and risk factors of colorectal cancer CRC results from genetic mutations that lead to abnormal cell proliferation. However, since the mid-1990s, there has been a 1–2 % increase in incidence among younger adults. 1,2 Alarmingly, rates in those under 50 have increased by 2.4 % each year, with mortality rising by 1 % each year. CRC primarily affects individuals over the age of 50. However, since the mid-1990s, there has been a 1–2 % increase in incidence among younger adults. Alarmingly, rates in those under 50 have increased by 2.4 % each year, with mortality rising by 1 % each year. Family history: Having a family history of CRC, especially in a first-degree relative, significantly increases the risk of developing the disease. Approximately one in every ten cases is linked to family history, highlighting the importance of early and regular screening for those at high risk.

Diet: Consuming red and processed meats raises the risk of CRC, while a fiber-rich diet, such as one including whole grains, can help lower it. Studies have shown that consuming 300 milligrams of calcium daily (the amount found in a large glass of milk) can reduce the risk by 17 %.

Prolonged sitting increases the risk of colon cancer by 28–44 %. Other contributing factors include smoking and alcohol consumption. Alcohol, in particular, is associated with several types of cancer, including CRC. Prolonged sitting increases the risk of colon cancer by 28–44 %. Other contributing factors include smoking and alcohol consumption. Alcohol, in particular, is associated with several types of cancer, including CRC. Medical conditions: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, increase the risk of CRC. According to studies, long-term inflammation in the colon significantly raises this risk, highlighting the importance of routine screenings.9 CRC is diagnosed using a combination of screening tests, diagnostic techniques, and laboratory analysis. Early detection is critical for improving outcomes and survival rates. Patients will be asked to undergo the tests and procedures listed below based on their medical history, physical exam, and CRC screening test results. The gold standard for detecting polyps and cancers. Similar to a colonoscopy, but less invasive. No sedation is required for this minimally invasive colon imaging treatment. This method checks the large intestine for polyps, cancers, and other abnormalities. It uses computed tomography (CT) scanning technology to provide detailed, high-resolution 3D images of the colon and rectum. Fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical assays (FIT) can both detect blood in stool samples. Blood tests cannot be used alone to diagnose CRC. However, they provide insight into a person's overall health and can detect abnormalities that may be related to the presence of cancer. Individuals suspected of having CRC are evaluated with a complete blood count, liver function tests, and kidney function tests. Norgen Biotek offers researchers a variety of methods for isolating DNA and RNA from cell and tissue samples. Advanced approaches, such as RNA or DNA analysis, identify cancer-related genetic markers and support early tumor detection. Tumor markers can be found in blood, tissue, and other bodily fluids. An abnormal level of a tumor marker may indicate CRC. Norgen Biotek provides cutting-edge technologies for liquid biopsy biomarker testing, ensuring accurate and reliable results. Prevention is crucial in reducing the occurrence of CRC. Individuals can significantly lower their risk by implementing effective measures. A nutritious diet is an effective way to reduce the risk of CRC. At the same time, limiting the consumption of red and processed meats is important, as studies have linked excessive intake to a 29 % increased risk of colon cancer.10 Even small, consistent dietary changes can have a significant impact on CRC prevention. Adopting healthy lifestyle habits is another important aspect of CRC prevention. Regular physical activity, such as 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week, helps maintain a healthy weight and reduces cancer risk.11 Similarly, limiting alcohol intake is essential, as excessive consumption has been linked to an increased risk of developing CRC.12 Making these small but meaningful changes to your daily routine can have a significant impact on your long-term health. Individuals with a family history of CRC should consider genetic testing to identify inherited conditions such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which significantly increase cancer risk. Understanding these genetic predispositions allows for early and regular screenings, providing opportunities to detect and address cancer before it develops. Proactive genetic testing encourages individuals and families to better manage their health.13 CRC should be conducted regularly to ensure early detection and prevention. Screening options include stool tests and visual exams such as colonoscopies. These methods help detect and remove precancerous polyps, preventing cancer from forming. Early detection through screening significantly improves treatment outcomes.14 Who should be screened for colorectal cancer? Consult your doctor to determine whether you should start screening sooner. What foods are linked to increased colorectal cancer risk? Diets high in red or processed meats and low in fiber have been linked to an increased risk of CRC. Stool tests are useful for initial screening and can help detect early signs of cancer.
