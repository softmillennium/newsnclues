Such electric spikes are a surprise because only nerve cells were thought to communicate this way. These signals move at a snail’s pace compared to nerve impulses and can be detected at least 500 micrometers away — about the distance of 40 cells — researchers report in the March 25 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The pulsing electrical waves may help injured cells’ neighbors prepare to heal wounds.

Sign up for our newsletter We summarize the week's science breakthroughs every Thursday.

For over 150 years, scientists have known that wounds alter electric fields across skin cells, says cell biologist Min Zhao of the University of California, Davis School of Medicine. But they didn’t know that skin cells can send spikes of electricity the way nerve cells do, says Zhao, who was not involved with the new work.

To capture this phenomenon, bioengineer Sun-Min Yu and engineering scientist Steve Granick — both of the University of Massachusetts Amherst — grew human skin cells or dog kidney cells on electrode-lined chips. Both are epithelial cells, a cell type that forms barriers such as skin and mucous membranes, and also lines organs and body cavities. After blasting some cells with lasers, Yu measured tiny shifts in electrical activity.

The researchers found that the pulses generated by both the skin and kidney cells are partly driven by the flow of calcium ions and have about the same voltage as a nerve cell zap. But the spikes move at a crawl compared to nerve cell signals, Granick says. Whereas nerve cell impulses last just milliseconds, epithelial cells take one to two seconds to spit out their electrical messages.

The process was so pokey that Yu nearly missed the signals. “She realized she would just [have to] be patient and make measurements over a glacial scale,” Granick says.

The software Yu was using was set to detect speedier nerve cell pulses and wouldn’t flag spikes slower than 500 milliseconds. “I asked the software engineer to release that constraint, and then it worked,” Yu says.

Wounded cells sent pulses for more than five hours, possibly alerting their neighbors to squeeze out damaged cells and to start replicating to repair the wound. Such slow, long-lasting signaling makes sense, Zhao says. While nerve cells drive split-second reactions, epithelial cells heal wounds over days to weeks.

The discovery of these electrical spikes adds a new understanding of the time dimension of the wound healing process, Zhao says. And it may give researchers new respect for the role of electrical activity. Electric fields are often dismissed as less important than biochemical or mechanical signals. “We need to change that idea,” Zhao says. “We also need to understand [wound healing] as a complicated, complex process involving many different aspects,” including short bursts of electrical activity.

The study looked at electrical propagation only in roughly two-dimensional sheets just one cell thick. Yu hopes to next explore how epithelial cells use these pulses to communicate in 3-D structures and with other cell types.",sciencenews
https://sciencenews.org,Fermenting miso in orbit reveals how space can affect a food’s taste,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ferment-miso-orbit-space-food-taste-iss,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:03:34 GMT","Fermenting foods in space could provide a new culinary frontier.

When fermented aboard the International Space Station, the Japanese condiment miso tasted nuttier than two earthbound versions, researchers report April 2 in iScience. The finding not only reveals that fermentation is possible for a food orbiting Earth, it also characterizes a space environment’s influence on a food.

Astronauts usually munch on freeze-dried foods void of most microbes, says industrial designer and researcher Maggie Coblentz of MIT’s Space Exploration Initiative. “Fermentation is a really exciting way to open that up, so to invite a diverse community of microbes that will interact with one another and also preserve food while growing and enhancing flavor.”

Sign up for our newsletter We summarize the week's science breakthroughs every Thursday.

A fermented food’s flavor can vary depending on the microbes and other elements of the surrounding environment. Miso was chosen for the experiment because of its firm structure, strong flavor and cultural significance, among other reasons. It represents the first known food deliberately fermented in space, says interdisciplinary food researcher Josh Evans of the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen.

Evans and colleagues combined cooked soybeans, salt and fermented rice called kōji to make about 1 kilogram of a miso-to-be mixture, keeping one-third of it. The rest went to Coblentz in Cambridge, Mass., who split her portion and sent one-third of the total mixture to launch into space from Florida in March 2020. All portions remained frozen until then. After 30 days of fermentation in each location, the batches were refrozen and later analyzed for microbial and chemical composition and flavor profile.

Fourteen tasters tried miso fermented in Copenhagen (left), the International Space Station (center) and Cambridge, Mass. (right). The space miso appears darker likely because of its elevated temperature aboard the ISS compared with the earthbound batches, which may have sped up the fermentation process. Maggie Coblentz

Fourteen tasters including chefs and researchers thought the space miso had nuttier and more roasted notes compared with the earthbound ones. These flavors are associated with compounds called pyrazines. The space miso contained more pyrazines, likely because the toastier temperature aboard the ISS sped up fermentation. (On average, the environment surrounding the space miso was roughly 36° Celsius — possibly due to heat-generating equipment nearby — compared with 23° C in Cambridge and 20° C in Copenhagen.)

All three misos bore similar microbes, although one bacterial species was found only in the ISS miso. Further, the fungus that fermented kōji showed more genetic mutations in the ISS miso than the Earth batches, possibly because of increased radiation exposure in space.

The researchers could not isolate the ISS miso’s fermentation variables, including radiation, temperature and microgravity, to attribute specific properties to them, Coblentz says. But all those environmental features — or the “space terroir” — contributed to the miso, imparting a unique taste of space.",sciencenews

https://livescience.com,Gaia telescope retires: Scientists bid farewell to 'the discovery machine of the decade' that mapped 2 billion Milky Way stars,https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/gaia-telescope-retires-scientists-bid-farewell-to-the-discovery-machine-of-the-decade-that-mapped-2-billion-milky-way-stars,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 20:16:24 GMT","On March 27, scientists bid farewell to the Gaia telescope, bringing to a close its groundbreaking 11-year mission of mapping the Milky Way and our cosmic neighborhood.

Though not as famous as some of its peers like the Hubble or James Webb space telescopes, Gaia has reshaped our understanding of our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Since 2014, the European Space Agency's ( ESA ) telescope has meticulously charted the cosmos, creating a vast catalog of nearly 2 billion stars, more than 4 million potential galaxies and around 150,000 asteroids, with moons possibly circling hundreds of them.

These observations have led to more than 13,000 scientific studies , with many more likely to follow in the coming years.

""Gaia's extensive data releases are a unique treasure trove for astrophysical research, and influence almost all disciplines in astronomy,"" Johannes Sahlmann , a physicist at the European Space Astronomy Centre in Spain and a project scientist for the Gaia mission, said in a statement .

After 11 years of operations — nearly double its expected lifetime — Gaia ran out of fuel, prompting its operators at ESA to power down and retire the spacecraft.

The best map of the Milky Way galaxy

Since it launched in December 2013, Gaia charted the cosmos from a vantage point about a million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth, at a spot called Lagrange point 2 (L2), where the gravitational forces of Earth and the sun, and the orbital motion of a satellite balance each other.

Gaia's primary goal was to map the positions and movements of over a billion stars within the Milky Way, creating the largest, most precise 3D map of our galaxy . To do so, it was equipped with twin telescopes pointed in different directions to measure the distances between stars, while three onboard instruments collected data on the positions, velocities, colors as well as chemical compositions of celestial objects.

The exquisite map of our galaxy it assembled has enabled scientists to better understand the galaxy's spiral structure, estimate the shape and mass of the dark matter halo that surrounds the Milky Way, and solve the decades-old mystery of our galaxy's warped and wobbling disk — which is likely due to an ongoing collision with the smaller Sagittarius galaxy.

Additionally, the catalog has provided astronomers with new insights into the ancient nature of parts of our galaxy , suggesting that stars began forming in the Milky Way's disk less than 1 billion years after the Big Bang — far earlier than the previously accepted timeline of 3 billion years.

The telescope's observations have also led astronomers to discover previously hidden stellar streams. For example, in 2020, its database of stars revealed the presence and shape of the largest structure ever observed in our galaxy: a vast ensemble of interconnected stellar nurseries spanning 9,000 light-years, known as the Radcliffe Wave , which may have had a lasting impact on Earth's climate .

""Gaia has changed our impression of the Milky Way,"" Stefan Payne-Wardenaar , a scientific visualiser at the Heidelberg University in Germany, said in a previous statement .

The spacecraft has serendipitously captured thousands of starquakes — tiny motions on surfaces of stars that cause them to swell and shrink periodically — providing unique insights into the inner workings of stars, and spotted high-velocity stars both escaping our galaxy and, surprisingly, racing toward it. It also uncovered several cosmic ""sleeping giants,"" or black holes — one of which is lurking extremely close to Earth .

Gaia's star catalog has also been used to clock the expansion rate of the universe, fueling the ongoing debate over why the expansion seems to be occurring faster than astronomers expected.

""It is impressive that these discoveries are based only on the first few years of Gaia data, and many were made in the last year alone,"" Anthony Brown , an associate professor of astronomy at the University of Leiden in Netherlands, said in the statement.

Saying goodbye to the 'discovery machine of the decade'

On March 27, ESA commanded Gaia to use its thrusters for the final time, pushing the spacecraft into a ""retirement orbit"" safely away from Earth and the scientifically important L2 orbit, which is also home to the James Webb Space Telescope, Euclid telescope and China's Chang'e 6 orbiter.

Last week the mission team deactivated the spacecraft's instruments, which were designed with multiple redundant systems to ensure it could reboot and resume operations after any failure. To prevent its computers from powering back on in the future, operators deliberately corrupted its onboard software, according to the ESA statement.

""We had to design a decommissioning strategy that involved systematically picking apart and disabling the layers of redundancy that have safeguarded Gaia for so long,"" Tiago Nogueira , Gaia spacecraft operator, said in the statement. ""We don't want it to reactivate in the future and begin transmitting again if its solar panels find sunlight.""

Team members wrote the names of all 1,500 contributors to the Gaia mission into the spacecraft's onboard memory, as well as personal farewell messages and poems.

The telescope may have gone dark, but scientists hope its discoveries will continue to shine brightly. So far, only a third of the mission's data has been analyzed, as processing the vast amount of information — Gaia is expected to have gathered more than 1 petabyte (1 million gigabytes) of data by the end of its mission — takes months. The next batch of science data is set to be released in 2026, covering a little over five years of observations, with the fifth and final release scheduled for 2030, which will encompass the full 10 years of data.

https://livescience.com,Mysterious origin of iconic Sutton Hoo helmet possibly revealed in new research,https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/mysterious-origin-of-iconic-sutton-hoo-helmet-possibly-revealed-in-new-research,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 19:43:37 GMT","Archaeologists say the stamp with a motif of a warrior riding a horse from Denmark is remarkably similar to the horse and rider motifs stamped on the Sutton Hoo helmet in England.

The famous seventh-century helmet from Sutton Hoo in England may have been crafted in southern Scandinavia, a new find suggests.

The idea comes from the discovery in Denmark of a bronze metalworking die or stamp that depicts a warrior on horseback.

Examinations show the design on the rectangular stamp is remarkably similar to the horse-and-rider motifs stamped into the metal of the ceremonial helmet, which was unearthed in 1939 from an Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo in the east of England.

Similar motifs have been found on helmets from Sweden and jewelry from southern Germany, and scholars have suggested that the Sutton Hoo helmet may have been an heirloom or diplomatic gift from those regions.

The latest discovery confirms that the motif of a horse and riding warrior was indeed widespread throughout Northern Europe at that time.

""It's definitely connected to the aristocracy,"" archaeologist and prehistorian Peter Pentz , a curator at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, told Live Science. He noted that nobles from these times and places were expected to ride horses into battle.

The stamp was found on the Danish island of Taasinge roughly two years ago, amid the ruins of a metal workshop, and it is now on display in the museum.

Horseback-riding warrior

The Sutton Hoo helmet is a curious mixture of Northern European and Roman styles . It was rebuilt from hundreds of fragments found at the Sutton Hoo site, which also yielded ornate grave goods — including musical instruments, jewelry, tableware, weapons and armor — from a burial chamber built on the deck of the buried ship.

The helmet and its distinctive face mask are now icons of the Anglo-Saxon culture, which was established in eastern Britain during the early medieval period by migrants from what are now the coasts of Germany and Denmark.

Although Anglo-Saxon smiths were certainly capable of crafting such a helmet, the new discovery adds strength to the idea that it originated overseas, Pentz said. The horse-and-warrior motifs on the Sutton Hoo helmet are not identical to the ones on the stamp, but they show many similarities, including their depictions of the ears, manes, noses and tails of the horses, he said. He added that the stamp is also exactly the same size as the horse-and-riding-warrior motifs stamped onto metal panels on the Sutton Hoo helmet, which is now housed at the British Museum in London .

Anglo-Saxon England

Experts in England are excited about this new support for the idea that the iconic Anglo-Saxon helmet may have originated overseas. The similarity between the motifs on the stamp and the helmet ""adds to the sense of quite how interconnected were the military elites of this period in north-western Europe,"" Helen Gittos , a medieval historian at the University of Oxford, told Live Science in an email.

Gittos was not involved in the discovery at Taasinge, but she recently published a paper that suggested the helmet and other finds indicate some Anglo-Saxon nobles fought as mercenaries for the Byzantine Empire .

University of Chester archaeologist Howard Williams , who was also not involved, said the design on the stamp is the closest parallel yet found to the horse-and-warrior motifs on the Sutton Hoo helmet.

It now seems likely that the helmet was made in southern Scandinavia in the late sixth or early seventh century, or that it had been heavily influenced by the artistic style of that area, Williams told Live Science in an email.

""The motifs from Taasinge and Sutton Hoo are similar but not identical, reflecting a popular design used on helmets across a wide region,"" he said.",livescience
https://livescience.com,"Your brain starts eating itself during a marathon, study finds",https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/your-brain-starts-eating-itself-during-a-marathon-study-finds,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 18:15:00 GMT","A small study of people who ran a marathon found that their brains ' energy demands increased in the aftermath of the race.

Marathon running may seem like the ultimate sport for staying in shape. That said, it can take a heavy toll on the body , potentially damaging the kidneys, upsetting the stomach, increasing the risk of heart failure, and triggering musculoskeletal injuries. Let's not forget that the original marathon runner, the ancient Greek soldier Pheidippides, is said to have dropped dead immediately after reaching his destination.

Now, a new study suggests that marathons also affect the brain — causing the organ to eat itself to make up for fuel lost during the run.

In the research, published March 24 in the journal Nature Metabolism , scientists observed declines in a key biomarker of myelin, a fatty tissue that insulates the connections between brain cells, in marathon runners just after a race. The study authors say this suggests the brain consumes myelin as an energy source under these extreme conditions.

Luckily for long-distance runners, these effects appear to be reversible.

Related: 6 ways an athlete's brain differs from an average person's

Once the body has exhausted the supply of its standard energy source — glucose, or sugar — it turns to backup generators, metabolizing fats as an alternative fuel source. The brain is, metabolically speaking, more of a Humvee than a hatchback; the energy-hungry organ devours 20% of the body's energy , meaning it can quickly suffer damage if fuel sources run short.

Pedro Ramos Cabrer — a neuroscientist at CIC biomaGUNE, a nonprofit research institute in San Sebastian, Spain, and a co-author of the study — told Live Science that he and his colleagues wanted to identify the brain's reserve energy sources. They suspected that fatty myelin could be the answer. Previous research in rodents suggested that fatty acids produced from myelin breakdown could help boost cell survival in the brain. Whether these preclinical findings would be replicated in humans was still a mystery, though.

""We needed to really deplete all the sources of energy of a body to prove this,"" Cabrer told Live Science.

The team scanned 10 runners' brains 48 hours before they ran a marathon and then again two days, two weeks and two months afterward. They used MRI, which can reveal the presence of water molecules trapped between myelin layers.

The brain scans showed that, two days post-run, the MRI signals in 12 brain areas were depleted compared with before the race — in some cases, by up to 28%. Changes to the brain's overall myelin levels were not statistically significant, however, suggesting that any changes were very isolated to specific regions.

""The areas that we saw have more significant changes were those related to motor circuits and the center of emotional control of the brain,"" Cabrer said. He suggested that this reflects the mental and physical effort the brain must maintain to get through a marathon.

For any runners concerned about this cerebral cannibalism, there's good news: After two months, all of the runners' myelin measures had recovered to their baseline levels.

Klaus-Armin Nave , director at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Germany, was not involved in the study but has also studied how myelin stores energy , using lab mice. Nave said the paper's findings aligned with how neuroscientists think myelin is maintained in the brain.

Related: How far can a person run without stopping?

""Myelin is constantly made and degraded,"" he said. ""It's like a bathtub in which you constantly fill in water and constantly drain it."" He added that Cabrer's work presents ""very strong evidence"" that, after a marathon, the brain's metabolic needs increase. Thus, the fuel stored in myelin is depleted more quickly than usual, leading to brain shrinkage.

The findings don't mean runners should avoid marathons on their brains' behalf. Both Nave and Cabrer noted that the study's small size means more work will be needed to draw concrete conclusions about marathons' effects on the brain. The very limited effects on overall myelin also raise the need for further research, they added.

Nevertheless, these effects may carry increased risks for certain athletes. For example, in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), metabolic molecules typically made by myelin are in short supply , and the researchers think that excessive exercise could potentially exacerbate the problem.

Further research will be needed to confirm this theory, Cabrer said.",livescience

The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer ( SPHEREx ) arrived in orbit atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on March 11.

The six released images, collected by the space telescope on March 27, were each snapped by three different detectors. The top three images span the telescope's complete field of view, and are captured again in the bottom three which are colored differently to represent varying ranges of infrared wavelengths.

Within each image's full field of view — an area roughly 20 times wider than the full moon — roughly 100,000 light sources from stars, galaxies, and nebulas can be glimpsed.

Once it is fully online in April, SPHEREX will scan the entire night sky a total of four times using 102 separate infrared color sensors, enabling it to collect data from more than 450 million galaxies during its planned two-year operation. This amounts to roughly 600 exposures a day, according to NASA.

This dataset will give scientists key insights into some of the biggest questions in cosmology, enabling astronomers to study galaxies at various stages in their evolution; trace the ice floating in empty space to see how life may have begun; and even understand the period of rapid inflation the universe underwent immediately after the Big Bang .

SPHEREx's wide panorama view makes it the perfect complement for the James Webb Space Telescope , flagging regions of interest for the latter to study with greater depth and resolution.

After lofting it to space, NASA scientists and engineers have performed a nail-biting series of checks on the new telescope. This includes ensuring that its sensitive infrared equipment is cooling down to its final temperature of around minus 350 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 210 degrees Celsius) and that the telescope is set to the right focus — something that cannot be adjusted in space.

A Bitcoin billionaire and a trio of other first-time astronauts are currently orbiting Earth's poles — a first for human spaceflight — as they embark on a roughly 4-day mission to ""advance space exploration"" by conducting several unorthodox experiments. However, several experts have questioned how much they can learn during such a short mission, and whether science is the true motivation of the project at all.

On Monday (March 31), the Maltese cryptocurrency mogul Chun Wang and the other members of the ""Fram2"" mission entered low-Earth orbit aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon ""Resilience"" capsule, which was propelled into space by a Falcon 9 rocket that launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at around 9:46 p.m. EDT, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com . (The name Fram2 was chosen to pay homage to the Fram expedition , which explored the Arctic between 1893 and 1896.)

Wang, who is leading and funding the mission, was accompanied by Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics engineer Rabea Rogge and Australian polar explorer Eric Phillips — all of whom received around 8 months of astronaut training before launch, according to Spaceflight Now . The group is expected to return to Earth at some point within three to five days of launch, when they will splash down off the coast of California.

The two main goals of the Fram2 mission are to achieve the first human spaceflight above Earth's poles and to carry out research that may help future space travel, according to a statement released March 24. There are 22 planned experiments, which range from classic space tests that measure physiological changes experienced by the astronauts to first-of-their-kind experiments, such as growing mushrooms and taking X-rays of one another — all of which will be carried out inside a 13-foot-wide (4 meters) living space.

""With the same pioneering spirit as early polar explorers, we aim to bring back new data and knowledge to advance the long-term goals of space exploration,"" Wang said in the statement. ""The science and research projects onboard will inform how we prepare for future missions, ultimately helping make space more accessible to us all.""

Despite the mission's rapid-fire agenda of world-first experiments, several experts have raised doubts about how much useful science the civilian crew will be able to produce.

Fram2 is ""a notch above [a] gimmick, but not exactly a groundbreaking milestone,"" Christopher Combs , an aerospace engineer at the University of Texas at San Antonio, told CNN . Because this is a private mission, ""you need something to say [it's] different and exciting,"" which is likely why they are attempting to do so many things that have never been done before, he added.

Meanwhile, John Prussing , an aerospace engineer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, thinks so little of the mission that he initially thought it was an April Fools' joke, as the initial launch window stretched into April 1, CNN reported.

Others have questioned if the Fram2 crew is well-suited to the task at hand and whether a billionaire paying for their own space mission sends the right message in terms of making space travel more accessible.

After reading all the ""marketing hype"" around the mission, ""I didn't feel I really had a handle on the intentions of those on board or how their skills or background relate to the experiments [they will be conducting],"" Fionagh Thompson , a researcher at Durham University in England that specializes in space ethics, told Live Science.

""The claim that it will open up space for all is arguably an exaggeration,"" Thompson added. As was the case with the early polar explorers that the mission is named after, this type of opportunity is only available to ""privileged"" people and ""the elite,"" she said.

Quick-fire science

One of the biggest criticisms of Fram2 is that the mission is trying to do too many experiments at once — and will not last long enough to collect any meaningful data on any of them.

""Extrapolating any results from short time-span studies is ill-advised,"" Thompson said. Some of the data could be incorporated into existing research, she added, ""assuming they share their results."" However, ""we will have to wait and see"" if this is the case.

A standout example is the ""MushVroom"" experiment, which will be the first to grow mushrooms in space. However, this will be done using oyster mushrooms, which can take several weeks to fully grow , meaning that the team is unlikely to be able to study the entire growing process.

Experts have questioned whether the Fram2 crew will be able to contribute any meaningful data toward ""advancing"" space exploration. (Image credit: SpaceX)

Another example is the decision to X-ray the astronauts in space for the first time. While this type of scanning can reveal changes in human physiology over time, the astronauts are unlikely to experience any detectable changes after just four days in orbit, which raises the question of why they are doing it at all.

The time limitation will be a similar problem for other tests that will assess physiological changes to things like blood flow, brain anatomy and bone density. These metrics have also already been extensively studied in astronauts on long-duration space missions, such as Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams who recently returned to Earth after spending 286 days on board the ISS .

The Fram2 mission is attempting to address some health questions that have not been extensively studied in space so far, such as the quality of sleep, the effects of diabetes (even though none of the astronauts are known diabetics) and changes to the female reproductive hormones — which will be monitored by a phone app linked to sensor-rigged diapers worn by the female astronauts. However, these tests will also suffer from the same limited time window as the others.

If the true intention behind these experiments was to improve our understanding of space travel for future generations, then the funding for this mission may have been better spent on other long-term research projects, Thompson argued.

A ""space adventure""

The other key goal of Fram2 is to fly humans over Earth's poles for the first time. SpaceX has already shared images taken by the mission crew that show this has been achieved. However, this endeavour has also been questioned by experts.

""There's nothing unique to a polar orbit, and the science advantages are kind of overblown,"" Prussing told CNN. The only reason this has not been done before is that it is very fuel-intensive to put a spacecraft into a polar orbit compared to circling the equator, he added.

While no astronauts have ever passed over the Arctic or Antarctica before now, these areas have been extensively mapped by satellites with instruments much more advanced than those available to the Fram2 crew, meaning that the team is unlikely to see anything we haven't seen before.

For Thompson, the decision to execute this particular orbit, coupled with the decision to name the mission after polar explorers, hints that the mission is geared to be more of a ""space adventure"" than a research project.

Thompson says she has no problem with billionaires funding space exploration, but is less impressed with ""vanity projects,"" and adds that it is important that we can identify them when they happen. ""We need transparency and honesty,"" she said. ""If it's about being 'heroic in space' then [just] say so.""

Weather website AccuWeather has warned of the potential for a 1-in-1,000-year flood across northeastern Arkansas to western Kentucky, with the worst-hit areas to receive the equivalent of four months' worth of rain in just five days. In some cases, this will fall on areas that could be vulnerable to flooding, having already received a great deal of rainfall in recent months.

""We're concerned about the risk of life-threatening and historic flash flooding, which could evolve into a major river flooding event,"" Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather, said in a statement. ""Dangerous situations can escalate to life-threatening emergencies in a matter of seconds with a flash flooding threat as serious as this.""

Heavy rain is expected to fall from Wednesday night (April 2) through Sunday (April 6), leading to widespread flash flooding, particularly in the Lower Ohio Valley, Mid-South, and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service .

The rain is flowing into the central U.S. from the tropics on an atmospheric river — a long, thin region of the atmosphere that transports heat and water vapor. The movement of water is expected to slow down and effectively stall between now and the weekend, resulting in a massive deluge of rain in the same few areas.

""A big area of high pressure off the coast of the Southeast U.S. will funnel moisture from the Caribbean and Gulf into parts of the central U.S.,"" Porter said. ""The weather pattern will look like a traffic jam in the atmosphere, with repeating thunderstorms and downpours over the same areas. This is a recipe for big flooding problems.""

Parts of Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky are all expected to receive up to 1.5 feet (0.5 meter) of rain between Wednesday and Saturday (April 5), AccuWeather reported. Some of these same regions have already battled deadly flooding this year, particularly Kentucky, where flooding led to the deaths of at least 24 people in February.

Forecasters anticipate that the rains will ease off over the weekend, but rivers may continue to rise into next week. Porter noted that people in the affected areas should be prepared to make for higher ground.

""Relentless rainfall will cause problems along creeks, streams, and low-lying flood-prone areas first before evolving into a river flooding problem as all of the water tries to flow downstream,"" Porter said. ""Be ready to move quickly to higher ground.""",livescience

The symptoms: The patient was initially brought to the emergency room after he was found collapsed in his home. Tests showed he had severe metabolic acidosis , in which too much acid builds up in the blood. Further labs, as well as CT scans and a review of the patient's medical history, suggested the buildup was caused by a lung infection, kidney injury and, potentially, heavy drinking , as the patient had a history of alcohol dependence.

The patient later tested positive for COVID-19 and a bacterial infection. Given the complexity of the case, he ultimately spent over a month in the intensive care unit (ICU) before being transferred to a general hospital ward to fully recover. Toward the end of his ICU stay, he had started having diarrhea. His doctors put him on a probiotic that they thought would ease the symptoms, and he continued taking that probiotic in the general ward.

But then, after nearly two months of treatment, the man suddenly developed swelling and ""severe, continuous"" pain in his abdomen. Tests again revealed a high level of acid in his blood, and scans showed signs of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia , a dangerous condition in which the intestines don't get enough blood.

What happened next: While investigating the man's symptoms, the medical team took a blood sample that tested positive for a bacterium called Clostridium butyricum — the same bacteria contained in the probiotic supplement he'd been taking. A genetic test confirmed that the strain in the man's blood perfectly matched the probiotic strain.

The diagnosis: The man had contracted a blood infection from the bacteria in his probiotic — a condition known as probiotic-related bacteremia.

The treatment: Unfortunately, the patient's condition rapidly progressed to multiorgan failure, and he became too unstable for the doctors to consider surgical treatment options. ""His treatment was transitioned to palliative care and he died on the 60th hospital day,"" his doctors wrote in a report of the case .

What makes the case unique: Probiotic-related bacteremia is a known risk of taking probiotics , but it is rare. Having a weakened immune system or abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract can raise the risk of these blood infections.

When they do occur, the infections are seen most often in older adults with multiple medical conditions. In the man's case, he had a history of alcohol dependence, smoking, colon cancer, high blood pressure and chest pain due to heart disease, along with the conditions that caused his initial trip to the ER. The report didn't note how recently the man had had cancer or if he'd undergone chemotherapy, which can suppress the immune system.

While being treated, he'd also been given a steroid to tamp down the inflammation driven by his COVID-19 infection, and steroidal drugs suppress the immune system. This may have further increased the likelihood of developing a bloodstream infection from a probiotic.

Notably, this is not the only case of this particular strain of C. butyricum causing probiotic-related bacteremia.

The probiotic is widely used, especially in Japan, and generally has a good safety profile . It's given in hospital settings as a diarrhea treatment, in part because it's thought to make the gut less favorable to pathogens and more favorable to bacteria that aid digestion and help mitigate inflammation.

Antibiotics , which the man was given for his bacterial infection, can also deplete the gut of bacteria, and probiotics can help restore some of those lost microbes. But in medically unstable and immunocompromised patients, these probiotics can occasionally go rogue , the doctors warned in the case report.",livescience
https://livescience.com,"North America is 'dripping' down into Earth's mantle, scientists discover",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/geology/north-america-is-dripping-down-into-earths-mantle-scientists-discover,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:27:49 GMT","An ancient slab of Earth's crust buried deep beneath the Midwest is sucking huge swatches of present-day's North American crust down into the mantle, researchers say.

The slab's pull has created giant ""drips"" that hang from the underside of the continent down to about 400 miles (640 kilometers) deep inside the mantle, according to a new study. These drips are located beneath an area spanning from Michigan to Nebraska and Alabama, but their presence appears to be impacting the entire continent.

The dripping area looks like a large funnel, with rocks from across North America being pulled toward it horizontally before getting sucked down. As a result, large parts of North America are losing material from the underside of their crust, the researchers said.

""A very broad range is experiencing some thinning,"" study lead author Junlin Hua , a geoscientist who conducted the research during a postdoctoral fellowship at The University of Texas (UT) at Austin, said in a statement . ""Luckily, we also got the new idea about what drives this thinning,"" said Hua, now a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China.

Related: Earth's crust is peeling away under California

The researchers found that the drips result from the downward dragging force of a chunk of oceanic crust that broke off from an ancient tectonic plate called the Farallon plate.

The Farallon plate and the North American plate once formed a subduction zone along the continent's west coast, with the former sliding beneath the latter and recycling its material into the mantle. The Farallon plate splintered due to the advance of the Pacific plate roughly 20 million years ago , and remnant slabs subducted beneath the North American plate slowly drifted off.

One of these slabs currently straddles the boundary between the mantle transition zone and the lower mantle roughly 410 miles (660 km) beneath the Midwest. Dubbed the ""Farallon slab"" and first imaged in the 1990s, this piece of oceanic crust is responsible for a process known as ""cratonic thinning,"" according to the new study, which was published March 28 in the journal Nature Geoscience .

Cratonic thinning refers to the wearing away of cratons, which are regions of Earth's continental crust and upper mantle that have mostly remained intact for billions of years. Despite their stability, cratons can undergo changes , but this has never been observed in action due to the huge geologic time scales involved, according to the study.

Now, for the first time, researchers have documented cratonic thinning as it occurs. The discovery was possible thanks to a wider project led by Hua to map what lies beneath North America using a high-resolution seismic imaging technique called ""full-waveform inversion."" This technique uses different types of seismic waves to extract all the available information about physical parameters underground.

The North American craton (outlined in black dashes) has a high seismic velocity (dark blue) compared to its surroundings. (Image credit: Hua et al. Nature Geoscience (2025))

""This sort of thing is important if we want to understand how a planet has evolved over a long time,"" study co-author Thorsten Becker , a distinguished chair in geophysics at UT Austin, said in the statement. ""Because of the use of this full-waveform method, we have a better representation of that important zone between the deep mantle and the shallower lithosphere [crust and upper mantle].""

To test their results, the researchers simulated the impact of the Farallon slab on the craton above using a computer model. A dripping area formed when the slab was present, but it disappeared when the slab was absent, confirming that — theoretically, at least — a sunken slab can drag rocks across a large area down into Earth's interior .

Dripping beneath the Midwest won't lead to changes at the surface anytime soon, the researchers said, adding that it may even stop as the Farallon slab sinks deeper into the lower mantle and its influence over the craton wanes.

The findings could help researchers piece together the enormous puzzle of how Earth came to look the way it does today. ""It helps us understand how do you make continents, how do you break them, and how do you recycle them,"" Becker said.",livescience
https://livescience.com,Scientists drilled into Belize's Great Blue Hole and discovered a worrying trend,https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/weather/scientists-drilled-into-belizes-great-blue-hole-and-discovered-a-worrying-trend,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 10:10:07 GMT","Scientists took a 98-foot core sample from the bottom of the Great Blue Hole off the coast of Belize to uncover patterns of tropical cyclones over the last 5,700 years.

Tropical cyclones in the Caribbean are getting more frequent — and could increase significantly in the coming decades, evidence found buried deep within the Great Blue Hole suggests.

Researchers took a sediment core from the Great Blue Hole sinkhole, situated about 50 miles (80 kilometers) off the coast of Belize, which revealed that tropical cyclones have increased in frequency over the past 5,700 years. The scientists described their findings in a study published March 14 in the journal Geology .

""A key finding of our study is that the regional storm frequency has increased continuously since 5,700 years B.P. (before present),"" study lead author Dominik Schmitt , a researcher at Goethe University Frankfurt's Biosedimentology Research Group, told Live Science. ""Remarkably, the frequency of storm landfalls in the study area has been much higher in the last two decades than in the last six millennia — a clear indication of the influence of Modern Global Warming.""

The bottom of the Great Blue Hole

Tropical cyclones are intense, rotating, low-pressure systems that form over warm ocean waters. They transfer heat from the ocean into the upper atmosphere. Tropical cyclones can be extremely destructive, producing strong winds, heavy rainfall and storm surges.

To learn more about these storms over a long period of time, the researchers extracted the sediment core from the bottom of the 410-foot-deep (125 meters) Great Blue Hole — a massive underwater sinkhole that formed as sea levels rose during the last ice age , around 10,000 years ago. This sediment core, measuring 98 feet (30 m) long, is the longest continuous record of tropical storms in the area.

By analyzing the layers of sediment in the core, the scientists could determine the number of tropical cyclones that had occurred over the past 5,700 years. Two layers of fair-weather sediment are usually laid down every year, enabling the researchers to count back the years like the rings of a tree and compare when storm-event sediment layers were deposited.

The researchers found that tropical cyclones have been getting more frequent over the past 5,700 years, with a particular increase in frequency since we started burning fossil fuels during the Industrial Revolution.

""Over the past six millennia, between four and sixteen tropical storms and hurricanes have passed over the Great Blue Hole every century,"" Schmitt said. In the past 20 years alone, however, the researchers found evidence of nine tropical storms passing over the same region.

There appear to be two factors driving the rise in tropical cyclones, the researchers noted. Much of the frequency increases over the past few thousand years may be due to a southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

The ITCZ is a region near the equator where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern hemispheres come together, resulting in low atmospheric pressure, high humidity and frequent thunderstorms. Along the northern edge of the ITCZ is the Hurricane Main Development Region (MDR), where most tropical cyclones in the Atlantic form.

The ITCZ usually moves northward in the summer and southward in the winter as a result of changing sea surface temperatures, but it has also been steadily moving southward over the past few thousand years.

This southward migration of the ITCZ ""has probably led to a southward displacement of the major Atlantic storm genesis region, and a shift of the main storm trajectories from formerly higher to now lower latitudes,"" Schmitt explained.

A surge in storms

Increases in global sea surface temperatures as a result of human-caused climate change are likely responsible for the recent spike in tropical storms, and will likely result in even more frequent tropical cyclones in the coming decades, according to the study.

""The nine modern storm layers from the last 20 years indicate that extreme weather events in this region will become much more frequent in the 21st century,"" Schmitt said.

The researchers predict that as many as 45 tropical storms and hurricanes could hit the Caribbean before the end of 2100.",livescience
https://livescience.com,"How do smart scales measure body composition, and how accurate are they?",https://www.livescience.com/health/how-do-smart-scales-measure-body-composition-and-how-accurate-are-they,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 20:00:00 GMT","The number on the scale does not tell the whole story. Your body weight does not account for your body fat, muscle mass and bone density, and will not tell how much of it is due to water retention or digested food. To put it into perspective, two identical twins can weigh exactly the same, but based on body weight alone, one can be considered athletic and the other classified as obese. This is the key issue smart scales are trying to solve.

Smart scales, also known as body fat scales, not only measure your body weight and Body Mass Index ( BMI ), but also provide a breakdown of your body composition and how it changes over time. They look and function in a very similar way to analog bathroom scales, but unlike their traditional counterparts, these devices can connect to your phone and send measurements to a range of connected fitness apps.

Some of the best smart scales on the market can give you an in-depth explanation of your health stats, offer basic diet advice and even measure your heart rate. Their functionality outstrips that of analog devices by a long mile.

What are the potential benefits of using a smart scale?

Smart scales can measure your body fat percentage, muscle mass, bone mass and many other health metrics. (Image credit: Getty Images)

Smart scales are not just for fitness enthusiasts and can benefit a wide range of population groups, Dr. Michael Chichak , a general practitioner and clinical reviewer at MEDvidi, a health clinic based in San Jose, California, told Live Science by email. ""These include athletes who track muscle mass for improved performance and recovery, elderly individuals who need to monitor changes in bone density and muscle mass to avert complications associated with sarcopenia [age-related loss of skeletal muscle] and people suffering from chronic conditions like heart diseases or diabetes where body composition can affect the management strategies of these conditions,"" Chichak said.

However, smart scales should not be treated as diagnostic devices, he emphasized. They are not as accurate as clinically validated diagnostic methods, such as the “gold standard” Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ), which uses rays of ionizing radiation to penetrate the body and produce images of bones and soft tissues inside. Moreover, plenty of factors can affect the accuracy of smart scales, from the make of the device to hydration levels and foot placement, Chichak said.

DEXA scans are the ""gold standard"" of measuring body composition. (Image credit: Getty Images)

That is because most smart scales work using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). While this method has its perks — it is non-invasive and relatively cheap, for example — it is also prone to distortions, according to a 2014 review published in the International Journal of Clinical Nutrition .

How does bioelectrical impedance analysis work?

BIA works by sending a small, unnoticeable electrical current through your body (often through bare feet and/or hands) and measuring your body's impedance, or resistance, to this current. Tissues with high water content can transmit electric currents more easily than tissues with lower water content. This means that muscle and blood will pose less resistance to electricity than fat and bones, for example. Then, a smart scale feeds these measurements into its proprietary algorithms (often incorporating self-reported metrics like age, sex and height) that calculate your body composition. The accuracy of results depends on how well a device measures resistance and which equations it uses to interpret this data, the review authors noted.

In that regard, some commercially available smart scales leave a lot to be desired, according to a 2021 study published in the journal JMIR Mhealth Uhealth . Scientists compared the measurements obtained with three different models of smart scales with DEXA and found that these devices can underestimate both fat and muscle mass by as much as 8 kg and 8.03 kg (approximately 17.6 pounds), respectively. Studies have also shown that typical stand-on smart scales tend to be less accurate than devices that use foot-to-hand technology (a stand-on platform and handles), according to a 2022 review published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology .

When using a device where you just step on the scale with bare feet, the current skips over the waist and above, Dr. Claudia Dal Molin , a sports medicine physician and an assistant professor of medicine and orthopaedics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told Live Science by email. ""In a woman, where more fat may be in the thighs than the mid-section, this technique could over-represent her body fat percentage, whereas in a man with less fat in the thighs, this might give a more accurate result,"" Dal Molin explained.

Some studies suggest that foot-to-hand technology may improve the accuracy of body composition measurements. (Image credit: Getty Images)

However, that does not mean that foot-to-hand technology is automatically better. ""Even in products that use a handle to better include the upper body in the measurement, companies may not provide transparent information about what algorithms are used to give you their final measurements,"" Dal Molin said.

What other factors can affect the accuracy of a smart scale?

As we mentioned before, how and when you take measurements may also affect the accuracy of your smart scale’s readings. Dehydration, excess body water and even skin temperature may alter electrical resistance in the body. For example, one 1988 study has shown that BIA can overestimate body water content and underestimate body fat percentage when the measurements are taken in warm ambient temperatures.

The good news is that science has moved forward since the late 80s. ""The latest designs with bioelectrical impedance technology have improved the accuracy of the measurements of body fat and muscle mass,"" Chichak said.

For example, some high-end smart scales use multiple frequencies of electrical current to improve accuracy. These devices measure impedance in different body segments, such as the arms, legs and torso, so they can provide a more detailed analysis of body composition, according to a 2024 study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition .

The takeaway? Home scales can still allow us to appreciate trends fairly accurately, but it is important to understand that BIA measurements are data points that can be flawed, Dal Molin said. ""Lastly, few smart scales are studied for accuracy and many studies have small sample sizes. Our knowledge within specific brands and products is therefore even more limited,"" she added.

Still, it performs reasonably well in small to medium-sized rooms and does not cost the earth or require expensive filter replacements, striking a good balance for the budget-conscious.

Why you can trust Live Science Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best ones for you. Find out more about how we test.

If you type ""air purifier"" in Amazon's search bar, chances are you will see the Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier as one of your top choices. This unassuming appliance has gathered hundreds of positive reviews and it is often on sale, at times costing as little as $79.99. It sounds like a great budget-friendly alternative to some of the best air purifiers — but does the Morento MR5866 offer good value for money?

Its specifications are impressive for the price. The Morento MR5866 features three different air filters, two air inlets and coverage of up to 1,290 square feet (120 square meters). Plus, it comes with a dedicated app, voice control and an air quality monitor, and it can be connected to Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

This air purifier is slightly more advanced than the Morento HY4866 Air Purifier , a model we rated at a solid 4 out of 5 stars about a year ago, so our expectations were high.

The Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier is available in three colors: white, gray and black. Our testing unit came in white, which is perhaps why its appearance did not score highly in our books. We were also somewhat underwhelmed by its chunky shape. True, this inoffensively basic design may blend in with various home decors easily, but it lacks the uniqueness and character of some of the more premium models. If style is high on your priority list, the Morento MR5866 may not be the best choice for you.

Looks aside, it is quite a well-designed air purifier. The Morento MR5866 weighs just 9.92 pounds (4.5 kg) and comes with a small handle at the back of the unit, so it is easy to move around even with one hand. It is also very compact. This air purifier measures only 17.7 inches (45 cm) in height and 13.6 inches (34.5 cm) in width, making it a good option for desktops and tight spaces.

Unlike most air purifiers, the Morento MR5866 has not one but two air inlets, one at the front and the other at the back of the unit. This means it requires two sets of air filters, each consisting of a pre-filter that captures hair, dust and other large particles, a HEPA filter that traps airborne pollutants as small as 0.3 microns, and an activated carbon filter that helps reduce bad smells and VOCs (volatile organic compounds.)

While this dual-layer design may sound expensive to maintain, that is fortunately not the case. On the contrary, a two-pack of filter replacements costs a very reasonable $23.99 — much cheaper than similar filter replacements from other air purifier brands. In that regard, the Morento MR5866 offers excellent value for the budget-conscious.

Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier: Features

Three fan speeds, auto mode and sleep mode

Compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant

Limited air-quality monitoring

The Morento MR5866 air purifier can be controlled manually using a small touchscreen located at the top of the unit, or remotely via the Havaworks app. Plus, it can be connected to Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, so it also comes with voice control. In terms of smart features, this air purifier lived up to our expectations. Our Morento MR5866 swiftly connected to third-party devices and we did not experience any connectivity issues during testing.

The Morento MR5866 has three manually adjusted fan speeds, an auto mode, sleep mode and timer, so you can schedule its working hours in advance and leave it to regulate its fan speed based on air quality readings. This air purifier features a built-in air quality monitor and its measurements are displayed in the app and on the unit's control panel.

However, the Morento MR5866 can only track airborne particles that measure at least 2.5 microns. While this accounts for many common pollutants like dust, pollen and some mold spores, it does not include any smaller particles, of which there are plenty in the indoor air — the aforementioned VOCs, for example. We were also disappointed that the Morento MR5866 shows only real-time air quality measurements, meaning we could not track changes over time.

Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier: Performance

Good air-cleaning performance

Quiet even at high fan speeds

Fans take time to get up to speed

On the whole, the Morento MR5866 air purifier delivers good performance for the price. However, we think it is better suited to small- and medium-sized rooms than large spaces, for which it is often advertised. This air purifier takes a full hour to filter out the air in a room measuring 1,290 square feet (120 square meters), but only 12 minutes in a room that is only 219 square feet (20 square meters). This corresponds with our experience — the Morento MR5866 made a tangible difference to the air quality in our relatively small bedroom, but its effects were less noticeable in larger spaces.

To fully assess its air-cleaning capabilities, we conducted a series of performance tests using a Perfect Prime air particle monitor , a professional device capable of detecting airborne pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. We started with an ambient air quality test: We put the Morento MR5866 in an enclosed medium-sized room, measured baseline air quality and then ran it on auto mode for 30 minutes. It removed 87.8% of 0.3-micron particles, 91% of particles measuring 2.5 microns and all pollutants larger than 10 microns. These numbers are not too impressive — other air purifiers in this price range can deliver better results.

That said, the Morento MR5866 managed to redeem itself during our smoke tests. We burned matches and incense sticks to create different types of heavy pollution, then measured the changes in air quality before and after running the air purifier for 30 minutes. We conducted several tests on the maximum fan speed and auto settings, and on average, the Morento MR5866 achieved an 86% reduction in 0.3-micron particles, a 97% reduction in 2.5-micron particles, and a 99.5% decrease in particles measuring 10 microns or more. While it is not the most powerful air purifier we tested, it still delivers a good air-cleaning performance for the price.

The Morento MR5866 offers accurate measurements of airborne particles measuring 2.5 microns and more. (Image credit: Anna Gora)

We also liked how quiet it was. We measured how loud the Morento MR5866 was at different fan speeds using a Sound Meter decibel-counting app, and we did not get a measurement higher than 58 dB — equivalent to the sound of a quiet conversation. At its lowest fan speed, we could barely hear it working.

Our only grumble about this air purifier is that it has underpowered fans. When switching between different settings, they take quite a long time to get up to target speed. For example, it can take more than 15 seconds for the Morento MR5866 to switch from the lowest fan speed to the fastest. For comparison, more premium models can do that in as little as five seconds.

Amazon 's customer reviews place the Morento MR5866 at a 4.5 out of 5 stars rating, with 79% of users giving it a full five stars. Positive reviews praised this air purifier for its compact design, quiet fans, wide app compatibility, ease of use and good value for money.

As one happy user commented: ""I’m very satisfied with this air purifier’s performance. While it truly shines in smaller rooms, it still makes a noticeable difference in larger spaces, helping to improve overall air quality. [...] The noise level is low on standard settings, and while higher speeds are slightly louder, it’s definitely nothing that would keep you awake. And if you are very sensitive to sound, it has a “night mode” which is almost impossible to hear, it makes the operation quiet enough that I sometimes have forgotten it was even on. [...] For the price, it’s a fantastic option that I’d wholeheartedly recommend!""

Negative reviews, on the other hand, often revolved around individual faulty units and network-related app issues that render the air purifier ""unusable."" As one user said, ""As far as an air purifier, it does a good job. The issue is, it continuously shuts off by itself, it beeps intermittently and changes settings by itself. It is frustrating having to keep turning it on. The instructions blame it on other signals over the wireless network.""

The BlueAir Blue Pure 411i Max is a great alternative to the Morento MR5866. It is just as quiet, compact and affordable, and it comes with a similar array of smart features, but it looks more stylish and offers more powerful air-cleaning capabilities.

If you would rather stick with the same brand, consider the Morento Air Purifier HY4866 . Its looks and performance closely match the Morento MR5866, but it tends to be cheaper by around $50.

Looking for something bigger and more powerful? Then you can't go wrong with the Levoit Core 600S . It is one of the best air purifiers on the market for functionality and air-cleaning performance, but it will set you back by around $299.99.

Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier: How we tested

We tested the Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier using a professional-grade device that can detect airborne pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. (Image credit: Anna Gora)

We spent over two weeks testing the Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier, looking at its design, functionality, day-to-day performance, ease of use and value for money. We also measured how loud it was using a Sound Meter decibel-counting app and conducted a series of performance tests using a Perfect Prime air particle monitor , a professional-grade device that can detect airborne pollutants as small as 0.3 microns.

We started with an ambient air quality test: we put the Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier in an enclosed, medium-sized room and ran it on auto mode for 30 minutes, taking note of air quality changes every 15 minutes.

Next, we performed several smoke tests. We burned matches and incense sticks to create different types of heavy pollution, then measured the air quality before and after running the air purifier for 30 minutes. The smoke tests were conducted on auto settings and at the highest fan speed.",livescience

The findings, published March 7 in the journal Physical Review Fluids , could inform the design of future high-speed vehicles.

In the study, researchers used three-dimensional simulations to reveal unexpected disturbances around fast-moving cones.

At hypersonic speeds — above Mach 5, or more than 5 times the speed of sound (3,836 mph or 6,174 kilometers per hour) — the flow of air around a vehicle's surface becomes complex and bumpy. Most simulations assume that the flow is symmetrical around the whole cone, but until recently, studies of the transition from streamlined to turbulent were only possible in two dimensions so we couldn't be sure that there weren't any asymmetries in flow around a three-dimensional structure.

The findings could help engineers design stronger, faster vehicles able to withstand the extreme temperatures, pressures and vibrations felt during hypersonic flight.

""Transitioning flows are 3D and unsteady in nature, regardless of the flow geometry,"" study co-author Irmak Taylan Karpuzcu , an aerospace engineer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said in a statement . ""Experiments were conducted in 3D in the early 2000s [but they] didn't provide enough data to determine any 3D effects or unsteadiness because there weren't enough sensors all around the cone-shaped model. It wasn't wrong. It was just all that was possible then.""

Using the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, Karpuzcu and aerospace engineer Deborah Levin simulated how air flow around a cone-shaped object — often used as a simplified model for hypersonic vehicles — changes in three dimensions at high speed. They studied both a single cone and a double cone, which helps scientists study how multiple shock waves interact with each other.

""Normally, you would expect the flow around the cone to be concentric ribbons, but we noticed breaks in the flow within shock layers both in the single and double cone shapes,"" Karpuzcu said.

These breaks were particularly prevalent around the tip of the cone. At high speeds, the shock wave lies closer to the cone, squeezing air molecules into unstable layers and amplifying instabilities in the airflow. The team confirmed their findings by running a program that tracks each simulated air molecule and captures how collisions between the molecules affect air flow.

The disturbances also seem to develop at high speeds. ""As you increase the Mach number, the shock gets closer to the surface and promotes these instabilities. It would be too expensive to run the simulation at every speed, but we did run it at Mach 6 and did not see a break in the flow,"" Karpuzcu said.

The breaks could affect design considerations for hypersonic vehicles, which could be used for shipping, weapons and transportation, Karpuzcu said, as engineers will need to account for the newly observed discontinuities.",livescience

Scientists just showcased a humanoid robot performing a complicated side flip.

The company that makes the robot, Unitree, posted a video to Youtube showcasing its acrobatics. In the video, the silver-grey G1 crouches slightly, then launches up before rotating sideways through the air.

The robot catches itself primarily with its left leg and stabilizes almost immediately as the other foot makes contact with the floor. As impressive as it is at full speed, it's even more mesmerizing in slow motion, particularly the ease with which the robot seems to balance and right itself after landing.

Last year, the same model mastered a backflip. To teach G1 its new trick, the company mainly upgraded the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm it used to make the software faster and more responsive, Unitree representatives told Live Science.

""The side flip was performed under reinforcement learning training,"" they added.

A robotic acrobat

The G1 can do more than acrobatics; during a martial arts demonstration, it disarmed a baton-wielding opponent . After a series of feints with its hands, the bot executed a spinning kick that sent the baton flying from its opponent's hands.

Like its human counterparts , the robot's lightweight, compact form helps it perform acrobatic moves with ease.

The G1 stands at just over 4.3 feet (1.3 meters) in height and weighs only 77 pounds (35 pounds) G1 also sports a 3D light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) and depth camera, which gives it a 360-degree view of its environment. Perhaps most importantly, it incorporates 23 degrees of freedom, a measure of the number of joints or axes of movement available to the bot.

The G1 can also walk and run at up to 2 meters per second (4.5 miles per hour or 7.2 kilometers per hour).

The company envisions robots like G1 or its successors doing everything from helping out with chores at home to performing industrial operations to assisting with hazardous rescue missions, the Unitree representative said.",livescience

https://theconversation.com,Chinese barges and Taiwan Strait drills are about global power projection − not just a potential invasion,https://theconversation.com/chinese-barges-and-taiwan-strait-drills-are-about-global-power-projection-not-just-a-potential-invasion-253408,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 18:55:31 GMT","Is China intent on a D-Day style invasion of Taiwan?

Certainly that has been the tone of some of the reporting following the emergence of photos and videos depicting massive new Chinese barges designed for land-to-sea military operations. The fact that China launched a two-day military drill in the Taiwan Strait on April 1, 2025, has only intensified such fears.

To me, the curious thing regarding these musings about a potential war involving China, which has one of the world’s most advanced militaries, is that it is supported by reference to technology first used some 80 years ago – specifically, the Mulberry Harbours, floating piers that allowed Allies to deploy land vehicles onto the beaches at Normandy on June 6, 1944.

As an expert on the history and geopolitics of the Mulberry Harbours, I believe using the World War II example obscures far more than it clarifies with regard to the geopolitical situation today. Indeed, while the new Chinese ships may be operationally similar to their historical forebears, the strategic situation in China and Taiwan is far different.

Disquiet on the Pacific front?

The possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, an island the Chinese Communist Party sees as part of its territory, is perhaps the most pressing security issue for countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

Beijing has increasingly ratcheted up the aggressive rhetoric toward the government in Taipei during the premiership of President Xi Jinping. While one reading of Xi is that his rhetoric is in part a strategic move to burnish Chinese power globally, labeling Taiwan as a renegade or breakaway province is, for many, a clear indication of an intention to invade and bring the island within the geography of Chinese sovereignty.

From the U.S. perspective, the Trump administration gave early signals that it saw China as the main threat to its national security, though Washington’s commitments to the defense of Taiwan remain uncertain, much like the president’s ultimate policy views toward Beijing.

Aside from the geopolitics, any China decision to invade Taiwan would mean attempting an extremely challenging military operation that is, historically speaking, a risky proposition. Seaborne invasions have often led to high casualties or even outright failure.

The Gallipoli landings on the coast of Turkey during World War I, for example, led to the withdrawal of mainly Australian and New Zealand forces after high casualties and barely any territorial gains. In World War II, island-hopping by U.S. forces to push back Japan’s advance achieved strategic goals – but at a high human cost.

The difficulty posed by sea-to-land invasion is not just the battles on Day 1, it is the logistical challenge of continuing to funnel troops and materiel to sustain a push out from the beachhead. That’s where the barges come into play.

About those WWII barges …

British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was skeptical of opening a front against Nazi Germany by a landing on the French coast – a position that frustrated the United States. The main concern of Churchill and his generals was the logistical puzzle. They reasoned that Germany would either retain control of French ports or sabotage them, and that tanks, guns, food, soldiers and other necessities were not going to be brought up from reserve via ports.

The Mulberry Harbours fixed that problem by creating a set of floating piers that would rise up and down with the tide by being fixed to sophisticated anchors. Ships could moor to these piers and unload needed material. The piers were protected by an inner ring of concrete caissons, dragged across the channel and sunk into position, and an outer breakwater of scuttled ships. The Mulberry Harbours were a combination of cutting-edge pier technology and improvisation.

The images of Chinese invasion barges today show that the technology has advanced, but the principle of an operational need for logistical support of a beachhead breakout is the same.

Yet the geography of any invasion is very different. In World War II, the Mulberry Harbours were part of an invasion from an island to conquer a continent. But a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be the inverse – from a continent to an island.

Great power politics, Chinese characteristics

The use of Mulberry Harbours, as innovative as it was, was only a moment in a longer geopolitical process.

The D-Day invasion was the culmination of the transfer of U.S. military might across the Atlantic through Operation Bolero. Simply, the United Kingdom became a giant warehouse – mainly for U.S. soldiers and equipment.

The Mulberry Harbours made the crossing of the English Channel possible for these men and weapons. It was the last step in the projection of U.S. power across the Atlantic Ocean and on to the European continent. I describe this as a process of a seapower moving from its near or coastal waters to far waters in another part of the globe.

The calculation for China is very different. Certainly, barges would help an invasion across the Taiwan Strait. But China sees Taiwan as part of its near waters, and it wants to secure those waters from global competition.

Beijing views the U.S. as having established a military presence just off its coastline from World War II to the present day, making the western Pacific another set of U.S. far waters across the globe accompanying its European presence. From its perspective, China is surrounded by a U.S. military based in Okinawa, Guam and the Philippines. This chain of bases could restrict China’s ambition through blockade, and controlling Taiwan would help China create a gap in this chain.

Of course, China does not just have an eye on its near waters. It has also created a far water presence of its own in its building of an ocean-going military navy, established a military base in Djibouti, and through its Belt and Road Initiative become an economic and political presence across the Indian, Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic oceans.

Chinese invasion barges could be deployed quite early in China’s process of moving from near to far waters. The Mulberry Harbours, conversely, were deployed once the U.S. had already secured its Caribbean, Atlantic and Pacific near waters.

Part of a process

Technical matters and historical comparisons with the Mulberry Harbours are an interesting way to look at the new Chinese invasion barges and consider the operational scale of geopolitics. But as with the World War II case, China-Taiwan tensions are simply a modern example of a local theater – this time, the Taiwanese Strait – being part of a greater global process of power projection. The comparisons to Mulberry Harbours, therefore, are not with the technology itself but its role in a mechanism of historical geopolitical change.

The reemergence of the technology of invasion barges may be a sign that a new conflict is on the horizon. If that were the case, the irony is that China would be using Mulberry Harbour-type technology to secure its position in the western Pacific at the same time the Trump administration is questioning the strategic value of the U.S. presence in Europe – a presence established through World War II and, at least in part, the use of the Mulberry Harbours.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,The never-ending sentence: How parole and probation fuel mass incarceration,https://theconversation.com/the-never-ending-sentence-how-parole-and-probation-fuel-mass-incarceration-250578,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:47:24 GMT","The U.S. operates one of the largest and most punitive criminal justice systems in the world. On any given day, 1.9 million people are incarcerated in more than 6,000 federal, state and local facilities. Another 3.7 million remain under what scholars call “correctional control” through probation or parole supervision.

That means one out of every 60 Americans is entangled in the system — one of the highest rates globally.

Yet despite its vast reach, the criminal justice system often fails at its most basic goal: preventing people from being rearrested, reconvicted or reincarcerated. Criminal justice experts call this “recidivism.” About 68% of people who leave prison in any given year are rearrested within three years, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

It’s certainly easy to blame individuals for getting rearrested or reincarcerated. But if you take a closer look at life after release – which often includes employment discrimination, housing barriers and exclusion from basic social services – recidivism seems less like a personal failure, I would argue, and more the workings of a broken system.

As a sociologist, I know that people are rarely given a “second chance” after conviction. Instead, they must navigate a web of legally imposed restrictions. Roughly 19 million people in the U.S. have a felony record, subjecting them to thousands of “collateral consequences,” in the words of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. These restrictions dictate everything from what jobs they can take to where they can live.

I’ve recently undertaken research to understand the scale of this issue, aided by my former undergraduate student Skylar Hathorn, who is set to begin a master’s degree in the fall. What we found was sobering. As sociologist Reuben Miller and historian Amanda Alexander have put it, people convicted of felonies are transformed into “carceral citizens.”

Why probation and parole are part of the problem

Probation is community supervision, typically imposed by courts as an alternative to incarceration, and parole is a type of prison release under community supervision. While community supervision was originally designed to help those convicted of crimes reintegrate into society – through mentorship, supportive services and other resources – today, in my view, it largely functions as a punitive surveillance system.

Instead of helping people reintegrate, the system enforces rules – such as forbidding contact with friends or family members who have criminal records – which create new challenges for people trying to rebuild their lives after prison. As one individual from my recent study on reentry put it, “That shit ain’t helping nobody.”

On average, people under community supervision must comply with 10 to 20 conditions, such as mandatory drug tests, regular check-ins with supervising officers, or curfews. These requirements are typically set at the state, county or city level, and can be supplemented with “discretionary” or “special” conditions imposed by court or parole officials.

But while community supervision is supposed to encourage reintegration and personal responsibility, its conditions are often unrealistic, creating hidden traps rather than pathways to success.

For example, imagine you’re lucky enough to find a decent job despite having a criminal record – but your probation officer schedules weekly meetings during your work hours. Do you skip work and risk losing your job? Or miss the meeting and risk a violation? Research shows that this dilemma is common. In one study of almost 4,000 people on probation, 55% missed at least one meeting with their parole officer, increasing their risk of reincarceration.

What if you aren’t able to find a job or can’t afford to pay the supervision fees charged each month? Does contact with a family member who happens to have a criminal record defy a condition of your supervision? Will a speeding ticket land you in jail, since you aren’t supposed to have any contact with law enforcement? What happens if you struggle with addiction and fail a drug test? Or what if you forget to charge your electronic ankle monitor — will your parole officer suspect foul play?

Depending on the conditions of your release, all of these seemingly minor snags could land you back behind bars. That’s why some scholars describe this system as a “parole- and probation-to-prison pipeline.” According to recent estimates, 35% to 40% of yearly prison admissions are of people who were on community supervision at their time of rearrest. In some states, over half of all prison entries are of people on either parole or probation.

State-level success stories – and failures

Importantly, if you’re on probation or parole, your chances of being sent back to prison are very different depending on where you live. You can see just how different by visiting the Justice Outcomes Explorer, a new data dashboard created by the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System. For example, among Idahoans who began a term of probation in 2018, roughly 16.6% were sent to prison within a year. Among Minnesotans, it was just 1.6%.

According to the Justice Outcomes Explorer, parole outcomes are even worse, though yet again they vary by state. Among those released on parole in 2018 from Utah prisons, roughly 51.6% were reincarcerated within a year. In California, that number was less than 7%. Although some variation may come from differences in data collection, much of it reflects policy choices.

As sociologist Michelle Phelps explains, supervision may act as “an off-ramp for some and a conveyor belt toward prison for others.”

Part of the problem is that probation and parole offices vary considerably. For instance, some states cap how long someone may remain on parole, while others allow parole boards to extend that time indefinitely. This creates a system where, in effect, parole boards operate as resentencing entities. Differences in supervision fees, restrictions on associating with others, and the use of electronic monitoring also vary by state.

Research suggests that Americans under community supervision must comply with many more conditions than they did just a few decades ago, which raises the question: Does any of this work?

While some studies suggest that contemporary forms of supervision may reduce reincarceration, recent analyses call this into question.

For example, one study compared people who were randomly placed under intensive probation supervision — requiring more office check-ins, home visits and drug tests — with those under traditional supervision. Researchers found that while both groups committed new crimes at the same rate, those under intensive supervision received technical violations – such as failing a drug test or not following curfew – more often, and were incarcerated more.

In another rigorous study out of Kansas, using what researchers call a “natural experiment,” legal scholar Ryan Sakoda found that post-release supervision significantly increased reincarceration rates. This suggests that community supervision keeps people trapped in the system, rather than helping them escape it.

In fact, according to estimates from the Council of State Governments, almost one-quarter of all prison admissions are due to technical violations of supervision, not new crimes. And even progressive states can enforce technical rules rigidly. For instance, Massachusetts sends a relatively small number of people back to prison or jail while they are on parole. But after retrieving data from a public records request, Skylar and I found that between 2020 and 2022, roughly 80% of all parole revocations were due to technical violations.

That said, the overall number of people admitted to U.S. prisons for technical violations has fallen significantly over the past few years. In 2018, roughly 133,000 people were admitted to prison for technical violations. By 2021, that number was around 89,000 – a decrease of about 33%.

Rethinking community supervision

Historically, community supervision wasn’t intended to be a form of punishment — it’s supposed to help individuals reintegrate. But that’s not the way it currently works. If states are serious about reducing crime, they should think about reinventing the system.

In 2021, New York implemented the “Less is More” Community Supervision and Revocation Reform Act, which reformed parole and reduced incarceration for technical violations. The act limits jail time for such violations to 30 days, allows early parole release and requires court hearings within 30 days. Within the first month of being enacted, the number of technical parole violators had fallen by 40%. By April 2022, technical violators only made up 1.7% of the daily state jail population. They had previously made up about 5% on average.

Along with policies that prevent criminalization in the first place, states that want to prevent recidivism could consider dedicating more resources to programs that help people with life after release. Offering supports such as housing and even direct cash assistance would help people reintegrate into society and create safer communities, research indicates.

On a similar note, criminal records limit access to a range of resources and opportunities such as housing, higher education, voting and social benefits like basic food assistance.

Simply having a criminal record also reduces the likelihood – by roughly 60% – that someone receives a callback after applying for a job. That’s why Skylar and I support automatic criminal record expungement, among other structural reforms.

Put plainly: Research points toward a system in need of comprehensive solutions. Without them, many will remain in the incarceration trap.

Your adventure-loving kids can kayak through fjords, plunge into icy water and camp under the Antarctic sky.

But rather than being ecstatic, as you anticipated, your kids whine about skipping an after-school scout meeting at a neighbor’s house. Missing this ordinary weekly event triggers such intense FOMO – “fear of missing out” – for them that they don’t want to go on your amazing expedition.

If this kind of debacle sounds familiar to you – or at least if you find it perplexing – you’re not alone. The three of us are marketing professors and social psychologists who focus on how consumers make decisions and how this shapes well-being. We’ve been studying FOMO for over a decade and recently published our work in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Over the years, we’ve learned what really drives intense feelings of FOMO – which explains why a run-of-the-mill meeting might feel more crucial than an over-the-top vacation.

FOMO’s real trigger

People use the term FOMO in many different ways. In our research, we focus on a very specific type of FOMO: the kind that occurs when people miss out on events that involve valued social connections.

With this kind of FOMO, we found that the pain of missing out is not related to missing the actual event or opportunity – although that could be there as well. The FOMO we study happens when people miss the chance to bond with friends, co-workers or teammates they care about.

So, the critical part of FOMO is missing out on interactions with people you value. FOMO about a group dinner at a restaurant isn’t really about the food and great lighting. Nor is FOMO about a concert just about the band’s performance. Instead, it’s about the lost opportunity to connect and make memories with people who are important to you.

Why is this upsetting? Imagine the scenario where all your best friends go out to dinner without you. They bond and make lasting memories with each other – and you’re not there for any of it.

If they get closer to each other, where does that leave you? What happens to your social relationships and your sense of belonging? Do you become a less important friend? Less worthy of future invites? Or even kicked out of the group altogether? The anxiety of FOMO can begin to spiral.

People with what psychologists call an anxious attachment style chronically fear rejection and isolation from others. Because FOMO involves anxiety about future social belonging, it may not come as a surprise that people who are naturally more anxious about their friendships tend to get more intense FOMO. When we asked people in one of our studies to scroll social media until they encountered something social they missed, we found that the more anxiously attached a participant was, the more intense FOMO they experienced.

Not just missing Coachella

Getting FOMO for an amazing event you can’t attend makes sense. But if FOMO is less about the event itself and more about the social bonding, what happens when you miss something that’s not really fun at all?

We find that people anticipate FOMO even for unenjoyable missed events. As long as there is some form of missed social bonding, feelings of FOMO emerge. One of our studies found that people anticipated more FOMO from missing an un-fun event that their friends would be at, than a fun event without their friends.

For better or for worse, sad and stressful events can often be emotionally bonding: Going to a funeral to support a friend, cleaning up the mess after a party, or even white-knuckling through a harrowing initiation ceremony can all offer opportunities to forge stronger connections with one another. Stressful contexts like these can be fertile grounds for FOMO.

How to fend off FOMO

Popular discussions about the negative consequences of FOMO tend to focus on the FOMO people feel from compulsively scrolling on social media and seeing what they missed out on. Consequently, much of the suggested advice on how to mitigate FOMO centers on turning off phones or taking a vacation from social media.

Those recommendations may be tough for many people to execute. Plus, they address the symptoms of FOMO, not the cause.

Our finding that the core of FOMO is anxiety about missed social relationships yields a simpler strategy to combat it: Reminding yourself of the last time you connected with close friends may provide a sense of security that staves off feelings of FOMO.

In an experiment testing multiple interventions, we asked 788 study participants to look through their social media feeds until they encountered a post of a missed social event. We asked about 200 of these participants to immediately rate how much FOMO they were feeling. They averaged a 3.2 on a 1-to-7 scale.

Another group of about 200 participants also scrolled through their social media feeds until they encountered a post of a missed social event. But before indicating how much FOMO they were feeling, we asked them to think back to a prior experience socializing and bonding with their friends. Encouragingly, this reflection exercise seemed to curtail FOMO. Their average FOMO rating was 2.7 out of 7, a significant drop.

With the remaining participants, we tested other strategies for mitigating FOMO – thinking about the next time they might see their friends or imagining what they’d say to a FOMO-suffering friend – but the simple reflection exercise was by far the most promising.

So, reminding yourself of the meaningful relationships you already have and reaffirming your social belonging in the moment may help combat the rush of anxiety that is characteristic of FOMO.

And missing out on social bonding experiences doesn’t have to be anxiety-provoking. In fact, in our activity-packed, hectic lives, missing some “must-attend” events may be a welcome relief – especially if you remind yourself that your social belonging is not in jeopardy. Cue a recent wave of counter-FOMO programming called JOMO, or “Joy of Missing Out.”

To quote Stuart Smalley, the fictional self-help guru of 1990s “Saturday Night Live,” reminding yourself that “I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!” might be just the trick to mitigate FOMO.",theconversation

I fondly remember trips to the Fellow-Reeves Museum in Wichita, Kansas, and the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. A 1908 photograph of my great-grandparents picking cotton has been used as a poster by the Oklahoma Historical Society.

This love of learning history continued into my years as a graduate student of history, when I would spend hours at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum learning about the history of human flight and ballooning. As a professor, I’ve integrated the institution’s exhibits into my history courses.

The Trump administration, however, is not happy with the way the Smithsonian Institution and other U.S. museums are portraying history.

On March 27, 2025, the president issued an executive order, “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which asserted, “Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth. Under this historical revision, our Nation’s unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed.”

Trump singled out a few museums, including the Smithsonian, dedicating a whole section of the order on “saving” the institution from “divisive, race-centered ideology.”

Of course, history is contested. There will always be a variety of views about what should be included and excluded from America’s story. For example, in my own research, I found that Prohibition-era school boards in the 1920s argued over whether it was appropriate for history textbooks to include pictures of soldiers drinking to illustrate the 1791 Whiskey Rebellion.

But most recent debates center on how much attention should be given to the history of the nation’s accomplishments over its darker chapters. The Smithsonian, as a national institution that receives most of its funds from the federal government, has sometimes found itself in the crosshairs.

America’s historical repository

The Smithsonian Institution was founded in 1846 thanks to its namesake, British chemist James Smithson.

Smithson willed his estate to his nephew and stated that if his nephew died without an heir, the money – roughly US$15 million in today’s dollars – would be donated to the U.S. to found “an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.”

The idea of a national institution dedicated to history, science and learning was contentious from the start.

In her book “The Stranger and the Statesman,” historian Nina Burleigh shows how Smithson’s bequest was nearly lost due to battles between competing interests.

Southern plantation owners and western frontiersmen, including President Andrew Jackson, saw the establishment of a national museum as an unnecessary assertion of federal power. They also challenged the very idea of accepting a gift from a non-American and thought that it was beneath the dignity of the government to confer immortality on someone simply because of a large donation.

In the end, a group led by congressman and former president John Quincy Adams ensured Smithson’s vision was realized. Adams felt that the country was failing to live up to its early promise. He thought a national museum was an important way to burnish the ideals of the young republic and educate the public.

Today the Smithsonian runs 14 education and research centers, the National Zoo and 21 museums, including the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which was created with bipartisan support during President George W. Bush’s administration.

In the introduction to his book “Smithsonian’s History of America in 101 Objects,” cultural anthropologist Richard Kurin talks about how the institution has also supported hundreds of small and large institutions outside of the nation’s capital.

In 2024, the Smithsonian sent over 2 million artifacts on loan to museums in 52 U.S. states and territories and 33 foreign countries. It also partners with over 200 affiliate museums. YouGov has periodically tracked Americans’ approval of the Smithsonian, which has held steady at roughly 68% approval and 2% disapproval since 2020.

Smithsonian in the crosshairs

Precursors to the Trump administration’s efforts to reshape the Smithsonian took place in the 1990s.

In 1991, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which was then known as the National Museum of American Art, created an exhibition titled “The West as America, Reinterpreting Images of the Frontier, 1820-1920.” Conservatives complained that the museum portrayed western expansion as a tale of conquest and destruction, rather than one of progress and nation-building. The Wall Street Journal editorialized that the exhibit represented “an entirely hostile ideological assault on the nation’s founding and history.”

The exhibition proved popular: Attendance to the National Museum of American Art was 60% higher than it had been during the same period the year prior. But the debate raised questions about whether public museums were able to express ideas that are critical of the U.S. without risk of censorship.

In 1994, controversy again erupted, this time at the National Air and Space Museum over a forthcoming exhibition centered on the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima 50 years prior.

Should the exhibition explore the loss of Japanese lives? Or emphasize the U.S. war victory?

Veterans groups insisted that the atomic bomb ended the war and saved 1 million American lives, and demanded the removal of photographs of the destruction and a melted Japanese school lunch box from the exhibit. Meanwhile, other activists protested the exhibition by arguing that a symbol of human destruction shouldn’t be commemorated at an institution that’s supposed to celebrate human achievement.

Republicans won the House in 1994 and threatened cuts to the Smithsonian’s budget over the Enola Gay exhibition, compelling curators to walk a tightrope. In the end, the fuselage of the Enola Gay was displayed in the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. But the exhibit would not tell the full story of the plane’s role in the war from a myriad of perspectives.

Trump enters the fray

In 2019, The New York Times launched the 1619 project, which aimed to reframe the country’s history by placing slavery and its consequences at its very center. The first Trump administration quickly responded by forming its 1776 commission. In January 2021, it produced a report critiquing the 1619 project, claiming that an emphasis on the country’s history of racism and slavery was counterproductive to promoting “patriotic education.”

That same year, Trump pledged to build “a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans to ever live,” with 250 statues to mark the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

President Joe Biden rescinded the order in 2021. Trump reissued it after retaking the White House, and pointed to figures he’d like to see included, such as Christopher Columbus, George Washington, Betsy Ross, Sitting Bull, Bob Hope, Thurgood Marshall and Whitney Houston.

I don’t think there is anything wrong with honoring Americans, though I think a focus on celebrities and major figures clouds the fascinating histories of ordinary Americans. I also find it troubling that there seems to be such a concerted effort to so forcefully shape the teaching and understanding of history via threats and bullying. Yale historian Jason Stanley has written about how aspiring authoritarian governments seek to control historical narratives and discourage an exploration of the complexities of the past.

Historical scholarship requires an openness to debate and a willingness to embrace new findings and perspectives. It also involves the humility to accept that no one – least of all the government – has a monopoly on the truth.

In his executive order, Trump noted that “Museums in our Nation’s capital should be places where individuals go to learn.” I share that view. Doing so, however, means not dismantling history, but instead complicating the story – in all its messy glory.

https://theconversation.com,23andMe is potentially selling more than just genetic data – the personal survey info it collected is just as much a privacy problem,https://theconversation.com/23andme-is-potentially-selling-more-than-just-genetic-data-the-personal-survey-info-it-collected-is-just-as-much-a-privacy-problem-253220,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:48:23 GMT","As soon as the genetic testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy on March 23, 2025, concerns about what would happen to the personal information contained in its massive genetic and health information database were swift and widespread. A few days after, a U.S. judge ruled that the company could sell its consumer data as part of the bankruptcy.

The attorneys general of several states warned their citizens to delete their genetic data. California urged its citizens to request that 23andMe delete their data and destroy their spit samples. Michigan’s attorney general released a statement warning that “23andMe collects and stores some of the most sensitive personal information, our genetic code.”

When customers originally signed up for 23andMe, they agreed to terms and conditions and a privacy notice that allows the company to use their information for research and development as well as share their data, in aggregate, with third parties. If consumers consented to additional research, which the vast majority did, the company can additionally share their individual information with third parties. 23andMe has also been clear that if it is involved in a bankruptcy or sale of assets, consumer information might be sold or transferred.

While 23andMe has warned customers all along about everything that is currently happening, many are still surprised and concerned.

I’m a lawyer and bioethicist who has been studying direct-to-consumer genetic testing for almost a decade. Understanding what information 23andMe has been collecting, and how it might be used if sold or shared, can help clarify concerns for consumers.

What is 23andMe?

In 2007, 23andMe, named after the 23 pairs of chromosomes found in a human cell, was one of the first direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies to open in the United States. It was backed by a large investment by Google, which quickly attracted the interest of other investors, allowing 23andMe to thrive when many other direct-to-consumer genetic companies went quickly out of business.

The direct-to-consumer business model is fairly straightforward: A consumer orders a genetic test kit online, spits into a tube that comes in the mail, returns it to the company and accesses their results in an online portal. Over 15 million consumers bought 23andMe, and the vast majority consented to its research. At its peak, the company was valued at US$6 billion.

While the market initially believed in the value of 23andMe’s business model, its stock has been in decline for years, and the company owes hundreds of millions of dollars to creditors.

Reasons for this rapid decline include a decrease in the sale of test kits after a 2023 hack of almost 7 million people’s data, as well as a failure to profit enough from providing data access to other private sector companies. Lack of private interest in 23andMe data may be related to the fact that much of the information the company collects is self-reported, which is often considered less reliable than information written down by a doctor in a medical record.

What kind of data does 23andMe collect?

While the saying goes “If you’re not paying, you’re the product,” 23andMe managed to convince its consumers to both pay for AND be the product. It did this by selling genetic testing kits to consumers as well as collecting a massive amount of their valuable data.

And 23andMe collected more than just genetic data generated from consumers’ spit. Eighty-five percent of customers consented to 23andMe research, allowing their individual-level data to be used for studies. The company then collected information from survey questions about their personal health and beyond, such as drinking habits and risk tolerance.

This means that not only does 23andMe possess the genetic data of 15 million people, but it also possesses almost a billion additional data points associated with this genetic information. This makes the 23andMe dataset potentially very private – and very valuable.

At first, drug companies seemed to agree. For example, in 2018, 23andMe granted pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline an exclusive license to use consented customer data to develop new drugs. GlaxoSmithKline also made a $300 million equity investment in 23andMe. When 23andMe went public in 2021, its $6 billion valuation reflected the promise of this business model.

But for over a decade, scholars, including me, have been warning that allowing 23andMe to collect and use personal data was not one that customers fully understood, or were actually comfortable with.

What should 23andMe customers worry about?

In response to current public concern about data privacy, 23andMe has stated that there will be no changes to how it stores and protects data during its bankruptcy proceedings. But once that stage is through, what exactly should customers worry about?

First, law enforcement could use genetic information in civil or criminal cases. This happened in 2018, when police used the genetic testing company GEDmatch to help identify the Golden State Killer. Police pretended they were customers looking for genealogy data and sent in an old crime scene blood spot. This allowed them to connect to known suspects with blood relatives who had given their genetic information to the company as consumers. While this was in violation of GEDmatch’s own policies, the evidence was successfully used in court.

Second, genetic information could be used to discriminate against customers if it shows that they have or are at high risk of developing a genetic disease or disorder. The federal Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act prohibits health insurers and employers from asking about genetic information or using it to discriminate in work or health insurance decisions. It does not, however, protect against discrimination in long-term care or life insurance.

Many of the warnings from the media and attorneys general are focused on genetic information because it is unique to only one person. But direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies also retain a massive amount of personal information from the surveys consumers are asked to complete. Much of this information could be embarrassing if it were inadvertently or intentionally revealed, such as a person’s intelligence.

In the 2025 book “Careless People,” former Meta executive Sarah Wynn-Williams reported that Facebook would use indications of self-consciousness about personal appearance, such as deleting a selfie, to promote beauty products. If companies know such intimate details about a person, they could not only be used to sell products, but also potentially manipulate them over social media or the internet in ways they do not even realize. It could be used for targeted advertising or to build algorithms that exploit a person’s vulnerabilities.

I believe consumers are right to be worried about how their genetic data could be misused. But the survey data containing all sorts of other personal information are at least as much, if not more, of a privacy problem. This is particularly concerning if the data is pooled together with other information available on the internet, like a dating profile, to create a more detailed – and personal – picture of an individual.

I am deleting my own 23andMe data. In the future, I would also warn consumers against freely gifting the private sector with information about their fears, hopes, limitations and successes.

That information is valuable to more people than just you.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Research shows that a majority of Christian religious leaders accept the reality of climate change but have never mentioned it to their congregations,https://theconversation.com/research-shows-that-a-majority-of-christian-religious-leaders-accept-the-reality-of-climate-change-but-have-never-mentioned-it-to-their-congregations-253303,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:47:05 GMT","Nearly 90% of U.S. Christian religious leaders believe humans are driving climate change. When churchgoers learn how widespread this belief is, they report taking steps to reduce its effects, as we found in our research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

We examined data collected in 2023 and 2024 from a nationwide survey of 1,600 religious leaders in the United States. The sample included religious leaders from fundamentalist and evangelical churches, Baptists, Methodists, Black protestants, Roman Catholic denominations and more – all recruited to match the proportions of churches across the country. The survey assessed religious leaders’ beliefs about climate change and whether they discuss climate change with their congregations.

According to that data, while the overwhelming majority of Christian religious leaders accept the human-driven reality of climate change, nearly half have never mentioned climate change or humans’ role in it to their congregations. Further, only a quarter have spoken about it more than once or twice.

Why it matters

When it comes to climate change, faith communities are often seen as divided. There is an assumption that religious conservatism and climate skepticism go hand in hand. This assumption is based on religious beliefs such as that the Earth was created by God and therefore humans cannot and should not alter it, along with rejection of climate science and diminished concern about climate change.

We then surveyed a sample of Christian Americans from major denominations across the country and found they think roughly half of Christian leaders in the U.S., and in churches like their own, deny that humans cause climate change. Given the actual number is closer to 1 in 10 based on the data we examined, it appears Christians overestimate the prevalence of climate denial among their leaders by around five times the level found in polling.

Churchgoers who think their religious leaders don’t believe humans cause climate change report being less likely to discuss it with fellow congregants and less interested in attending events that aim to address climate change or raise awareness of the issue.

The research also tested what would happen if we informed churchgoers of the true level of consensus among their religious leaders who accept that climate change is driven by humans. In a brief survey, Christians were told the percentage of Christian leaders nationally, and among their denomination specifically, who accepted that human activities cause climate change. As a result, we found, their perceptions and attitudes toward climate change shifted in a variety of ways.

Specifically, churchgoers who were informed about the actual consensus among religious leaders in accepting climate change were more likely to state that “taking action to reduce climate change” was consistent with their church’s values.

Churchgoers who received this information were also more likely to feel it would be inconsistent with their church’s values to vote for a political candidate who opposes actions that could slow climate change.

These findings highlight that religious leaders have a unique power to influence climate action – but only if they let their beliefs be known.

What’s next

These findings are not focusing on what is going on in specific churches and denominations. We provided churchgoers only with information on the consensus of acceptance of human-made climate change among Christian religious leaders across the U.S. A natural next step is to conduct research with religious leaders to examine the impact of their communication directly with their congregations, including if they convey the consensus described in this work.

Religious leaders, often viewed as moral guides, have the ability to reshape climate discourse within faith communities. If they vocalize their acceptance of human-made climate change, we believe they can correct widespread misperceptions, foster dialogue and encourage action in ways that secular authorities may struggle to achieve.

The Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Christian Zionism hasn’t always been a conservative evangelical creed – churches’ views of Israel have evolved over decades,https://theconversation.com/christian-zionism-hasnt-always-been-a-conservative-evangelical-creed-churches-views-of-israel-have-evolved-over-decades-249314,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:46:50 GMT","During confirmation hearings, Mike Huckabee, President Donald Trump’s nominee as ambassador to Israel, told senators that he would “respect and represent the President,” not his own views. But the Baptist minister’s views on the Middle East – and their religious roots – came through.

“The spiritual connections between your church, mine, many churches in America, Jewish congregations, to the state of Israel is because we ultimately are people of the book,” he said on March 25, 2025, in response to a question from a senator. “We believe the Bible, and therefore that connection is not geopolitical. It is also spiritual.”

Huckabee is one of the GOP’s most prominent “Christian Zionists” – a phrase often associated with conservative evangelicals’ support for Israel.

But Christian Zionism is much older than the 1980s alliance between the Republican Party and the religious right. American Christian attitudes toward the idea of a Jewish state have been evolving and changing dramatically since long before Israel’s creation.

Theologians for Israel

Zionism’s modern form emerged in the late 19th century. Its declared aim was to create a Jewish homeland in the region of Palestine, then under control of the Ottoman Empire. This was the land from which Jews were exiled in antiquity.

The “founding father” of the modern movement was Theodore Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian Jewish intellectual and activist who convened the first Zionist Congress in Switzerland in 1897. While most of the 200 attendees were Jews from various parts of the world, there were also prominent Protestant Christian leaders in attendance: church leaders and philanthropists who supported “the restoration of the Jews to their land.” Herzl dubbed these allies “Christian Zionists.”

Catholic leaders, however, were not among the supporters of a Jewish state. The prospect of a Jewish state in the Christian Holy Land challenged the church’s view of Judaism as a religion whose people were condemned to permanent exile as punishment for rejecting Christ.

Eventually, in the wake of the Holocaust and the establishment of Israel, attitudes shifted. In 1965, reforms at the Vatican II council signaled a radical change for the better in Catholic-Jewish relations.

But it would be three decades until that change was reflected in the Vatican’s diplomatic recognition of the Jewish state.

In contrast, Protestants were more open to Jews’ aspiration to return. In 1917, the British foreign secretary published the Balfour Declaration, announcing government support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.” With the British victory over the Ottoman Empire, the area soon fell under British control in the form of the League of Nations’ Mandate for Palestine.

In the U.S., the idea elicited enthusiasm among conservative Christians who hoped that the Jews’ return to Israel would help hasten the end times, when they believed Christ would return. Within a few years, Congress endorsed the Balfour Declaration.

Pastor W. Fuller Gooch summed up the evangelical reaction to the Balfour Declaration: “Palestine is for the Jews. The most striking ‘Sign of the Times’ is the proposal to give Palestine to the Jews once more. They have long desired the land, though as yet unrepentant of the terrible crime which led to their expulsion.” This “terrible crime” refers to Jews’ rejection of Jesus – one of multiple anti-Jewish tropes in the sermon.

Pivotal moment

Two decades later, prominent American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr declared himself a supporter of political Zionism. Unlike evangelicals, Niebuhr’s support for a Jewish state was based on pragmatic grounds: Considering the dangerous situation in 1930s Europe, he argued, Jews needed a state in order to be safe.

In the early 1940s, Niebuhr wrote a series of articles titled “Jews After the War” for The Nation magazine. His biographer Richard W. Fox called these articles “an eloquent statement of the Zionist case: The Jews had rights not just as individuals, but as a people, and they deserved not just a homeland, but a homeland in Palestine.”

Thus, in the 1930s and ‘40s, two different types of American Christian Zionism emerged. Some liberal Protestants, while giving qualified support to Zionism, expressed concern for the fate of the Palestinian Arabs. Conservative evangelicals, on the other hand, tended to be more hostile to Arab political aspirations.

In 1947, on the eve of the United Nations’ vote on the partition of Palestine, Niebuhr and six other prominent American intellectuals wrote a long letter to The New York Times, arguing that a Jewish state in the Middle East would serve American interests. “Politically, we would like to see the lands of the Middle East practice democracy as we do here,” they wrote. “Thus far there is only one vanguard of progress and modernization in the Middle East, and that is Jewish Palestine.”

In 1948, the U.S. government, at President Harry Truman’s direction, granted the newly declared state of Israel diplomatic recognition, over the objections of State Department officials.

There were, of course, prominent Americans who objected to recognizing Israel, or to embracing it so strongly. Among them was journalist Dorothy Thompson, who had turned against the Zionist cause after a Jewish militant group bombed Jerusalem’s King David Hotel in 1946. These opponents made the case for supporting emerging Arab nationalism and Palestinian autonomy and asserted that recognizing Israel would deepen America’s entanglement in the unfolding Middle Eastern conflicts.

But by the late 1950s and ‘60s, American criticism of Israel was increasingly muted. Liberal Christians, in particular, viewed it as a beleaguered democratic state and ally.

Rightward shift

Conservative Christian Zionists, meanwhile, continued to often view “love of Israel” through a biblical lens.

In the late '60s, the American journal Christianity Today published an article by editor Nelson Bell, father-in-law of famous evangelist Billy Graham. Jewish control of Jerusalem inspires “renewed faith in the accuracy and validity of the Bible,” Bell wrote.

Fifteen years later, televangelist Jerry Falwell told an interviewer that Jewish people have both a theological and historical “right to the land.” He added, “I am personally a Zionist, having gained that perspective from my belief in Old Testament scriptures.”

These Christians, like some Jewish religious Zionists, saw “the hand of God” in Israel’s conquest of East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War of 1967. They considered any territorial compromise with Arab states and the Palestinians to be an act against God.

During the 1980s, as the Republican Party forged alliances with the emerging religious right, Israel would become a core cause for the GOP. Some liberal Jews who supported Israel grew alarmed by these ties and by the rightward shift in Israeli policies toward the Palestinians.

Yet this brand of Christian Zionism is clearly the forerunner to today’s – and holds sway in Washington. Today, 83% of Republicans view Israel favorably, compared with 33% of Democrats. Republicans in Congress are pushing to use the biblical terms “Judea and Samaria” instead of “the West Bank.” Evangelical Christian Zionists continue to call for support of the Israeli right and of settlers in the occupied territories.

And in Huckabee, they see a potential ambassador who shares their views.

In 2009, when Huckabee was considering a presidential campaign, he visited Israel and met with settler leaders. On hearing of Huckabee’s presidential aspirations, a rabbi said, “We hope that under Mike Huckabee’s presidency, he will be like Cyrus and push us to rebuild the Temple and bring the final redemption.” The rabbi was referring to the biblical story of Cyrus, King of Persia, and his proclamation that the exiled Jews be allowed to return to Zion.

Seven decades after the state of Israel’s founding, evangelical Christian Zionism’s influence is greater than ever. This turn to the political right is very far from the mid-20th century Zionism of Truman, Niebuhr and the Democratic Party.",theconversation

Among the devastation were 11 public and private schools and 30 child care facilities. In all, the fires disrupted the education and daily lives of over 700,000 students.

The fires first erupted on Jan. 7, 2025, in the Pacific Palisades, a small enclave of Los Angeles, and in Eaton Canyon, where the tight-knit community of Altadena is nestled in the foothills just north of Pasadena. Fierce winds pushed the flames through neighborhoods, making this one of the top five most destructive wildfires in California history.

In the immediate aftermath of this disaster, much of the focus has been, rightfully, on lives lost, homes damaged or destroyed, and the ability to maintain livelihoods. But noticeably missing from most media coverage have been the consequences of the wildfires for children and discussion of the unique challenges they face surrounding disasters.

We are a disaster epidemiologist and a disaster planner at the University of Southern California with almost 40 years of experience between us. We have studied pandemics, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes.

But when the destruction impacts your own community, it hits differently. Like many others, we were directly affected by the school closures and poor air quality in the Los Angeles area.

We both had friends and colleagues who suffered property damage in the fires, including Rita’s best friend who lost her home in the Altadena fire. Our work, which focuses on disaster recovery and resilience in children, suddenly felt deeply personal.

We are currently studying the effect of wildfires on families and what factors help children recover faster and lead to more resilient lives.

The importance of schools

School districts across the region closed their doors due to dangerous air quality and structural damage. This included the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is the second-largest in the nation, serving over 500,000 students. Some schools were destroyed, while others were left with hazardous conditions, including toxic ash from burned homes. Even when schools reopened, many parents and caregivers were worried about sending their children back into classrooms that might not be safe.

This disruption in education extends beyond a few lost school days. Research shows that prolonged school closures can significantly affect children’s learning, mental health and sense of security. After major disasters, students often experience academic setbacks, increased anxiety, and emotional distress.

According to the Education Recovery Scorecard, as of spring 2024 the average U.S. student remained nearly half a grade level behind prepandemic achievement in math and reading, which points to the long-term impacts of school closures.

Rita’s best friend who lost her home shared that when it came to her children, her immediate priority “was getting them back into some type of normalcy.”

To her, this meant sending them back to school, but this wasn’t possible right away. “With the holidays and then the fires, my daughter was out of school for almost two months,” she said.

Her concerns about her children echo those of many parents in the wake of disasters.

Learning from past disasters

After the 2020 Slater Fire in Happy Camp, California, a rural town about 25 miles south of the Oregon border, we conducted focus groups with children who had lost homes and schools.

Our study found that despite experiencing profound loss, many of the children expressed gratitude for their communities and an eagerness to rebuild. Their perspectives revealed both resilience and critical gaps in disaster response – gaps that we see unfolding in Los Angeles today.

One of the biggest lessons from the Slater Fire and other disasters is that children recover best when they are given a sense of stability and normalcy as quickly as possible. The faster children can return to a routine, the better their emotional and academic outcomes tend to be. Schools, child care facilities and structured activities all play a crucial role in this process.

Helping children cope with stress

To assist parents and caregivers in navigating difficult conversations after a natural disaster, substantial research has explored how to talk to kids about disasters.

For families navigating the emotional toll of this disaster, open conversations are key. Avoiding the topic in an attempt to protect children can make them more anxious. Instead, caregivers should create space for children to express their emotions and ask questions. Children’s responses to trauma vary based on their age and experiences, but common reactions may include anxiety about future wildfires, trouble sleeping, and withdrawing from activities they once enjoyed.

Children may react differently, and it is important to be on the lookout for signs of stress. Younger children between ages 1 and 5 may become more irritable and may exhibit signs of developmental regression.

Older children between the ages of 14 and 18 may begin to show signs of depression or isolate themselves. They may also begin to act out or engage in risk-taking behaviors. Strategies that can help children process the experience include maintaining routines, keeping an open line of communication, encouraging creative outlets and modeling desired behaviors.

Tweens and teens may also find comfort in the shared experience with their friends. Rita’s best friend shared that her 11-year-old daughter and 10 of her friends named their chat group “70% homeless,” a telling reflection of how they are processing the disaster together.

Caring for our children after a disaster

Organizations such as Project:Camp, a nonprofit that provides pop-up camps for children affected by disasters, have stepped in to offer immediate child care relief in Eagle Rock, California, about 8 miles from Altadena. These programs not only support children’s mental health by offering structured, trauma-informed care in a fun environment, but they also give caregivers the time and space necessary to begin rebuilding their lives.

The services provided by these sorts of programs can serve as models that can be incorporated into the planning process for cities and counties. This allows more time for adults to focus on recovery needs while limiting the time that children must spend alone.

For families still struggling after the LA fires, we recommend talking to school counselors, seeking community support and contacting local disaster relief programs.

Looking ahead

Rebuilding after a disaster is about more than just reconstructing homes and infrastructure. It’s about restoring a sense of security for families, especially children.

If there is one thing our research has taught us, it is that children are incredibly resilient. But resilience is not built in isolation. Rather, it comes from strong support systems, thoughtful policies and communities that put their youngest members first in times of crisis. Prioritizing schools and child care centers in recovery plans helps to ensure that children can return to safe, supportive environments as soon as possible.",theconversation

In April 1994, an Israeli rabbi named Ido Alba published an article that read, in part, “In war, as long as the war has not been decided, it is a commandment to kill every non-Jew from the nation one is fighting against, even women and children. Even when they do not directly endanger the one killing them, there is concern that they may assist the enemy in the continuation of the war.”

An Israeli court convicted Alba for incitement to racism and encouraging violence and sentenced him to four years in prison.

Now the legal system is ignoring similar rhetoric.

In December 2023, following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which resulted in the killing of approximately 1,200 Israeli civilians, soldiers and migrant workers, Rabbi Moshe Ratt, who’s seen as a public intellectual among Israeli West Bank settlers, composed a long post on Facebook.

In it, he noted that in the past, some people may have struggled with the morality of destroying an entire people, including women and children. Now they don’t. Obliquely referring to the Palestinians, he added, “Some nations have descended into such depths of evil and corruption that the only solution is to eradicate them completely, leaving no trace.”

More recently, on Feb. 24, 2025, Nissim Vaturi, one of the deputy speakers in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, called for killing all Palestinian adults in Gaza.

Ratt’s and Vaturi’s words went unpunished. In fact, genocidal rhetoric like theirs – in which the entire destruction of a people is proposed – has become more common in Israel.

As a scholar of Israeli society, I’ve written about how calls for the eradication of Palestinians didn’t simply emerge out of the violence on Oct. 7, 2023.

They date back to the 1930s, and have gained steam – and more public acceptance – as prospects for peace fell apart in the 1990s, existential anxiety among Israelis has grown, and religious Zionists have gained more political power in the 21st century.

Colonial anxieties

Calls to eliminate the Palestinian presence date to before Israel’s official founding in 1948. When Zionist immigration to the region began at the end of the 19th century, less than 10% of the population was Jewish. The native, largely Muslim population represented a fundamental obstacle to establishing a Jewish state.

The founding fathers of Zionism openly discussed ideas for relocating Palestinians, which were usually envisioned as voluntary. These notions are not entirely unlike U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to transfer Palestinians from Gaza to other countries.

Attempts to dispossess majority indigenous populations are usually violent themselves, however, and almost always run up against resistance. For example, clashes took place between British colonists and Native Americans in the 17th century, between Dutch colonists and South African tribes in the 17th century, and between Han Chinese and Tibetans in the 20th century. In that same vein, conflict between Zionist settlers and Palestinians has existed from the outset.

Repeated violence and attacks can fuel existential anxiety among settlers, along with fantasies of achieving “permanent security” or absolute safety against future threats. Among Jewish Israelis, the collective memory of persecution – culminating in the genocide of European Jews during the Holocaust – has added another important layer to the longing for permanent security.

Biblical genocidal stories

In Israel, there’s also a history of biblical justifications for violence and genocide. This sort of rhetoric has waxed and waned over time; it’ll often exist on the margins in times of relative peace, but move into the mainstream during periods of violence and existential anxiety.

Most of the forerunners of modern Zionism saw themselves as secular. Nonetheless, they adopted major Jewish symbols and treated Jewish tradition and religious texts as a source of inspiration, even as they didn’t ascribe them legal authority.

This created an opening for political leaders to use biblical texts to promote political goals.

The Bible contains some explicit narratives of annihilation. The most well known is the story of Amalek, a nomadic people identified in the Book of Deuteronomy as the archenemy of the Israelites. In Chapter 25, Moses commanded the Israelites to “blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.” A related commandment involves the annihilation of the Seven Nations of Canaan, which inhabited the “promised land” when the Israelites conquered it. In Chapter 20, the Israelites are commanded: “You shall not leave a single soul alive. Completely destroy.”

Throughout Jewish history, these edicts and stories have generally been interpreted as historical accounts or as metaphors, not commands to commit genocide.

However, settlers of lands occupied by indigenous peoples – not just in Israel, but in other countries, too – have deployed these texts to condone mass violence. For example, in colonial America, Puritan settlers justified massacres of Native Americans by comparing them with Amalek.

During the Arab-Israeli war in 1948, Israeli army education officers distributed texts to soldiers that read, “In biblical times, Saul exterminated all of Amalek, men and women, youth and elderly, and even sheep and cattle.” The materials also noted that “biblical Joshua was commanded to annihilate the nations of the land and was forbidden to make any treaties with them.”

During that war, Israel uprooted an estimated 750,000 Palestinians. Israeli forces and civilians killed thousands who attempted to return over the ensuing years.

Messianistic forces unleashed

After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, this sort of religious justification for wiping out the Palestinians returned to the margins.

But another development would fuel genocidal rhetoric.

Decisive military victories during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, also known as the Six-Day War, involved the Israeli conquest of holy sites in the West Bank. Many religious Zionists perceived the military victories as miraculous.

For religious Zionists, the state of Israel is a sacred endeavor. They’ve generally been less interested than secular Zionists in adhering to international norms and taking geopolitical considerations into account when pushing for the settlement of contested territories.

After 1967, religious settler movements were emboldened. Groups such as Gush Emunim pushed the government to settle the newly occupied territories, which included the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. For these religious Zionists, the settlement project is not simply a land grab: Settlers are taking land that the Bible has promised to them.

In 1980, Israel Hess, who then held the official position as rabbi of Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, wrote in the student bulletin, “In a war between Israel and Amalek, it is a commandment to kill and annihilate infants and babies. And who is Amalek? Anyone who launches a war against the Jews.” These words triggered public backlash and prompted protests from several secular Zionist politicians.

Existential fears grow

In the 1990s, calls for widespread violence were largely marginalized, since there was hope for a political compromise with the Palestinians.

After these talks failed, however, the rhetoric and ideas of religious Zionists continued to migrate to the political center, particularly during and after the Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada. Taking place from 2000 to 2005, the uprising involving a series of suicide attacks in Israeli cities profoundly shocked the Jewish Israeli public, spurring the reemergence of deep existential anxiety.

With no peaceful solution for the conflict on the horizon, Israeli and Palestinian figures who viewed politics through a theological framework kept accumulating power.

In 2014, Ayelet Shaked, then a member of the Knesset and later the minister of justice, shared an article on social media that read, “The Palestinian people declared war on us, and we have to fight back … and in wars the enemy is usually an entire people, with its old men and women, its cities and villages, its property and infrastructure.”

Meanwhile, the dean of Quranic studies at the Islamic University of Gaza said in a 2015 television interview, “All Jews in Palestine today are fair game – even the women.”

As each side retaliated against the other, annihilation started to sound like a reasonable solution – a process that historian Yoav Di-Capua has termed “genocidal mirroring.”

The perfect storm

This mirroring does not imply a symmetry. Israel, with its superior military capabilities, has a significantly greater capacity to inflict harm on Palestinians.

The government formed in Israel following the 2022 election was unprecedented. For the first time in the nation’s history, the government depended upon ultranationalist religious factions, such as one called Jewish Power. The party has three official rabbis who advise its politicians. One of them, Dov Lior, is a prominent advocate of the idea that Palestinians are Amalek. Another, Yisrael Ariel, has written that the Torah’s commandment “Thou shalt not kill” does not apply to non-Jews.

When the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks reignited Israelis’ deep-seated fears of annihilation, calls for indiscriminate revenge grew louder.

As Rabbi Eliyahu Mali, the head of a military program for religious students in Jaffa, said in March 2024:

“If you don’t kill them first, they will kill you. The terrorists of today are the children of the previous operation whom you kept alive, and the women are those who produce the terrorists … Do not try to outsmart the Torah. The Torah tells you: ‘Do not keep alive any soul,’ so you should not keep alive any soul.”

Some secular Israelis joined in. Danny Neuman, a former football star and television commentator, said on TV in December 2023, “I am telling you, in Gaza, without exception, they are all terrorists, sons of dogs. They must be exterminated, all of them killed.”

Kinneret Barashi, a lawyer and a television host, tweeted in February 2025, “Every trace of the murderous mutations in Gaza must be erased, from the delivery rooms to the last elderly person in Gaza.”

These statements coincide with a grim reality on the ground. Since the Oct. 7 attacks, Israeli retaliation in Gaza has cost the lives of more than 64,000 Palestinians. Public health experts estimate that the obliteration of infrastructure and corresponding starvation, lack of access to medical care and spread of infectious diseases, could bring the death toll to the hundreds of thousands.

Meanwhile, large swaths of the Israeli public appear to support the mass expulsion of Palestinians and condone the concept of genocide in the abstract, according to a recent poll I commissioned through the Israeli polling firm Geocartography.

In the representative sample of Jewish Israelis who were polled from March 10-11, 2025, 82% supported the forced expulsion of Gaza’s population to other countries, while 56% endorsed the expulsion of Israel’s Arab citizens. By comparison, according to a 2003 poll, only 46% supported the “transfer of Palestinian residents of the occupied territories,” and just 31% supported the “transfer of Israel’s Arab citizens.”

Moreover, in my poll I relayed a story from the Book of Joshua, in which the ancient Israelites conquered the city of Jericho and killed all of its inhabitants.

When I asked respondents whether the Israeli army, when conquering an enemy city, should act similarly to the Israelites when they conquered Jericho, 47% of respondents said they should.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Foreign aid cuts could mean 10 million more HIV infections by 2030 – and almost 3 million extra deaths,https://theconversation.com/foreign-aid-cuts-could-mean-10-million-more-hiv-infections-by-2030-and-almost-3-million-extra-deaths-253017,"Tue, 02 Apr 2030 00:00:00 GMT","In January, the Trump administration ordered a broad pause on all US funding for foreign aid.

Among other issues, this has significant effects on US funding for HIV. The United States has been the world’s biggest donor to international HIV assistance, providing 73% of funding in 2023.

A large part of this is the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which oversees programs in low- and middle-income countries to prevent, diagnose and treat the virus. These programs have been significantly disrupted.

What’s more, recent funding cuts for international HIV assistance go beyond the US. Five countries that provide the largest amount of foreign aid for HIV – the US, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands – have announced cuts of between 8% and 70% to international aid in 2025 and 2026.

Together, this may mean a 24% reduction in international HIV spending, in addition to the US foreign aid pause.

We wanted to know how these cuts might affect HIV infections and deaths in the years to come. In a new study, we found the worst-case scenario could see more than 10 million extra infections than what we’d otherwise anticipate in the next five years, and almost 3 million additional deaths.

What is HIV?

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system. HIV can be transmitted at birth, during unprotected sex or thorough blood-to-blood contact such as shared needles.

If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), a condition in which the immune system is severely damaged, and which can be fatal.

HIV was the world’s deadliest infectious disease in the early 1990s. There’s still no cure for HIV, but modern treatments allow the virus to be suppressed with a daily pill. People with HIV who continue treatment can live without symptoms and don’t risk infecting others.

A sustained global effort towards awareness, prevention, testing and treatment has reduced annual new HIV infections by 39% (from 2.1 million in 2010 to 1.3 million in 2023), and annual deaths by 51% (from 1.3 million to 630,000).

Most of that drop happened in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic was worst. Today, nearly two-thirds of people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, and nearly all live in low- and middle-income countries.

Our study

We wanted to estimate the impact of recent funding cuts from the US, UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands on HIV infections and deaths. To do this, we used our mathematical model for 26 low- and middle-income countries. The model includes data on international HIV spending as well as data on HIV cases and deaths.

These 26 countries represent roughly half of all people living with HIV in low- and middle income countries, and half of international HIV spending. We set up each country model in collaboration with national HIV/AIDS teams, so the data sources reflected the best available local knowledge. We then extrapolated our findings from the 26 countries we modelled to all low- and middle-income countries.

For each country, we first projected the number of new HIV infections and deaths that would occur if HIV spending stayed the same.

Second, we modelled scenarios for anticipated cuts based on a 24% reduction in international HIV funding for each country.

Finally, we modelled scenarios for the possible immediate discontinuation of PEPFAR in addition to other anticipated cuts.

With the 24% cuts and PEPFAR discontinued, we estimated there could be 4.43 million to 10.75 million additional HIV infections between 2025 and 2030, and 770,000 to 2.93 million extra HIV-related deaths. Most of these would be because of cuts to treatment. For children, there could be up to an additional 882,400 infections and 119,000 deaths.

In the more optimistic scenario in which PEPFAR continues but 24% is still cut from international HIV funding, we estimated there could be 70,000 to 1.73 million extra new HIV infections and 5,000 to 61,000 additional deaths between 2025 and 2030. This would still be 50% higher than if current spending were to continue.

The wide range in our estimates reflects low- and middle-income countries committing to far more domestic funding for HIV in the best case, or broader health system dysfunction and a sustained gap in funding for HIV treatment in the worst case.

Some funding for HIV treatment may be saved by taking that money from HIV prevention efforts, but this would have other consequences.

The range also reflects limitations in the available data, and uncertainty within our analysis. But most of our assumptions were cautious, so these results likely underestimate the true impacts of funding cuts to HIV programs globally.

Sending progress backwards

If funding cuts continue, the world could face higher rates of annual new HIV infections by 2030 (up to 3.4 million) than at the peak of the global epidemic in 1995 (3.3 million).

Sub-Saharan Africa will experience by far the greatest effects due to the high proportion of HIV treatment that has relied on international funding.

In other regions, we estimate vulnerable groups such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and trans and gender diverse people may experience increases in new HIV infections that are 1.3 to 6 times greater than the general population.

Will Oliver/EPA

The Asia-Pacific received US$591 million in international funding for HIV in 2023, which is the second highest after sub-Saharan Africa. So this region would likely experience a substantial rise in HIV as a result of anticipated funding cuts.

Notably, more than 10% of new HIV infections among people born in Australia are estimated to have been acquired overseas. More HIV in the region is likely to mean more HIV in Australia.

But concern is greatest for countries that are most acutely affected by HIV and AIDS, many of which will be most affected by international funding cuts.",theconversation

It touches upon incel online hate groups, toxic influencers and the misogynistic online spaces of the manosphere.

Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, has backed a move for Adolescence to be shown in schools, and Netflix has now made the series available to be shown for free in classrooms through charity Into Film+, which has also produced a guide for teachers. Resources for teachers and parents will also be produced by relationships charity Tender.

Adolescence is a drama and deserves the praise it has attracted. But it wasn’t developed as an educational resource, the kind that is produced in consultation with young people and schools and should be underpinned by robust research and well planned evaluations.

The series shows an extreme example of one teenager drawn into the world of the manosphere. Not all boys will see themselves reflected in this portrayal. And as a researcher working on masculinity and misogyny, my concern is that showing the series in schools may lead boys to think that they are all perceived as potential threats.

Showing the series as a teaching tool risks framing boyhood as monolithic, with one particular – and problematic – way of being a boy.

Already, a broad-brush, blame-heavy approach is often taken to boys in response to issues relating to sexual harassment and violence. “We may have a problem with boys and young men that we need to address”, Keir Starmer has said.

Boys dealing with blame

In research I have carried out for a forthcoming book on boys and masculinity, I worked with young men and boys aged 13 to 19. One 15-year-old boy said that “I am always told that I am part of the problem but never allowed to be part of the solution”. I also found that this broad blame culture leads to feelings of worthlessness in young men and boys, which shuts down vital dialogue and also may lead them to resort to looking for direction from negative spaces such as the manosphere.

It is evident from reports and evidence that young men and boys do carry out a large amount of reported sexual harassment and harms against young women and girls. This can be seen in the 2021 Ofsted report into sexual harassment in schools in England, for example. The 2025 2000 Women report states that, in the UK, a woman is killed by a man every three days.

There is evidently a serious, endemic and complex problem. The misogyny that can be popularised by toxic influencers online also needs urgently addressing.

But a “one-size-fits-all” approach to tackle “boys’ issues” may result in making things worse, not better, due to the lack of recognition of the intersectionality of boyhood. Other aspects of identity, such as race, age, class, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, sexuality and physical and mental health will have implications for the approaches that need to be taken.

Read more: How to talk to boys about misogyny

My ongoing research has demonstrated that boyhood means differing things to different boys. In steering groups with young men and boys from various ethnicities and differing social classes, a consistent theme emerged. This was a conflict between the internal and external self that the boys felt that they had to portray. This was also highlighted in a further 16 focus groups carried out on the project, again with a range of boys.

The internal self refers to who the boys actually are, including other identity traits such as race and class, and all the other intersecting aspects of their identity. The external self is what they felt they should show as a boys to fit into the hierarchy of masculinity and how they should portray themselves to fit within the social expectations of being a boy. This causes a conflict of external and internal self.

Efforts to help boys deal with issues such as the messages of the manosphere need to be attuned to the nuance of their internal selves. Generalising boys does not account for the individual identities that they bring to the issues that affect them.

Boys as individuals

The monolithic perspective of “boys” and the ensuing group blame oversimplifies complex issues, resulting in less than effective solutions and interventions that do not acknowledge or account for the nuances and complexities that surround individual boys.

This approach ignores diversities and intersecting identities and steers societal thinking about boys as a set group. It risks stereotyping them and causing prejudicial approaches. When boys are stigmatised in such a way, it compounds issues across genders, breaks down valuable communication and can also cause resentment and hostility.

One of the key voices and valuable perspectives that is missing from this debate is that of young men and boys themselves. We need to truly listen to their perspectives and their needs and build upon these as they are the experts in the world they are experiencing. Good practice accounts for and builds upon these experiences, with young people.

My research has demonstrated that young people want to be a part of these discussions rather than having things decided for them. It also shows that, quite often, we are teaching them what they already know and providing support and education that is too little, too late. We need to move away from the broad brush blaming of boys and young men and begin to approach them based upon their own individual identities – of which gender is only a part.",theconversation

Many parents, particularly of young boys, may fear they don’t know enough about what their children are exposed to online. I research radical misogyny online, and the pathways by which young people encounter these spaces. Here is what parents should know about this content.

What is the manosphere?

The manosphere is a network of communities that create, consume and distribute content online aimed at men and boys. It includes multiple groups that differ in their aims and focus, but are all largely anti-feminist.

These groups discuss masculinity, but also topics such as health, gaming, politics and finance. They trivialise hateful rhetoric through memes, comedy and trolling (provocation or bullying for amusement) by framing it as self-help, entertainment and tools for financial success. This can make it difficult for parents to identify and for children to realise the extreme messages they are being exposed to.

Manosphere content is promoted by various influencers on popular social media platforms. These influencers often showcase unattainable wealth and status, selling the illusion that followers can achieve success by adopting their teachings.

The most notable manosphere influencer is Andrew Tate, who rose to fame in 2022. He and his brother Tristan are currently under investigation in Romania for charges of rape, human trafficking and money laundering, and in the UK for rape and human trafficking. However, he is not the only influencer out there.

In recent years, there have been a number of incidents of violence that have been linked to manosphere content. The extent of real-world effects is difficult to measure, and not everyone who engages with the manosphere will go on to commit violence. But it’s clear that these communities can promote violence or spread harmful ideas about women and girls.

It is important to note, however, that this content also harms men and young boys. The manosphere promotes unrealistic expectations and extreme measures which can lead to poor self-esteem, mental health problems and, in some cases, suicide. This content preys on vulnerabilities and insecurities of boys and young men, especially related to social isolation and sexual rejection.

Misinformation and pseudoscience

Much of the content that spreads in the manosphere is based on disinformation or pseudoscientific theories. These provide an easy framework for men to assess and improve their status while framing women and feminism as the problem.

For example, the “80/20 rule” refers to the pseudoscientific theory that 80% of women are only attracted to the top 20% of men. In the manosphere, this rule is used to blame women for mens’ feelings of sexual or romantic rejection.

Influencers and community members promote step-by-step instructions that people can follow to improve their social standing. Many of these guides involve extreme or harmful physical transformations in a phenomenon known as “looksmaxxing”, which can even involve facial surgery in a bid to increase their sexual “value”.

Read more: ‘Looksmaxxing’ is the disturbing TikTok trend turning young men into incels

The manosphere has an expansive lexicon which is used to incite hatred towards women and fuel rivalry between men. Common terms include:

Red pill : TRP, the manosphere’s core philosophy, derived from the Matrix, frames the red pill as an awakening to feminism’s oppression of men. The blue pill represents ignorance, and the black pill, used by incels, as accepting their “terminal” celibacy status.

Amog (alpha male of the group), Alpha, Gamma, Omega, Sigma, Sub-5 - These terms categorise and compare men and their social status. While sigma and alpha males or Amogs are considered the top of the hierarchy, the terms gamma, omega, and sub-5 denigrate men perceived to be of a lower status.

White Knight, Soyboy : Derogatory terms describe men who are viewed as being subservient to women.

Awalt (All women are like that), Foid/Femoid (female humanoid), Becky, Carousel: Terms used to denigrate and dehumanise women.

Parents should not panic if they hear their children using manosphere terms. They may not fully understand their meanings and may have encountered them innocently. However, changes in how boys talk about women and girls, withdrawal from family and friends, and frequent use of these terms can be an indication that they are being influenced by the manosphere.

Supporting your child

Most adolescents will come across manosphere content at some point. A recent survey found that 59% of boys accessed manosphere content through innocent and unrelated searches. This doesn’t necessarily mean that they endorse the misogynistic values spread by these groups.

Here are some steps you can take to support your child.

1. Explore online together

Research commissioned by media regulator Ofcom found that children were more likely to come across harmful content if their parents are less engaged in what they are doing. Watching content that relates to your children’s hobbies, and sending them content you think they would like, can help train algorithms to promote more moderate content and open up an avenue for discussion.

Engaging online with your child can be a natural way to start conversations about what they are exposed to. It is important that you are not trying to intervene or critique, but rather understand why they enjoy watching certain influencers or content.

2. Encourage reflection and media literacy

Research suggests that teaching children to be sceptical about what they see online can inoculate them against mis- and disinformation.

The most obvious disinformation they are most likely to come across in the manosphere may be in the form of statistics, summaries of “academic” reports, and news articles about instances of female aggression or false rape allegations. They may also come across misleading content in educational or self-help posts, about improving their appearance or how to be successful.

Ask your children why they trust certain influencers and where they think their friends get their information. These kinds of questions can help them develop their own fact-checking skills without it seeming like a lesson.

3. Ask open-ended questions

Asking children about what they consume or what slang they use online can feel cringe. The best way to get around this is to ask simple open-ended questions such as “How do boys in your class talk about girls?” or “Have you ever heard of…?”

What you hear may be shocking, but approach it with curiosity and without judgment or dismissal to let them know they can share things with you.

If you are concerned about your child’s behaviour, you can also get support from resources such as Young Minds mental health support, the Center for Countering Digital Hate’s free parents guide or the government’s radicalisation helpline ACT Early. Getting support from government services is not a punishment. It won’t go on a person’s criminal record, but can provide access to governmental services like Prevent.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,What these new landing barges can tell us about China’s plans to invade Taiwan,https://theconversation.com/what-these-new-landing-barges-can-tell-us-about-chinas-plans-to-invade-taiwan-253044,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:17:16 GMT","China’s intentions when it comes to Taiwan have been at the centre of intense discussion for years. Both mainland China and Taiwan claim to represent the “real” China after the Kuomintang nationalist party under Chiang Kai Shek retreated across the Taiwan Strait and established the Republic of China there in 1949. Ever since then, mainland China – the People’s Republic – has maintained a claim over Taiwan.

But in recent years, Chinese leaders – including the current president, Xi Jinping – have talked of plans for “reunification” which would bring Taiwan and its population of 23 million under the control of Beijing. By force if necessary.

Now, the recent appearance of a handful of odd-looking barges at a beach in Guangdong province in the People’s Republic may be a significant movement towards that unwelcome potential outcome.

The Shuiqiao barges filmed in March 2025 working together to form a relocatable bridge – the name means “water bridge” – enable the transfer of vehicles, supplies and people between ship and shore, over shallow beaches and potential obstacles on to firm ground. Analysts have already pointed out that there is no obvious commercial role for such large vessels, so the most likely purpose is for landing armed forces during amphibious operations.

All major navies maintain some form of amphibious capability. The UK’s Royal Fleet Auxiliary, for example, operates the UK’s three bay class landing ships, which are due to be replaced by six modern multi-role strike ships. What is particularly significant, however, is that the Shuiqiao offers capabilities along similar lines to the Mulberry harbours built for the D-Day Normandy landings.

The specialised nature of these landing barges, with only one real purpose – to help land large numbers of military forces, stands in contrast with mainstream amphibious vessels. Bay class ships, for example, continue to be used for civilian evacuations, humanitarian aid, disaster relief and a wide range of military roles.

That is a crucial distinction as amphibious operations present huge logistical challenges. D-Day required 850,000 troops, 485,000 tons of supplies and 153,000 vehicles to be landed safely over the first three weeks. Ports tend to be difficult to seize intact, as was demonstrated to great cost during the 1942 raid on Dieppe, so it is generally necessary to land armies over the invasion beaches.

The ability to install temporary harbours, which is what the Shuiqiao bridges appear to provide, offers a means of quickly landing large forces from bigger ships to shore. That also reduces the number of specialised landing ships required, by enabling the use of commercial vessels for ferrying troops to those makeshift ports.

Is an invasion of Taiwan imminent?

What is of concern is that such specialised landing barges are not normally constructed until shortly before they are intended to be used. The Mulberry harbours went into production only a year before the Normandy landings. This is both to ensure they are in good working order when required, but also as they tend to offer little additional value and yet come at a significant price. In this present case, the nearest comparable civilian and military vessels cost hundreds of millions of dollars each.

This does not mean that their appearance guarantees that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is imminent. At present there are reported to be three completed prototype landing barges ready for deployment and three under construction. This would offer one or two beach bridges, each an estimated 820 metres long.

That would be of minimal value in a major invasion. The single US Navy Jlots modular floating pier in Gaza, for example, was only able to land 8,800 tonnes of aid in 20 days. While the Gaza effort was affected by bad weather, any Shuiqiao landing bridges would face much more dangerous wartime conditions. Three to six barges could also still plausibly be intended for disaster relief, even if does not seem a particularly cost-effective means of delivering aid.

But if the number of these barges continues to increase then the assumption must be that a major amphibious expedition is likely within the next decade. Historically, neither the UK, US or any other major power has maintained more than a handful of such highly specialised landing vessels, except for when they intended to use them. In the case of these barges the target may not necessarily be Taiwan – although it would be the most obvious target.

Assuming that an invasion does not trigger a world war, it might still be unsuccessful. Despite years of preparation and near complete control of the sea and skies, the Normandy landings were incredibly perilous and at times looked at risk of defeat. Success came at great cost in lives, through great skill, and at times a little luck. More than 4,400 allied soldiers are believed to have died within the first 24 hours alone, with many more wounded.

Furthermore, getting forces ashore is only part of the challenge. Taiwan’s geography is not suited to rapid movement inland and in similar historic cases that has led to significant additional casualties and delays.

The battle of Anzio during the 1944 invasion of Italy, for example, registered tens of thousands of casualties as the allies struggled to break out of the beachhead. Likewise, at Gallipoli in 1915, repeated failures to move inland saw allied forces suffer hundreds of thousands of casualties only to eventually withdraw.

As a historian who is fond of China, I can only hope that these prototypes will remain just that and this will join the list of other forgotten moments in world history. If not, then the conflicts we have seen since the cold war and even those of the past few years may look minor in comparison to what could be unleashed as a result of an invasion of Taiwan.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Engineering hope: how I made it my mission to help rebuild Ukraine’s critical infrastructure,https://theconversation.com/engineering-hope-how-i-made-it-my-mission-to-help-rebuild-ukraines-critical-infrastructure-251857,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:02:31 GMT","The war in Ukraine is often marked by specific dates, like February 24, 2022 – the day of the full-scale invasion. But for many Ukrainians, that February never really ended. For me, then a 22-year-old master’s student in construction engineering, that day shattered everything I understood about my future. I was glued to my phone, refreshing news updates in a frantic attempt to make sense of the chaos.

The distant echoes of explosions rumbled through the city, shaking windows and setting off endless car alarms. Air raid sirens wailed, their sound slicing through the early morning stillness. Outside, people hurried past with suitcases, their faces pale and tense, while others lined up at pharmacies and ATMs, their hands trembling as they stocked up on essentials.

My family and friends sent frantic messages (Are you safe? Are you leaving? What do we do?) but no one had an answer. Fear settled in like a second skin, thick and suffocating. The streets, once familiar, now felt unrecognisable, transformed by the weight of uncertainty.

We were all touched by the war, including my family. My father, who is a scientist and professor of Mykolaiv University of Shipbuilding, voluntarily joined the military forces to fight for Ukraine and give my family the possibility to work and study while the war raged outside.

Meanwhile, my hometown, Mykolaiv – previously a strategically important shipbuilding and port city on the Black Sea – became a key stepping-stone for Russian forces on the road to Odesa. It is very close to currently occupied territories and the frontline.

The Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges.

Controlling access to the city and its bridges was crucial in the battle for Ukraine. The destruction of these bridges cut off vital supply routes, leaving Mykolaiv isolated and struggling to hold the line. What were once ordinary crossings became symbols of survival, as the city fought to stay connected and withstand the siege.

As my home was attacked, I realised something fundamental: bridges were not just engineering projects. They were lifelines.

Engineering hope

Rebuilding bridges and roads is about more than repairing physical structures; it is about restoring security, economic stability and vital connections between communities. A collapsed bridge isolates people from essential services, disrupting supply chains and deepening vulnerability. The war has exposed just how critical Ukraine’s infrastructure is for survival.

Mykolaiv is one of the hardest-hit regions. According to the Ukrainian government, more than 20 bridges were destroyed or severely damaged by Russian attacks, including the Inhul Bridge, a vital artery for the city.

The Snihurivka Bridge, another key crossing, was also wiped out, leaving thousands stranded without reliable access to healthcare and supplies. For months, humanitarian aid and commerce were forced onto alternative, unreliable routes, further isolating communities. The reconstruction of key bridges in my home region has allowed life to resume, but the scale of the challenge across the country remains immense.

Elsewhere, the destruction has been just as devastating.. The Irpin Bridge, north-west of Kyiv, which once carried 40,000 vehicles a day, became a symbol of both loss and survival. Ukrainian forces had to destroy the bridge to stop Russian advances on Kyiv. Thousands of civilians fled across its wreckage under fire.

Science: a light in the dark

Fast forward to the autumn of 2022. Ukraine’s power grid was under relentlessattack. Entire cities were plunged into darkness. I sat at my desk in Lviv, in western Ukraine, where I have been working on my PhD thesis. My laptop battery was draining and a single candle flickered beside me. I was writing a research paper on strengthening methods for buildings and infrastructure. Yet, all around me real infrastructure was collapsing, making my work feel disconnected from reality.

Nadiia Kopiika

The city had endured weeks of missile strikes targeting critical infrastructure and power cuts became part of daily life. Simple tasks like boiling water for tea, charging a phone, or even sending an email became unpredictable challenges. The hum of generators filled the streets and people lined up at charging stations trying to stay connected. The darkness wasn’t just outside, it seeped into everything, a constant reminder that the war was never far away.

At that moment, a question struck me: what if science could help rebuild Ukraine? Could research, something that had once felt so theoretical, actually make a difference in the aftermath of war?

My supervisor introduced me to BridgeUkraine: a research alliance of people focused on rebuilding Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. It was founded by two leading experts in disaster recovery and engineering: Stergios-Aristoteles Mitoulis, the head of structures at the University of Birmingham’s School of Engineering and Sotirios Argyroudis, reader of infrastructure engineering at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Brunel University.

The project aimed to not only repair what was damaged but to build better infrastructure: homes that are more resilient, more sustainable and ready for future crises. Mitoulis recalled that the whole idea for BridgeUkraine was born out of a deeply personal moment:

I first thought of BridgeUkraine when I spoke with my former MSc student, Marat Khodzhaiev, who was in Ukraine when the war started. He was stranded in his house and at risk of missing the opportunity to graduate from his MSc course in the UK. All bridges around him had collapsed, there was no escape route. His wife was pregnant at the time. That call made me realise the urgent need, not only to rebuild infrastructure, but also to support and empower Ukrainian engineers to build their future. BridgeUkraine became more than just a research alliance, it became a mission that ensures that Ukraine’s recovery will be driven by its own people, equipped with the best knowledge and tools to rebuild their country.

The KSE Institute estimates that more than 300 bridges across Ukraine require urgent reconstruction, with damages exceeding US$2.6 billion. But this isn’t all about infrastructure; it is about securing Ukraine’s independence and ensuring that its economy and society can function even under the most difficult conditions. Every bridge rebuilt is a step toward recovery, a restored connection between families and communities, and a symbol of resilience.

To address these challenges, rebuilding Ukraine’s infrastructure cannot follow conventional methods. The sheer scale of destruction demands a new approach, one that not only restores what was lost but strengthens the country for the future.

At BridgeUkraine, we are developing solutions that prioritise resilience over quick fixes. Instead of rebuilding vulnerable structures, we are integrating sustainable materials, climate-adaptive engineering, and strategic planning to ensure that Ukraine’s transport networks are built to last.

Rebuilding fairly and efficiently

A comprehensive assessment conducted by the government of Ukraine, the World Bank Group, the European Commission, and the United Nations estimates that the total cost of Ukraine’s reconstruction and recovery stands at approximately €506 billion (US$524bn) over the next decade. This underscores the necessity for continued and enhanced international support to address the extensive needs arising from the conflict.

There are no academic guidelines on how to rebuild after such destruction. What is the most effective way to approach reconstruction in this context? We quickly came to the realisation that conventional methods were too slow and rigid to address the urgent and widespread damage.

Our research team wanted to re-imagine how to rebuild infrastructure and homes that are resilient to future challenges, from war-related destruction to climate-induced disasters. As Mitoulis told me:

Rebuilding infrastructure is not just about restoring roads and bridges, it’s about rebuilding lives. Our approach is centred on people, ensuring that the infrastructure is designed by Ukrainians, for Ukrainians. It must not only reconnect communities but also support economic recovery and long-term resilience.

But such ethical reconstruction must be inclusive, sustainable and community-driven, ensuring that those who depend on infrastructure have a say in how it is rebuilt.

Reconstruction must be a participatory, creative effort – one that rebuilds cities with beauty and meaning, connecting them to their past while preparing for the future. Too often, post-war recovery efforts have been dictated by external donors, prioritising short-term economic gains over long-term resilience.

People like me, who have grown up in these places, understand the culture, the rhythm of daily life, and the importance of preserving identity as well as buildings. We want to see our cities restored in a way that reflects our history and spirit.

For example, in post-second world war Warsaw, reconstruction efforts initially ignored the city’s historical character in favour of Soviet-style urban planning. It was only through the persistence of local architects and historians that parts of the Old Town were painstakingly restored to reflect their original designs.

Ukraine cannot afford such myopic, profit-driven decision-making. Instead, it must empower local communities, integrating their knowledge, needs and skills into the reconstruction process.

This vision started to take shape through workshop discussions with experts in geography and urban planning. Everyone agreed on the need for an adaptable transportation system where modular designs and relocatable, prefabricated bridges (like the Mabey bridge in US) could respond to evolving demands and disruptions.

Similarly, at the ReBuild Ukraine 2024 conference leading engineers, policymakers and researchers showcased groundbreaking technologies designed to accelerate reconstruction while reducing long-term environmental and economic risks (for example, nature-based solutions, 3D-printing, Virtual Reality and Building Informational Modelling).

Revolutionising damage assessment with AI, radar and satellite imagery

But to effectively plan for recovery and reconstruction, it’s crucial to first accurately characterise the damage. A clear picture of what has been destroyed allows for smarter decisions, prioritising the most urgent repairs and using resources effectively.

Our latest research, published in Automation in Construction, introduces a faster, more precise way to assess damage to key infrastructure, particularly bridges. Bringing together expertise from a large multidisciplinary team, we developed a new approach that combines satellite images and radar and artificial intelligence to swiftly and accurately analyse damage.

This technology allowed us to assess the condition of bridges remotely, without having to be onsite in dangerous or inaccessible areas. By providing rapid, data-driven insights, our method helps ensure that reconstruction efforts start where they are needed most, speeding up recovery and making rebuilding efforts more effective.

We tested this approach on numerous bridges in the Irpin region of Ukraine, and the results were striking. It significantly improved both the speed and accuracy of damage assessments. Using Sentinel-1 SAR images (radar satellite images from the European Space Agency’s Copernicus program), crowdsourced data (photos and reports from people on the ground), and high-resolution imagery, we developed a comprehensive approach for damage detection and classification.

This approach works on multiple levels: it provides a big-picture view of damage across entire regions while also zooming in on specific structural issues in individual bridge components. By combining satellite data with detailed images, our method makes damage assessments more precise, faster and safer, ensuring that reconstruction efforts focus on the most critical areas first.

These findings can play a crucial role in damage and needs assessment such as those conducted by the World Bank.

Sustainable infrastructure

In war zones, destruction often affects vital humanitarian and evacuation corridors, making it essential to prioritise reconstruction based on factors such as the national importance of a bridge, its role in border crossings, and its impact on social services.

For instance, the failure of a bridge could disrupt emergency response efforts, further complicating recovery.

But rebuilding after a disaster is also an opportunity to create something stronger, smarter, built to last – and with a sustainable focus.

Given Ukraine’s commitment to net-zero emissions and resilience, we expanded our research [and published a study] which introduced an innovative model for rebuilding infrastructure that can withstand future hazards while minimising carbon emissions. At its core, the model features a “smart prioritisation system” that helps decision-makers allocate resources effectively. It assesses key factors such as repair urgency, community impact and long-term durability, ensuring that rebuilding efforts provide the greatest benefits where they are needed most.

For example, when assessing damaged structures, the system prioritises projects that will provide the most long-term benefits. That might mean restoring energy systems to prevent future blackouts or repairing bridges that serve as key evacuation routes and economic lifelines.

As Stanislav Gvozdikov, deputy director of Euro-integration Process at Ukraine’s State Road Research Institute, told me: “Every bridge we restore, every road we reopen, isn’t just about infrastructure, it’s about restoring life, reconnecting families and ensuring that communities have the resilience to withstand whatever comes next.”

This is already a reality near my home town, Mykolaiv, where newly rebuilt bridges have restored transport links and also revived local economies, giving people hope for the future.

But no one rebuilds a country alone.

The UK-Ukraine 100-year agreement, announced in February 2025, underscored a deep commitment to Ukraine’s security, economic resilience, and post-war reconstruction. The partnership recognises the importance of cooperation between the UK and Ukraine to strengthen technological innovation and to increase collaboration in transport more widely.

I’ve also had the privilege of working with some of the brightest minds in the field, including more than 50 practitioners, consultants, academics, institutions and international bodies. This alliance of experts was united by a shared vision: to change the way the world approaches post-war reconstruction.

A key part of this mission is training engineers, equipping them with the latest knowledge in damage assessment, resilience-based and people-centred design and international standards to lead Ukraine’s reconstruction.

We come from different backgrounds – engineering, economics, policy, humanitarian efforts, and governmental bodies. But we all share the same motivation in wanting to help our country.

Leading researchers from Ukraine specialising in AI technologies, infrastructure engineering, sustainable and energy-saving buildings or climate change, are also members of BridgeUkraine. AI-specialist, Ivan Izonin has spoken passionately about how he believes that the collaborative efforts we have started “will lay the foundation for large-scale scientific projects that will be pivotal in post-war reconstruction…”. While Natalya Shakhovska , also a specialist in AI, recalled: “My activity in the BridgeUkraine alliance gave me the opportunity to align my research to critical infrastructure assessment, enabled by my AI modelling…Today I really feel included, I understand that my expertise is helping [my country’s recovery]”

Another enthusiastic Ukrainian researcher, Khrystyna Myroniuk, who specialises in building physics, told me how the collaboration had given her the opportunity to continue her “research on sustainable housing solutions for Ukraine”.

Stopping the brain drain

One of the most critical challenges facing Ukraine today, aside from the physical destruction, is the brain drain – the mass exodus of skilled professionals who left the country in search of safety and better opportunities abroad.

This trend has had a significant impact on the country’s ability to rebuild. Engineers, architects and other highly trained specialists have long been a pillar of Ukraine’s development. But the war has forced many to leave, with no clear path back to contribute to the reconstruction effort. BridgeUkraine is helping to reverse this trend by offering a compelling reason for these skilled professionals to return.

Our engagement with Ukrainian engineers then sparked another idea: what if we trained local professionals to apply our expertise, equipping them to drive this transformation within their engineering communities?

This vision became the foundation of the Empower Ukraine programme, through which, over 5,000 engineers and scientists will be trained in European (Eurocodes) and international design standards.

This ensures that Ukraine’s recovery is driven by its own people, equipped with the latest global knowledge. By bridging the knowledge gap and integrating the best methods and ideas from across Europe, Ukraine can position itself as a leader in resilient infrastructure design.

Our research was taken up by the Ministry of Restoration of Ukraine. Stanislav Gvozdikov collaborated with us to launch a joint programme of Continuing Professional Development seminars for engineers designed to help them stay up to date with the latest knowledge and skills in their field. To date, our expertise has been shared with over 1,500 Ukrainians.

Argyroudis emphasised to me how critical the role of engineers will be in Ukraine’s reconstruction, saying: “It’s about rebuilding Ukrainian identity as a country.”

The ultimate goal is to build a culture of innovation and self-reliance among local professionals who have the expertise and passion to drive this change.

Professionals can now contribute to projects and be part of a larger community of practice, which brings together engineers, academics and international partners.

I am, personally, incredibly proud to have had the privilege, over the past two years, to help empower Ukrainians to develop world-leading research that accelerates their country’s recovery.

Shaping tomorrow

My hometown, Mykolaiv, still bears the scars of war. Returning there, I saw firsthand what was lost. But also what could be rebuilt. War has taken, and continues to take so much, but it has also forged a new generation of engineers who understand that our profession is no longer just about calculations and designs. It is about resilience, survival and national recovery.

Nadiia Kopiika

Three years ago, I would have imagined a very different career for myself. But today, I know that engineering is more than my profession, it is my mission.

I am committed to ethical and inclusive infrastructure recovery in Ukraine, because science must be the foundation of national resilience. Ethical reconstruction must prioritise people over profits, creating systems that empower and strengthen communities.

Ukraine’s recovery is about setting a global precedent for post-conflict reconstruction. Our research, training programs and commitment to innovation are laying the groundwork for a stronger, more connected Ukraine, offering a paradigm shift to the war-torn world. Because rebuilding is about more than replacing the past. It is about creating a future that can withstand whatever comes next.

https://theconversation.com,How Islamic State used video to legitimise its caliphate,https://theconversation.com/how-islamic-state-used-video-to-legitimise-its-caliphate-252214,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:17:11 GMT","The rise of the self-styled Islamic State (IS) has been described as an “accident of history” which took place as a result of the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003.

The extremist organisation had existed as a mere “paper state” since its founding as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) in October 2006. But the video release of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declaring himself the caliph on July 4 2014 marked a turning point in contemporary history.

IS subsequently published hundreds of videos, some of which shocked the world with their graphic violence. Ideological enemies of the caliphate were executed by beheading or being burned alive.

But while the violence mobilised global opposition to what the then-US president, Barack Obama, called IS’s “bankrupt” ideology, the group used video as its go-to medium for IS propaganda and recruitment.

The group’s official videos, generally described as “slick” and “Hollywood-esque”, heavily emphasised two vital aspects of its identity: Islamic and state. The Islamic aspect of IS has been debated at length by scholars – especially the question of how much they had to do with Islam, if at all. But little research has been done to investigate the statehood claim made by IS.

Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo

The fact IS termed itself as Islamic State, or ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah (الدولة الإسلامية) in Arabic, demonstrated its claim to be a state in the truest sense of the word – not just to citizens living in the territory it controlled, but to its supporters and enemies worldwide.

IS also presented evidence of state-building activities in the form of official propaganda releases. These aimed not only to back up its statehood claims but to seek recognition from its subjects and supporters for the caliphate project.

For our book, Islamic State, Media and Propaganda: Performances of the ‘Visual Caliphate’, we conducted an in-depth visual analysis of 374 official IS videos. These were published between the caliphate’s establishment in July 2014 and its dismantlement in July 2017, and collected from various online IS channels before their takedown in mid-2015, when Twitter started suspending thousands of pro-IS accounts en-masse.

We looked at the videos IS produced through four different analyses.

1. Population

The population analysis reveals IS’s portrayal of itself as a vibrant Islamic society. IS depicted its people as a cohesive community living under shariah law, emphasising gendered roles and the Bay’ah citizenship agreement, which privileged Sunni Muslims while marginalising minorities.

This analysis highlights the disproportionate portrayal of men as fighters and breadwinners. Women, meanwhile, were largely invisible on screen, confined to domestic roles as wives and mothers. Young boys were groomed as future fighters while girls were portrayed as “pearls of chastity” and trained to raise the next generation of the caliphate.

Surprisingly, women did make a one-off appearance when they were shown fighting alongside men on the battlefield as the caliphate was on its last legs.

2. Territory

This analysis unravels three stages of IS’s expansionist territorial strategy. First, identify enemy targets and territory. Second, attack and defeat the enemy. Finally, project the victory to followers and opponents alike.

The videos also show IS exercising sovereignty over its territory – aiming to legitimise its rule in the eyes of its subjects, and encourage global supporters to emigrate, join and defend IS.

The group projected itself as a de facto sovereign state capable of capturing, controlling and defending its territory with the help of modern technology such as drones, maps and weaponry. It depicted any severe military setbacks it suffered as a divine test – and heavily downplayed their importance.

3. Governance

This showcases IS’s efforts to project itself as a modern state by documenting its governance practices, including law enforcement, public services and administration. IS presented itself as a revolutionary state that brought peace and security to a war-torn region.

Associated Press/Alamy Stock Photo

The governance mode of analysis highlights IS’s theatrical performances of its ability to run a state. Videos showed civil servants working in offices as well as civilians engaging with the state institutions they ran. They regularly featured state symbols such as the IS flag and its gold dinar currency.

These displays of performative governance were made at a time when the caliphate was constantly pummelled by military operations conducted by both US- and Russia-led coalitions.

Despite its strict Salafi identity (an orthodox Islamic movement that advocates a return to the practices and beliefs of the first three generations of Muslims), IS presented itself as a modern state by deploying tools such as its own branding, currency, infrastructure and taxation.

4. Foreign policy

IS interactions with other states and non-state actors were presented as foreign policy. It rejected the modern international system, which it deemed un-Islamic, and refused to seek recognition from the international community. Instead, IS engaged in “rebel diplomacy” with other jihadi groups. The aim was to co-opt them into its global network of affiliates.

Our analysis reveals how IS used civilian casualties caused by coalition airstrikes to justify terror attacks abroad. It also selectively quoted Islamic texts to legitimise its actions, and took matters into its own hands when religious teachings did not fit its narrative.

An example of this was the horrific burning alive of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh. According to a narrative attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, burning alive as a form of punishment is forbidden in Islam.

Our research underscores IS’s unique status as a jihadi organisation that came close to establishing a de facto state. This was an unprecedented feat in contemporary history, and shows how IS’s theatrical performances of statehood were carefully scripted and staged. Jihadi-led violence has subsided across the Middle East and North Africa since the territorial collapse of IS in 2017.

But it has risen in other regions of Asia and Africa, including Central Asia, East Africa and the Sahel region. So our findings can help in the understanding of how the blueprint of the caliphate might inspire and influence existing and future jihadi movements with statebuilding ambitions.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,US Senator Cory Booker just spoke for 25 hours in Congress. What was he trying to achieve?,https://theconversation.com/us-senator-cory-booker-just-spoke-for-25-hours-in-congress-what-was-he-trying-to-achieve-253616,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 02:40:05 GMT","The Democrats have been under intense pressure to find an effective way to challenge US President Donald Trump without control of either chamber of Congress or a de facto opposition leader.

They may have just found one. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker took the Senate floor on Monday evening in Washington to give a speech lambasting Trump’s actions. He didn’t stop talking – aside for the occasional question from a fellow Democrat – until Tuesday night, 25 hours later.

So, how common are these types of speeches in the US Congress, and what’s the point?

Filibusters throughout history

Booker’s speech set a new record for the longest continuous speech in the Senate, surpassing Senator Strom Thurmond’s 24-hour speech in 1957 to try to prevent the passage of the Civil Rights Act.

This was during the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the Allied forces in Europe during the second world war. The army was the great desegregation force in the 1940s, and Eisenhower, as president in the 1950s, was strongly in favour of civil rights.

Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division/Wikimedia Commons

In 1957, Congress was going to pass a civil rights bill that would make it harder for officials in southern states, in particular, to prevent Black people from voting. So Thurmond, the South Carolina senator and fierce proponent of segregation, launched what was (until today) the longest speech in Senate history to oppose it.

Thurmond’s speech was a filibuster, an extended speech in the Senate to attempt to delay or block a vote on a bill or confirmation. Thurmond, however, was unable to stop enactment of the bill.

Senators engage in filibusters when they know they’re going to lose, especially when it’s a piece of legislation they really dislike or disagree with. Because they can’t stop the passage of the bill, they use the filibuster to call attention to their opposition to it. The intention is to rally the troops and say, “I’m standing with you, even if this vote goes the other way”.

In 2016, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who represents the state of Connecticut where the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School took place, launched a nearly 15-hour filibuster to force the Republican Senate leadership to allow votes on two gun control measures.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz also spoke all night – 21 hours in total – against Obamacare in 2013. It wasn’t all focused on health policy; he filled the time by reading the children’s book, Green Eggs and Ham by Dr Seuss.

What Booker was trying to achieve

Booker’s speech was not technically a filibuster – he wasn’t holding the floor to talk against a specific bill, as Thurmond was. He was giving time to his Democratic colleagues to just control the shape of the general debate about Trump.

Senators use speeches like this when they’re losing on a issue, and Booker feels the Democrats are currently losing to Trump. They have been unable to stop any of his executive actions, so they feel they need to cut through in some way to reach the American people.

Trump has been “flooding the zone” from the moment he took office in January with hundreds of policies and executive actions – and he has been extremely successful at it. These actions cut across so many areas, it’s been very hard for the Democrats, on any given day, to pick out the top things to fight against.

Because they don’t have control of the House or Senate, and there is no opposition leader, there is no single, principal Democrat who can stand up day by day and say, “This is what happened, this was what the threat to the country is, this why we’re opposing it and this is the way we’re going to attack it”.

Trump is controlling the narrative and the media environment. And the Democratic leadership has been unable to counter it, even though, at the grassroots level, Democrats and many others who voted for Trump are really angry.

As Booker put it during his speech:

Moments like this require us to be more creative or more imaginative, or just more persistent and dogged and determined.

There comes a certain point in a human drama that transcends partisanship when you’re looking at someone speaking from the heart, speaking their convictions and you can come to respect them.

Booker ran for the presidency in 2020 and ultimately yielded to Joe Biden, and I expect we’ll hear much more from him in 2028 when the next presidential election occurs. He is most likely going to run again.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Flies are masters of migration – it’s about time they got some credit,https://theconversation.com/flies-are-masters-of-migration-its-about-time-they-got-some-credit-253254,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:59:13 GMT","As I sprinted across the flower-rich meadow on the eastern coast of Cyprus, I could barely see my car. The air was full of tiny black dots, pelting like bullets past me. I hauled open the car door and breathed a sigh of relief once inside. I was surrounded by millions of flies, amid the most incredible migration event I have ever seen.

The migration cameras my team and I use to monitor these insects counted nearly 6,000 flies per metre per minute. Being hit by a fly travelling over 25mph (helped by the wind) hurts enough to make you want shelter quickly.

All of these flies had just travelled at least 60 miles (100km) across open sea from the Middle East to Cyprus. This journey forms part of their springtime migration towards northern Europe.

Butterflies and dragonflies are well-known insect migrants, but not because they’re the most numerous. That title is given to the flies. I have studied all of the insects migrating through Cyprus and the Pyrenees on the France-Spain border. Flies make up nearly 90% of all migrants. Yet they have been consistently overlooked by scientists and their ecological contribution has been hugely underappreciated.

My colleagues and I set out to change this. We have spent months collecting written sources that mentioned fly migration from anywhere in the world. Our findings, now published in Biological Reviews, could change our perception of flies forever. Previously, nobody really knew the extent to which flies migrated, yet they are the most numerous and most ecologically important of all terrestrial migrants.

Scarlett Weston

Fly migration has been part of written human history for millennia. In the book of Exodus, when the pharoah of Egypt didn’t let Moses’s people go, God sent a plague of flies to change his mind. Then God removed flies from the land until “not a fly remained”. This last biblical quote is key.

If these flies had been misidentified mayflies coming out of the river Nile, which are known to amass in huge numbers, their exhausted bodies would have remained for days. Because they all disappeared without a trace, this suggests a huge migration of flies. Egypt is on an important fly migration route. So perhaps fly migration was significant enough to be the subject of divine intervention.

Flies migrate to reproduce, moving to exploit seasonal food resources. All over the world, it’s mostly females that migrate. They have been recorded migrating through mountain passes high in the Himalayas, on ships hundreds of miles out to sea in the Gulf of Mexico and in their millions migrating through western Europe. Amazingly, while on fieldwork in the Maldives, I saw Forcipomyia midges use their soft foot hairs to stick to dragonfly wings to hitch a lift over the Indian Ocean.

Vital roles

Flies are so important to the planet and to us. No other group of terrestrial migrants (including vertebrates such as mammals) are as ecologically diverse as flies. More than half (62%) of all migrating flies, including hoverflies, are pollinators. Without them, food crop production would decline.

Will Hawkes

As they migrate, flies transport and disperse pollen between flowers. This could help plants adapt to climate change by maintaining genetic diversity.

Many migratory fly species (34%) are decomposers, ensuring the planet isn’t covered in rotting carcasses and animal dung. One study showed that the larvae of just 50 houseflies (Musca domestica), – the very ecologically similar and equally abundant autumn housefly Musca autumnalis migrate south through the Pyrenees in their millions – can decompose up to 444kg of pig manure.

The ecological roles of flies are not all positive, though. My latest study shows that monoculture crops provide lots of food for some migratory fly species (18%) that have subsequently become crop pests. Some (16%) carry diseases, such as mosquitoes that migrate huge distances and bring diseases such as malaria.

But migratory flies have an overwhelmingly positive impact on the planet. Hoverfly larvae eat trillions of aphids each year in southern England. Insect migration is already known to be the most important way that the nutrients plants need to grow are moved across the land and flies make up the majority of the insects that transport the nutrients.

The movement and subsequent death of trillions of migrating flies, whose bodies contain elements, such as phosphorous and nitrogen which plants need to grow, could be vital to soil health of the soils too. Migratory birds have been noted feeding on and moving at the same time as migratory flies, perhaps using them as fuel for their journeys.

We’re only just waking up to the significance of flies. Hopefully, it’s not too late to protect them. One German study found that the number of aphid-eating migratory hoverflies declined by 97% over the last 50 years. Fewer aphid-eating hoverflies means more crop-eating aphids and also fewer pollinators. So that’s a terrifying statistic that could have drastic consequences.

A sunrise of hope exists, however. These brilliant migratory flies have so many young that if we improve landscape connectivity, reduce pesticide usage and provide suitable habitat, they can bounce back really quickly. We need these flies as much as we need the air we breathe. So next time you see a fly up against your window, open it and let it out. It has a long way to go and such important work to do.

https://theconversation.com,Misokinesia: when repetitive movements are infuriating to some people,https://theconversation.com/misokinesia-when-repetitive-movements-are-infuriating-to-some-people-252056,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:17:04 GMT","For some people, the mere sight of someone tapping their foot, twirling their hair or clicking a pen can trigger an intense sense of discomfort, or even rage. This reaction is known as “misokinesia”, a sensitivity to repetitive movements that can make everyday interactions challenging.

It is only a recently explored phenomenon in research. But studies suggest that up to one-third of the population experiences some level of discomfort when confronted with the repetitive movements of other people. These triggers can include things such as another person bounding their leg repeatedly, or biting their nails, fidgeting – even yawning. Misokinesia may affect a person’s job and their personal lives.

Misokinesia produces what has been likened by some as a “fight or flight” response in people living with the condition, with reactions including an increase in blood pressure, adrenaline and heart palpitations. Other physical reactions such as nausea are possible too.

There can also be cognitive reactions, such as a lack of focus or patience, negative or violent thoughts, and feelings of anger and disgust.

It can be person-specific. This means that people who experience misokenisia find some people’s repetitive actions are more triggering than others. This can make it difficult to spend time with particular people comfortably due to their opposing needs. For example, it may be difficult for a person with misokinesia to be around someone who is stimming (employing self-stimulating behaviour such as leg bouncing) for emotional regulation.

Misophonia

Misokinesia is similar to misophonia, which is a strong dislike or hatred of certain sounds, often made by people, such as yawning, breathing or chewing. It can also be person-specific and can affect a person’s day-to-day life, including their ability to regulate their emotions.

Misophonia often co-occurs with anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Misokinesia, however, is entirely visual. While the two conditions can co-occur, they are distinct experiences.

Given that some people with misophonia report experiencing misokinesia too, it suggests a possible shared neurological basis. But research into both conditions remains in its early stages.

The exact causes of misokinesia remain unclear, but it may be due to a combination of neurological, psychological and genetic factors. There is evidence that neurodivergent people, including autistic people and those with ADHD, may be more likely to experience both misokinesia and misophonia.

People with both of these conditions may experience stigma, with other people believing they are overreacting. This can affect whether a person who experiences misokinesia will share their experiences with others. It can also reduce the likelihood that they will seek support.

There is no official diagnosis for misokinesia, nor for misophonia. Discussions are ongoing about whether they should be recognised as clinical conditions, however.

Can misokinesia be managed?

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be one way to reduce the effects of both misokinesia and misophonia on a person’s life. CBT can help a person identify their triggers, acknowledge their reactions and learn relaxation techniques to practice in real-life scenarios. Practicing relaxation techniques, can help to manage both the physiological and mental responses to a trigger.

Practical strategies, such as subtly blocking one’s view of the movement, shifting focus to another part of the environment, or explaining triggers to those around them may also help reduce distress.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Val Kilmer’s macho action figures held a melancholy just below the surface,https://theconversation.com/val-kilmers-macho-action-figures-held-a-melancholy-just-below-the-surface-253631,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 08:05:50 GMT","Leading man of 1990s Hollywood, Val Kilmer, has died at 65 from pneumonia. Battling cancer since 2014, he has not been a frequent presence on our film screens for most of this century. While he has recently done some interesting projects, he never recaptured his fame and box-office draw of the 1980s and ‘90s, when he appeared in iconic films such as Top Gun (1986) and Batman Forever (1995).

His standout performance as Tom Cruise’s swaggering, self-assured rival Iceman in Top Gun made him a star. But the film that really cemented his reputation as a leading man was Oliver Stone’s The Doors (1991), in which he played Jim Morrison to astonishing effect. He is the best thing about that film.

IMDB

In 1993, he starred as Doc Holliday in Tombstone, a stylish modern western, which he co-headlined with Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp. It was perhaps the most '90s of the '90s westerns. Kilmer’s performance was crowd-pleasing and critically acclaimed. His 2020 memoir, I’m Your Huckleberry, took its name from a line Kilmer spoke in the film.

In some ways, it is a superhero film with cowboys – as you can see so clearly in the poster. It was this performance that put Kilmer on the radar of Warner Bros when they were looking to cast a new Batman after Michael Keaton abandoned the suit.

Batman Forever

We’ve got used to superhero films having cinematic universes and narrative continuity between films, but in the 1990s that had not quite been established.

Warner Bros had struck cinematic gold with the first modern superhero blockbuster, Superman (1978) starring Christopher Reeve, but faced diminishing critical and financial returns with each subsequent film in the series. After Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) failed to connect with audiences, the studio turned to Batman to be its cinematic icon. In those days, one superhero film every couple of years was seen as sufficient. Fortunately, Tim Burton’s Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), two dark takes on the Batman story both starring Michael Keaton, were hits.

However, Batman Returns was regarded by audiences and critics as too “dark”, and too Burton. Both Burton and the studio felt a change of pace was needed for a third film. Joel Schumacher was brought on as director and, perhaps due to the departure of Burton, Keaton also chose to leave the series.

Fresh off Tombstone, Kilmer was cast as the superhero.

Batman Forever took a goofier tone, inspired just as much by the campy 1960s TV series as the dark gothic noir style of Burton. It is still brooding, but the film is more bombastic, more colourful. Noted for performances from Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey as the villains – and the costumes that famously featured nipples and codpieces – Kilmer’s performance got lost.

IMDB

Worse for Kilmer, rumours of being difficult to work with on the set of Batman may have set his career back in subsequent years. But, despite these difficulties, Kilmer makes a good Batman.

He performed the role with a brooding physicality, as well as playfulness. He was underrated, and certainly better than George Clooney, who took over in Batman and Robin (1997) after Kilmer declined to return.

The non-Keaton Batman films are sometimes overlooked by fans, or not seen as living up to the heights of the Burton movies. In recent years, Burton’s movies have become more or less canonised as the “real” Batman of the era. A series of comic books, Batman '89, has been published since 2021 that continues the story from Batman Returns, bypassing the developments of Kilmer’s Batman Forever and Clooney’s Batman and Robin.

Keaton has since reprised his role as the caped crusader on the silver screen as a major supporting character in The Flash (2023), which also featured cameos from Batman alumni Clooney and Ben Affleck as alternate universe versions of the Dark Knight. Kilmer and Christian Bale were the only retired big-screen Batmans not to appear in the film.

But Batman Forever stands the test of time. It is an entertaining film that walks the line between the dark and brooding Batman from Burton, and the parody of the 1960s television series starring Adam West.

Soulful melancholy

Batman Forever was the pinnacle for Kilmer in terms of critical and commercial success. He followed it with great performances in films such as The Ghost and the Darkness (1996), Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) and Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009), but he was often the supporting character rather than the lead. These films, too, weren’t box-office smashes like his films up to and including Batman had been.

Mark Humphrey/AP

One of his best performances of the 2000s was in the David Mamet film Spartan (2004). Kilmer plays a retired marine corps sergeant in a good leading turn. He gave a muscular performance that still had a soulful melancholy at its heart, which can be seen in a lot of his roles. He plays action figures who are tough and macho on the outside, but have a melancholy just below the surface.

Although he never reprised his role as Bruce Wayne, a fitting coda for Kilmer’s career was the long-awaited sequel Top Gun: Maverick (2022), in which he gives a cameo as an ailing version of Iceman.

Kilmer will be missed for his iconic roles as the quintessential performer of the late 1980s and '90s. In 2021, a documentary about Kilmer, Val, was released, based on decades of archive footage. I would recommend it to audiences who want to know more about the man, his life, his career and his health battles over the past decades.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,People with dementia could stay in the workplace longer – with the right tech,https://theconversation.com/people-with-dementia-could-stay-in-the-workplace-longer-with-the-right-tech-253370,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:17:31 GMT","For Paul, a finance administrator, things came to a head when his report mistakenly included £7,000,000 of costs rather than £700,000. Fearing accusations of fraud, Paul disclosed his recent dementia diagnosis to his boss.

Six weeks of sick leave became six months, and then a stepping stone to early retirement. Several years later, Paul regrets his unwanted unemployment, but at the time there didn’t seem to be an alternative.

Paul was participating in an unrelated study about public transport when he told us about his unemployment. As researchers, we had heard many similar accounts – so we decided to dig down into the research on work and dementia. We were curious about how typical Paul’s experience was of the trajectories of people diagnosed while working.

The ageing of populations around the world is influencing our lives in many ways. More people are extending their working lives beyond traditional retirement ages, and many more are being diagnosed with dementia. Around 9% of the world’s 55 million people with dementia are under 65, with around 370,000 new cases of young-onset dementia annually.

It is striking then, that despite government and business commitments to support longer working lives and inclusive employment practices, workers with dementia are largely ignored. What little evidence we have paints a picture of widespread and unwanted unemployment.

For some, this takes the form of redundancy or retirement. For others – like Paul – a period of temporary leave gradually evolves into a permanent exit.

Alongside workforce ageing, digital transformation is perhaps the single most important development in modern industry. Almost all our working lives are now shaped by digital technologies in some form.

Older people are often stereotyped as technologically incompetent. This can be even worse for people with dementia. When exciting digital innovations are discussed in relation to them, the focus is almost always on providing care. But someone diagnosed with dementia in their 60s today might have been blogging in their 30s, scrolling social media on a phone in their 40s and using a smart home assistant in their 50s.

The tech is here already

The reality is that many people with dementia use digital tools every day. This ranges from familiar products like Google Maps to more cutting-edge technologies. A person with dementia recently introduced us to their voice-activated AI companion, with which they watch and discuss films. These companions can provide vital social interaction for people fearing judgement or isolation because of their cognitive decline.

Far from being a barrier, digital technologies could offer ways to help people with dementia to enjoy positive working lives, just as they help workers who don’t have dementia. The trick is to use them to tailor work and workplaces to the individual.

For example, if a worker is struggling to remember appointments, automated and shared calendar scheduling can take care of that. If a worker has impaired wayfinding, mapping apps can be tailored to working environments and live location data can be used to guide staff around complicated sites. This is hardly futuristic tech. Many of us would struggle without our online calendars and maps.

Research shows that touchscreens can be particularly challenging for older people with dementia. To make interfaces more suitable, developers could encourage the integration of voice-operated smart assistants into employee workstations (think of Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri).

While discussions of dementia often focus on memory loss, the various types of dementia are associated with a wide range of symptoms. One very common symptom is the struggle to find the right words. But recent developments in generative AI (like OpenAI’s ChatGPT) are proficient at predicting and expressing the next word in a sequence.

These tools are also excellent at transforming text into different formats. Guidance on dementia-friendly information recommends features such as large fonts, single-clause sentences and single-syllable words.

A generative AI tool could quickly transform documents into dementia-friendly formats. The integration of these tools into emailing and writing applications could make a lot of work far more accessible to people with dementia.

These days, it makes little sense for workers to be manually entering costings into a spreadsheet. Dementia or no dementia, these practices are ripe for human error. By outsourcing them to digital technologies, we can free up our ageing workforces to use their unmatched skills, such as networking and experience.

In practice, employers will likely be responsible for supporting positive working lives with dementia in the future. The best way to do this will be to develop strategies, in consultation with people with dementia, that identify interventions suitable for the workplace. Then, when an employee is diagnosed, they can pick and mix a personalised collection of tools to address their needs.

Right now, we are not aware of any workplace that has such a strategy. But many organisations already have robust policies for other conditions. Our own employer, the University of Bath, has a repository of reasonable adjustments that can be tailored to support staff and students experiencing mental illness. Dementia could be approached in much the same way.

The UK government is currently attempting to increase the number of people with disabilities participating in the labour market. It is simultaneously driving an agenda to increase the use of AI throughout the country.

The potential of a digital working life for people with dementia highlights both promise and peril. Simply forcing every person into work is a surefire way of turning challenging situations into real problems. But providing tailored support for those who want to work can enrich organisations and workers alike.",theconversation
https://quantamagazine.org,Why Everything in the Universe Turns More Complex,https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-everything-in-the-universe-turns-more-complex-20250402/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","“I had got disillusioned with the state of the art of looking for life on other worlds,” Wong said. “I thought it was too narrowly constrained to life as we know it here on Earth, but life elsewhere may take a completely different evolutionary trajectory. So how do we abstract far enough away from life on Earth that we’d be able to notice life elsewhere even if it had different chemical specifics, but not so far that we’d be including all kinds of self-organizing structures like hurricanes?”

The pair soon realized that they needed expertise from a whole other set of disciplines. “We needed people who came at this problem from very different points of view, so that we all had checks and balances on each other’s prejudices,” Hazen said. “This is not a mineralogical problem; it’s not a physics problem, or a philosophical problem. It’s all of those things.”

They suspected that functional information was the key to understanding how complex systems like living organisms arise through evolutionary processes happening over time. “We all assumed the second law of thermodynamics supplies the arrow of time,” Hazen said. “But it seems like there’s a much more idiosyncratic pathway that the universe takes. We think it’s because of selection for function — a very orderly process that leads to ordered states. That’s not part of the second law, although it’s not inconsistent with it either.”

Looked at this way, the concept of functional information allowed the team to think about the development of complex systems that don’t seem related to life at all.

At first glance, it doesn’t seem a promising idea. In biology, function makes sense. But what does “function” mean for a rock?

All it really implies, Hazen said, is that some selective process favors one entity over lots of other potential combinations. A huge number of different minerals can form from silicon, oxygen, aluminum, calcium and so on. But only a few are found in any given environment. The most stable minerals turn out to be the most common. But sometimes less stable minerals persist because there isn’t enough energy available to convert them to more stable phases.

Information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge and energy. Michael Wong, Carnegie Institution

This might seem trivial, like saying that some objects exist while other ones don’t, even if they could in theory. But Hazen and Wong have shown that, even for minerals, functional information has increased over the course of Earth’s history. Minerals evolve toward greater complexity (though not in the Darwinian sense). Hazen and colleagues speculate that complex forms of carbon such as graphene might form in the hydrocarbon-rich environment of Saturn’s moon Titan — another example of an increase in functional information that doesn’t involve life.

It’s the same with chemical elements. The first moments after the Big Bang were filled with undifferentiated energy. As things cooled, quarks formed and then condensed into protons and neutrons. These gathered into the nuclei of hydrogen, helium and lithium atoms. Only once stars formed and nuclear fusion happened within them did more complex elements like carbon and oxygen form. And only when some stars had exhausted their fusion fuel did their collapse and explosion in supernovas create heavier elements such as heavy metals. Steadily, the elements increased in nuclear complexity.

Wong said their work implies three main conclusions.

First, biology is just one example of evolution. “There is a more universal description that drives the evolution of complex systems.”

Second, he said, there might be “an arrow in time that describes this increasing complexity,” similar to the way the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the increase in entropy, is thought to create a preferred direction of time.

Finally, Wong said, “information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge and energy.”

In the work Hazen and Szostak conducted on evolution using artificial-life algorithms, the increase in functional information was not always gradual. Sometimes it would happen in sudden jumps. That echoes what is seen in biological evolution. Biologists have long recognized transitions where the complexity of organisms increases abruptly. One such transition was the appearance of organisms with cellular nuclei (around 1.8 billion to 2.7 billion years ago). Then there was the transition to multicellular organisms (around 2 billion to 1.6 billion years ago), the abrupt diversification of body forms in the Cambrian explosion (540 million years ago), and the appearance of central nervous systems (around 600 million to 520 million years ago). The arrival of humans was arguably another major and rapid evolutionary transition.

Evolutionary biologists have tended to view each of these transitions as a contingent event. But within the functional-information framework, it seems possible that such jumps in evolutionary processes (whether biological or not) are inevitable.

In these jumps, Wong pictures the evolving objects as accessing an entirely new landscape of possibilities and ways to become organized, as if penetrating to the “next floor up.” Crucially, what matters — the criteria for selection, on which continued evolution depends — also changes, plotting a wholly novel course. On the next floor up, possibilities await that could not have been guessed before you reached it.

For example, during the origin of life it might initially have mattered that proto-biological molecules would persist for a long time — that they’d be stable. But once such molecules became organized into groups that could catalyze one another’s formation — what Kauffman has called autocatalytic cycles — the molecules themselves could be short-lived, so long as the cycles persisted. Now it was dynamical, not thermodynamic, stability that mattered. Ricard Solé of the Santa Fe Institute thinks such jumps might be equivalent to phase transitions in physics, such as the freezing of water or the magnetization of iron: They are collective processes with universal features, and they mean that everything changes, everywhere, all at once. In other words, in this view there’s a kind of physics of evolution — and it’s a kind of physics we know about already.

The Biosphere Creates Its Own Possibilities

The tricky thing about functional information is that, unlike a measure such as size or mass, it is contextual: It depends on what we want the object to do, and what environment it is in. For instance, the functional information for an RNA aptamer binding to a particular molecule will generally be quite different from the information for binding to a different molecule.

Yet finding new uses for existing components is precisely what evolution does. Feathers did not evolve for flight, for example. This repurposing reflects how biological evolution is jerry-rigged, making use of what’s available.

Kauffman argues that biological evolution is thus constantly creating not just new types of organisms but new possibilities for organisms, ones that not only did not exist at an earlier stage of evolution but could not possibly have existed. From the soup of single-celled organisms that constituted life on Earth 3 billion years ago, no elephant could have suddenly emerged — this required a whole host of preceding, contingent but specific innovations.

However, there is no theoretical limit to the number of uses an object has. This means that the appearance of new functions in evolution can’t be predicted — and yet some new functions can dictate the very rules of how the system evolves subsequently. “The biosphere is creating its own possibilities,” Kauffman said. “Not only do we not know what will happen, we don’t even know what can happen.” Photosynthesis was such a profound development; so were eukaryotes, nervous systems and language. As the microbiologist Carl Woese and the physicist Nigel Goldenfeld put it in 2011, “We need an additional set of rules describing the evolution of the original rules. But this upper level of rules itself needs to evolve. Thus, we end up with an infinite hierarchy.”

The physicist Paul Davies of Arizona State University agrees that biological evolution “generates its own extended possibility space which cannot be reliably predicted or captured via any deterministic process from prior states. So life evolves partly into the unknown.”

An increase in complexity provides the future potential to find new strategies unavailable to simpler organisms. Marcus Heisler, University of Sydney

Mathematically, a “phase space” is a way of describing all possible configurations of a physical system, whether it’s as comparatively simple as an idealized pendulum or as complicated as all the atoms comprising the Earth. Davies and his co-workers have recently suggested that evolution in an expanding accessible phase space might be formally equivalent to the “incompleteness theorems” devised by the mathematician Kurt Gödel. Gödel showed that any system of axioms in mathematics permits the formulation of statements that can’t be shown to be true or false. We can only decide such statements by adding new axioms.

Davies and colleagues say that, as with Gödel’s theorem, the key factor that makes biological evolution open-ended and prevents us from being able to express it in a self-contained and all-encompassing phase space is that it is self-referential: The appearance of new actors in the space feeds back on those already there to create new possibilities for action. This isn’t the case for physical systems, which, even if they have, say, millions of stars in a galaxy, are not self-referential.

“An increase in complexity provides the future potential to find new strategies unavailable to simpler organisms,” said Marcus Heisler, a plant developmental biologist at the University of Sydney and co-author of the incompleteness paper. This connection between biological evolution and the issue of noncomputability, Davies said, “goes right to the heart of what makes life so magical.”

Is biology special, then, among evolutionary processes in having an open-endedness generated by self-reference? Hazen thinks that in fact once complex cognition is added to the mix — once the components of the system can reason, choose, and run experiments “in their heads” — the potential for macro-micro feedback and open-ended growth is even greater. “Technological applications take us way beyond Darwinism,” he said. A watch gets made faster if the watchmaker is not blind.

Back to the Bench

If Hazen and colleagues are right that evolution involving any kind of selection inevitably increases functional information — in effect, complexity — does this mean that life itself, and perhaps consciousness and higher intelligence, is inevitable in the universe? That would run counter to what some biologists have thought. The eminent evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr believed that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence was doomed because the appearance of humanlike intelligence is “utterly improbable.” After all, he said, if intelligence at a level that leads to cultures and civilizations were so adaptively useful in Darwinian evolution, how come it only arose once across the entire tree of life?

Mayr’s evolutionary point possibly vanishes in the jump to humanlike complexity and intelligence, whereupon the whole playing field is utterly transformed. Humans attained planetary dominance so rapidly (for better or worse) that the question of when it will happen again becomes moot.

But what about the chances of such a jump happening in the first place? If the new “law of increasing functional information” is right, it looks as though life, once it exists, is bound to get more complex by leaps and bounds. It doesn’t have to rely on some highly improbable chance event.

What’s more, such an increase in complexity seems to imply the appearance of new causal laws in nature that, while not incompatible with the fundamental laws of physics governing the smallest component parts, effectively take over from them in determining what happens next. Arguably we see this already in biology: Galileo’s (apocryphal) experiment of dropping two masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa no longer has predictive power when the masses are not cannonballs but living birds.

Together with the chemist Lee Cronin of the University of Glasgow, Sara Walker of Arizona State University has devised an alternative set of ideas to describe how complexity arises, called assembly theory. In place of functional information, assembly theory relies on a number called the assembly index, which measures the minimum number of steps required to make an object from its constituent ingredients.

“Laws for living systems must be somewhat different than what we have in physics now,” Walker said, “but that does not mean that there are no laws.” But she doubts that the putative law of functional information can be rigorously tested in the lab. “I am not sure how one could say [the theory] is right or wrong, since there is no way to test it objectively,” she said. “What would the experiment look for? How would it be controlled? I would love to see an example, but I remain skeptical until some metrology is done in this area.”

Hazen acknowledges that, for most physical objects, it is impossible to calculate functional information even in principle. Even for a single living cell, he admits, there’s no way of quantifying it. But he argues that this is not a sticking point, because we can still understand it conceptually and get an approximate quantitative sense of it. Similarly, we can’t calculate the exact dynamics of the asteroid belt because the gravitational problem is too complicated — but we can still describe it approximately enough to navigate spacecraft through it.

Wong sees a potential application of their ideas in astrobiology. One of the curious aspects of living organisms on Earth is that they tend to make a far smaller subset of organic molecules than they could make given the basic ingredients. That’s because natural selection has picked out some favored compounds. There’s much more glucose in living cells, for example, than you’d expect if molecules were simply being made either randomly or according to their thermodynamic stability. So one potential signature of lifelike entities on other worlds might be similar signs of selection outside what chemical thermodynamics or kinetics alone would generate. (Assembly theory similarly predicts complexity-based biosignatures.)

There might be other ways of putting the ideas to the test. Wong said there is more work still to be done on mineral evolution, and they hope to look at nucleosynthesis and computational “artificial life.” Hazen also sees possible applications in oncology, soil science and language evolution. For example, the evolutionary biologist Frédéric Thomas of the University of Montpellier in France and colleagues have argued that the selective principles governing the way cancer cells change over time in tumors are not like those of Darwinian evolution, in which the selection criterion is fitness, but more closely resemble the idea of selection for function from Hazen and colleagues.

Hazen’s team has been fielding queries from researchers ranging from economists to neuroscientists, who are keen to see if the approach can help. “People are approaching us because they are desperate to find a model to explain their system,” Hazen said.

But whether or not functional information turns out to be the right tool for thinking about these questions, many researchers seem to be converging on similar questions about complexity, information, evolution (both biological and cosmic), function and purpose, and the directionality of time. It’s hard not to suspect that something big is afoot. There are echoes of the early days of thermodynamics, which began with humble questions about how machines work and ended up speaking to the arrow of time, the peculiarities of living matter, and the fate of the universe.",quantamagazine
https://undark.org,"Amid NOAA Cuts, Scientists Warn of Weather and Climate Risks",https://undark.org/2025/04/02/noaa-federal-funding-cuts/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","In 1807, President Thomas Jefferson founded the nation’s first scientific agency. It was tasked with surveying the coasts of the United States. Roughly 60 years later, a national weather bureau was created, and a fish and fisheries commission soon followed. The focus of these three agencies was eventually brought together in 1970 as part of the new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. Today, agency staff study the ocean and atmosphere, share knowledge, and conserve coastal and marine ecosystems. Under the new administration of Donald Trump, this agency with 218-year-old roots is undergoing another significant change — one that experts fear could significantly hamper NOAA’s work.

CROSS SECTIONS: Dissecting the contentious and the controversial — with science at the core.

In fiscal year 2024, NOAA accounted for more than half of the Department of Commerce’s budget and, as of recently, it had about 12,000 employees worldwide. The agency has a broad portfolio of activities, including gathering data and monitoring oceans, the atmosphere, fisheries, and marine life. The National Weather Service, a NOAA sub-agency, provides weather forecasts that include watches and warnings used to protect people and their property. To carry out its work, NOAA has at its disposal an array of tools, including satellites, airplanes, weather balloons, maritime buoys, and radar systems.

Under the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency, the administration’s cost-cutting effort, CBS reported that 880 NOAA employees were let go in late February. In March, a U.S. district judge ordered thousands of fired federal workers to be temporarily reinstated, but many have been put on administrative leave. The administration has also discussed possibly terminating leases for properties housing NOAA operations. Moreover, all federal agencies are currently subject to a purge of certain words and phrases. The New York Times has found that “climate science” is among them.

“One could make a strong case that NOAA was under-resourced and under-staffed before these cuts, so this is simply making the situation worse,” wrote Keith Seitter, former executive director of the American Meteorological Society, in an email to Undark. This could lead to dangerous delays in forecasting extreme weather events like tornadoes and hurricanes, in addition to hampering climate research. Private entities aren’t likely to be able to fill the void, Seitter noted.

“There seems little question that these cuts are going to severely impair NOAA’s ability to carry out its mission,” he wrote.

Trump and his supporters have long criticized NOAA’s climate research efforts as being politically motivated. Project 2025, a sprawling document created by the conservative Heritage Foundation, describes NOAA as a main driver of the “climate change alarm industry,” and suggests the climate research of one of its divisions ought to be “disbanded.” The document further states that some of NOAA’s other functions could be carried out in the private sector “at lower cost and higher quality.” The National Weather Service, for example, could be commercialized, according to Project 2025.

Massachusetts-based meteorologist Brian Gonsalves wrote in an email to Undark: “We are already seeing immediate impacts from these cuts, which will only worsen if further cuts are made.” The reduced staffing could make it more difficult to gather and process the data coming in from across the country — on temperature, wind speed, and dew points, among other things. The end result may be a decline in the agency’s ability to produce accurate weather forecasts, he said.

This may ultimately put people’s safety at risk. Seitter, currently a visiting professor of environmental studies and geosciences at the College of the Holy Cross, pointed to the arrival of spring’s severe weather season. “It would not be a surprise to see insufficient staffing available to do some of the really important planning and preparation with state and local emergency managers,” he said. This could compromise forecasts of and preparations for tornadoes, for example, that have ripped through parts of the country in March with more likely throughout spring. Hurricane season, which extends from June to November, could be an issue, too.

Privatizing the National Weather Service would have additional implications, not only for ordinary people wanting to check the weather, but also for private entities that rely on data generated by the federal government. For instance, companies like AccuWeather depend on data collected by NOAA, among other sources.

On X, Tony Pann, a Maryland-based meteorologist, posted: “The information on your phone app comes from data provided by NOAA for free. NOAA gathers weather data (daily balloon launches) and feeds it into the modeling so your phone can tell you it’s going to rain tomorrow. Saying we don’t need NOAA or the NWS because I can see the weather on my phone, is like saying we don’t need farmers because I can just go to the grocery store.”

Project 2025, a sprawling document created by the conservative Heritage Foundation, describes NOAA as a main driver of the “climate change alarm industry.”

It would be extraordinarily difficult for private companies like AccuWeather to do its work in the absence of NOAA-provided data, according to the meteorologists who communicated with Undark. Gonsalves, for example, said “it’s impossible to adequately fill the void from a forecasting standpoint, as well as data collection for climate study.”

Seitter echoed this opinion, noting that the business models of private companies “are built on the foundation of a strong NOAA providing data from which they can create specialized products and services.”

Yet more cuts could be on the way. During the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to rescind unspent funds earmarked for climate mitigation in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. Through the IRA, Congress allocated billions of dollars in resources to counter or prevent the effects of climate change, particularly in areas most likely to be affected, such as coastal cities. The IRA also funded efforts to improve NOAA weather forecasting capabilities.

All of this could lead to a worsening of climate change by reversing progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. might well relinquish its role as a global leader in climate research and forecasting. And with NOAA’s monthly climate change briefings indefinitely suspended in April owing to personnel reductions, staff may become less aware of what, precisely, is happening to the climate.

And as CBS News reported in February, a former top NOAA scientist in the first Trump administration, Craig McLean, is worried about the politicization of science could undermine objectivity going forward.

“We are already seeing immediate impacts from these cuts, which will only worsen if further cuts are made.”

McLean gave as an example so-called Sharpie-gate, which occurred in 2019, when President Trump claimed that Hurricane Dorian would hit Alabama and displayed an altered graphic in front of news cameras to show the direction the storm would take. After an X account for the National Weather Service office in Birmingham, Alabama posted on social media that the hurricane would not impact Alabama, Trump’s staff apparently pressured Neil Jacobs — Trump’s current pick to run the agency — to say the forecasters had been wrong.

Trump has denied human-caused climate change, calling it “one of the great scams of all time.” And now the president oversees agencies such as NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency, which traditionally have conducted climate research work predicated on the long-standing scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases caused by human activity are primary drivers of global warming. Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, went so far as to call climate change a “religion” at a briefing in March, outlining steps his agency would undertake to deregulate. Jacobs could very well follow suit.",undark
