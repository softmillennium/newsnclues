                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo is today laying out the goodies for the Switch 2, which includes the third-party titles available at launch. The roster may be small, but it includes a number of notable titles from the current generation, trimmed and polished to work on the new hardware. That includes Cyberpunk: 2077, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Street Fighter 6, Hitman: World of Assassination and Split Fiction. EA has also committed to putting whatever the hell we pretend to call FIFA these days EA Sports FC as well as this year’s Madden. There’s also a Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD remaster and Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut plus a tweaked version of Hogwarts: Legacy. Fortnite will also be available on the console on release day.

The breadth and depth of titles available on day one is testament both to the fact there are plenty of good titles in the air right now, and that the Switch 2 must be fairly easy for developers to work with.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Audi provided flights from Washington to Las Vegas and accommodation so Ars could drive the RS e-tron GT. Ars does not accept paid editorial content. LAS VEGAS—Audi's sleek four-door electric sedan, the e-tron GT, has just received its midlife refresh. Usually, a midlife refresh is mostly cosmetic, intended to prevent the model from feeling too stale in the marketplace. But this time Audi has kept the visual changes to a minimum. There are new wheels and a new interior, as well as redesigned front and rear fascias, although the changes are quite subtle. Instead, there's been a comprehensive reengineering effort under the skin. Perhaps not quite as comprehensive as the Polestar 2 refresh—which swapped front-wheel drive for rear—but there are now new motors and a new battery pack, which bring with them increased range, a reduced 0–60 mph time, and even faster fast-charging. That drops the 0–60 mph time from 4 seconds down to 3.3, but the 51-mile ( 82 km) increase to its range—now 300 miles (482 km) on a single charge—is probably going to be the most enticing improvement for potential buyers. Audi Audi Bedford Green is a new color and only available on the RS e-tron GT. Bedford Green is a new color and only available on the RS e-tron GT. Audi Bedford Green is a new color and only available on the RS e-tron GT. Audi didn't have any S e-tron GTs in Las Vegas for us to try, so we had to make do with the RS e-tron GT, which starts at $167,999—$20,000 more than the 2024 version. But you do get quite a lot extra for that. Peak power is up to 912 hp (680 kW), although only in launch mode or if you push the boost control button. So Audi isn't joking when it says this is the fastest car it has ever built.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>企業のAI利用が世界的に拡大する中で、AIのインフラに対するニーズも鮮明になりつつある。長年にわたりネットワーク負荷分散やアプリケーションデリバリー、ウェブアプリ基盤などを手掛ける米F5も近年にAIインフラ領域への注力姿勢を鮮明にしている。同社で技術と製品の総責任者を務めるチーフイノベーションオフィサーのKunal Anand氏に、AIインフラの現状や取り組みの方向性などを聞いた。



米F5 チーフイノベーションオフィサーのKunal Anand氏 米F5 チーフイノベーションオフィサーのKunal Anand氏

Anand氏は、2024年9月に日本法人のF5ネットワークスジャパンが行った事業戦略説明会に登壇し、「今後数年のうちに大半のアプリケーションがAIを実装する」と述べていた（関連記事）。それから約6カ月を経た2025年3月下旬時点で、「既にわれわれの顧客の50％以上がAIを利用している状況だ」（Anand氏）と述べ、急速なAIの拡大ペースを指摘する。

Anand氏によれば、現在のAIインフラの導入パターンは2つに大別される。1つは、AIの開発・運用のための巨大なコンピューティングリソースを備えた「AI Factory」と表現されるデータセンターの大規模環境だ。世界的なクラウド提供事業者（ハイパースケーラー）がけん引してきたが、最近では世界的な通信事業者や金融、自動車などの大企業も導入に乗り出しているという。

「3月の『GTC』（NVIDIAの年次開発者会議）でお会いしたある銀行幹部は、既に3つのAI Factoryを構築中で、新たに約700人のAI科学者の新規雇用を計画していると話された。また、大手自動車メーカーの顧客はわれわれの製品上で自動運転のモデル構築やその学習のワークロードを実行している。このように、ペタバイト規模のAIのデータがわれわれのソリューションで日々処理されている」（Anand氏）

もう1つは、AI Factoryを必要とするほどにはまだ至っていない一般的な企業や組織だ。主な利用はAIの推論であり、クラウドなどの大規模言語モデル（LLM）などへのアクセスとなる。内容は生成、要約、情報検索など千差万別だが、金融や医療といった規制要件が厳しい業界でも、もはや日常的に使われているといい、利用実態の可視化や管理、機微情報の外部漏えいリスクなどセキュリティやプライバシーへの対応が喫緊の課題として浮上している。

こうした動向を踏まえてAnand氏は、F5では、AIを中心としたアプリケーションのデリバリーとセキュリティを統合したプラットフォーム「F5 Application Delivery and Security Platform」の構築に注力していると話す。AIインフラでの高速な処理性能の提供と優れたエネルギー効率の実現、AI利用におけるセキュリティの担保に焦点を当てているほか、生成AIやAIアシスタント機能の製品への実装も進め、ユーザーの業務支援も推進しているという。

上述のAI Factory領域では、GTCの基調講演にも参加し、F5の中核となる「BIG-IP」とNVIDIAのGPUプラットフォームの連携の深化などを発表。ソフトバンクともAIインフラ領域での連携を推進していくことも明らかにした。

もう一方のAIの推論を中心とする一般的な企業や組織の領域では、3月にAI利用時の性能管理や可観測性、保護の機能を包括的に搭載する「F5 AI Gateway」の一般提供を開始した。クラウドサービスを中心としたAI利用の管理ソリューションは、APIゲートウェイ型の拡張で提供されているケースが多いが、Anand氏は、既存のAPIゲートウェイではAIにまつわる課題へのきめ細やかな管理や制御に制約があるとし、まずAIに特化したF5 AI Gatewayを開発、提供したという。

「F5 AI Gatewayについては、特に顧客の最高情報セキュリティ責任者（CISO）からの関心がとても高く、セキュリティやコンプライアンスの担保などについて多くの時間を割いて彼らと会話をしている」（Anand氏）

ここでは、日本を含む大手顧客やパートナーらと共にフレームワーク相当のAIのセキュリティソリューションの実現に向けて協働しているほか、製品・サービス面では顧客がすぐに適用可能な機能やポリシー類を標準搭載し、利用に応じてチューニングをしていくこともできる。

直近では、データセキュリティ企業のLeakSignalを買収しており、LeakSignalが持つAI関連データとアクセスなどの検出や識別、可視化、監視、ポリシーベースの制御といった機能をF5の製品・サービスに順次統合していくという。

なお、AIへのアクセスはAPI経由が多いだけに、Anand氏は今後数年のうちにAIとAPIの双方のゲートウェイを統合していくだろうとも述べた。

また、AIアシスタント機能では、SaaSプラットフォーム「F5 Distributed Cloud Services」での提供を皮切りに、今後はBIG-IPへの実装を順次行い、ユーザー業務の支援強化や運用自動化を推進していくという。これにより、効率的な監視やプロアクティブな問題への対処、設定の最適化、自然言語による照会とアドバイスの提供など可能になるほか、AIによる推奨のルールやポリシー、コードの生成、適用なども行えるようになるとしている。「日本では、特に自動化とDevOpsに対して顧客から大きな関心が寄せられている」（Anand氏）

Anand氏は、前職のImpervaで最高技術責任者と最高情報責任者を兼務したほか、メディアやテクノロジー、航空宇宙の組織などでセキュリティ、テクノロジー、データ、エンジニアリングを担当し、AIと機械学習分野でも15年以上の経験を持つという。そうした経歴もあってコードレビューから製品やサービスへの理解を深めていくなど、同社の経営幹部でありながらユニークなアプローチを実践しているそうだ。

「私の役割の根幹として最も大切にしているのは、確かな品質の製品やサービスを顧客に提供すること。特に日本の顧客は品質を最重要視しているが、実はこの点をあまり理解していない外資系ITベンダーが少なくない。まず品質を大切にする。その上でAIの利用を拡大させていく顧客のニーズに応え、AIで顧客の課題解決も図り、アプリケーションとセキュリティの包括的なソリューションで顧客に貢献していく所存だ」（Anand氏）</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The successor to the Nintendo Switch, which was released about eight years ago, will be released on June 5th for 49,980 yen (tax included). Nintendo announced details of the Switch 2 in its video announcement, "Nintendo Direct," and revealed the launch title and release date. The 7.9-inch LCD display supports 1080p and supports HDR and up to 120fps, with twice the pixel count of the original Switch. When connected to a dock, it supports 4K output. The "Joy-Con" is magnetic and has a larger analog stick, allowing you to operate it like a mouse. The Switch 2 will continue to support additional storage, but it will only be a MicroSD Express card, not a card for the original Switch. The Switch 2 will come with improved speakers for better audio and a microphone for taking advantage of the new chat function. It also comes with a new C button, allowing you to connect with other players through audio and video chat using the camera sold separately. There is also plenty of support from third parties, and games such as Eldenling, Split Fiction, Hogwarts Legacy, and EA SPORTS Madden NFL will be released for Switch 2. Nintendo released a short trailer in January, showing off the designs for the Switch 2, but barely revealed any details.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese tech giants have collectively spent over $16 billion on Nvidia's H20 data center GPUs for AI so far this year, according to Reuters, which cites a report from The Information. Chinese companies increased their spending on Nvidia GPUs despite the expected 'DeepSeek impact' and unused AI infrastructure in China. This likely happened as a response to the AI diffusion rule proposed by the previous U.S. government that bans Chinese entities from buying American AI GPUs starting in May. H3C, one of the leading server makers in China, even raised concerns about possible Nvidia GPU shortages last week as it could not get what it demanded. $16 billion per first quarter is a lot of money. Nvidia reported $17.11 billion in earnings from China and Hong Kong in fiscal year 2025 (ended on January 28, 2025), so last year, the company earned approximately $4.27 billion per quarter on average selling GPUs to Chinese customers. So, big Chinese companies quadrupled their purchases of Nvidia's H20 GPUs for AI applications in the first quarter of calendar 2025. Unfortunately, Nvidia's China revenue in calendar Q1 2024 is something hard to estimate (as Nvidia's fiscal first quarter ends in late April), though based on Nvidia's filings with the Security and Exchange Commission, it is safe to say that we are dealing with a sum of around $2.4 billion – $2.5 billion. This essentially means that Chinese tech giants increased purchases of Nvidia's H20 GPUs in Q1 2025 by over six times compared to Q1 2024. Many observers believe that GPUs sold to Singapore entities are smuggled to restricted countries, such as China.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent days, a new digital fever has taken over social networks: the creation of images inspired by the traces of Studio Ghibli using chatgpt. OpenAi's image generation function allows you to transform personal photos into acclaimed Japanese -style illustrations - such as Chihiro's trip and the boy and heron. Learn how to try the feature while it is available.

How Image Generation works

The appeal has viralized so much that for a few days, it had to be temporarily suspended due to overload on the servers. Now reactivated, it is accessible even for free users, with a limit of three images per day.

The tool uses artificial intelligence to apply Studio Ghibli's characteristic visual style to photos or descriptions provided by the user.

Step by step to create your illustration

To turn a photo or idea into art, follow these instructions:

Visit the ChatgPT website; Login (or create an account if you don't have it yet); Click on the "+" symbol and then "load from the computer" to send an image; Enter the command: “Turn this image into a Studio Ghibli style illustration”; If you prefer to create an image from scratch, type a detailed description. Example: “Grease a Ghibli -style illustration showing a child running through a field of lilies, dressed in purple clothes.”

The result is a charming image, with soft strokes and nostalgic atmosphere, typical of Japanese studio animations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former canvasser for Elon Musk’s America PAC operation—which mobilized voters to sign a sketchy “petition” during last year’s presidential election—has sued the billionaire, accusing him and his political organization of failing to pay him at least $20,000. The former canvasser, who is described as a Philadelphia man, hasn’t revealed his real name, for fear of retaliation. “For his safety and security, Plaintiff John Doe is proceeding under a pseudonym,” the suit states. To drive broader and broader adoption of the initiative, America PAC initially claimed it would pay canvassers $47 for each person that they successfully convinced to sign the petition. Due to Musk’s close proximity to the Trump campaign and his open and vocal support of Trump, the initiative was almost immediately accused of being a paid voter registration drive and/or a vote-buying scheme, both of which are illegal. Doe, who canvassed for America PAC and Musk’s other org, Group America, LLC, claims he was never paid the referral money that he’s owed. “Plaintiff is in communication with numerous others who referred voters to sign the America PAC petition, who are likewise frustrated that they did not receive full payments for their referrals,” it continues. The litigation claims that America PAC owes at least $5 million in unpaid referral money to canvassers. It wasn’t immediately clear how to reach America PAC, as the organization’s website has no contact portal. We’ve contacted a PR specialist associated with the group but did not receive an immediate response. In a statement to the Associated Press, America PAC spokesperson Andrew Romeo said: “America PAC is committed to paying for every legitimate petition signature, which is evidenced by the fact that we have paid tens of millions of dollars to canvassers for their hard work in support of our mission. Elon’s attempts to buy the U.S. presidential election in 2024 were obviously successful, but it also came with a cost. Meanwhile, Musk’s most recent attempt to buy an election—this time for a pivotal Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin—has flopped. As one local news outlet puts it, Wisconsin voters “will not notice any change when they go to the polls. They will still have to present a valid photo ID just as they have under the state law, which was passed in 2011 and went into effect permanently in 2016 after a series of unsuccessful lawsuits.” A report from Politico on Wednesday suggested that Musk would soon be asked to leave the administration. However, the White House has already come out to denounce the report (WH press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the report “garbage”) and claims that Musk will “depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>is a senior reviewer who has worked at The Verge since its founding in 2011. His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc. Last week, Apple announced that lossless audio and ultra low latency would be coming to the AirPods Max with USB-C. It was a pleasant surprise for owners of Apple’s over-ear headphones, which have fallen behind the AirPods Pro in recent years when it comes to offering new features. Firmware version 7E99 was supposed to arrive early this week alongside iOS 18.4 and macOS Sequoia 15.4. But late in the day yesterday, Apple added a “coming soon” asterisk next to the AirPods Max on a support site that lists each device’s latest firmware. There’s no official word on what’s behind the hold-up, but one theory is that an error in the update file means iOS and macOS are both looking for the new AirPods Max firmware at the wrong URLs — and will need another software update of their own to resolve the problem. Apple also introduced a new USB-C to 3.5mm cable for the AirPods Max last week, and it’s worth noting you can use that without any new firmware; it works right out of the box for connecting the headphones to devices with a traditional headphone jack — and it’s a pretty good cable as these things go. Regardless, Apple needs to make the process of updating AirPods more straightforward. For years, it has just sort of happened in the background at a random moment when your iPhone and AirPods are near each other with the headphones charging. There’s no way of manually triggering an update, which runs counter to the way every other earbud maker does it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study by scientists at Princeton University in the United States has generated debate by stating that it is possible to generate electricity using Earth's rotation as a source of energy. The idea was developed from a concept elaborated in 2016. The researchers built a cylindrical device equipped with electrodes and conductors made of manganese and zinc ferrite, positioned at an angle of 57 ° - aligned perpendicular to the rotation of the planet and its magnetic field. According to scientists, this configuration allowed the generator to produce 17 microvolts of electricity, a result published on the 19th. Retired physicist Rinke Wijngaarden, who has been with the development of the idea since 2016, says he has not been able to replicate the results in his own experiments two years later. For him, the theory has not yet been convincing enough. The researchers, in turn, say they have circumvented this obstacle using special materials that prevent this reorganization and maintain the constant electrostatic force in the system. Despite doubts, scientists behind the research believe in the potential of discovery and plan to expand tests to generate larger amounts of energy. Both sides of the debate agree that more studies are needed before the practical viability of using land rotation can be confirmed as a renewable source of electricity. Until then, the idea follows as a bold proposal that still needs to prove in the field of applied physics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japan, one of the most prone to earthquakes on the planet, has released new worrying predictions about a possible magnitude megatremoto between 8 and 9. According to an official report, an event of this magnitude in the region known as Nankai Trough could cause unprecedented human and financial damage, overcoming past tragedies. In the worst scenario, an earthquake with magnitude 9 could affect about 1.23 million people - approximately 1% of the Japanese population - and cause the death of up to 298,000 people, especially due to tsunamis and night collapses in the middle of winter. In addition to human tragedy, the report estimates that economic damage would exceed US $ 1.81 trillion, equivalent to almost half of the country's GDP. The forecast was adjusted based on recent soil data, expansion of flood areas and inflationary pressures. The previous estimate pointed to losses of US $ 1.43 trillion. In 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake in the northeast region of Japan caused a devastating tsunami and the collapse of three nuclear reactors, killing more than 15,000 people. Since then, concern for new megaterrend has grown. In 2023, the country issued its first formal alert on the possibility of an extreme seismic event in the Nankai Trough region, after a 7.1 magnitude tremor in the bordering area of ​​the valley. The new report reinforces the need for urgent preparation against a disaster of gigantic proportions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An incredibly well -preserved fossil has given scientists a chance to observe, with rich detail, what aquatic life was like in Australia millions of years ago. It is a new species of freshwater fish, found in the archaeological site of McGraths Flat, which belongs to the Miocene period, dated about 16 million years. The finding allowed not only to identify the species, but also to rebuild its behavior, diet and even appearance. The fossils were found in a rare state of conservation, buried in Goethita, an iron oxide mineral that protected delicate structures such as skin, muscles and even internal organs. Using high precision microscopy, scientists analyzed the stomach and intestinal tract of fossils and found that Ferruaspis Brocksi fed mainly with chaoborus larvae, known as “ghost mosquito larvae” because they were almost transparent. These clues helped paleontologists understand how the region's river ecosystem was organized, which today is arid, but in the past sheltered dense tropical forests. This indicates that Ferruaspis Brocksi probably had nightly hunting habits, a behavior deducted from the revealed food preference. This type of color probably served as camouflage in the aquatic environment, protecting predator fish and helping to hunt discreet prey such as Chaoborus larvae. The discovery of Ferruaspis Brocksi represents a milestone for paleontology in Oceania. In addition to revealing a new species, the fossil allows you to rebuild behavioral and environmental aspects of a little known period. Thanks to unusual preservation, scientists now have a unique window to understand biodiversity and ecological relationships that existed in a tropical Australia millions of years ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In times of instant communication, waiting for hours-or even days-for an answer on WhatsApp can generate anxiety, doubts and even misunderstandings. However, psychology shows that this behavior does not always indicate disinterest. Factors such as mental tiredness, social anxiety and the desire to preserve personal limits are among the main reasons. Knowing these reasons can help better understand each other and avoid hasty judgments. According to a study by Computers in Human Behavior magazine, the constant flow of messages, notifications and availability requirement affect mental well-being. Thus, some people prefer to move momentarily from the screens to preserve emotional health, which results in a slower pace of response in digital interactions. Some also choose to respond in time as a way of setting healthy limits. The constant urgency of messages can be seen as an invasion, and slowing the answer is a way of maintaining emotional balance. Studies such as Posted in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin suggest that in certain cases the delay may indicate disinterest or low emotional priority, but it is not a rule. Understanding that emotional, mental and social factors influence this behavior helps to avoid misunderstandings and cultivate more empathic relationships in the digital environment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And there are already reports that Musk’s time in the White House may be limited due to President Donald Trump’s patience wearing thin. But if you ask leaders of the Democratic Party, who see the billionaire oligarch as electoral poison, they want Musk to keep campaigning for Republicans. “We should be putting Elon Musk into every state right now campaigning because he’s actually a huge boon to Democrats right now,” said DNC chair Ken Martin. “And frankly, the American people are quite frustrated with this guy and what he’s been doing since Donald Trump was inaugurated. There’s plenty of other states we’d love you to campaign in.” But Wikler’s message that Musk should continue to be involved in day-to-day decisions by the Trump regime clearly runs counter to what Democrats should want. And Wikler may have realized his verbal slip-up, later saying during the press call that he wanted Musk to get stripped of any real power. “Elon Musk should become Donald Trump’s special envoy for midterm elections and go out and speak on the campaign trail in every possible state in every possible district,” Wikler said. “At the same time, Elon Musk should be removed as quickly as possible from any position of power over the federal government. Democrats have finally started to push back against Musk in various ways, though some tactics may prove to be more effective than others. Rep. Jamie Raskin, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter Wednesday to FBI director Kash Patel asking for an investigation into Musk’s ties to China. But Democrats clearly need to remember that this isn’t just about winning or losing elections. The part that really matters is what happens in between those elections. And while Musk might be hurting Republicans at the ballot box right now, he can still do tremendous damage between now and the next election.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newly informed equipment is capable of cutting submarine cables into extreme depths. Although presented as a civil tool, strategic potential raises international concerns. In a scenario of growing geopolitical tension, these cables have become strategic targets - and the possibility of their interruption poses severe risks to global security. In this context, China has just revealed an unprecedented device, developed specifically to cut submerged cables into great depths, which lights alerts in governments and military forces around the world. It is estimated that more than 1.4 billion meters of submarine cables currently connect continents, with plans for many additional kilometers. They are responsible for about 95% of international data traffic - a number ranging from countries. In Australia, for example, almost all communication depends on these cables. With the growth of services such as streaming, cloud servers and artificial intelligence, submarine cables were considered not only technical but strategic elements. In other cases, failures have been caused by accidents, but there is always the fear that they may be deliberate actions. According to a report by South China Morning Post, the state -seafone state -owned vehicle laboratory and the China ship scientific research center have developed a compact but highly efficient device aimed at cutting submarine cables. This allows you to cut cables with multiple layers of protection, including steel, rubber and polymers, usually used to shield these structures against damage. Haidou is an autonomous submersible with a format similar to that of a fish, used for mapping and research of great depths. Already Fendouzhe is a manned vehicle, also focused on scientific studies, but now can carry this new device with potential for military use. This is the first time that a country has officially declares to have technology focused on cutting submarine cables - something that until then was just speculated. In a possible conflict, cutting strategic cables can compromise military systems, government communications and the operation of online companies and services worldwide. Private companies are also investing in advanced monitoring solutions, with sensors and artificial intelligence to detect vibrations or attempts to cut cables. These initiatives aim to offer damage quickly and ensure the necessary redundancy so that if a cable is interrupted, the data can be redirected by other routes. However, simultaneous interruption of various cables, especially at strategic points, can cause significant failures in data systems. It is not just slow internet or instability in calls, but possible collapses on banking, financial, defense and even hospital operations that depend on continuous communication. With China opening the game and openly presenting its new technology, the dynamics of maritime security enters a new phase. Having such a specific and powerful cable device creates a precedent and increases the pressure for other nations to develop - or reveal - their own defense technologies or attack in the underwater environment. If before cutting a submarine cable was an action considered extreme and difficult to perform, it can now become more accessible, fast and accurate, transforming the bottom of the sea into another potential scenario for geopolitical disputes. Chinese technology is presented as an advance for peaceful purposes, but its destructive potential does not go unnoticed.</p>

While sharing screenshots and videos from the original Nintendo Switch has always been an excessively complicated process, it’s going to be much easier for the Switch 2. During today’s Direct presentation, Nintendo spent a lot of time talking about the Switch 2’s new built-in GameChat functionality that will give players a way to share their screens during group video calls. To move screenshots previously, you had to pop a Switch’s SD card out from behind its kickstand and slot it into another device. You could also share images and videos directly to Facebook and, until last year, X / Twitter by linking your Switch to accounts on either of those platforms. It was also possible to move media straight from your Switch to your smartphone by going into the Switch’s Album section, hitting share, and then taking a picture of the QR code generated by the console. According to Nintendo, Switch 2 users will be able to access the console’s 100 most recent screenshots and videos directly from the smartphone app. Obviously, a Nintendo Account will be required to make this work, but the company noted that you will not need a Nintendo Switch Online membership to take advantage of the smartphone app’s media transfer feature. The media transfer details alone are already a significant upgrade for the application, which never felt all that well-integrated into many of Nintendo’s games. Located within the smartphone app, Zelda Notes is meant to serve as a useful tool to help guide you through the Zelda games with features like spoken directions to specific locations you’ve marked on a map. The application will also give players a way to share blueprints for their unique Autobuild creations. Zelda Notes feels like a very smart way to get people excited about coming back to two older games many people have already spent quite a bit of time playing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo is Nintendo, and while plenty of people came out of the woodwork earlier this year to criticise it for being too conservative with the Switch 2, it was cooking in private. In classic Nintendo style, the corporation gave plenty of prominence to some surprisingly weird new options, like being able to use the Joy-Con 2 controllers in mouse mode. Nintendo was plumb in the middle of showing off its new Game Chat feature and trying to sell party chat as a huge new innovation in the year 2025. As it went on, though, it did start to introduce features that aren't available on other consoles, with the option of easily hooking up a camera being one. One is that, during party chats, you'll be able to see your friends' floating heads while they talk, superimposed on their screen portions. In some supported games, like Super Mario Party Jamboree, their faces will even appear in-game, near their characters, to give you live reactions. It's a real curiosity, and anyone who grew up in the PlayStation 2 era will immediately be wondering if this is basically just an EyeToy born again. We only saw a few applications of the camera, but I've no doubt that Nintendo will have more up its sleeve. With any peripheral of this ilk, the big question is whether more uses will still be cropping up in a few years, and I have to admit I'm doubtful. Still, at that price, I can't help but love Nintendo for throwing its camera into the mix.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget. After President Donald Trump pushed back a deadline for banning TikTok in January, the 75-day delay will run out on April 5th, but there’s still no word on a deal that could satisfy the law by shifting control of TikTok away from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The Information reports that later today, Trump plans to announce a plan for “TikTok America,” a new company with 50 percent ownership by unnamed new US investors, a one-third stake for existing ByteDance investors, and a 19.9 percent share for ByteDance. It would apparently license TikTok’s algorithm from ByteDance. That follows reports by the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and CNBC, which added Amazon and AppLovin to a list of potential or interested buyers along with Oracle, Blackstone, former LA Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, and Perplexity. AppLovin is a mobile tech company worth about $100 billion that uses data and AI to collect user information and target ads, and the WSJ says that its pitch to the Trump administration is that “it could solve national security concerns and unleash economic growth as a job creator.” Amazon could be interested in TikTok’s power to drive shopping interest, after shutting down its own Inspire feed of short, vertical videos in January. All of that is, of course, assuming TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, wants to sell. A reportedly favored plan for Oracle, Blackstone, Silver Lake, and other investors to make a deal is still rumored as a potential solution, but the New York Times notes that it’s still unclear whether that will satisfy the TikTok ban-or-divest law’s requirements. With Trump also planning to announce new tariff plans on Wednesday, the WSJ reports Chinese officials are waiting to hear the details before considering anything else.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds returns this summer with ten new episodes.

Paramount+ has dropped a tantalizing one-minute teaser for the upcoming third season of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds., and it looks like the latest adventures of the starship Enterprise will bring romance, comedy, mystery, and even a bit of analog tech, not to mention a brand new villain.

(Some spoilers for S2 below)

We haven't seen much from the third season to date. There was an exclusive clip during San Diego Comic Con last summer—a callback to the S2 episode "Charades," in which a higher-dimensional race, the Kerkohvians, accidentally reconfigured Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan physiology to that of a full-blooded human, just before Spock was supposed to meet his Vulcan fiancee's parents. The S3 clip had the situation reversed: The human crew had to make themselves Vulcan to succeed on a new mission but weren't able to change back.

The S2 finale found the Enterprise under vicious attack by the Gorn, who were in the midst of invading one of the Federation's colony worlds. Several crew members were kidnapped (La'an, M'Benga, Ortegas, and Sam), along with other survivors of the attack. Pike faced a momentous decision: follow orders to retreat, or disobey them to rescue his crew. In October, we learned that Pike naturally chose the latter. New footage shown at New York City Comic-Con picked up where the finale left off, giving us the kind of harrowing high-stakes pitched space battle against a ferocious enemy that has long been a hallmark of the franchise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are tremendously fond of fermented foodstuffs. Technically, it's the yeast they crave, produced by yummy rotting fruit, but they can consume quite a lot of ethanol as a result of that fruity diet. Yes, fruit flies have ultra-fast metabolisms, the better to burn off the booze, but they can still get falling-down drunk—so much so, that randy inebriated male fruit flies have been known to court other males by mistake and fail to mate successfully. Then again, apparently adding alcohol to their food increases the production of sex pheromones in male fruit flies, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. That, in turn, makes them more attractive to the females of the species. This in turn makes alcoholic males more attractive to females and ensures a higher mating success rate, whereas the success of drunken male humans with females is likely to be questionable." Fruit flies are the workhorses of modern genetics research, used to study everything from cancer to sleep disorders. They make excellent model systems because they share so many genes with humans, plus they are cheap, easy to breed, and can be genetically altered easily. Many years ago, I had the privilege of visiting the University of California, San Francisco laboratory of behavior geneticist Ulrike Heberlein, who spent years getting fruit flies drunk in an "Inebriometer" to learn about the various genes that influence alcohol tolerance. (Heberlein is now scientific program director and laboratory head at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Farm Research Campus.)</p>

At least two of Nintendo’s Switch 2 games are going to be more expensive than most games on the first Switch. Many Switch games cost $59.99, but Nintendo revealed today the Switch 2’s Mario Kart World, a June 5th launch title, will cost $79.99, while Donkey Kong Bananza, releasing a little over a month later, will cost $69.99.

These aren’t Nintendo’s first titles to exceed a $59.99 price. That honor goes to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which launched at $69.99. When that price was announced, Nintendo told Game Informer that “we determine the suggested retail price for any Nintendo product on a case-by-case basis.”

Nintendo is taking some of the sting off Mario Kart World’s higher price if you get it as part of a special $499.99 Switch 2 bundle. (On its own, the Switch 2 costs $449.99.) But it appears that Nintendo’s next-generation console could have games that are generally more expensive than before.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the heels of releasing its most capable AI model yet, Google is making some changes to the Gemini team. A new report from Semafor reveals that longtime Googler Sissie Hsiao will step down from her role leading the Gemini team effective immediately. According to a memo from DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, this change is designed to "sharpen our focus on the next evolution of the Gemini app." This new responsibility won't take Woodward away from his role at Google Labs—he will remain in charge of that division while leading the Gemini team. Meanwhile, Hsiao says in a message to employees that she is happy with "Chapter 1" of the Bard story and is optimistic for Woodward's "Chapter 2." Hsiao won't be involved in Google's AI efforts for now—she's opted to take some time off before returning to Google in a new role. Hsiao has been at Google for 19 years and was tasked with building Google's chatbot in 2022. This process has been a bit of a slog, with Google's models improving slowly while simultaneously worming their way into many beloved products. However, the sense inside the company is that Gemini has turned a corner with 2.5 Pro. While this model is still in the experimental stage, it has bested other models in academic benchmarks and has blown right past them in all-important vibemarks like LM Arena.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crowds at CinemaCon in Las Vegas were treated to an early screening of Universal Pictures’ How to Train Your Dragon, and the resounding reaction from those in attendance is excitedly positive. The feature from writer-director Dean DeBlois is a live-action adaptation of the DreamWorks animated films that DeBlois also oversaw. The CinemaCon screening previewed the film before its June theatrical debut for film industry professionals, invited media, and content creators. io9’s Germain Lussier was in attendance and we’ll kick things off with his thoughts: My only gripe is the new stuff, while good and subtle, never elevates things enough. It is by far one of the best live-action adaptations, but I still prefer the animated film. Thanks to its acting and character dynamics, I was emotionally engrossed, and I did fall in love… pic.twitter.com/wGvFPjhMj7 — Rosa Parra (@rosasreviews) April 2, 2025 Wasn’t exactly sold on this live-action remake before, but I’m blown away. #HowToTrainYourDragon is the best live-action adaptation film I’ve seen. I’ve never loved a CGI creature more than Toothless. How to Train Your Dragon does live action remakes of animated classics right. Dean DeBlois nigh perfectly adapted the original. Took the family to see a screening of the live action #HowToTrainYourDragon movie, coming out this June, they LOVED it, here with director @DeanDeBlois and Christian and Glen from Framestore #❤️🐉 #ToothlessForever #dragonsareREAL pic.twitter.com/tNiUQVMMGX — Cressida Cowell (@CressidaCowell) March 28, 2025 By the time Hiccup touches Toothless’ nose, I lost that fight. I couldn’t help but give myself completely to a story I love deeply, even while accepting its tendency to be safe. How To Train Your Dragon was INCREDIBLE. There are jaw dropping sequences that truly took my breath away. Mason Thames truly embodies who Hiccup is and it was a sight to behold. How to Train Your Dragon won’t overcome those who are staunchly against remaking animation as live-action, but ultimately, it’s a great story once more very well told. It didn’t reinvent anything yet unlike, say, Lion King 2019, it still has heart and I still cried. Just saw the live-action How to Train Your Dragon and—wow. The care and love poured into adapting this beloved franchise is undeniable, and it shows in every frame. How To Train Your Dragon bucks the trend of live-action remakes being subpar. It beautifully takes on the original animated film but adds just enough to stand out from it. #CinemaCon #HowToTrainYourDragon pic.twitter.com/84pQXuPzJh — That Hashtag Show (Official) (@ThatHashtagShow) April 2, 2025 I have only sort of interacted with the animated #HowToTrainYourDragon so seeing the live-action was a beautiful adventure. Toothless is a cat and I would die for him pic.twitter.com/JZ9EAuooWI — Rachel Leishman (@RachelLeishman) April 2, 2025 While, I do feel the live action #HowToTrainYourDragon is not needed, I am overjoyed it was made pic.twitter.com/w1LBardTj7 — K.E.V.I.N. #HowToTrainYourDragon was everything I wanted as someone utterly obsessed with original. Get ready to fall in love with Toothless all over again.#HowToTrainYourDragon is an exceedingly faithful adaptation that brings the classic story and world to life. What I love so much about How To Train Your Dragon live action is that it is not a shot for shot remake. The bond between Hiccup & Toothless is perfectly brought to screen. See it on the biggest screen possible. https://t.co/FEldTMDcij — Tessa Smith – Mama's Geeky (@MamasGeeky) April 2, 2025 How to Train Your Dragon opens June 13.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo's Switch 2 presentation gave us pricing for the console ($449 to start) and Nintendo's product pages have given us pricing information for accessories ($80 for a Pro Controller, $90 for another pair of Joy-Cons, and $110 for a replacement dock, sheesh). But what Nintendo didn't mention during the presentation was game pricing, either for standalone Switch 2 titles or the Switch 2 Edition upgrades for existing Switch games.

We do have one solid first-party data point for US game pricing: Mario Kart World, the console's flagship launch title, will cost $50 when you buy a digital copy as part of a Switch 2 bundle. But the game will cost $80 when you buy it on its own, $30 more than the pack-in version and $20 more than the usual $60 price for first-party Switch games.

That doesn't mean that $80 is the starting price for all Switch 2 games. Donkey Kong Bananza, slated for a near-launch July 17 release, has a $69.99 MSRP, which is more in line with the $70 default for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S games. Nintendo hasn't explained that first-party pricing gap between the two games, but it could reflect Mario Kart World's more involved online multiplayer, or simply be a way to push people on the fence in the direction of the cheaper bundled version.

Inflation alone would be enough to justify the price increases—a $60 game in 2017 could cost $78 now (though that's using the overall rate of inflation, and prices have risen more steeply in some corners of the economy than others). But with a new console comes the potential for better and more detailed graphics, and those can take more money to produce, too.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I don't think anybody outside Nintendo or FromSoftware was expecting a spiritual successor to Bloodborne to be one of the titles announced at the Nintendo Switch 2's launch today. Not just "playable" on the Switch 2, but exclusive to it. But there it was, The Duskbloods, debuting its dread horror action just a few minutes before the luminously pink and puffy Kirby Air Ride 2. We'll get to FromSoftware's surprising Switch 2 exclusive in a bit. Far less surprising is a new Mario Kart game, as Mario Kart 8 sold more than 67 million copies, covering more than 40 percent of all Switches sold. These are the other Switch 2 exclusives Nintendo touted today: Kirby Air Riders, a sequel to the 2003 GameCube title Kirby's Air Ride, puts the adorable pink inhalation monster and his friends on jet-powered stars. Donkey Kong Bananza has the big guy doing his usual 3D/2D platforming, but also digging into mines. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment has Koei Tecmo and Nintendo putting a prequel story to Tears of the Kingdom into the Dynasty Warriors mass slash-em-up mold. Drag x Drive uses both the Joy-Con's mouse mode and motion controls for moving, shooting, and even waving to your teammates for the ball in a stylized wheelchair basketball match.</p>

His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc. Sonos is lowering the price of two products in an effort to boost hardware sales amid a continued slump. The company’s Era 100 smart speaker and entry-level Ray soundbar now both cost $199. That’s a $50 drop for the Era 100, which launched at $249. Both products have regularly been available for less during sales and retailer discounts, but now the price drop is permanent. Its original price felt reasonable, but at $199, it’s an even better deal and a good gateway into the Sonos ecosystem. Still, the compact soundbar easily outperforms built-in TV speakers, so it’s a solid no-frills option for smaller rooms or secondary TVs. (Some owners have also come to enjoy it as a desk speaker, but that’s not the primary purpose.) $199 is certainly a fairer price for what you’re getting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Verge staff has a lot of feelings about the device, which will launch on June 5th, and we’ve collected our first impressions below. But the Switch 2’s mostly-black design looks off to me. The original Switch may have launched with a gray Joy-Con option, but the neon red and blue controllers that also launched on day one became iconic. Now, the Switch 2 has just splashes of colors, and they’re mostly hidden. And yes, Nintendo will almost certainly repeat its strategy of launching a Switch 2 with that display technology down the line. And I was pleasantly surprised that the company went with a 120Hz panel that supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and wider HDR color. It won’t deliver the inky blacks of OLED, but as long as Nintendo’s quality assurance is up to snuff, the LCD won’t dissuade me from buying a Switch 2 on day one. The new Joy-Con are bigger, look more comfortable, do indeed attach via magnets, and can even be used like a mouse. Just imagine: the joy of Zoom meetings, now integrated into your gameplay. Voice chat and video streaming are the worst parts about gaming to me. I will not be using these features to scare my friends away by yelling at them. The new GameCube controller is one flaw from perfection Hardly the Pro Controller replacement or WaveBird successor I was hoping for. $449.99 is higher than I was expecting for the Switch 2. But still I’ll be doing everything I can to snag the $499.99 bundle with Mario Kart World, a game that costs an eye-watering $79.99 on its own. Let’s just hope pre-orders, which start on April 9th, go ok. (I’m expecting disaster.) I never would have bet on Donkey Kong Bananza leading the charge. He may be as old as Mario, but this is only Donkey Kong’s second-ever 3D platformer, his first since 1999’s Donkey Kong 64, and his first solo game since Tropical Freeze in 2014. He’s an unlikely candidate for a system seller. Then again, that’s probably what Mario Kart is for. The age of new consoles being bundled with a free game is behind us, but it’s confusing why Nintendo is charging for the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour app. Wii Sports not only helped make that console a huge hit for Nintendo, it also cleverly introduced gamers to the Wiimote and Nunchuck’s unique capabilities and motion-controlled gaming. The Welcome Tour app feels like a similar idea, but with much less replay value. And I nearly jumped out of my seat during the Kirby Air Riders trailer, which looked almost like an intro for a new SSB game. It wasn’t, unfortunately, though SSB creator Masahiro Sakurai, who also directed the original Air Ride, is directing Riders. Here’s hoping he’ll be up for another SSB. It’s been more than two decades since Nintendo released F-Zero GX, my favorite anti-gravity racer of all time, and Switch 2 Direct revealed that it and several other GameCube games are coming to the new console as a Nintendo Switch Online feature. After my decision to stick with digital game downloads for the original Nintendo Switch led to frustrations with playing those games on the Switch OLED, I was planning a return to physical cartridges for the Switch 2. But Nintendo’s reveal of its new virtual game cards last week has changed my mind. Nintendo squeezed in some promising info about Switch 2 updates for older titles during today’s Direct. The selection of games getting updates — which includes Arms, Super Mario Odyssey, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker — is relatively small, and it sounds like Nintendo is taking steps to make them compatible with the Switch 2’s new GameChat feature.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Europol has shut down one of the largest dark web pedophile networks in the world, prompting dozens of arrests worldwide and threatening that more are to follow. Launched in 2021, KidFlix allowed users to join for free to preview low-quality videos depicting child sex abuse materials (CSAM). To see higher-resolution videos, users had to earn credits by sending cryptocurrency payments, uploading CSAM, or "verifying video titles and descriptions and assigning categories to videos." Europol seized the servers and found a total of 91,000 unique videos depicting child abuse, "many of which were previously unknown to law enforcement," the agency said in a press release. Operation Stream, as it was dubbed, was supported by law enforcement in more than 35 countries, including the United States. Nearly 1,400 suspected consumers of CSAM have been identified among 1.8 million global KidFlix users, and 79 have been arrested so far. According to Europol, 39 child victims were protected as a result of the sting, and more than 3,000 devices were seized. Police identified suspects through payment data after seizing the server. And in some cases cops defeated user attempts to hide their identities—such as a man who made payments using his mother's name in Spain, a local news outlet, Todo Alicante, reported. It likely helped that most suspects were already known offenders, Europol noted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson has refused to commit to resisting President Donald Trump if he ordered the agency to drop its antitrust suit against Meta, saying he would “obey lawful orders” and calling the scenario “a hypothetical.” His comments, made at a tech policy event in Washington, DC, followed a session where Ferguson reaffirmed his belief that independent regulatory agencies are “not good for a democracy.” Ferguson appeared at an antitrust-focused event hosted by Y Combinator on Wednesday, branded as the “Little Tech Competition Summit.” The FTC is set to begin its blockbuster anti-monopoly trial against Meta in just a couple of weeks, making a case that — in an extreme scenario — could break up the company. Ferguson has pledged strong fealty to him, declaring last month that Trump “is the chief executive and is vested with all the executive power in our government,” including the power to remove commissioners. Asked by The Verge how he’d react if the president asked him to drop a case like Meta’s, Ferguson said, “the President’s head of the executive branch, and I think it’s important for me to obey lawful orders.” But, he added, “I think that the President recognizes that we’ve got to enforce the laws, so I’d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.” “I can’t imagine it happening,” he said. Trump has already taken unprecedented steps to assert power over independent agencies including the FTC, and Ferguson has so far welcomed them. Trump signed an executive order in February claiming that independent agency officials should be subject to “supervision and control” by the president. Recently, The Verge first reported, FTC staff was instructed to stop labeling the agency as “independent” when describing it as a plaintiff in legal complaints. “My view about the FTC’s mission is entirely unchanged,” he said, adding that he’s “firmly of the view” that Trump had authority to fire his colleagues and that independent agencies are “not good for a democracy.” That’s because, he said, “all powerful executive branch officials” should be accountable to the people, ”and the only person in the executive branch that gets elected is the president.” Alvaro Bedoya, one of the Democratic commissioners Trump has attempted to fire, has previously told The Washington Post that Ferguson is “no friend to Big Tech.” But, he wondered, what would happen if the White House called him up to ask him to settle a case or halt an investigation?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. In its April 2nd Direct event, Nintendo revealed a lot of the Switch 2 details we’ve been waiting for, including the console’s price ($449.99 in the US), its June 5th release date, and a slew of new games coming to it, like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza. Nintendo says they’ll be more comfortable, too. Smoother and quieter makes sense if Nintendo is using Hall effect sensors this time around, as previously rumored. Disconnecting them involves pressing a release button on the back. In its Direct today, Nintendo claims they “won’t easily detach” on their own, but we’ll see about that when the system launches this summer. You can’t even force them to detach with ghost hands. Another big new feature of the Switch 2 Joy-Cons is that they can work like a mouse with select games. Kawamoto said the feature will be used in games like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, for aiming (gyro control is still an option, too, according to a footnote on the page), and the thoroughly named Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV. The Joy-Cons come with wrist straps, which Nintendo says gives them a wider base for “smoother gliding and better stability.” Kawamoto said the new Joy-Con rumble feature, now called HD Rumble 2, is updated “to allow for a wider variety of vibrations.” They’ll also be stronger, he said, and have “quicker response times.” According to Nintendo’s official specs, the controllers will last about 20 hours between charges and recharge in about 3.5 hours, same as the original Joy-Cons. As for accessories, apart from the included wrist straps, Nintendo has also announced a $19.99 set of two wheels you can attach the Joy-Con 2s to for games like Mario Kart World. Nintendo did away with the IR sensor found on the right-hand first-generation Joy-Con, which I will miss for no reason other than that I love when gadgets have IR sensors. In every other way, the updated Joy-Cons sound like an improvement over their predecessors, with intriguing new features and Nintendo’s promise of better comfort and improved rumble.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and a senior aide used personal Gmail accounts for government communications, according to a Washington Post report published yesterday. Waltz has been at the center of controversy for weeks because he inadvertently invited The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal chat in which top Trump administration officials discussed a plan for bombing Houthi targets in Yemen. Yesterday's report of Gmail use and another recent report on additional Signal chats raise more questions about the security of sensitive government communications in the Trump administration. A senior Waltz aide used Gmail "for highly technical conversations with colleagues at other government agencies involving sensitive military positions and powerful weapons systems relating to an ongoing conflict," The Washington Post wrote. Waltz himself "had less sensitive, but potentially exploitable information sent to his Gmail, such as his schedule and other work documents, said officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe what they viewed as problematic handling of information," the report said. "The officials said Waltz would sometimes copy and paste from his schedule into Signal to coordinate meetings and discussions." Separately, The Wall Street Journal described additional Signal chats in a report on Sunday about Waltz losing support inside the White House. "Two US officials also said that Waltz has created and hosted multiple other sensitive national-security conversations on Signal with cabinet members, including separate threads on how to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine as well as military operations. They declined to address if any classified information was posted in those chats," the WSJ wrote. We contacted the White House about the reported use of Gmail and Signal today and will update this article if we get a response.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>German A., a 43-year-old Russian engineer, is accused of secretly supplying sensitive technical information from ASML, NXP, and TSMC to Russia, allegedly to assist in building a 28nm-capable fab there, reports NRC. His illicit earnings were about €40,000, and he now faces 18 to 32 months in prison. German A. is accused of supplying Russia with confidential technical materials from ASML, GlobalFoundries, NXP, TSMC, and GlobalFoundries, including semiconductor production manuals and various chipmaking machines. The investigators reportedly found that he obtained 105 internal documents from ASML and 88 files related to TSMC. The materials did not contain complete blueprints for building wafer fabrication equipment or something more significant (e.g., a fab itself or how to design a process technology). Still, they were labeled confidential and could support the setup of a basic semiconductor line capable of producing chips at 28nm-class process technology, which is good enough for military applications. Investigators believe he shared this data via cloud storage and messaging apps and handed over a USB stick in Moscow, allegedly earning around €40,000 in the process. In August 2024, German A. was taken into custody following a report from the national intelligence agency. A month later, ASML and NXP were officially informed of the espionage suspicion. His case is now being handled in court, and authorities suspect ties to Russian intelligence. While German A. could not possibly steal blueprints of all tools necessary to build a fully functioning semiconductor production facility in Russia, a network of such spies could potentially do the job and revive semiconductor production in the hostile nation. After that, he joined the Greek research institute NCSR and later started to work at Fab 1, a Dresden facility of GlobalFoundries. German A. was among over 100 engineers who moved to ASML, where he operated machines for producing electro-optical components. 's name appears on four patent filings associated with ASML, the latest of which was published just a month ago. These documents list several inventors, and it is unclear whether German A. played a significant role in those innovations. A review of his digital activity shows that he accessed restricted files on two days in December 2020, even though he had no need for them. Experts asked by NRC believe the leaked data includes presentations and manuals but not the core plans needed to construct chip machines or an entire plant. After ASML, German A. used recruitment agencies to look for work in research roles but was unsuccessful. This is now seen as an attempt to gather parts for a new facility. Statements from his former spouse reveal that by late 2023, he was in touch with Russian researchers about building a fab in Russia capable of producing chips using a 28nm technology. Back then, Russian entities were blacklisted and could not get advanced chips from prominent suppliers, whether distributors or foundries. That same year, he held a one-year position at TU Delft but remained isolated, and investigators found no signs of theft there. Both ASML and NXP experienced breaches involving unauthorized access in the past. In late 2023, it was revealed that a cyber group linked to China had been covertly operating within NXP's systems for an extended period. ASML also battles frequent cyberattacks and insider threats: in early 2022, a former Chinese employee stole confidential data. Although that employee, just like German A., lacked access to complete designs needed to construct a fab tool or equip a fab, a broader network of similar operatives could realistically piece together enough to boost the semiconductor industries of China and Russia. In response, both companies have strengthened their digital defenses: internal systems now limit access between departments and employee activity is tracked for unusual behavior.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The closure of accounts for "Kyash," which allows free transfers between individuals, has been a hot topic on social media.

Kyash, which operates the service, announced on February 27th that it would close accounts that have no usage history for more than six months. If you wish to continue using the service, you will be asked to check your balance by 11:59pm on March 31st and reuse it by depositing, settlement, transfers, withdrawals, etc.

This topic was based on the above. The company has been complaining about its users on social media, with the company's "price collection unavailable" in January due to a defect in the payment system of its "Kyash Visa Card."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Igor's Lab received a defective PowerColor RX 9070 XT Hellhound from a reader who had purchased the card. While it had apparently passed quality control tests, Igor found a defective RDNA 4 die that resulted in unsustainable temperatures — which persisted even after re-pasting. Igor's Lab does preface its report by noting that, for now, this is an isolated case and it cannot fully confirm what caused the damage to the die. Further inspection with a microscope revealed more than 1934 craters or pits in the silicon, amounting to over 1% of the chip surface. Igor's Lab says it used general industry guideline values as a reference point for allowable pit size, as RDNA 4 currently lacks any publicly available specifications for the maximum depth of a defect. "... As a rule, depths ≤ 5-10 µm with a diameter ≤ 50-100 µm are not considered critical, provided they do not occur near die edges or bond surfaces. In more sensitive areas or in applications with high mechanical stress (such as particularly thin dies), a defect with a depth of more than 2-3 µm can already be critical." The outlet measured one pit on the faulty card with a depth of 12.59 µm and a diameter of 212.36 µm, which is beyond the standard industry guidelines. Similar to sanding, complications in the backgrinding process can occur. Debris from the grinding process can cause scratches and pitting, flaking, or other irregularities that affect the silicon's structural integrity and reduce cooling effectiveness. Regardless of where the damage came from, Igor's Lab concludes that there are multiple parties that failed to catch the problem. As the card comes from PowerColor's factory, it's ultimately responsible for inadequate Q&A. TSMC and other involved parties also passed this particular sample, potentially due to AI-based inspection algorithms that didn't have sufficient training to detect the problems. At present, the issue doesn't appear to be widespread. AMD told Igor's Lab that the defective PowerColor RX 9070 XT is "an isolated incident." Hopefully, that's correct and there aren't further incidents.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indiana University contacted Wang in December to ask about a 2017-2018 grant in China that listed Wang as a researcher, according to an unsigned statement that appears to be written by a Purdue University professor and long-time collaborator of Wang seen by WIRED. The statement has been circulating among cybersecurity and privacy scholars at universities around the world in recent days and was sent to WIRED by three separate sources. Alex Tanford, a professor emeritus at Indiana University and the IU Bloomington Chapter president of the American Association of University Professors, says Wang reached out to him and said that he had been accused of alleged research misconduct. IU did not answer WIRED’s questions regarding any probes into Wang. “The charge seemed trivial—that he had failed to properly disclose who was principal investigator on a grant application and had not fully listed all his coauthors on an article,” Tanford tells WIRED of the allegations. Wang regularly collaborated with researchers at the Institute of Information Engineering (IIE) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a government-funded cybersecurity research lab. In papers, Wang and his coauthors disclosed that the IIE scholars received funding from sources such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China, but that Wang was being supported by US grants. It’s not uncommon for professors at US institutions to collaborate with researchers in China, and there's no public evidence to suggest that the arrangements were improper. According to the unsigned statement’s title and metadata, it appears to have been authored by Ninghui Li, a computer science professor at Purdue who has collaborated on research with Wang since at least 2006. Li did not respond to emailed requests for comment nor a voicemail left on his office phone.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I was already worried Nintendo would price the Switch 2 too high, and unfortunately, the official price is even higher than I feared it would be. Nintendo showed off some exciting announcements in Wednesday's Switch 2 livestream, but it's hard to be excited, knowing many Nintendo fans may find it challenging to afford the new console. Here's a look at just how pricey the Switch 2 is compared to previous Nintendo consoles and what fans have to say about it. The Switch 2 is less than $100 shy of being the most expensive console Nintendo has ever released when adjusted for inflation. Stay in the know with Laptop Mag Get our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors After Wednesday's Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo officially announced that the Switch 2 will start at $449 and launch on June 5, 2025. There's also a configuration for $499 that includes the new Mario Kart World game. The original Switch was just $299, so this is an increase of $150 generation-to-generation. Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE : was $649 now $419 at Best Buy Now $230 off, the 2024 Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE is a great for both gaming and productivity. It's one of the best best for college students, business pros, and anyone else looking for a capable PC. In fact, the Switch 2 is the third most expensive console Nintendo has ever released when adjusted for inflation. When it launched in 1985, the NES cost $179, which would be $530 today. The SNES just barely takes second place with a price of $459 when adjusted for inflation.

For context, that's higher than a typical AAA PC game, which is around $60 or $70 today. In fact, Nintendo seems to be nickel-and-diming its users wherever it can. Who would pay for the system tutorial? It's truly hard to fathom how Nintendo can expect gamers to want to pay for that, on top of paying more for the console itself and the games. This pricing may have major repercussions for Nintendo, too. As one Bluesky user said, "It's called Switch 2 because after watching Nintendo Direct imma Switch 2 Steam Deck." This pricing could put Nintendo in a precarious position by pushing gamers toward less expensive devices with less expensive games, particularly handheld gaming PCs. For Nintendo's sake, I sure hope to see a lot of sales on Switch 2 consoles and games, and it sounds like many other gamers are in the same boat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Automated bots seeking AI model training data for LLMs have been vacuuming up terabytes of data, growing the foundation's bandwidth used for downloading multimedia content by 50 percent since January 2024. It’s a scenario familiar across the free and open source software (FOSS) community, as we've previously detailed. The Foundation hosts not only Wikipedia but also platforms like Wikimedia Commons, which offers 144 million media files under open licenses. For decades, this content has powered everything from search results to school projects. This exponential growth in non-human traffic has imposed steep technical and financial costs—often without the attribution that helps sustain Wikimedia’s volunteer ecosystem. The foundation says that when former US President Jimmy Carter died in December 2024, his Wikipedia page predictably drew millions of views. The surge doubled Wikimedia’s normal network traffic, temporarily maxing out several of its Internet connections. Wikimedia engineers quickly rerouted traffic to reduce congestion, but the event revealed a deeper problem: The baseline bandwidth had already been consumed largely by bots scraping media at scale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Wick fans have plenty of reasons to celebrate. During CinemaCon 2025, it was officially confirmed that John Wick: Chapter 5 is already under development, with Keanu Reeves returning to the main role that consecrated him. But this is not the only news-the franchise universe is about to grow like never before, with a lively precelane and two spin-offs on the horizon. John Wick's impossible mission will be revealed - in anime This mission was only cited in the first productions, but never actually shown. The production will be written by Vanessa Taylor (Game of Thrones, the shape of water) and directed by Shannon Tindle (Ultraman: Rising). It has always been a great influence on me, especially in John Wick's saga. Turning this universe into anime looks a natural step. I believe this media can expand our characters and action in hitherto unimaginable ways." In addition to animation and fifth chapter, the franchise expands with new spin-offs. The already announced Ballerina, starring Ana de Armas, debuts in June and promises to bring a new female perspective to the universe of professional killers. "John Wick's productions have raised action cinema to a new level. I'm grateful to Lionsgate for trusting me this mission. “Caine is one of my favorite characters in John Wick's universe. His mastery of action, culture and narrative makes him the ideal director.” With so many projects in progress, John Wick's universe seems far from retiring.</p>

By insulating the terminals and cable insertions with tape and placing them in a plastic bag that can be seen inside, they are collected at the resource and garbage collection center once a week on resource days.

The mobile battery, a portable storage battery that incorporates a small rechargeable battery that mainly uses charging mobile phones and smartphones, is also eligible. Just like before, it will also be accepted for bringing items to stores (such as electronics retailers) of the JBRC, a general incorporated association.

However, small rechargeable batteries that have been deformed or expanded must be brought to the Shinjuku Cleaning Office and each cleaning center. They also encourage people to use up as much electricity as possible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A SpaceX and X engineer, Christopher Stanley—currently serving as a senior advisor in the Deputy Attorney General's office at the Department of Justice (DOJ)—was reportedly caught bragging about hacking and distributing pirated e-books, bootleg software, and game cheats. The boasts appeared on archived versions of websites, of which several, once flagged, were quickly deleted, Reuters reported. Stanley was assigned to the DOJ by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While Musk claims that DOGE operates transparently, not much is known about who the staffers are or what their government roles entail. It remains unclear what Stanley does at DOJ, but Reuters noted that the Deputy Attorney General’s office is in charge of investigations into various crimes, "including hacking and other malicious cyber activity." Declining to comment further, the DOJ did confirm that as a "special government employee," like Musk, Stanley does not draw a government salary. The engineer's questionable past seemingly dates back to 2006, Reuters reported, when Stanley was still in high school. The news site connected Stanley to various sites and forums by tracing various pseudonyms he still uses, including Reneg4d3, a nickname he still uses on YouTube. There, Stanley branded a competing messaging board "stupid noobs" after supposedly gaining admin access through an "easy exploit," Reuters reported. On Bluesky, an account called "doge whisperer" alleges even more hacking activity, some of which appears to be corroborated by an IA screenshot of another site Stanley created, electonic.net (sic), which as of this writing can still be accessed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Generation Z is transforming the way we think work and rest. Instead of waiting for traditional retirement to slow down, many young people are choosing to take long periods of break through their professional life. This practice, known as micro -postation, has been observed among some millennials since 2007, but has now gained prominence as a dominant trend among new generation professionals. According to career experts, such as Marlene Pöhlmann of Robert Half agency, micro -postation is a voluntary career interruption, usually among jobs, which can last several months. During this period, people travel, take care of the family or invest in hobbies and personal development - without the pressures of daily work. Generation Z, born between the mid -1990s and 2010, has a different relationship with work. They value the balance between personal and professional life, prioritize mental health and are less willing to sacrifice their youth by uncertain promises of future stability. In addition, the world of work has become more flexible. Another factor that motivates this choice is insecurity regarding traditional retirement. Many young people doubt that when they retire in the future, they can really enjoy the benefits provided for by current social security systems. Jonathan H. Westover, researcher and member of Forbes Council, defends practice as an important instrument for improving mental health and preventing burnout. Research indicates that regular work breaks reduce stress and increase overall well-being. Sugure teacher Mariappanadar from an Australian university recalls that these breaks are not always paid or structured as a “sabbatical year”. They are often financed with personal economies or public aid, which can pose a financial risk, especially in high -cost countries. "Who is not present, is not seen - and this can make a difference in strategic decisions within a company," says Pöhlmann. There is still resistance in some cultures and sectors. In addition, there are those who argue that young people should take advantage of youth energy to work harder and gain experience, especially at the beginning of their career. Being present in the corporate environment, for example, may favor important connections. Great leaders have already mentioned that working in person in office increases the chances of professional growth, while remote work or prolonged absences can limit opportunities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But, the showcase did reveal some details that have firmly piqued my interest as a Steam Deck enthusiast. Unlike most Steam Deck docks, Ninty's new cradle comes with a fan built-in, and that could make all the difference when running demanding adventures at 4K on a big screen. As someone who regularly uses these hubs, the idea of a much thinner device achieving that boggles my mind, and Ninty's secret weapon could end up being the new integrated fan. Thermals are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to gaming handheld performance. If you're looking for a system that's going to hit 4K at lofty frame rates without breaking a sweat, I wouldn't immediately point you towards Nintendo Switch 2. That said, the fact that the console maker has designed its dock with temperature considerations at its forefront tells me it's serious about offering up a high-spec experience, and it could end up making my Steam Deck OLED look a little silly. One of the biggest blights to portable performance is thermal throttling, a cursed term that describes when a CPU runs slower due to toasty temperatures. It's something gaming laptops and handhelds can suffer from, and the solution is usually adding more elaborate cooling solutions that make for chonkier designs. One of the delights of being a Switch player is being able to dive into some games without needing to bench-press a heavy portable, but it does mean Ninty's system is somewhat nerfed in docked mode. Yet, by moving a powerful fan to the dock rather than squeezing it into the Switch 2 itself, Nintendo may have achieved a better balance than Valve. Sure, you can pick up Steam Deck docks with active cooling included, but they rarely lower thermals in a way that translates to a meaningful performance boost. Neither the Deck's own innards or those third-party cradles can help the portable actually hit anywhere near 4K outside of some lighter indie titles and classic capers.

In theory, the system will draw more power and keep everything nice and cool while you mess around with daft creations in Tears of the Kingdom remastered, enjoy a road trip in Mario Kart World, or even play bigger third-party games at 4K. Nintendo is typically viewed as a low-spec underdog compared to Sony and Microsoft, and this new system won't remotely be in the same ring as the PS5. What it might do, however, is set a new docked mode approach yet again that makes all the difference compared to existing portables, and this new hybrid solution has been a long time coming.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But unlike graphene, molybdenum disulfide is a semiconductor. The material has been used in a variety of demonstration electronics, including flash storage and image sensors. But we've recently figured out how to generate wafer-scale sheets of MoS 2 on a sapphire substrate, and the team took advantage of that to build the processor, which they call RV32-WUJI. It can only add single bits at a time and is limited to kilohertz clock speeds, but it is capable of executing the full RISC-V 32-bit instruction set thanks to nearly 6,000 individual transistors. We've identified a wide range of what are termed 2D materials. These all form repeated chemical bonds in more or less a single plane. Molybdenum disulfide is slightly different, as the angle of the chemical bonds is out of plane, resulting in a zig-zag pattern. This means the sheet is slightly thicker than its component atoms. Credit: Ben Mills/Wikipedia Molybdenum disulfide consists of sulfur (yellow spheres) and molybdenum (blue spheres) in a staggered hexagonal structure. In any case, the electronic properties of these materials are strictly a product of the orbital configurations of the molecule itself—there is no bulk material from which bulk properties can emerge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dogs are dear family members for millions of people in the world. Like humans, dogs also suffer from anxiety and stress, and this can manifest in quite evident ways in behavior. Among several known strategies, a technique has caught the attention of experts and is gaining space: reading aloud to your dog. Read to the dog: Why does it work? Many of the animals calmed down quickly - some even fell asleep. The sound of the human voice, when used quietly, creates a safety and relaxation environment, especially for more sensitive dogs. This causes the animal to associate that moment with calm and comfort. Children's books are a good choice as they use short phrases and simple language, facilitating the animal's attention to the sound of reading. How to include reading in your pet's routine Dogs like routine and predictability, which helps reduce anxiety. Reading every day at the same time - especially after a walk or late afternoon - can help the animal relax and sleep better. Also, it is important to use a smooth and constant voice tone. How to know if your dog is anxious? Dr. Charlotte Rice, an expert in animal welfare, proposes the Peep test, which helps tutors identify signs of stress in their pets: And (ears): Are they lowered or facing back? P (position): Does he try to hide, move away or get still? If the animal presents these signs, reading can be a simple, accessible and effective way to relieve its tension. Several factors can trigger stress in dogs, including: Changes in the environment: reforms, home change, new family members or travel. Other factors: veterinarian visits, hospitalizations, loneliness, lack of physical and mental stimuli.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We've known for a few months now that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support backward compatibility for older Nintendo Switch games, and as of today's presentation, we also know that some Switch games will get special Switch 2 Editions that add new features and support higher resolutions and other features. Nintendo's product pages for the Switch add more details, including the status of backward-compatibility testing for original Switch games and a small handful of first-party Switch games that will get "free updates" to enhance them for Switch 2. There will be a second tier of updates for original Switch games that Nintendo says "may improve performance or add support for features such as GameShare in select games." These won't include the extra features or higher resolutions of Switch 2 Edition games, but they'll be available for free, and they ought to improve playability. We still don't know whether non-updated Switch games running on the Switch 2 will perform better by virtue of the updated hardware; we'll have to wait to test the console ourselves to know for sure. (There are, for better or worse, many Switch games with performance issues that we could use to test.) The current state of Switch 2 backward compatibility testing. The vast majority of first-party games are good to go; third-party testing is a work in progress. Though Nintendo's plan is to support the vast majority of the Switch library on the Switch 2, there are some games that won't run, some games that will have specific requirements, and others that are still being tested. All of Nintendo's first-party games have passed "basic compatibility testing," meaning they should play more or less as reliably as they do on current Switch hardware.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During today’s Switch 2 breakdown, Nintendo showed off an exclusive FromSoftware game for the upcoming console called The Duskbloods, which despite its online multiplayer focus looks kind of like a Bloodborne sequel in everything but name. A woman, who appears to be lying on the floor so as to avoid the moonlight streaming through a nearby window, grabs his hand and seemingly leaves behind a circular brand. In true FromSoft fashion, she imparts cryptic dialogue through it all, telling some unseen presence, “I give you my blood. What follows is a smattering of cutscenes and gameplay showcasing a semi-Gothic world that at points looks like a mashup of Bloodborne and Elden Ring as well as something completely new and steampunk-y. Some of these aesthetics fly in the face of what one might expect from a Bloodborne sequel, sure, but it still feels like the FromSoft team wants us to view The Duskbloods as a spiritual successor. Bloodborne told a deeply symbolic story about humanity’s connections to blood and the moon, specifically its mythical ties to reproduction. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that our first look at The Duskbloods makes frequent allusions to similar motifs, even if the game ultimately has nothing to do with Bloodborne. The official FromSoft website mentions The Duskbloods players throwing themselves into “a violent fray for ‘First Blood’,” which sounds an awful lot like Bloodborne’s elder god-linked Old Blood. And this may be a stretch, but a man near the end of The Duskbloods trailer strikes a pose (see the top of this blog post) similar to Bloodborne’s iconic Make Contact gesture. Developed for PlayStation 4 in cooperation with Sony’s Japan Studio (rest in peace), Bloodborne has been locked to a single platform since its 2015 launch. Fans are hungry for any acknowledgement of its existence, and they’ll eagerly tune into every major gaming event hoping for Bloodborne to make an appearance. It’s a shame The Duskbloods may be resigned to the same fate due to its Switch 2 exclusivity, but its existence may be a clue as to what’s going on with Bloodborne behind the scenes. Sony owns that property, so any future Bloodborne project would need its approval even if FromSoftware’s developers were to develop a remaster or even a follow-up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Il suffit d'une violation de données pour que toute votre vie en ligne soit bouleversée. Le problème réside surtout dans notre dépendance à l'égard des mots de passe. Recevez une sélection de conseils stratégiques et d'astuces concrètes chaque semaine dans votre boîte mail avec notre newsletter Guides pratiques. En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles Vous pouvez créer un mot de passe qui respecte toutes les règles, un mot de passe si long et si complexe qu'il vous faut cinq minutes pour le taper. Il ne vous protégera en rien si le service pour lequel vous utilisez ce mot de passe le stocke de manière incorrecte. Dans cet article, j'utilise indifféremment les termes 2FA et MFA. "Quelque chose que vous êtes", comme une empreinte digitale ou un autre identifiant biométrique La mise en place d'une sécurité supplémentaire pour la plupart des services en ligne requiert des compétences techniques minimales. Si vous pouvez utiliser l'appareil photo de votre smartphone, taper un numéro à six chiffres et appuyer sur OK dans une boîte de dialogue, vous avez toutes les compétences requises. En général, le plus difficile est de trouver la page contenant les paramètres appropriés. Voici donc tout ce qu'il faut savoir pour activer la fonction 2FA et renforcer votre sécurité. Lorsque l'option 2FA est activée, une personne qui vole votre mot de passe et tente de se connecter à partir d'un appareil inconnu n'obtient pas immédiatement l'accès. La personne qui a volé les informations d'identification de votre compte n'ayant pas accès à votre smartphone, elle sera stoppée net dans son élan. Sans ce code, elle ne peut pas déverrouiller votre compte et vous recevrez une notification indiquant que quelqu'un a tenté, sans succès, de se connecter à distance. Pour la plupart, les systèmes d'authentification à deux facteurs que vous voyez aujourd'hui utilisent le premier élément (votre mot de passe) et le dernier élément (votre smartphone). Les smartphones sont devenus omniprésents, ce qui en fait des dispositifs de sécurité pratiques. Votre smartphone peut contribuer à l'authentification en fournissant un code unique que vous utilisez avec votre mot de passe pour vous connecter. Vous pouvez obtenir ce code de deux manières : Ou généré par une application installée sur votre téléphone. (Certains services vous permettent également d'approuver une notification push sur votre smartphone). Sur les services qui prennent en charge l'utilisation de passkeys, vous pouvez enregistrer ces informations d'identification sécurisées soutenues par 2FA dans un format qui envoie les deux facteurs d'authentification simultanément lorsque vous vous connectez sur cet appareil et que vous prouvez votre identité à l'aide d'éléments biométriques ou d'un code PIN. Un rapport de 2023 de Microsoft a conclu que le 2FA fonctionne, bloquant 99,22 % des attaques, par rapport aux comptes pour lesquels le 2FA n'était pas activé. Un rapport de Google, basé sur une étude d'un an, présente des conclusions similaires. L'authentification à deux facteurs permet d'arrêter net la plupart des attaques occasionnelles. Un attaquant déterminé qui cible directement un compte spécifique peut être en mesure de trouver des moyens de le contourner, en particulier s'il peut détourner le compte de messagerie utilisé pour la récupération ou rediriger les appels téléphoniques et les messages SMS vers un appareil qu'il contrôle. Mais si quelqu'un est aussi déterminé à s'introduire dans votre compte, vous avez certainement un plus gros problème. Si vous avez la possibilité d'utiliser des messages SMS, il vous suffit d'associer un numéro de téléphone portable à votre compte. (Avec certains services, vous pouvez également utiliser une ligne téléphonique virtuelle qui peut recevoir des SMS). Configurez le compte pour qu'il envoie un code à ce numéro chaque fois que vous vous connectez sur un appareil non fiable. Une fois cette opération terminée, vous recevrez un code sur cet appareil. Saisissez le code pour confirmer que vous l'avez reçu, et la configuration de l'authentification 2FA est terminée, le service marquant cet appareil comme étant de confiance. La procédure est identique à celle de l'utilisation des messages texte. Saisissez l'adresse électronique de votre choix, attendez qu'un code arrive dans votre application de messagerie et saisissez-le pour confirmer que cette méthode fonctionne. Après cette étape, tout se passe sur votre appareil. Le processus est régi par une norme bien acceptée, l'algorithme TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password), qui utilise l'application d'authentification comme une calculatrice sophistiquée générant des codes à partir de l'heure actuelle de votre appareil et du secret partagé. Le service en ligne utilise le même secret et son horodatage pour générer des codes qu'il compare à votre entrée. Les deux côtés de la connexion peuvent ajuster les fuseaux horaires sans problème, bien que vos codes échouent si l'heure de votre appareil est erronée. Après avoir installé l'application sur votre appareil, l'étape suivante consiste à la configurer pour qu'elle fonctionne avec chaque compte pour lequel vous avez activé la fonction 2FA. Toutes les applications mobiles que j'ai énumérées ci-dessus permettent d'utiliser l'appareil photo d'un smartphone pour prendre en photo un code QR, qui contient le secret partagé de votre compte. C'est beaucoup plus facile que de saisir manuellement une chaîne alphanumérique complexe. La capture d'écran ci-dessous, par exemple, est le code QR que j'ai vu lors de la création d'un compte Dropbox. Dans l'application de votre smartphone, choisissez l'option d'ajout d'un nouveau compte, puis prenez une photo du code-barres pour configurer automatiquement la prise en charge 2FA. Dans l'application de votre authentificateur, choisissez l'option d'ajout d'un nouveau compte, choisissez l'option du code-barres, dirigez le smartphone vers le code-barres sur l'écran de votre ordinateur et attendez que l'application remplisse les champs nécessaires. Une fois le compte configuré dans l'application d'authentification, celle-ci commence à générer des codes sur la base du secret partagé et de l'heure actuelle. Certains paramètres 2FA incluent une option permettant de générer des mots de passe spéciaux pour les anciennes applications qui ne prennent pas en charge l'authentification moderne. (Mais en réalité, si vous utilisez une application tellement obsolète qu'elle nécessite un mot de passe, vous vivez à l'ère du Pléistocène et vous devriez remplacer cette application par une alternative moderne). Comment transférer des comptes 2FA sur un nouveau smartphone ? Configurez l'application sur le nouveau téléphone, installez-la, connectez-vous, puis vérifiez chaque compte pour confirmer que les codes générés sur le nouveau téléphone fonctionnent correctement. N'effacez pas votre ancien téléphone tant que vous n'êtes pas certain que l'application d'authentification du nouveau téléphone fonctionne correctement. Microsoft Authenticator vous permet de sauvegarder les codes dans le nuage et de les restaurer sur un nouvel appareil, mais uniquement si vous utilisez la même plateforme mobile - Android à Android ou iOS à iOS. Avec Google Authenticator, vous pouvez synchroniser les codes sur plusieurs appareils en vous connectant avec le même compte Google sur chaque appareil, comme indiqué ici : Obtenir des codes de vérification avec Google Authenticator. L'activation de l'option 2FA pour un service modifie les exigences de sécurité, vous obligeant à fournir au moins deux preuves d'identité lorsque vous accédez à un service sécurisé pour la première fois sur un appareil inconnu. Une fois que vous avez relevé ce défi avec succès, vous avez généralement la possibilité de classer l'appareil comme étant de confiance, ce qui signifie que les demandes de 2FA devraient être relativement rares sur les appareils que vous utilisez régulièrement. Google, Microsoft et Apple, par exemple, peuvent envoyer des notifications à un appareil de confiance ; vous touchez la notification pour approuver la connexion. Pour les services de grande valeur, vous pouvez choisir l'option "peu pratique" qui consiste à toujours demander un code 2FA ou une invite pour se connecter. Cette précaution réduit le risque qu'une personne ayant accès à un appareil de confiance puisse altérer ce compte. Dans la mesure du possible, vous devez mettre en place au moins deux options de vérification afin d'éviter le risque d'être bloqué sur votre compte. Lorsque j'ai le choix, je préfère utiliser une application d'authentification plutôt que de recevoir des codes par SMS, et vous devriez faire de même, pour deux bonnes raisons. La première raison est une simple question de logistique. Il arrive que vous ayez accès à l'internet (via une connexion filaire ou Wi-Fi) mais que vous ne puissiez pas recevoir de message texte, parce que votre signal cellulaire est faible ou inexistant, ou parce que vous utilisez une carte SIM différente lorsque vous voyagez. La deuxième raison est le risque, faible mais réel, qu'un pirate informatique se fraye un chemin à travers les défenses de votre opérateur mobile pour acquérir une carte SIM avec votre numéro de téléphone, un processus appelé SIM swapping ou simjacking. Cependant, j'utilise l'application Microsoft Authenticator pour les comptes de grande valeur, y compris les codes de vérification pour configurer 1Password sur un nouvel appareil. Comment puis-je savoir quels services prennent en charge 2FA ? Lorsque j'ai commencé à écrire sur cette technologie, il y a plus de dix ans, la prise en charge de 2FA était relativement rare. Aujourd'hui, elle est devenue monnaie courante et un nombre croissant de services en ligne l'exigent : Rendez-vous sur cette page de compte et connectez-vous pour commencer : Vérification en deux étapes (google.com). Tous les comptes Microsoft, y compris les comptes gratuits utilisés avec Outlook.com, Xbox et d'autres services grand public, prennent en charge diverses options d'authentification gérées directement par le titulaire du compte. Comment utiliser la vérification en deux étapes avec votre compte Microsoft". Si votre service informatique a activé cette fonctionnalité, suivez ces instructions : "Set up your Microsoft 365 sign-in for multi-factor authentication". Pour les comptes Apple, l'authentification à deux facteurs exige que vous fournissiez un code de vérification à six chiffres lorsque vous vous connectez pour la première fois à un nouvel appareil. (Vous pouvez utiliser un numéro de téléphone de confiance si vous n'avez pas accès à un autre appareil connecté à votre compte Apple). La prise en charge de l'authentification à deux facteurs est omniprésente dans les services de médias sociaux (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, etc.). Si vous n'êtes pas sûr d'un service spécifique, le meilleur endroit pour vérifier est un superbe référentiel d'informations open-source appelé 2FA Directory, qui est géré par une association suédoise à but non lucratif, le groupe 2factorauth, et maintenu sur GitHub. Et si un service de grande valeur dont vous dépendez ne prend pas en charge le 2FA, peut-être devriez-vous envisager de passer à un service qui le prend en charge. Vous disposez probablement d'identifiants de connexion à des dizaines de services en ligne qui prennent en charge la fonction 2FA ; la meilleure stratégie consiste donc à dresser une liste de priorités et à la parcourir. L'ajout de l'authentification électronique renforce cette faiblesse potentielle. Si vous utilisez des services de l'une de ces grandes plateformes, il est essentiel d'ajouter la prise en charge du 2FA. Les messages provenant d'un compte de messagerie compromis peuvent également être utilisés pour attaquer vos amis et collègues (en envoyant des pièces jointes chargées de logiciels malveillants, par exemple). Si vous utilisez Outlook.com, Microsoft 365, Exchange Online, Gmail ou Google Workspace, votre compte de messagerie utilise la méthode de vérification d'identité associée à votre compte Microsoft ou Google. Comme pour le courrier électronique, le plus grand risque associé à un compte Facebook ou Instagram piraté est qu'il soit utilisé contre vos amis et associés. Néanmoins, il vaut la peine d'explorer ces paramètres et de les sécuriser autant que possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is about to take another bold step in reformulating the United States trade policy. The measure marks a break with decades of multilateral agreements and can trigger serial retaliation by various business partners. The announcement is scheduled to take place at 4 pm (US east coast time) in the White House rose garden, according to presidential spokesman Karoline Leavitt. Although the complete details have not yet been disclosed, Trump has argued that these new tariffs aim to match the rates applied by other countries and combat non-tariff barriers that, according to him, impair the competitiveness of US exports. These measures represent a turn in US commercial policy, which for decades followed the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Now, the focus moves to direct negotiations, country per country, with fares that may vary according to the commercial behavior of each nation. Sources linked to the government indicate that Trump can adopt different rates below the universal value of 20% initially considered, but selectively applied to more than 15 countries. That is, products already charged may suffer additional increases. Since taking over his term just over ten weeks, Trump has imposed 20% rates on China imports related to fentanyl fighting, as well as restoring 25% steel and aluminum rates, reaching products more than $ 150 billion. In addition, temporary relief granted to products from Canada and Mexico expires today, which further increases the tension among North America's business partners. According to a survey cited by the Federal Reserve of Atlanta, entrepreneurs expect prices, hiring slowdown and lower growth in the coming months. Canada, Mexico and the European Union have already signaled that they prepare retaliation measures. In a recent conversation, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carnery and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum classified US actions as “unjustified” and reinforced the need to protect regional competitiveness with respect to sovereignty. Economists warn that strategy can be expensive for the ordinary citizen. A Yale University Budget Lab study estimates that an additional 20% increase in tariffs can cost about $ 3,400 a year, with high price only.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2015 and while chemotherapy and two tracheotomies helped him defeat it, the procedures destroyed his voice. He spoke in a rasp or used an electric voice box for the remainder of his life and largely left acting. (He made a brief cameo in 2022's Top Gun: Maverick, for which his voice was digitally altered.) Kilmer had a reputation for being eccentric and difficult to work with, but he also had his champions, and his talent was undeniable. "After so many years of Val battling disease and maintaining his spirit, this is tremendously sad news.” His portrayal of rock star Jim Morrison in The Doors (1991) was widely praised, as was his work in the 2004 black comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang opposite Robert Downey, Jr. And who could forget his deliciously profligate Doc Holliday ("I'll be your Huckleberry") in 1993's Tombstone or his colorful turn as Elvis Presley in True Romance that same year? Then there was the cocky "Iceman" opposite Tom Cruise's Maverick in 1986's Top Gun and Madmartigan in the classic fantasy adventure Willow (1988) that turned him into a major star. But here at Ars, we'd like to remember him as Chris Knight in Real Genius, the rebellious, irreverent science whiz kid at the fictional Pacific Tech (a thinly disguised Caltech) who befriends a shy young 15-year-old freshman (Gabriel Jarret). So we're re-upping our 2020 tribute to the film in Kilmer's honor.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There have been several reports of AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPUs refusing to boot on ASRock motherboards. The two companies have been aware of them since February 2025, with ASRock immediately releasing a beta BIOS update to address the problem. After a few weeks of investigation, the cause of the issue has finally been identified as a memory compatibility problem, but it has already been resolved with the latest BIOS release. Following a joint investigation, AMD and ASRock identified a memory capability issue present in earlier BIOS versions, which has been rectified in the latest BIOS,” AMD told Tom’s Hardware. Even though more than a hundred motherboards failing to post with a 9800X3D chip have been documented, that is still a drop in the bucket compared to the thousands, if not millions, of motherboards and CPUs out there in countless variations. “We recommend that users start by updating their BIOS to the latest version available for their specific motherboard model.” Still, if you have a problem even after updating your BIOS, the company says you should contact customer support. Sure enough, the motherboard successfully booted after this procedure and even passed some long-term testing. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is one of the best gaming CPUs you can buy today, so both AMD and its motherboard partners are likely vigilant on any problems that might appear on these components. However, we're following up with AMD for more details.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While listening in on the atmosphere, a team of researchers from the U.S. military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) picked up unexpected disturbances caused by a SpaceX rocket plummeting through the atmosphere toward its landing site. DARPA’s AtmoSense program seeks to use Earth’s atmosphere as a global sensor by measuring acoustic and electromagnetic waves propagating through the atmosphere, and attempting to trace them back to a specific disturbance event that took place on Earth. In doing so, DARPA hopes to be able to trace underground explosions or other national security threats using the signals detected from the atmosphere. During its latest round of listening to the atmosphere, a team used AtmoSense to study sound waves created by controlled explosions in New Mexico. “As the team was looking at the data, they saw a huge drop in what’s called total electron content that puzzled them,” Michael Nayak, program manager of AtmoSense, said in a statement. “Imagine that you have water going through a hose. That’s a flow of electrons, and if you put your fist in front of the hose, you’ll notice a significant drop in water volume coming out of the hose.” “Then they decided to pull other SpaceX reentry data, across dozens of launches, to see if they could spot a similar electron drop,” Nayak added. Using AtmoSense, the team inadvertently discovered a new technique to identify objects reentering through Earth’s atmosphere, according to Nayak. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is a partially reusable, two-stage rocket that launches payloads into orbit, then returns to Earth for a controlled landing, allowing its first stage to be recovered and reused.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After years of rumors, Nintendo has finally announced a release date for the Switch 2. It will be available for preorder in the US from select retailers starting on April 9th, as both a standalone console and as a limited-edition bundle with Mario Kart World for $499.99. The Joy-Cons are bigger, too, and now magnetically attach to the console instead of relying on a pair of sliding rails to snap into place. They also offer mouse-like functionality with select games, and the right Joy-Con sports a “C” button, which can be used for in-game chat features, screensharing, and other actions. Below, we’ve rounded up all the preorder information you need if you want to be one of the first to get your hands on it. We’ll be updating this post regularly as more information becomes available, so bookmark this page if you’re keen on learning more ahead of the launch. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, with the first batch of invitations going out on May 8th. Additional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that. Thankfully, if Nintendo’s strict requirements are an issue, the preorder process at Best Buy appears to be far more straightforward. What’s more, most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup, signaling a welcome return to a more old-school, midnight release schedule we last saw prior to the pandemic. Details are sparse beyond that; however, My Best Buy Plus and Total members can land a $20 certificate for every $150 they spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear, which is a nice perk for members of Best Buy’s premium loyalty program. That privilege will run you at least $49.99 a year, though both membership tiers will also grant you access to exclusive discounts, free two-day shipping, and other perks. We expect Best Buy to provide some more preorder information ahead of April 9th — including details on whether the retailer intends to implement a queue system, as it did with the PlayStation 5 release. Nintendo and Best Buy are the only retailers, thus far, to have provided any insight into how preorders will work when they open on April 9th. That said, you can sign up GameStop to receive notifications about the upcoming console, various games, and accessories. Presumingly, this will also include preorder details once they’re available. Like with previous launches, we anticipate that Amazon, Target, and Walmart will all have limited stock of the console, as well. But despite Nintendo “taking risks” to ensure it can meet demands, reports indicate that US retailers might not have enough Switch 2 consoles to meet preorder demands. Update, April 2nd: Updated to include additional preorder details from Best Buy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuX TV series will begin airing in spring 2025. On the 30 Nippon Television Network, the announcement will start every Tuesday at 24:29 (Wednesday at 11:29) on April 8th, and the way it is announced is becoming a hot topic on social media and other media.

First of all, it is not listed on the list of programs scheduled to be broadcast. Only anime that have started at the same time, such as "Shin Samurai Den YAIBA" starting April 5th and "Apocalypse Hotel" starting April 9th.

Also, at first glance, there is no mention of the program guide. Looking closely at the relevant time, the actual program name is "Ueda and the Woman DEEP [One Opera Childcare] & [New] Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuX [character]", and appears to be broadcast every Tuesday at 11:59pm on "The Night of Ueda and the Woman Who Bark at DEEP".

If Gundam GQuuuuuX is not listed on the program schedule alone, it may result in the event that it cannot be found or recorded properly. "X" has attracted criticism, including posts such as "it looks like garbage" and "That's why I start watching the stream."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sony has a replacement for its current flagship QD-OLED TV, the extremely well-received A95L. That’s the model that was crowned “King of TV” at last year’s Value Electronics TV Shootout, which Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel served on the judging panel for. Sony claims that it has 125 percent the peak brightness of the A95L and 150 percent of last year’s Bravia 8, which will remain on sale as an OLED-but-not-QD option. It has a similar design to the A95L, and Sony even says it’ll be cheaper — though pricing information won’t be shared until later in spring. To that end, at a recent demonstration session at its Tokyo headquarters, Sony put the Bravia 8 II up against the A95L, Samsung’s S95D, and LG’s G4, along with even more formidable competition: Sony’s own BVM-HX3110 reference monitor, which you’d normally find on movie sets and studios for the most accurate HDR color grading possible. If you haven’t seen one of these in person before, I kind of recommend not seeking one out, because it will ruin all other screens for you. It costs nearly $40,000 and has 4,000 nits peak brightness. It looks absolutely out of control, and I would dearly love to have one on my desk. That’s what Sony is shooting for with the Bravia 8 II. The BVM-HX3110’s higher brightness gives HDR footage an almost surreal look thanks to its finer control over contrast. But in each TV’s filmmaker mode, which is supposed to deliver the most accurate color possible, Sony got much closer than Samsung or LG. As the owner of a couple of LG OLEDs myself, I was actually a little surprised at how washed out and green-tinted the G4 tended to look in comparison. Now, Sony won’t have chosen demo footage that might trip up its own displays, and it’s also at an obvious advantage when it comes to emulating the color reproduction of the BVM-HX3110. But Sony really is the market leader for reference monitors by some distance, so that still feels like a fair and relevant target. I would not be shocked if the Bravia 8 II turns out to be another winner by “King of TV” metrics. Sony is also updating several other products in its home theater range. This line comes in sizes from 55 to 98 inches, the upper end of which is larger than any OLED Sony sells. Also part of this demonstration was the BVM-HX310 reference monitor, which is similar to the BVM-HX3110 but “only” reaches 1,000 nits peak brightness. The Bravia 5’s control over backlighting and blooming was clearly better than its predecessor, and it looked to be a more robust solution than Samsung’s as well. Sony also made a point of demonstrating its AI noise reduction feature, which is the kind of thing I’d normally run away from but have to admit was quite impressive — it did a good job of cleaning up old footage from Friends and Home Alone in real time. But at least in this demonstration, the Bravia 5 made the most convincing attempt to reproduce colors and contrast as well as you could reasonably expect from a mid-range Mini LED TV. This is a fairly standard LED TV that comes in sizes from 43 to 77 inches, but you’ll get similar image processing and software integration to the rest of Sony’s Bravia range. If you’re more of a projector person, Sony is adding the new Bravia Projector 7 to its range, joining the higher-end 8 and 9 models. The Projector 7 is pretty close to them spec-wise, reaching 2,200 nits in brightness and supporting 4K 120Hz. Finally, Sony is introducing some new audio options to integrate with its Bravia TVs. As mentioned, Sony doesn’t yet have pricing details for any of its new Bravia products — that’ll come sometime this spring.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sony’s glittering new RGB LED display made a big splash last month, and as one of the few to see it in the flesh, I can attest that it's a very exciting new advancement. It's also still deep in the prototype stage, so it'll be a while before we get our hands on one. While pricing has yet to be announced, the 2025 lineup includes two new LED TVs, new home audio gear, and a blazing new OLED TV primed to compete with LG, Samsung, and others for the coveted title of best TV of the year. I traveled to Sony HQ in Tokyo to get a hands-on preview of all the new gear ahead of the official release. Despite sharing the naming convention of Sony’s second-tier OLED from 2024, the Bravia 8 Mark II is positioned as Sony’s 2025 flagship TV, with performance to match. In design, the TV looks a lot like 2023’s A95L QD-OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but Sony claims the new Bravia 8 is 25 percent brighter than that model and 50 percent brighter than its namesake. Built to compete with 2025’s LG G5 and Samsung S95F OLEDs, the TV uses a version of Samsung's latest QD-OLED panel rather than LG’s new “Quad Stack” panel, along with Sony processing tech like XR Tiluminous Max for enhanced colors and Sony's XR Processor with AI for analyzing and optimizing content scene-by-scene. Sony claims one reason for sticking with a QD-OLED panel this year is that it allows for better off-axis color accuracy. It’s also notable that this TV will purportedly undercut Sony’s previous flagship in pricing, which should make it more competitive in a very tough market. In person, the TV showed fabulous color accuracy and saturation, alongside sizzly brightness at every turn. In Sony's carefully curated demos, the TV showed less image clipping than last year’s LG G4 and Samsung S95D (8/10, WIRED Recommends) viewed side by side. A blacksmith demo using the next-gen BT.2020 color gamut dazzled, revealing gleaming-bright molten metal that looked ready to pop off the screen and singe your eyebrows. It appeared to easily outpace the older models, including Sony’s own 2023 A95L (9/10, WIRED Recommends), instantly drawing my eye each time it was fired up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Executives at artificial intelligence companies may like to tell us that AGI is almost here, but the latest models still need some additional tutoring to help them be as clever as they can. Scale rose to prominence providing human labor for training and testing advanced AI models. Large language models (LLMs) are trained on oodles of text scraped from books, the web, and other sources. Turning these models into helpful, coherent, and well-mannered chatbots requires additional “post training” in the form of humans who provide feedback on a model’s output. Scale supplies workers who are expert on probing models for problems and limitations. The new tool “is a way for [model makers] to go through results and slice and dice them to understand where a model is not performing well,” Berrios says, “then use that to target the data campaigns for improvement.” Berrios says that several frontier AI model companies are using the tool already. He says that most are using it to improve the reasoning capabilities of their best models. In one instance, Berrios says, Scale Evaluation revealed that a model’s reasoning skills fell off when it was fed non-English prompts. “While [the model’s] general purpose reasoning capabilities were pretty good and performed well on benchmarks, they tended to degrade quite a bit when the prompts were not in English,” he says. Jonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, a company that builds large AI models, says that being able to test one foundation model against another sounds useful in principle. "Anyone who moves the ball forward on evaluation is helping us to build better AI," Frankle says. Scale says it is becoming more challenging to measure improvements in AI models, however, as they get better at acing existing tests. The company says its new tool offers a more comprehensive picture by combining many different benchmarks and can be used to devise custom tests of a model’s abilities, like probing its reasoning in different languages. The company’s new tool may also inform efforts to standardize testing AI models for misbehavior. In February, the US National Institute of Standards and Technologies announced that Scale would help it develop methodologies for testing models to ensure they are safe and trustworthy. What do you think are models’ biggest blind spots?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In early 2024, the bird influenza that had been spreading across the globe for nearly three decades did something wholly unexpected: It showed up in dairy cows in the Texas Panhandle. A dangerous bird flu, in other words, was suddenly circulating in mammals—mammals with which people have ongoing, extensive contact. “Holy cow,” says Thomas Friedrich, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. This bird flu, which scientists call highly pathogenic avian influenza, or H5N1, is already at panzootic—animal pandemic—status, killing birds in every continent except for Australia. Around the world, it has also affected diverse mammals including cats, goats, mink, tigers, seals, and dolphins. In all of known history, “This is the largest animal disease outbreak we’ve ever had,” says Maurice Pitesky, a veterinary researcher at the University of California, Davis. The virus, which emerged nearly three decades ago, is now creating upheaval in the poultry and dairy industries and making economic and political waves due to the fluctuating price of eggs. But there’s more at risk here than grocery-store sticker shock. As it has journeyed around the world on the wings of migrating birds, the virus has infected more than 960 people since 2003, killing roughly half of them. So far, H5N1 flu hasn’t acquired the key trick of passing with ease from person to person, which is what could enable a human pandemic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For more than 160 years, bizarre giant organisms lived in the first Devonian, about 400 million years ago, have been giving twisting to those who deal with classifying the living. Let's talk about the prototaxites, of which a first fossil has been discovered in 1843. In the last twenty years, several studies had suggested that it was mushrooms, but a new research seems to question this hypothesis. The publication is currently available on Biorxiv and is waiting to be subjected to the trial of review between even. The prototaxites probably had an appearance similar to huge tree trunks without branches, which could reach 8 meters in height. Based on their anatomy and their chemical composition, over time it has been excluded that these giant organisms can be classified as terrestrial plants or as algae, and even less animals. The remaining alternatives, read in the new study, are two: it could be precisely mushrooms, or a group of living that cannot be inserted inside the kingdoms or domains currently recognized and existing. The morphological analysis showed that P. Taiti presents a series of anatomical characteristics that do not seem to correspond to those of the mushrooms we know. "We conclude - reads the last part of the publication - that the morphology and the molecular imprint of P. Taiti are clearly distinct from those of the mushrooms and other organisms preserved on the Rhynie site and we suggest that it must be considered as a member of a group of eukaryotes previously not described and completely extinct". In short, the mystery about the origins of these giant organisms continues and further studies will be needed before we can give a real ending to this story.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia’s RTX 50-series laptop GPUs have recently launched, and although the availability of devices with these graphics cards is spotty at best, official benchmarks are rolling out to show us how they perform compared to other cards. We’ve already seen multiple reviews for the RTX 5090 laptop GPU, like Tom’s Hardware’s look at the Razer Blade 16, but RTX 5080 laptops are still few and far between. However, Notebook Check got its hands on two Schenker Neo 16 test units, both equipped with a Ryzen 9 9955HX CPU and an RTX 5080 laptop GPU, and shared the graphics benchmark results for these units. Of course, benchmark numbers mean nothing if they cannot be translated to actual FPS numbers. This gap is much smaller than the 12.82% average uplift in FPS numbers between the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 laptop GPUs.

On top of that, you’re probably saving hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars by going with the cheaper 50-series option. But if you already have an RTX 4090 laptop GPU, it’s probably best to skip this generation. This is especially true as your device is probably under two years old, and you’ll only get a 5% to 10% improvement with a Blackwell graphics card.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Banks and insurance in France quickly took the generative AI train, in particular in order to deploy secure conversational assistants internally and thus reduce the risks linked to Shadow AI. All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data The Digital Banking Experience (DBX) study carried out annually by ESN Sopra Steria on the European banking services market suggests that yes. AI is presented as a "leadership leader for French banks". Technological experts and sector managers have already largely expressed their preference for internal uses of LLM, mainly for reasons of compliance and risks. However, the study notes that 15% of French banks' French customers use generative AI at least once a day. This is the highest rate in Europe. It’s little and a lot at the same time. Only a few actors conduct experiments from the Genai customer focused, including Hello Bank!, A subsidiary of BNP Paribas. Customer relations and automation can be sent by internal use cases of the Genai and the so -called classic AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc.). In another area, still according to Sopra Steria's report, France would be more cautious than its European neighbors on digital payments. Indeed, France stands out at the same time by its intensive recourse to credit card payments. "76% of French people say they never bought cryptocurrencies or intend to do so." Is this reluctance a guarantee of trust for banks? In France, they "still enjoy a higher level of confidence (56%) to that of other structures", including insurance (27%) and social networks (8%). "They must imperatively strengthen their cybersecurity strategies to preserve this position. Transparency and customer education on data protection mechanisms are essential levers to maintain and strengthen their confidence," said the study.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tuesday 1st April a new and extensive series of layoffs in the United States involved thousands of federal employees employed in the control and prevention of American diseases (CDC). The new wave of cuts implies the blockage of several programs aimed at American citizens and involves all the Agency departments, from the division for the prevention of HIV to that for reproductive health, passing through the departments that dealt with safety at work and the programs for vaccinations and respiratory diseases, among others. Once you arrive in the office, several employees of the department found that their badge no longer worked. "I am sorry to inform you that you are affected by an action to reduce the workforce (ref) - reads the email sent to the employees concerned -. After receiving this notice, you will be put on the administrative departure and you will no longer have access to the You are not ordered differently by your leadership ". "Today's cuts at the CDC have targeted programs that deal with all aspects of the life of the Americans - explains to Wired a source of the CDC -. This will lead to worst health results, to greater risks for the US population and will contribute to the decline of life expectancy in the United States [...] Democrats ". "There was no attempt to allow staff to transfer projects, programs or responsibilities," says an employee of the Agency. Experts warn that the cuts will have an immediate impact. To the division for the prevention of the HIV of the CDC - whose mission is to "promote the health and quality of life by preventing HIV infections and reducing diseases and deaths related to HIV in the United States" - at least half of the employees received a notice of dismissal.</p>

In the US, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for pre-order from select retailers on April 9, and it pre-orders will open in select EU markets on April 8. If Nintendo didn’t reveal what kind of silicon powers the Nintendo Switch 2 today, the company said that the new console has “significantly improved CPU and GPU performance over Nintendo Switch, resulting in faster processing speed and enabling new visually advanced gameplay.” The new console has a bigger 7.9-inch LCD 1080p screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR support, and it also has the same thickness as its predecessor. With the new Nintendo Switch 2 Dock that’s included in the box, players can output video at up to 4K resolution and play games at up to 120 fps on compatible games and TVs. The new C button on the right Joy-Con 2 can be used to access GameChat, but I’ll have more on that below. The Nintendo Switch 2 will come with 256GB of internal storage (compared to 32GB on the original Switch), and it will support faster read and write speeds. The feature will require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription after an open-access period that will last until the end of March 2026. However, game screen sharing looked really laggy in today’s video demo. With the optional Nintendo Switch 2 camera (sold separately), players will also be able to video chat, and in some games see each other’s faces in place of in-game avatars. Safety features will also help to ensure that players have a safe and secure chat experience on the Switch 2. With GameShare, Nintendo Switch 2 players will be able to invite up to 3 other players to temporarily play the same game together via local play with their Nintendo Switch 2 or Nintendo Switch system. GameChat will also let Nintendo Switch 2 owners play the same game online with other Switch 2 players and talk via GameChat. The Nintendo Switch Online subscription that will be required for GameChat and online multiplayer on the Switch 2 will also provide access to GameCube games via the optional Expansion Pack membership. Nintendo will also sell a dedicated wireless GameCube controller that will have the same C button as the Joy-Con 2. The biggest Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive game that was revealed today is Mario Kart World, which will offer a free roam mode and weather system, similar to Xbox’s Forza Horizon series. Nintendo also teased today Kirby Air Riders, a Mario Kart-style game that will be the sequel to the 2003 Gamecube game Kirby Air Ride. Donkey Kong Bananza, a 3D platformer game with a destructible environment was also another highlight from today’s presentation, as well as Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, a game set in the Zelda universe. The Switch 2 will also welcome many high-profile third-party games, including Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades II, Street Fighter 6, Split Fiction, the EA Sparts FC, Madden NFL, NBA 2K, and WWE 2K series, Cyberpunk 2077, Final Fantasy VII: Remake, Star Wars Outlaws, and the upcoming Borderlands 4. Nintendo also teased Project 007: a brand new James Bond game coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, as well as The Duskbloods, an exclusive game from Elden Ring developer From Software coming in 2026. The list of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games announced today includes Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV, Sid Meier’s Civilization VII, Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and Metroid Prime 4 Beyond. For people who own the original Nintendo Switch version of these games (either physical or digital), the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will be available as a paid upgrade pack.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's recent introduction of a 25% tariff on aluminum imports has raised concerns within the PC hardware industry, particularly regarding potential price increases for graphics cards and desktop cases. As per PCMag, industry insiders are alarmed by the possible ramifications of these tariffs on manufacturers and consumers.​ This development is particularly concerning for consumers seeking affordable options in an already inflation-sensitive market. Reports of the aluminum tariff's impact on PC hardware first surfaced on Reddit, where user "Neoescape" warned that the additional duties were affecting GPU imports. "We recently imported several data center GPUs and got blindsided by a huge bill due to this additional 25% aluminum-related tariff," the user wrote. We thought that tariff was on raw aluminum and steel, not finished PC cases," Reeves explained. However, the policy also extends to aluminum derivative products, including PC components, further increasing costs for manufacturers and consumers. Similarly, PC case manufacturer SilverStone Technology has been hit with the 25% aluminum tariff on top of the existing 20% tariff on Chinese imports. The company stated that since many of its cases are made primarily from steel and aluminum, these tariffs have significantly impacted costs. Likewise, InWin, another PC case vendor, reported that while it maintains prices using its existing stock, price adjustments may become necessary as inventory runs low.

The tariffs are expected to result in higher retail prices for GPUs and desktop cases, components that heavily rely on aluminum. This development is particularly concerning for consumers planning to build or upgrade their PCs, as it could increase overall costs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>is a senior reviewer who has worked at The Verge since its founding in 2011. As it turns out, the company has put together a surprisingly detailed resource page that goes over all the titles it has tested thus far — both from Nintendo itself and third-party developers. Even titles that we assumed might be fully incompatible — Ring Fit Adventure, 1-2-Switch, and the various Labo kit assembly games — are supported to some extent on the Switch 2 if you stick to original Joy-Cons or use other workaround methods that Nintendo spells out. At least for the time being, there’s only one game that just plain won’t work, and that’s the VR Labo kit. I don’t think anyone can really fault Nintendo for that. The company also divides “games with startup issues” — Doom Eternal, Rocket League, NBA 2K25, and Warframe are among these — and “games that are playable, but have some in-game compatibility issues” into separate lists. “Nintendo is continuing to improve compatibility, including by working with publishing and developing partners,” the company notes on its site. That work will no doubt continue right up until the console’s release in early June. Separately, Nintendo has also revealed which original Switch titles will be getting upgrades via future patches. These include Arms, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, Super Mario Odyssey, and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This feature allows you to see how they were specific places in past years with just a few clicks, without having to install anything or configure anything. However, there is a little known feature that allows users to see what these images were like in the past. To access this feature, just use Google Maps on your computer or smartphone. On your phone, open the Google Maps app, look for any address and hold the desired point to fix a pin. By selecting it, a timeline will be displayed with images of different years. If there are old images available, you can use sliding control to travel in time visually. The most common reaction when using this function is simple astonishment. Who would imagine I could see the facade of your home as it was in 2008? Details such as vintage cars, landscape changes and even disappeared trees can make you embark on a true nostalgic ride. In addition to the emotional value, this tool offers a unique perspective on the transformation of cities over time. In some cases, it was also used in police investigations, allowing you to view scenes as they were years ago. In addition to being a fascinating tool to revive the past, the function also has great practical utility in several areas. If you are thinking of moving or buying a property, you can check how the neighborhood has evolved over the years. For business, this feature is a visual gold mine. Seeing how the facade of a trade or shopping center has changed over the years can be a great way to demonstrate the evolution and trajectory of a brand. These images can even be used on social networks or on the company's website, telling a transformation story. In cities that have undergone rapid changes, the tool offers a deeper understanding of how urban processes shaped the present. Each image captured is a visual record, revealing moments that could otherwise be lost. The most impressive about this feature is that it makes the past accessible without having to look for old documents or go to historical files. With just a few clicks, you can access a digital time capsule that is available publicly and is constantly updated. The next time you use Google Maps to look for an address, remember that you may be a click to rediscover a forgotten version of your world. The past is not as far away as it seems, and now, thanks to this functionality, you can visit it whenever you want.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tiktok Shop and the live: colored inscriptions in superimpression, products in favor of the room, discounts that flash. It really seems to be in a district of the nineties. A leap in the future so long that I almost go around and takes us back to the time of local TVs when they commanded: Roberto da Crema, Patrizia Rossetti, Roberto Artigiani, Alessandro Orlando and Wanna Marchi with his daughter Stefania. Tiktok Shop and the return of telepromations, but vertically If you have happened to scroll Tiktok in these days, in addition to the usual Asmr, the brain rot memes and the morning routines, you will have come across these direct details. And the content is also very immediate: often there is someone who tries to sell something. And for something, we mean everything. Dresses, shoes, accessories, jewelry, ethnic foods, protein spreads, wallets, tattoos, massages, smartphones accessories, colored waters and even homeopathic products. Even if the shot went from 4: 3 to 9:16. And it is perhaps also for this reason that the format of online sales, abroad, has been depopulated for a while and cannot be considered as something niche. According to the New York Times, about 500 billion dollars were spent in 2023 through live streaming on the app. Maybe it's still too early to understand what direction this new format will take. Tiktok Shop started on March 31 and, what we know so far, is that many Creators have wanted to focus on the new functionality by enrolling in the program. Not only big names such as, for example, the New Martina phenomenon, which was among the first in Italy to import this trend transforming the meticulous technique of its manual work in a way to monetize never seen before. However, there are also small creators, merchants and craftsmen who try to give a new life to their business, transforming it and bringing it out of the province. In a short time, therefore, we can expect everything: if today, in fact, marketing is done as once (with the difference that the switchboard for calls is replaced by the comments section), it is not difficult to think of seeing Creator soon capable of applying TikTok formats to your business. If local TVs already had few filters in this sense, it is possible to think that history can also be repeated in vertical teleshopping.</p>

Like the original, the Switch 2 remains a hybrid device, capable of on-the-go gaming in handheld form and connecting to a big-screen TV at home. After an initial reveal back in January, which itself followed months of leaks, we now know that the Switch 2 will boast a larger 7.9-inch screen in handheld mode. Disappointingly, it's a return to an LCD display after the gorgeous OLED model for the original Switch, but it does see a bump in native resolution to 1080p and offers HDR for supported games. It's also capable of a frame rate up to 120 fps, though this will again depend on the game. Audio gets a boost too, with improved speakers and support for 3D audio (via headphones, although a system update is planned to offer support for this through the in-built speakers), and a microphone is built into the top of the console. The controllers are similarly revised, with the newly dubbed Joy-Con 2 controllers connecting via "strong magnets,” with a release button to disconnect them. Confirming long-standing rumors, they'll also be able to be used as mouse controllers, while the SL/SR shoulder buttons incorporated onto them are now larger and easier to press when used as a single controller. GameChat will allow users to speak openly, with noise-canceling tech cutting out background noise, while a new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera peripheral will allow onscreen group playing. Screen sharing will also be possible, again accessed from the C button menu, and you'll be able to shrink or enlarge other players’ screens, with an example shown of helping a lost player find their way to their friends elsewhere in a game world. It all speaks to an even greater social focus for the Switch 2. It's worth noting that all those GameChat features will be require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. The C button will also make an appearance on a new Switch 2 Pro controller, a more “conventional” joypad akin to an Xbox or PS5 controller. Expect more info to follow, but we'd expect these to be mappable buttons like those found on some of the best game controllers. Nintendo will also introduce a dedicated, wireless GameCube controller for use with classic games from that console coming to Nintendo Switch Online—more on that shortly, too.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Finally: This morning's Switch 2 exclusive Nintendo Direct finally answered all the burning questions about the device, including key specs, price, and release date. The 1080p IPS LCD has 120Hz variable refresh rate technology and HDR support. Nintendo was tight-lipped about the Switch 2's processor. Obviously, it's a step or two up from the first-gen switch, as evidenced by its shortened battery life. Users can expect between two and 6.5 hours of playtime, depending on the game. By comparison, the Switch could go about 4.5 to nine hours on a charge. Nintendo bumped the Switch 2 to 256GB of internal memory for eight times the storage, which should delight game hoarders like myself. Additionally, last week's Nintendo Direct unveiled "Virtual Game Cards" to share your digital purchases just like physical media. The Switch 2's JoyCons are significantly different as well. I'm on the fence about whether this is good or bad. On the one hand, keeping it slim minimizes weight, which is essential for a handheld device. I always found it uncomfortable to use the controllers while attached. I was constantly having to adjust my grip because of its slim design. So, I mainly used the Joy-Con grip attachment for a better feel. There were initial concerns that this was a flimsy way to connect them, but that doesn't look like much of a problem with the Joy-Con 2's deep inset sockets and powerful internal magnets. The controllers should remain securely in place until the release lever is activated, no matter how much a user fidgets while playing. Other nifty features include mouse mode and the "C" button. It's ideal for puzzle games, golf, or other compatible titles. The C button, which also appears on the new Nintendo Pro Controller, launches a self-explanatory new feature called GameChat and pulls up its related options. Switch's lack of a proper chat function was a big complaint, so it's nice to see Nintendo listen to user feedback. Docking blocks airflow, and users typically play games longer while docked. Additionally, the hybrid supports 4K HDR at 60fps when connected to a TV, which probably increases heat generation. So, a fan to vent excessive heat makes sense. Customers can also buy the console bundled with Mario Cart World for $500. Units ship to pre-order holders and retailers on June 5.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a big difference in points, the country demonstrates a distinct economic scenario that can surprise those who think of living or investing in the region. It offers updated information about prices, quality of life, health services, crime, among other factors, allowing direct comparisons between cities and countries. In addition to comparing the cost of living, the platform also analyzes factors such as rent price, purchasing power of residents, health services and traffic congestion. It is therefore considered a valuable reference source for those who plan to change, travel or invest in other regions of the world. According to Numbeo's latest report in 2025, Uruguay stands out as the most expensive country in South America, with a score of 46.33. This result puts the country in an undisputed position of leadership, with a significant difference from the second place, Argentina, which obtained 35.75 points. The high cost of living in Uruguay is mainly related to its dependence on imports. The country has no large industries or produces hydrocarbons, which forces it to import a wide range of products and inputs, considerably raising prices. This directly affects the cost of essential goods such as food, technology and fuels. The economic structure of Uruguay, although stable, has barriers to competition in certain sectors, which, added to the small domestic market, results in higher prices compared to other countries in the region. Despite high costs, Uruguay maintains a good reputation for quality of life. For them, the benefits of living in a safe and stable environment compensate for the high cost of living. However, for local citizens, high prices can become a difficult cargo. The cost of living can be a challenge, especially for those who do not have access to higher income or public benefits. As the global economy evolves and new dynamics emerge in South America, it will be interesting to note whether Uruguay will be able to maintain its leadership position in the cost of living ranking or whether other countries will start to climb this index, revealing changes in the region's economic reality.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla posted its production and sales numbers for the first quarter of 2025 this morning, and they continue the bad news streak for the electric automaker. Tesla produced 362,615 vehicles in total between January and the end of March, a 16.3 percent decrease from the same period in 2024.

The drop in sales was a little less bad; unlike this time last year, Tesla was able to more closely match production with demand. As a result, the company delivered 336,681 EVs in Q1, a drop of 12.9 percent compared to Q1 2024.

The Models 3 and Y make up the vast majority of Tesla's business—it built 345,454 of them in Q1 2025, a 16.2 percent reduction compared to the same period last year. Despite a recent refresh for the Model Y, which comprised the majority of these two EVs, sales declined by 12.4 percent year over year, with just 323,800 being sold, compared to 369,783 deliveries for Q1 2024.

Things look even worse for the even more outdated Models S and X and the often-recalled Cybertruck. Production for these EVs fell by 18.3 percent year over year to 17,161 units in Q1 2025, with sales dropping year over year by 24.3 percent to just 12,881.

Things were slightly rosier for Tesla's energy storage business, which deployed 10.4 GWh, but this part of the business contributes a small fraction to the bottom line; in 2024, automotive sales accounted for 77 percent of revenues.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Getting hold of the latest and greatest graphics card is almost always a challenge, thanks to scalpers, and the recent market hasn't been much different. Users are eager to get their hands on the new RTX 5000 and RX 9000 series GPUs, but finding a readily available supply is far from typical. However, Damien Mason over at Club386 has noticed one vendor taking steps to manage their GPU supply in a way that directly impacts scalpers' ability to swoop in and raid available stock. Amazon has a handful of product listings reserving various RTX 5000 and RX 9000 GPUs and prebuilt PC's with these cards as exclusive items for Amazon Prime members. If you are logged into an Amazon Prime account, you probably wouldn't be wise to the situation, as there is no indication on the product pages that these products are exclusives. However, if you find them while signed out or logged into an account with an Amazon Prime membership, you'll notice a tag that says "Exclusively for Prime Members" on the product search page. We've been covering the scalping situation, so it's interesting to see a vendor as large as Amazon offering a path for sellers to take, which would mitigate the issue. Some resellers have listed AMD RX 9000 series GPUs for as much as $2,000 (USD), while system integrators have seen RTX 5000 series GPUs offered for up to $3,000 (USD). We took the opportunity to explore this claim for ourselves and were able to confirm listings for both GPUs and prebuilt PCs featuring these graphics cards that were labeled as Amazon Prime exclusives when accessing the product pages from outside of a Prime membership account. Then again, if scapling continues to be profitable, we're sure that resellers can afford their own Amazon Prime accounts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, that hidden gem of Miyazaki’s career will be available to stream in the United States for the first time ever. IndieWire can exclusively reveal that “Future Boy Conan” will begin streaming this April on RetroCrush, a subscription service dedicated to classic anime. When a girl named Lana washes up on their shore, tragedy follows, and Conan leaves behind his old life to confront shadowy operatives with mysterious plans to control this new world. “Future Boy Conan” wasn’t a particularly successful show upon its original airing, though it eventually received a 1999 sequel series that Miyazaki was entirely uninvolved in. However, its themes of humanity’s relationship with the planet and its characters and aesthetic now feel foundational for Miyazaki’s future work, from “Castle in the Sky” to “Princess Mononoke”; many of its concepts and scenes were referenced in his latest film, “The Boy and the Heron.” The show has since become something of a cult classic, and was featured in the popular manga “Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!” by Sumito Ōwara as the work that inspired its main character to want to become an animator. The show is also notable for featuring contributions from several animators who would go on to work on future Ghibli projects, including Miyazaki’s fellow studio co-founder Isao Takahata, who is credited on two episodes of the show. The series was almost entirely unseen in U.S. for over forty years, until GKIDS — the current distribution rights holder for most Studio Ghibli films — licensed the series in 2021, commissioning a 4K restoration and an English dub. The streaming rights deal was negotiated by Mary Gibson, acquisitions director of RetroCrush’s parent company Cineverse, and Alison Kozberg, GKIDS director of home entertainment. “With its blend of breathtaking action, quiet moments of wonder, and a timeless story about survival and resilience, Future Boy Conan is a must-watch for Japanese animation enthusiasts, newcomers, and especially fans of Hayao Miyazaki.”</p>

Nintendo is releasing a new 3D Donkey Kong game that will be an exclusive for the Nintendo Switch 2. Bananza is a 3D platformer that gives DK a new look that’s seemingly inspired by his appearance in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. “Explore a vast underground world—by smashing your way through it!” according to the description of Nintendo’s YouTube trailer for the game. “Bash, throw, and climb through just about anything in DK’s brand-new 3D platforming action-adventure game!” In the trailer, you can see DK scaling walls like a super-powered Link from Breath of the Wild, picking up and tossing rocks to smash through enemies and walls, and digging into the ground with his fists. There also looks to be old-school 2D sections and mine cart rides. The game looks full of energy — DK and various characters in the trailer are really expressive and fun. It’s a shame it won’t launch at the same time as the Switch 2, but at least we won’t have to wait too much longer after the system releases to play the game.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The emblematic case is that of the journalist and writer Francesca Mannocchi who, suffering from multiple sclerosis, denounced on social media that he had had to pay 680 euros for an urgent magnetic resonance imaging. After days of attempts to contact the Lazio regional switchboard, she was offered an appointment only in July 2025 at a Frosinone structure, 90 kilometers from her home. In response to the complaint, the Lazio Region issued a press release in which it claims that the medical recipe presented by Mannocchi could not be managed by the ordinary booking system as classified with generic code. The most recent survey by Altroconsumo, published last March, reveals that 52% of the specialist visits do not respect the maximum times provided for by the regulations, with a disturbing peak for emergencies: 76% of visits with urgent or short priority code, which should be guaranteed respectively within 72 hours or 10 days, go out of time. A fact that reveals how patients with more serious problems pay to pay the highest price of systemic dysfunction. Altroconsumo also highlights how certain performances, crucial for the early diagnosis of serious pathologies, undergo particularly significant delays. Biblical times that translate into concrete health risks: 40% of respondents said that, while waiting for the visit or examination he needed, his health problem has worsened. The situation also presents marked territorial disparities. Only three regions-Tuscany, Emilia-Romagna and Umbria-show an improvement in waiting times compared to 2023, while the picture appears particularly serious in the southern regions. The investigation also notes widespread irregularities: in 26% of cases the patients felt responded that the agendas were closed and it was not possible to book any appointment, despite this practice is expressly prohibited by law. A bureaucratic labyrinth that ends up discouraging the most fragile. An alarming figure that testifies to how the right to health, sanctioned by the Constitution (as Francesca Mannocchi also recalls in the report posts), is increasingly becoming a privilege for those who can afford to pay visits and exams of their own pocket.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google has introduced a mechanism to its latest smartphone, the Pixel 9a, to limit the battery voltage and extend its lifespan. All lithium-ion batteries deteriorate over time and eventually need to be replaced. The recently updated Pixel 9a support page details a new feature called Battery Health Assistance, which aims to limit the maximum battery voltage to keep the battery as long as possible. Specifically, after 200 charging cycles, the maximum battery voltage begins to be adjusted. The adjustment continues in stages up to 1,000 times. Unfortunately, there is no option to disable the feature. Although it may have benefited in the long run, there may be some users who don't care about the battery life, so it may have been better to have the option of continuing to use it normally. A Google public relations commented to 9to5google, "Battery Health Assistance is a feature that will be provided to some Pixel devices by the end of the year, and is designed to improve ease of use." Thankfully, other models will be considered an option. Tips to improve your daily battery life include using dark mode, adjusting screen brightness and sleep time, turning off keyboard sound and vibrators, and turning off Hey Google detection.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo had a surprise reveal for its Switch 2 Nintendo Direct with a trailer for a new game from From Software, The Duskbloods.

“I give you my blood. I give you my life. Turn a wheel and transport him to a night of moonlight, to humanity’s very dusk. Close your eyes and contemplate the moon, as you are able,” said an unknown female narrator’s voice. The Nintendo Swtich 2 debuts on June 5 with a couple of bundles.

From Software makes a lot of popular games, from Elden Ring to the Dark Souls titles. It’s a fantasy story, with a rich narrative and amazing graphics. It is coming from game director Hidetaka Miyazaki and will debut in 2026.</p>

Nintendo loves to create games that show off the unique features of their consoles, like Wii Sports, Nintendo Land, and 1-2-Switch. The Switch 2 version of this will be the rather functionally named Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, in which your tiny avatar will run around on a giant Switch 2 console and explore its features and secrets through the medium of minigames and tech demos.

It looks like the sort of game that might come installed on the console for free, but Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be a paid, digital-only game. Perhaps that indicates that it’s a bit more substantial and fun than you might expect. It will be available at the console’s launch.

One of the minigames featured is a top-down golf putting game that uses the Joy-Con 2’s mouse and gyroscope sensors so you can push the Joy-Con around on a surface like it’s the head of your golf club. Another seemed to relate to the console’s 3D audio capabilities. Elsewhere, as your avatar explores the Switch 2, clicking on question marks will explain facts about the console, like how the Joy-Con 2’s magnetic attachment works.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I've been complaining about tech a lot recently, and I don't apologize for it. Too much can be corrosive, it can make you insufferable to others, and it can leave you jaded, as many people, myself included, have become about technology. I had three recent experiences, however, that were each quite small in their way but which reminded me that not everything in the tech world has fallen victim to the forces of "enshittification." Once in a while, technology still feels easy and—dare I co-opt the world from Apple's marketing department?—even magical. Ars has complained about DRM since our founding over 25 years ago. As writers and editors ourselves, we certainly get the desire not to have one's work ripped off or repurposed without payment, but even effective DRM imposes annoying costs on those who actually paid the money for the thing. Case in point: I've been teaching myself songwriting, audio production, and mixing for the last 18 months, and part of that process has led me to invest some decent money into Universal Audio products. I bought its stellar and rock-solid-reliable Volt 2 audio interface and then spent much of 2024 snapping up high-quality plugins like Topline Vocal Suite, the Manley Voxbox, and the Electra 88 Rhodes piano. So it was just insulting to find out the hard way that Universal Audio used a variant of the iLok DRM system—itself unfortunately common in the audio industry—that required constant Internet connectivity to function. The iLok ecosystem can be configured in three main ways, authorizing your plugins 1) to a custom iLok USB dongle (which costs $50–$70 and requires a USB port—plus, you have to remember it at all times), 2) to the local machine you are working on, or 3) to the cloud. Universal Audio allowed only dongle and cloud authorizations, but I figured this wouldn't be a problem because, surely, the system would only need to check in semi-regularly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South America is a continent full of natural wonders. From majestic mountains to exuberant forests, the region houses phenomena that intrigue science. Among these wonders, there is a river that escapes all the known rules: the hottest river on planet Earth. This extreme heat has no volcanic origin, as it would be common in phenomena of this type, but in underground geothermal sources. The boiling river is not just a natural spectacle - it is also the object of intense scientific studies. Some of the characteristics that make it so special include: The waters of Shanay-Timpishka can reach between 86 ° C and 95 ° C. In some parts, it is possible to see animals falling into the water and dying almost instantly due to the high temperature. Plant density decreases visibly, and certain species completely disappear on the banks where the temperature is most extreme. Because it is subject to such high temperatures, it serves as a model to understand how the global increase in temperatures can affect integer ecosystems. Studying the river is not a simple task. The combination of extreme heat, intense and difficult humidity transforms each scientific expedition into a risky and exhaustive mission. Despite adverse conditions, some plants, such as Giant Ceiba, can survive near the river. This suggests that certain species may have greater heat tolerance - something essential on a rapidly warming planet. He raises fundamental questions about how the planet answers environmental changes and to what extent ecosystems can adapt to warming. Understanding phenomena like Shanay-Timpishka can provide crucial clues to predict the climate's future-and how to mitigate its effects.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We knew a Mario Kart game was coming to the Switch 2, and now Nintendo has finally shared some real details in its latest Nintendo Direct. It’s called Mario Kart World, and it will be a day-one Switch 2 exclusive when the console launches on June 5th. The company plans to share more about it in a Nintendo Direct scheduled for April 17th at 6AM PT / 9AM ET. Mario Kart World features an open-world mode, in-game atmospheric effects that depend on “the time of day and weather conditions,” and up to 24 drivers per race. The open-world mode is called “Free Roam,” and it’ll sound familiar to Forza Horizon 5 players, letting users drive on or off-road around the world, “take scenic drives with friends, and take photos together at different locations.” There’s also a “Knock-out Tour” mode that lets you do a cross-country Cannonball Run-style checkpoint race. Nintendo showed off some new gameplay mechanics, like abilities to grind on rails and power lines or wall jump, as well as new vehicles like boats and snowmobiles. Other shots showed what looked like on-the-fly character customization. Characters that appeared in the trailer included standards like Mario and Wario, as well as new ones to the mainline series, like the cow from Moo Moo Meadows in Mario Kart 64. And it makes a lot of sense as a debut title for the platform, as the kart racing series has arguably become Nintendo’s most popular franchise. Meanwhile, Mario Kart 7 was the top-selling 3DS game, Mario Kart Wii was second only to Wii Sports on that platform, and Mario Kart DS sat just behind Nintendogs to claim third place on the handheld.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a surprising turn of events, Chinese DRAM maker Changxin Memory (CXMT) is considering hiking the prices of its DDR4 memory after demand and supply stabilized, according to DigiTimes. Keep in mind that the information is unofficial, though. In a bid to gain market share away from primary memory suppliers, just about six months ago CXMT and another Chinese memory maker Fujian Jinhua offered their DDR4 SDRAM chips with a 50% discount, which made them cheaper than reballed (recycled/re-used) memory ICs, which intensified price competition amid oversupply of DDR4. However, as memory module producers and PC makers increased their stockpiles of hardware in general and mainstream memory specifically to prepare for possible tariff changes in the U.S., this led to quicker usage of existing inventory at contract hardware makers. As a result, DDR4 and DDR5 memory prices are projected to remain steady or even increase in the second quarter. As prominent DRAM makers shifted their capacity to DDR5 and HBM (and keep in mind that HBM requires more DRAM capacity than mainstream types of memory), Chinese DRAM makers seem to be inclined to cease dumping DDR4 SDRAM in a bid to gain market share. What happens in June and July remains to be seen. PC makers start to prep for the back-to-school season in late Q2—early Q3, so this is when DRAM prices tend to increase. Many PCs use not only mainstream DDR4 or DDR5 but also LPDDR5 and LPDDR5X, so expect demand for all four types of memory to rise this summer. However, how this affects pricing because OEMs and ODMs are stockpiling DRAMs now remains to be seen.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo’s full showcase of the Switch 2 has finally arrived. The Switch 2 is bold in black and spunky with its colorful joystick accents, but its real capabilities are more than skin deep. Nintendo is back and is once again declaring itself as the king of fun gaming devices, even if that means you may not be playing your games with the greatest graphical fidelity. There will be a bundle with Switch 2 and the upcoming game Mario Kart World, that will be on sale for $500. If you just want the console it’ll be going for $450. The newly added “C” button enables GameChat, which combines with the Switch 2’s built-in mic to talk to friends while playing games online. You can also expand your friends’ game screens to see more of what they’re playing. You need to have a Switch Online subscription for GameChat, but new buyers will get a one-month subscription to try out those features. Nintendo showed how player’s backgrounds are automatically blocked out, but we’ll see if Nintendo offers players control over background blur. Nintendo gave us a tiny peak of its Switch 2 back in January, but on Wednesday the legacy Japanese game maker finally pulled the curtain back on its sequel to 2017’s Nintendo Switch. The Switch 2 is an iteration on the company’s dockable handheld design from 2017, though with more top vents and a few extra buttons on top. They’re both compatible with their own straps and new charging grip. Nintendo said the screen supports HDR for better visual contrast, and the system also includes a better speaker and in-built microphone. The system will also support 3D audio through supported headphones. The right-side JoyCon includes a large “C” switch under the Home button which makes a chime when you press it. The beefy Switch 2 dock supports 4K resolution for compatible games and HDR is supported in TV mode. The dock includes its own fan system for cooling. There’s a new, exclusive Switch 2 Pro controller as well. At least, Nintendo Switch Online will remain consistent between platforms. These games will support both local and online multiplayer for up to four players. There’s a new version of the GameCube controller also coming to Switch 2, though it will be exclusive for Switch Online subscribers. Other games will get an “upgrade” for Switch 2, such as improved visuals and compatibility with features like mouse controls. Super Mario Party Jamboree, for example, now supports the camera modes and JoyCon mouse. app that helps you navigate the game or share screenshots with friends. There were a few other games shown off in Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal, but none as big as Elden Ring which will finally come to Switch systems in a “Tarnished Edition” arriving sometime this year. Hades II and Street Fighter 6 will arrive on Switch 2, as well. Hogwarts Legacy and Civilization VII—which will support mouse controls—are coming to the platform later this year. Finally, the most surprising ports may be Cyberpunk 2077 and Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth running on a Switch 2. If it can run on Steam Deck perfectly fine, we’re sure the wizards at CD Projekt Red can bring it to Nintendo’s slimmer handheld. Nintendo started its stream by showing off Mario Kart World, a Switch 2 exclusive. The big update is an open-world type “free-roam” environment to discover new routes or just take a few selfies with friends. It launches the same day as Nintendo Switch 2 and will have its own Direct on April 17. As for exclusives, Switch 2 will have its fair share. For one, FromSoftware is debuting a new game called DuskBloods with a visual style that feels much more like Bloodborne than its other recent titles. Finally, for those who still appreciate the Dynasty Warriors formula, the Zelda-themed Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment will launch in 2025. If you need to get excited about more exclusives with Nitendo’s most beloved characters, Donkey Kong is finally getting a new platformer with morphable terrain in Donkey Kong Bonanza. That title should be arriving on July 17 this year. Also, Masahiro Sakurai, the creator of Super Smash Bros., is back with a new Kirby Air Ride, which should be available sometime in 2026. Some of what Nintendo showed at its latest direct are details you’re already well aware of if you’ve been following the ultra-hyped handheld these last few months. The Virtual Game Cards also double as a way of lending games to friends and for moving titles between two Switch consoles you own. Nobody wants to stand in line for hours just to get their hands on a console, as much as they might love Nintendo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You can also purchase a Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World for $499. Preorders commence on April 9 in North America from "participating retailers." The Switch 2 is physically larger than the original Switch, with bigger Joy-Cons to accompany it, as well as a new dock. The much-anticipated console/handheld hybrid will have big shoes to fill, as the original Nintendo Switch was Nintendo's best-selling console of all time, with over 150.86 million units sold. The screen will go up to 120 frames per second with compatible games. It also has a built-in fan to keep the system extra cool while playing on a TV or monitor. Nothing was mentioned during the stream about an SoC, though the original Switch famously ran on an Nvidia Tegra X1 — a 256 CUDA core Kepler architecture GPU, with an 8-core Arm CPU that had four Cortex-A57 performance cores and four Cortex-A53 efficiency cores. It was manufactured on TSMC's 20nm process node, about a decade ago. The Switch 2 SoC specs aren't known, but there are some pretty solid rumors, so let's quickly talk about the CPU and GPU. We know from Nintendo's spec page that Nvidia will be providing the custom chip. The CPU will supposedly be an 8-core Arm Cortex-A78, though it might not have all eight cores enabled. The chip will be manufactured using Samsung's mature 8N process node, which at least means it doesn't need to compete too hard for wafers. In short, it's effectively the same processor that Nvidia puts into its Jetson Orin hardware, customized for Nintendo's specific use case. The Joy-Con 2 controllers attach magnetically, which Nintendo says keeps them "firmly attached." Should you play with a single Joy-Con, there are bigger SL and SR buttons on the inside. Each controller can be used as a mouse for compatible games, like Metroid Prime 4 Beyond, giving it some PC-style controls. Nintendo also highlighted a new game for mouse controls called Drag & Drive, which looks like Rocket League with basketball. Both Joy-Con 2 controllers are used as mice at once in this game, which you don't usually see on PC. Nintendo promises a 3D audio system, even if you don't have surround sound. Sony had touted this kind of tech for the PlayStation 5. The system has a new kickstand that is larger and bends back quite far.

There will be three types of games for the Switch 2. Metroid Prime 4 Beyond will be available in Switch and Switch 2 editions, where you can play in HDR at 60 fps or 120 fps. If you own a Switch game, you can upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition version with a paid upgrade pack. It allows for GameChat, letting you talk with friends while playing games. There's a built-in microphone in the Switch that will recognize your voice, and Nintendo didn't show it in use with a headset. The chat menu will also have game screens to share with others in your party, though Nintendo's direct made it look a little choppy. Your chat can include players in different games, so you don't have to be playing together. It's nice to see this built-in, as the original Nintendo Switch required a smartphone app. There's also a new Switch 2 Pro controller with rear GR and GL buttons for remapping front buttons like some pro controllers and a C button like on the Switch. Another software feature is GameShare, which lets you share games with other consoles on local networks. There's also a Nintendo Switch 2 camera that you can connect to the system to broadcast yourself on screen and video chat in front of your screen. The camera feed will also be incorporated into games, like some Mario Party-style mini games shown in the Direct. Nintendo started the stream with Mario Kart World, showcasing what will surely be a powerhouse game that will sell throughout the Switch 2's lifetime. It will be a launch day release for the Switch 2. The game will change with time of day and weather conditions. Koei Tecmo is developing the game with "support from Nintendo." Nintendo also announced Kirby Air Riders, a sequel to the GameCube game that featured racing and open-world exploration. Donkey Kong: Bananza is marking another major first-party release in a frolicking platformer that shows the hero punching his way through destructible environments. Nintendo will launch Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour as a paid digital game, guiding the player through the new console. It will explain the magnetic circuit that keeps the Joy-Cons attached and showcase rumble, mouse controls, and more in a series of mini-games. Those include painting, golf, playing maracas, and more. Third-party titles announced on the stream include Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades 2, Street Fighter 6 (including Amiibo to support it), Daemon X Machina, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Hogwarts Legacy (with mouse controls), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4, Hitman: World of Assassination, an upcoming James Bond 007 game. Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster, Yakuza 0 Directors' Cut, Deltarune, Civilization VII, WWE 2K, NBA 2K, Borderlands 4, Survival Kids, Enter the Gungeon 2, Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, among others, many of which will release with the Switch 2 or later this year. The trailer showed a series of fearsome warriors, as well as some steampunk sensibilities and gothic undertones, all with a huge vampire twist. An expansion pack for Switch 2 will bring GameCube games to the handheld. A GameCube controller will also be released for Switch Online members.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Amid growing fallout over Elon Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration, Tesla’s sales fell a staggering 13 percent in the first quarter of 2025 year over year. It was Tesla’s worst production and delivery report in three years. Analysts had expected Tesla to report deliveries in the quarter of 377,592 vehicles, down from 386,810 vehicles a year ago, according to a consensus of 27 analyst estimates compiled by Tesla. It was Tesla’s worst production and delivery report in three years Tesla said that deliveries were impacted by the production changeover for the refreshed Model Y, which just recently started making its way to customers. The downswing wiped out nearly $460 billion from the company’s market cap and shaved over $100 billion from Elon Musk’s net worth. Tesla’s sales in Europe for January and February were down nearly 43 percent year over year, according to registration data from the EU. (The company does not break out sales regionally, so registration data from Europe and China are watched closely.) While Tesla faces new hurdles, other automakers are reporting brisk sales of their own EVs. Tesla’s problems are partly because of Musk’s position with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a specious effort to cut “waste and fraud” in the government that appears mostly aimed at eliminating humanitarian aid programs and terrorizing federal workers. He has also amplified racist theories on social media and made a fascist salute during Trump’s inauguration. Musk’s antics have spawned a nationwide protest movement called Tesla Takedown, aimed at boycotting the company and driving down its stock price. And it appears to be successful in persuading many progressive Tesla owners to sell their vehicles, despite steep drops in used car values. President Donald Trump has said suspects caught defacing Tesla vehicles would be charged with “domestic terrorism.” Musk is pinning his hopes on AI, robotics, and self-driving cars, which he argues will propel Tesla to new financial heights. But his past promises about autonomous driving have failed to come true. And experts have questioned Tesla’s approach to the technology, pointing to dozens of fatal crashes that have occurred involving the company’s partially automated features.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a highly anticipated Nintendo Direct presentation this morning, the company revealed new information about the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware and software ahead of a newly announced June 5, 2025, release date. The system will be available on its own or in a bundle with Mario Kart World, for $449 and $499, respectively. The presentation led off with an extended look at a new exclusive launch title, Mario Kart World, which features 24 racers at once on "various regions across the globe" where "you can drive off the race track and go virtually anywhere" in a new "free roam" mode. Characters were shown doing jumps off of walls and wearing multiple different costumes. A new level themed after the original Donkey Kong featured prominently, as did one reminiscent of the Hyrule Castle level of Super Smash Bros. You can also go on "scenic drives with friends" and take photos with them in a new photo mode. Credit: Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of classic games, purchased as "Upgrade Packs" for original owners.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They are the so -called “lavender weddings”: alliances based on friendship, mutual support and coexistence, but without sexual or romantic involvement. The term “lavender marriage” originates in the nineteenth century, when it was used to describe unions between men and homosexual women who sought to hide their sexual orientation from society. Today, the concept has gained a new dimension among younger people: it is an affective partnership without romance, but with commitment, coexistence and shared life goals. These marriages are not facade relationships, but conscious agreements between two people who want to divide life under a logic of cooperation. Motivation can be emotional, practical, financial or a mixture of all. At this juncture, lavender marriage emerges as a practical and affective solution: it offers stability, coexistence and even access to legal benefits such as joint health plans, inheritance and rights in medical decisions. For many people, it is a way to build an emotional and logistical support base without having to meet the expectations of traditional relationships. For these partnerships, priority is care, empathy and mutual planning - not passion. These unions may include expenditure division, common life projects, well -defined coexistence agreements and even the possibility of each partner to maintain other romantic or sexual relationships outside the union. On social networks, especially in Tiktok, the theme exploded. Hashtag #LaVendemariage already accumulates millions of views, with personal reports, advice and even proposals from apps dedicated to those seeking this type of partnership. Each couple defines their own terms: There are those who live as “best married friends”, who raise children together, who invests in shared professional projects - and all without involving the romantic element. Although the starting point of lavender marriages is platonic, some evolve to deeper affective relationships. However, this is neither the rule nor objective. This trend also represents a critique - or at least an alternative - to the romantic ideal that still dominates much of social narratives. Instead of waiting for the soul mate, many young people are choosing trustworthy partners with whom they can create a home based on mutual care, stability and complicity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the scandal of information on the US military plans in Yemen shared on Signal, here is the national security councilor Michael Waltz returns to be talked about for a new communication error. According to a report published in these hours by the Washington Post, Waltz has discussed "sensitive military positions and powerful armament systems relating to an ongoing conflict" using his personal Gmail account, definitely less sure than Signal. More in detail, it would seem that Waltz, together with other members of the National Security Council (NSC), used the Google mail service "for highly technical conversations with colleagues from other government agencies". What amazes, however, is that he was the only one to use a personal account, while the others would all have used government accounts. In addition, the Washington Post makes it known that the councilor received in his personal mailbox "less sensitive information, but potentially exploitable [...], such as his agenda and other work documents". A decidedly problematic management of information, which could prove to be dangerous for Donald Trump's government. Of full response, the spokesman for the Council Brian Hughes took us to defend the behavior of the director, specifying that "Waltz has not sent and would never send information classified on a private account" and that he and his collaborators used "only safe platforms for classified information". Yet, according to a recent indiscretion of the Wall Street Journal, Waltz would have created on Signal Chat shared with some members of the Council to discuss sensitive topics such as Somalia or the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. But Hughes seems to have a justification for this too, claiming that Signal is an "authorized app, and in some cases it is automatically added to government devices". However, Michael Waltz is difficult to defend, given that last week he created a group chat on the messaging app in which he was discussed sensitive themes, and to which he also invited the editor -to -act of The Atlantic - as well as Trump's critic -, Jeffrey Goldberg.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even if the 2024 YR4 asteroid no longer represents a threat to the earth, there is still a remote possibility that could hit the moon in 2032. The scenario had already been hypothesized in the past, but now a team of astronomers has managed to obtain more precise measurements of the object thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JSWT). NASA's JSWT is one of the most powerful telescopes available to scientists. Precisely by virtue of his skills, the instrument observation program is saturated: if a working group wants to use it - perhaps to study the light in the galaxies farthest from ours or to scrutinize the border of the Solar System - it must put in line. For this reason, although the discovery dates back to December 2024, it was possible to observe 2024 YR4 with the JSWT only in March of this year. If on the one hand the latest analyzes have confirmed that there is no possibility of impact with our planet, it remains a 2% probability of collision with the moon. JWST's observations also determined that the asteroid has a diameter of 60 meters, with a margin of error of seven meters (the first estimates indicated an interval between 40 and 90 meters). 2024 YR4 is therefore large enough to cause serious damage within a radius of 80-100 kilometers, underline the members of the team head of the NASA telescope. "Part of our motivation to continue examining this particular asteroid is to discover whether the probability of lunar impact will increase or reduce to zero. A 2% impact probability implies a 98% probability that does not happen," said Andrew Right, a planetary astronomer at the applied physics laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The series that redefined modern science fiction is back. With a sharp look at the ethical impacts of technological advances, Black Mirror returns to Netflix on April 10 with his long -awaited seventh season. Created by Charlie Brooker, British production resumes its anthological format with independent episodes, and this time, it brings a sequence of one of the most iconic chapters of the series. Get ready for stories that mix tension, reflection and inescapable discomfort. In this new season, Black Mirror features six unpublished episodes: ordinary people, Bète Noire, Eulogy, Toys, Reverie Hotel and USS Callister: Into Infinity. Each chapter addresses, in a unique way, the dangers and dilemmas that arise from the increasingly intimate relationship between humanity and technology. One of the highlights is the episode Hotel Reverie, where a movie star finds herself trapped within a simulation that recreates a classic of British cinema. In this universe generated by artificial intelligence, the only way out is to follow the film's script - literally. History raises questions about how much technology can manipulate reality, confusing fiction and real life. Another striking episode is ordinary people, who brings a deep emotional dilemma: a man needs to resort to advanced technology to save his wife, but the choice is accompanied by a very high ethical price. This is the first time Black Mirror has continued an earlier episode, breaking his tradition of autonomous stories. The choice reflects the potential of the narrative universe of USS Callister, which combines social criticism, satire with pop culture and an engaging sci-fi aesthetic. Ancient fans will surely have plenty of reasons to get excited. Names like Paul Giamatti, Awkwafina and Emma Corin are part of the episodes of the new season. The combination of intense performances with provocative scripts reinforces the series's commitment to generate not only entertainment, but also critical reflection on today's world. Since his debut, Black Mirror has been known for portraying future dystopics who, over the years, seem frighteningly plausible. This seventh season follows tradition, addressing topics such as manipulated memories, invasive artificial intelligence and the effects of fame in digital times.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta's Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses is one of the products that has successfully entered the highly competitive wearable market in recent years and has successfully built a foothold. If CES in January was a representation of the year 2025, then more people will be walking, working and relaxing in smart glasses. However, Meta doesn't seem to be satisfied with brand glasses that allow you to answer questions and take photos. A recent report by Bloomberg appears to have greater ambitions to create eyewear that can display graphics, track hand gestures, and do a variety of things. The product under development is coded "Hypernova," and according to Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the price is expected to be around $1,000 to $1,400 (approximately 150,000 to 210,000 yen), roughly four times the price of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. This is the story of the original Hypernova, and it is said that a version of a binocular system with displays on the left and right as a successor is already under development. These operations are either performed using capacitive touch controls on the sides of the glasses or using a finger gesture with a Meta neural wristband attached. I believe that the camera performance of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses is within acceptable range (Meta says it is equivalent to the iPhone 11), but Hypernova is expected to upgrade to a sensor comparable to the iPhone 13. It may also improve shooting performance in dark places. According to Bloomberg, Hypernova's announcement is "still a few months away," but Meta's release plans could change.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data Meta Ray-Ban connected glasses have managed to impose itself on the competitive market for portable products. If the CES of last January is an indication of what we will see by 2025, we must expect that more and more people are walking, work and lounge with connected glasses. Almost four times the price of its Ray-Ban connected glasses. But unlike existing AR glasses, such as G1 Even Realities, you will have to look down and not up to see the digital screen. Several connected glasses that we have seen this year have set up a top -oriented screen. This only applies to the first version of Hypernova. Because a successor with a binocular display system (screens on both sides) is also - and already - being prepared. It will be designed in partnership with Oakley. And will be intended for sporting use. According to Bloomberg, the new connected glasses have a start -up screen that presents Meta and its various partners, including Google/Android and the manufacturer of Qualcomm fleas, who worked with the technological giant for recent Quest helmets. Once started, the glasses display a horizontal stack of icons, similar to the dock of iPhones and MacBooks applications. And the glasses will probably synchronize with your phone to project the incoming notifications of various messaging services. The Hypernova 2 would be designed in partnership with Oakley. Better stabilization of the image would certainly be welcome. Bloomberg claims that the Hypernova is "still in months to be presented".</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world has been addicted to caffeine for centuries, and in the year 2025 the scientific argument over whether coffee is good or bad for you remains unsettled. One might believe the lack of consensus is a Mainstream Media™ psyop to keep people scrambling for marketable solutions to a problem that’s completely made up, but the cottage industry of coffee alternatives that’s proliferated by this endless tug of war is an interesting outcome regardless of which side you’re on. This is where mushroom coffee makes its inevitable entrance.

Some quick googling revealed 10 known players in the game, all of which offer their own riff on a common base formula of dried mushrooms–usually a combo of lion’s mane, chaga, and cordyceps—boosted with buzzy add-ons like probiotics and nootropics. I spent a week with each, swapping out my morning coffee for each brand's recommended dose of powder and hot water. After day five I allowed myself to experiment with sweeteners and milks, which you’ll need with almost all of these to get through the entire cup without gagging.

Some hit like a mild cup of coffee, some were actual coffee, and others were uncanny concoctions no normal person would ever crave unless they were fully indoctrinated in the heady lifestyle this unique alt-beverage industry revolves around. I laughed, I cried, I got the runs, and I crashed on my couch in the early afternoon more times than I could count, all for science, and all so you don’t have to try this on your own.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PC makers have been preparing to reduce reliance on hardware produced in China for years, and large computer suppliers like Dell and HP seem to have diversified their supply chains. Recent U.S. government-imposed taxes on Chinese imports are driving up the cost of computer parts and there's only so much they can do. Puget Systems published a blog post explaining that while it can absorb some of the price changes caused by tariffs, it will inevitably have to pass the higher costs on to its clients. China produces a large portion of global electronics, so its impact on the computer market is hard to overestimate even though large companies like Apple, Dell, and HP are expanding production in other countries — including Vietnam, which isn't subject to U.S. tariffs. Additionally, goods that were temporarily exempt from a separate 25% charge set in 2018–2019 may lose that exemption on June 1, potentially bringing the total increase to 45% for some items, such as the best graphics cards. "We absorb initial cost changes on many components," wrote Jon Bach, president of Puget Systems, in the blog post. "We adjust our pricing when ongoing long-term costs are clear, and absorb differences otherwise. That rate could jump to 45% on June 1, pending policy changes, Puget warns. When combined with additional tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, graphics cards may get too expensive for many potential buyers. CPU coolers and fans are also expected to rise around 20%, though their overall impact on system pricing is minimal. SSDs and hard drives are seeing about a 10% price increase, mainly due to shifts in the broader supply network rather than tariffs on core components like NAND chips or media platters. Memory is also expected to rise around 10%, though recent spot market price drops may reduce the impact. Costs for Puget's own services, such as warranties, will remain at the existing level as the company only changes in response to internal business expenses, typically tied to inflation and staffing. In addition, some suppliers have raised prices more than necessary, using uncertainty as a reason to drive urgency and increase revenue. This kind of behavior is not limited to one industry and affects prices throughout the entire supply chain. Because the supply network is so layered, predicting costs can be difficult. There's hope for some future relief if suppliers reduce prices, and those savings would be passed on. In the meantime, Puget Systems stockpiles hardware, which helps to manage shortages and delay price hikes. But there's only so far such measures can reach, and with how quickly everything is changing, eventually Puget will be paying higher costs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a non-exhaustive list of places microplastics have been found: Mount Everest, the Mariana Trench, Antarctic snow, clouds, plankton, turtles, whales, cattle, birds, tap water, beer, salt, human placentas, semen, breast milk, feces, testicles, livers, brains, arteries, and blood. In early March I milked a few drops out of my fingertips and sent the sample to be tested for microplastics. I was in the London office of Clarify Clinics—a firm that offers to cleanse your blood of microplastics, forever chemicals, and other toxins, in treatments that start at £9,750 ($12,636). Each week around 10 to 15 people walk into the basement clinic just off Harley Street—a road famed for its private clinics and wealthy clientele. That plasma is filtered through a column that is supposed to trap microplastics and other undesirable chemicals, before being mixed back with the blood cells and pumped back into the patient. It’s very comfortable,” says Yael Cohen, CEO of Clarify Clinic. The ones who sleep are my favorite.” They come for all kinds of reasons, Cohen says: Some are suffering with chronic fatigue, others with brain fog or long Covid. The clinic also runs treatments marketed toward people on Ozempic-style weight-loss drugs, looking to conceive, or ward off dementia. What Clarify sells them is the hope of easing their symptoms by ridding their blood of microplastics, or other potential contaminants such as PFAS chemicals (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) and pesticides. But the science on how microplastics affect our health is still far from conclusive. “That’s the reason why it is important to determine accurately how much microplastics or any other type of environmental contaminants humans are exposed to.” There have been an onslaught of scientific papers that have tracked microplastics to every inch of the Earth’s surface and deep within our bodies, but very few attempt to tease out the impact these have on our health. A 2022 review article found that microplastics were associated with harm to human cells, but didn’t examine actual health outcomes in living humans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Thorne wishes he could unsee some of the incel content he came across while doing research for his hit Netflix show Adolescence. (Spoiler alert: This piece contains plot details for Adolescence.) Each episode, shot unflinchingly in one take and focusing on different characters in Jamie’s life, interrogates the factors that led to this brutal crime, with online radicalization and bullying playing key roles. It’s a world Thorne, the show’s cocreator, had to get intimately familiar with to tell the story. The most disturbing part of his research wasn’t consuming content from men he referred to as “manosphere kings,” like alleged rapist Andrew Tate (Tate has denied the allegations), but rather small blogs from tweens and teens using incel ideology to explain why girls didn’t like them. I wouldn't have been drawn in like Jamie was drawn in, but I knew that there were elements of it that would've made real sense to me,” Thorne says. The manosphere is an online universe of male, right-wing influencers who proffer misogynist advice on how to be more masculine and get laid—often reducing women to sexist stereotypes and blaming feminism for issues like male loneliness. Far from being an obscure ideology, manosphere rhetoric and high-profile leaders of the nebulous movement were highly influential in President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign. But Adolescence tells a more nuanced story, one that illustrates how the proliferation of this content can have a horrific impact. Manosphere teachings include lessons in how to pick up women after lowering their self-esteem, obsessive fitness routines, even pseudoscientific exercises for how to develop a more-defined jawline. His rage at Katie stems from her rejecting his offer to go on a date—one he only made after she was slut-shamed at school—and subsequently calling him an incel on Instagram. He scoffs at the idea that boys and girls can be friends and seems desperate for the female psychologist evaluating him to like him—even as he tries to dominate her during their session. In the second episode, which takes place at Jamie’s school, the detective investigating the case gets an earful about incel and red pill subcultures from his son, a student who bluntly tells his dad that he’s clueless when it comes to the motivations behind Katie’s murder.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lightmatter, a startup that has worked on various optical interconnects for several years now, this week introduced a possible solution: its Photonic M1000 high-performance photonic interconnect platform that promises to enable large multi-chiplet processors with optical interconnects supporting bandwidth of up to 114 Tbps (14.25 TB/s). The device includes eight connected chip sections in one package and integrates 1,024 serial data channels. Each of these supports 56 Gbps transmission using a straightforward modulation method. For external connections, the M1000 incorporates 256 fiber-optic lines with eight wavelengths per signal line, each offering 448 Gbps. The Passage M1000 comes in a 7,735 mm^2 package that can deliver up to 1,500W of power to its chiplets, which is more or less in line with expectations for next-generation AI processors. The Passage L200 is a 3D optical chiplet that replaces traditional copper interconnects with ultra-high-speed photonic links. Unlike conventional designs limited to edge I/O, L200 enables edgeless connectivity, enabling data channels to be placed anywhere on the die surface for better performance. The L200 users chiplet IP from Alphawave with a UCIe die-to-die interface and Lightmatter's photonic circuits that support supports 320 multi-protocol SerDes, 16-wavelength WDM per fiber for up to 1.6 Tbps per fiber.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ついに任天堂の新型コンソールが登場する時が来た。初代「Nintendo Switch」の発売から8年、待望の後継機「Switch 2」の詳細が4月2日夜、ついに明らかになる。

初代Switchは、「Switch Lite」や有機ELモデルといったバリエーション展開で人気を集め、さらに「マリオ」「ゼルダ」「どうぶつの森」など、任天堂独自の人気シリーズを遊べる唯一のプラットフォームとして支持されてきた。

初代Switchが登場してから、ゲーム界は進化を続けている。いまでは4KグラフィックスやVR、ストリーミング、ゲームのサブスク、そしてソーシャル要素などが、より多くのゲーマーにとって重要になっている。新型Switchは「Xbox Series X」や「PlayStation 5」などの競合機に追いつきつつ、家族向けで携帯性もある、誰もが手に取りやすいフォーマットを維持できるかが注目されている。世界中のゲーマーが、次に任天堂がどのような発表をするのかを心待ちにしている。

米CNETの新たな調査では、米国の成人ゲーマーの半数以上（58%）がSwitch 2の購入に関心を持っているが、検討する点もあることが分かった。具体的には、27%が「手頃な価格」を求めているほか、任天堂の新作ゲームや技術面の進化も期待されている。

長年待ち続けてきた任天堂ファンは、新しく進化したシステムを手にする準備ができている。果たしてSwitch 2はその期待に応えられるのか。

ここからは米CNETによる新たな調査の結果と、ゲーム担当編集者による注目のポイントを紹介する。

Z世代が求めるのは新作ゲームと性能

米CNETの調査によると、自分をゲーマーだと認識するZ世代の70%、ミレニアル世代の71%が、今度の新型Switchに興味を持っている。特に興味深いのは、Z世代が何を求めているかという点だ。

Z世代回答者のほぼ4人に1人（23%）が、任天堂の新作ゲームを期待しており、30%がより大きな画面や高品質なグラフィックスなどの技術向上を望んでいる。とはいえ、購入判断で最も大きな要素として挙がったのは「手頃な価格」（31%）だった。米CNETのエディター・アット・ラージでゲーム機器などを担当するScott Stein記者は、これらの結果に驚きはないという。

「Switch 2の存在意義を裏付ける結果と言える」とStein記者は話す。

ここからはZ世代のゲーマーや米国の成人ゲーマー全体がSwitch 2への買い替えを決める際に重視している点を詳しく見ていき、専門家の見解を紹介する。

最重要ポイントは価格

ほかのゲーム機と比べて任天堂の製品はそれほど高価ではなかったため、予算を抑えたい層にとっては500ドルのXbox Series Xよりも手を出しやすい選択肢だった。Stein記者はSwitch 2の価格が400ドル程度になると予想しており、Z世代がゲーム機にあまり高い出費をしたくないなら、この価格は受け入れられる可能性が高い。なお初代Switchは発売当初、300ドルだった。

「Z世代はテクノロジーの状況をよく分かっていて、高額を払いたがらない」とStein記者は言う。「Switch 2は中間くらいの価格帯を狙えるかもしれない」

また、Z世代が任天堂の定番ゲームを好むなら、新型Switchを買う可能性は高い。ただし、大手パブリッシャーが人気タイトルをどの程度Switch 2に対応させるかによっては、値段に見合うかどうかの判断が分かれるかもしれない。

求められるのは性能と独自機能

特に若いゲーマー世代であるZ世代は、新型Switchに高解像度グラフィックスを期待している。これはPlayStationやXboxなどハイエンドゲーム機への期待と同様だ。この世代は初代Switchが出たときまだ若かったため、今回初めて任天堂のグラフィックスや機能について意見を持てる状況になったとStein記者は語る。

さらにZ世代は、Switchならではの特徴にも注目している。

例えば、任天堂は「Joy-Con」をマウスのように使う可能性を示唆している。これが購買の決め手になるかは分からないものの、Z世代は何か変わった要素を求めていて、それに値段に見合う価値を感じられれば買うだろうと、米CNETのシニアレポーターであるDavid Lumbは言う。

ゲームへの出費は多いが選択は慎重

若い世代はコンソールの価格を気にする一方で、Switch 2を検討するうえで重視しているのは提供されるゲームだ。「自由になるお金があるZ世代は、さまざまなゲームを買うのではなく数本のゲームに絞り、そこに少しお金をかける傾向がある。友人関係がこうした1～2本のゲームを基盤としている場合は特にそうだ」とLumb記者は話す。

Lumb記者はまた、Z世代はSwitch 2の価格に見合うほどゲームが提供されるかを様子見する可能性があるとも指摘する。友達と遊ぶ定番ゲームがすでにあるためだ。

とはいえ、この世代はサブスクリプションやゲームへの支出が最も多い層でもある。

Z世代は平均して月56ドルをサブスクや新作ゲームに費やしており、米国の成人ゲーマー全体の月平均35ドルと比べるとかなり高い。1年で252ドルも差が出る。

これには新作ゲームの代金やサブスク代だけでなく、1年に1本だけ購入したゲームの課金（外見やアップグレード、アイテムなど）が含まれる可能性もある。

Switch 2が米国のゲーマーに注目される理由

米国の成人ゲーマーの半数以上（58%）がSwitch 2の購入に関心を持っている。一体なぜだろうか。

Switchを愛好するゲーマーにとって、このフォーマットとゲームは楽しく、そろそろ次の世代に移りたいという気持ちがあるからだとLumb記者は言う。

「みんな次のバージョンがどうなるかワクワクしているだけで、必ずしも全員が買うというわけではないだろう」とLumb記者。米国の成人が新型Switchを買う決め手として挙げている点は、以下の通りだ。

編集者とゲーマーが期待するSwitchの重要ポイント

Lumb記者とStein記者によると、Switch 2には大幅な変化は期待しないほうがいいという。2日の映像配信「Nintendo Direct」で詳しく発表されるだろうが、ここでは調査結果や専門家の意見を踏まえて、期待されるいくつかの可能性を挙げておく。

人気ゲームを呼び込むための性能アップ

価格に加えて、購入の決め手となるのは「技術の進化」と「ゲームのラインアップ」だ。とはいえ、その両方を実現するには、任天堂以外のメジャータイトルにも対応できる性能が必要になる。

任天堂はXboxやPlayStationほど性能重視ではなく、むしろ独自のゲーム体験を重視しているとLumb記者は言う。

「任天堂は常に最新かつ最強のグラフィックスという方向性より、独自のスタイルを追求してきた。しかし初代Switchではハイエンドゲームの移植という点で苦戦したため、次のモデルではこうしたゲームを十分に確保できる程度の性能向上が期待される」とLumb記者は話す。

任天堂の新たなサブスクプラン

現状、任天堂はクラウドセーブやオンラインマルチプレイ、過去の任天堂タイトルのライブラリーを提供する「Nintendo Switch Online」を展開している。米CNETの編集者たちは、任天堂が今回の発表でこの既存サブスクを拡充することを期待している。

Stein記者は「もし任天堂がSwitch 2向けに特別なサブスクプランを提供するとしたら、現行Switchのユーザーも利用できるかどうかが気になる」と言う。例えば、月額料金を払えば新作「マリオカート」が無料で遊べるといった、追加特典付きのプランが登場するかもしれない。

特別な機能や技術的アップグレード

現時点でうわさされているSwitch 2の仕様は、8インチLCD画面、8コアの「Arm Cortex A78C」CPU、バッテリー持続のための5Wの消費電力などだ。

任天堂は時折、斬新な技術で驚かせてくれるため、今回も何か面白い仕掛けがあるかもしれない。AIによるアップスケーリングやNVIDIA製プロセッサーの搭載などもうわさされている。

調査方法

特に断りがない限り、数字はすべてYouGov Plc.の調査による。対象は成人2369人で、うち1290人がゲーマー。調査は2025年3月19日～25日にかけてオンラインで実施され、結果は18歳以上の米国成人の人口構成比に合わせて重み付けされている。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The young man, graduated in a prestigious university of the Ivy League and coming from a wealthy family from Maryland, is accused of killing Thompson with a gunshots last December in front of a Manhattan hotel. The case had triggered a vast media debate - including several conspiracy theories and memes - transforming Mangione into a viral figure on social networks. Through the online platforms, it has collected over 700 thousand dollars in donations for its legal defense, thanks to the support of those who see it as a symbol of the fight against the American health system, often criticized for unsustainable costs and inadequate covers. In anticipation of this development, the accused had already strengthened his legal team with a lawyer specialized in cases of death penalty. Mangione, in fact, is facing two separate processes: one in the state of New York and the other at the federal level. The state process, already in an advanced phase, could lead him to an life imprisonment sentence without the possibility of conditional freedom, on charges of first instance murder aggravated by terrorism. In the federal processes for penalty, the procedure is divided into two distinct phases: the hearing on guilt and, only in the event of a guilt verdict, a second phase where the jury decides to apply whether to apply the death penalty or life imprisonment. This decision must be unanimous: only one opposite juror is enough to exclude the capital penalty. The federal death penalty is reserved for crimes considered particularly heinous or affect federal interests. According to the investigators, Mangione would have carefully planned the murder, following Thompson for days and leaving a diary that would document his hatred towards the health insurance industry. During his first term (2017-2021), Trump had already shown his favor for the capital penalty, interrupting a 17-year moratorium on federal executions and authorizing the killing of 13 convicted. His vision on the death penalty has consolidated even more today: in fact, already on the first day of his new mandate, President Trump signed an executive order that requires the Department of Justice to pursue the death penalty "for all the crimes of a gravity that requests its use".</p>

As already happened in the first instance for Chatgpt upon his arrival on WhatsApp, also a destination AI opens to a reduced range of features, which however gravitate around tasks that could be useful in daily use, for example the generation texts consistent with the context and corrections to draw up sentences and paragraphs behind indications on topic and style or correct a ready -made text. Or, you can look for information on the net by following precise questions. Or you can still ask for advice to plan for example a trip or to reorganize ideas on a project. It is possible to recall destination ai inside a group chat by mentioning it with the snail ("@meta ai") and in the same way it is possible to find it on the list of personal contacts through the appropriate research field. How to disable Meta Ai su on WhatsApp What if you weren't interested in this functionality? In reality, at the moment there is no possibility of disabled or deleting destination to from WhatsApp. There are those who tried to ask the same assistant, but the answer does not lead to an effective method.

So that got me asking: Well, why is it the most popular vehicle? And why can't I have one?” Karlin says. Still, Karlin was nervous when he got to the customs. The China-made Wuling Hongguang Macaron costs less than $8,000. Today, there are almost no Chinese electric cars sold in the US. First, they are almost never sold here officially. Compared to Mexico, where 135,000 Chinese-branded vehicles were sold in 2023, accounting for 10 percent of total car sales, the US has no Chinese auto brands on sale (although it does sell a small number of made-in-China electric or hybrid cars by Polestar, Volvo and Ford). For many other countries, this is where parallel import, or unauthorized gray market vehicles, comes in. But they’ve been almost nonexistent in the US since 1988, when Congress passed a law essentially forbidding the import of any foreign cars unless they go through a lengthy and costly process to prove they meet US safety and emission standards. The law was passed when Japanese and European automakers were significantly squeezing the US auto market, which sounds familiar to Chinese EV brands’ market advantage today.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On March 31, caster Oe Mariko retracted the closure of her X (formerly Twitter) account, which had been announced to be closure.

Oe also posted about her X account, saying, "I'm going to close it," as she will leave TV Tokyo at the end of March. However, he received advice from his followers, "If you close it, you'll see a spoof, so it might be better to just leave it alone," and he changed his policy by saying, "I definitely want to avoid fake accounts being used for scams, so I think I'll just leave them alone."

According to X's specifications, after a certain period of time has passed since the account was deleted, a third party can create an account with the same username. This could be misused and used for fraud.

A similar example is the official X (formerly Twitter) account for JAXA's lunar spacecraft, "SLIM," which made Japan's first moon landing. JAXA had announced that it would be closing its account after SLIM operation was over, but followers had raised comments such as, "There is a risk of impersonation, etc.".

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Have you ever had a problem trying to boot your Windows PC? Startup errors are one of the most difficult issues to troubleshoot and repair. So Microsoft has released a new tool that can be used if your PC no longer boots properly. This feature is called "Quick Machine Recovery" (QMR) and can be tested with the latest builds for "Windows 11 Insider." If a serious boot-up problem occurs, the PC enters WinRE mode, connects to the network and sends diagnostic data to Microsoft. Based on that data, a program suitable for repairing the problem will then be sent to your PC via Windows Update. One of the major benefits of QMR is that it is designed to run automatically, allowing it to run remotely. Your organization's IT administrator can send fixes that are appropriate for that PC without having to physically connect to the PC. If you are a private user, the fixes will be managed by Microsoft. Additionally, Windows Insider Program participants will be provided with a test repair package within a few days so that they can check QRM's operation.</p>

And you receive an unpleasant error message if you go to a page whose URL does not include the Magic HTTPS term. If you send someone a contract in PDF format, you can easily encrypt it and protect their content from prying eyes. All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data Certainly, your reception box is encrypted at rest and in transit. But good luck if you want to protect a message so that it can only be read by the person you send it to. The existing options for emailing email are expensive, excessively complex to administer and improper. Send encrypted messages to any user, whatever the messaging service And this with new feature for Gmail users in a company. For Google Workspace administrators, no additional configuration is necessary. According to Google, this feature allows you to quantify the content of a message on the customer before it is transmitted or stored on a Google Workspace server. This approach means that each message is protected by zero knowledge (Zero-Knowledge Encryption) and meets the base of standards that highly regulated industries must respect. Resolve the complex skein of emails to encrypt If you have already had a real estate transaction using encrypted mail, you know how painful all this is. This system was not integrated into the bank's website. And so I had to create a separate password. But did not give me, neither to me nor to my banker, no indication that the messages had disappeared. In current business environments, administrators can set up secure messaging systems based on S/Mime standard. But provided that the administrator assigned a certificate to each user. And that he has left none of these exhaust certificates. There are of course less centralized options, such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). It is not surprising that a long -term study conducted in a large university has revealed that only one message out of 1,700 is encrypted. When the recipient has configured S/Mime, Gmail sends an e-mail e2ee via S/Mime (like today). Companies can choose to force all external recipients, even those that use a Gmail account, to use this "restricted" version of Gmail. Understand when and why we receive a encrypted message Classification labels to help users understand when (and why) they received a encrypted message When will this feature be available for you? For the moment, these features are only available for Google premium customers, those who have paid for the Google Workspace Enterprise Plus subscriptions, Standard Education or Education Plus, with the Ensured Controls option. If your business uses a simple business subscription or if you have a free Gmail account, you will have to wait. The functionality is deployed today for companies and educational establishments. Google sets up the support of E2E messages according to what it calls a "progressive approach ... in beta version, with the possibility of sending E2EE messages to Gmail users of your own business".</p>

Hart, abbreviation of Autoregressive Hybrid Transform (Autoregressive hybrid transformer), is a generator of images from text developed by MIT, Nvidia and the University of Tsinghua. It is characterized by unprecedented speed and generations, with a latency of 3.1 to 5.9 times lower than that of the most recent diffusion models. Without going into details, instead of using a diffusion model, which is the training method used by most popular IA image generators, including Dall-E Openai and Imagen 3 by Google, Hart is a self-regressive visual generation model (AR), the same as the GPT-4O image generator recently published by Openai. AR models allow you to better control the final image by generating it step by step. However, training these models is expensive. And quality can suffer from higher resolutions. To remedy this problem, the researchers introduced a hybrid tokenizer which makes it possible to treat the different parts of the image more effectively. Result: Hart is faster and has a better yield than diffusion models. Given that most AI models take at least a few seconds to generate images, which is very fast anyway, I did not expect Hart's speed to impress me a lot. The model is accompanied by a stopwatch to timer each generation. After using the model several times, I noticed that it took 1.8 seconds to generate images. And about 10 seconds to Imagen 3 from Google. Despite the speed of Google's model, Imagen 3 took about 10 times more time than Hart to generate the image. I tested most text conversion models in image on the market. The inference code is also open and accessible via a public GitHub deposit, that developers, academics or AI lovers can use to continue their research on image generators.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, these aquatic monsters—a national symbol that features on Mexico’s 50 peso bills, and which were once considered divine entities, the “twins” of the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl—are at “extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.” Xochimilco is home to the remnants of a vast canal network built by the Aztecs, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, though the district is facing ecological deterioration as a result of increasing urbanization. But there is one last hope. Public sightings are important, he says, but to be sure of their existence in the wild, there needs to be evidence. Armed with confirmation that axolotls are still present in Xochimilco, and with an estimate of how many, the researchers then plan to run campaigns to combat misinformation about the species and to guide conservation, and also to bolster the wild population by releasing reared individuals. The final results of this survey will be published in the first half of 2025, and a new count is planned for 2026. WIRED witnessed firsthand how scientists Vania Mendoza, Viviam Crespo, and Paola Cervantes—together with local villagers, like Basilio Rodríguez—conducted the census. They used traditional fishing techniques together with innovative methods such as environmental DNA analysis, where a species can be traced by hunting for DNA that it sheds into its surrounding habitat. The surveying takes place at dawn in Xochimilco, one of the last vestiges of the ancient lake system of the Basin of Mexico, where plant and animal species that modernity has erased from other parts of Mexico City still survive. It’s a magical oasis in the monster capital that looks like something out of a Mexican fairy tale, where herons and pelicans are heard as the sun comes up. As we travel through the landscape on a wooden raft, we see that the lake is still filled with chinampas, artificial agricultural islands first developed in pre-Hispanic times and which amazed the first Spaniards who came to these lands. They appear in four different colors: wild axolotls have a blackish-brown hue, while mutant variants include leucistic (white with dark eyes), white albino, and golden albino. “So far, we haven’t found any axolotls; however, DNA analysis offers a chance,” says Paola Cervantes, a graduate in earth sciences and part of the UNAM team for this year’s census.</p>

This image generation function has recently become a hot topic for its use in creating Studio Ghibli-style anime style images. There are no such restrictions on paid plans. OpenAI's move to use image generation functions to further spread ChatGPT is merely a new development in the intensifying competition among AI developers. ChatGPT is expected to have around 500 million weekly users, but other AI models are also gaining momentum. In addition to improving task processing and problem solving abilities, AI models are now required to generate content such as images and videos. ChatGPT also has a video generation function called "Sora," but it can only be used with paid accounts. Serena H. Huang, an AI consultant and author of The Inclusion Equation and PhD in Economics, said that Studio Ghibli-style images are also flooded with social media, and is considering the impact of widespread use of image generation tools like OpenAI. "AI image generation is a powerful driving force behind productivity and innovation," Huang told CNET. "It could speed up the content production process, allow for faster marketing material development, and make communication more engaging. He also predicts that services such as Microsoft Copilot, which currently only have simple image generation functions, are likely to be enhanced in the future. "As competition for user acquisition intensifies, there will be remarkable progress," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Words that reflect Brussels' concern for a spiral of retaliation that could damage both economies, at a time when inflation and global instability already represent considerable challenges for international markets. The information translated so far indicate that the Trump plan will provide for differentiated bodies by country, with the declared objective to end those that the White House considers unfair commercial practices by international partners. As Corriere della Sera writes, according to Banca Goldman Sachs on Wednesday 2 April a generalized duty of 15% on imports in the United States may be announced, a measure that would affect European goods for an estimated value of 540 billion dollars. These rates would be added to those already in force of 25% on aluminum and steel, and to those, always 25%, on cars and their components that will enter into force on Thursday. Among the countries that could be most affected include those with which the United States recorded the highest commercial deficits in 2024: China, European Union, Mexico, Vietnam, Ireland, Germany, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India, Thailand, Italy, Switzerland, Malaysia, Indonesia, France, Austria and Sweden. For Italy, concerns mainly concern the wine sector, which exports bottles every year for about 2 billion euros in the USA. According to Corriere da Fonti di Palazzo Chigi, the hope that the new commercial measures will not hit this important voice of Italian exports, but so far from Washington would not have arrived official communications in Rome. So far, Brussels has maintained a prudent approach, preparing countermeasures for a value of 36 billion euros on American goods after the introduction of the duties on steel and aluminum, without however applying them immediately to keep the way of the negotiation open. But any new indiscriminate duties of 15% would require a more incisive response, as Von der Leyen himself clarified. "I want to be clear: Europe has not started this clash. While underlining that the goal remains a negotiating solution, Von der Leyen added firmly: "We don't necessarily want to take revenge, but we have a strong plan to do it if necessary." The European response could go beyond the traditional mutual approach to goods to include services, in particular those of technological scope, scope so far not touched by commercial tensions. According to rumors, Brussels is evaluating the implementation of the so-called anti-coercion tool for economic security, a mechanism that would allow to close the EU market to certain American goods and services and to exclude US companies from participation in public calls or projects financed with the community budget. Von der Leyen has intensified his commitment with leaders of the whole block to guarantee a united front in the response to the White House. If on the one hand the heads of state and government agree that Trump's duties cannot remain unanswered, on the other there is no agreement on which products must be targeted, since many fear that the countermeasures can damage the key sectors of their national economies. The exchange of duties risks triggering a dangerous vicious circle: the increase in import prices could feed inflation both in Europe and in the USA, while companies that decide to absorb extra-tassi would see their profits reduced, with a consequent increase in the risk of recession. The possibility that these two phenomena manifest themselves simultaneously would open a stagflation phase - the combination of economic stagnation and persistent inflation - considered particularly harmful to financial markets in a moment of already high global uncertainty.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>「不動産テック」というトレンドワードが誕生してから10年ほどが経とうしている。矢野経済研究所によると、2022年度の不動産テックの市場規模は前年度比21.1%増の9402億円と推計され、2030年度には2022年度比約2.5倍の2兆3780億円に拡大すると予測されている。

国内の不動産テックを収録する不動産テックカオスマップでは2016年の初版から2024年時点の第10版までサービス数が実に6倍以上に増えている。そうしたなか近年、注目を浴びるのがAIの活用だ。

不動産業界に広がるAIの活用

以前から不動産価格の推定や賃料査定の一部サービスでAIが活用されていたが、「ChatGPT-4」の登場をきっかけに、生成AIを中心としたAIの活用が不動産の世界にも本格的に広がっている（下図参照）。

不動産ビジネスの肝となる用地取得。Penetratorが提供する「WHERE」は、衛星画像からAIによって全世界どこでも、空き家や駐車場や畑など指定した不動産を自動的に識別し、不動産所有者情報をワンクリックで割り出すサービスだ。

従来、紙の地図を見て有望そうな土地を特定し、現地調査をし、法務局で不動産登記情報を見て情報を得ていたものが、同サービスによって、パソコン画面上を操作するだけで不動産所有者情報を得られる。

他にも、オフィスデザインやオフィスレイアウト設計がある。イトーキは、東大発AIスタートアップ企業、燈と共に、オフィスデザイン自動生成AIと関連したアプリケーションを開発している。

オフィスデザイン自動生成AIは、イトーキの社内データベースに蓄積されたオフィスレイアウトなどのデータをもとに、様々なパターンのオフィスを自動でデザインできる。

この生成AIと連携させ、燈のもつ空間スキャン技術を活用し、オフィスデザインを瞬時にシミュレーションすることで、従来は膨大な工数と時間を費やしていたオフィス内の寸法測定などのアナログ作業を大幅に軽減し、オフィスデザインの初期提案をよりスピーディーに行える。

住宅販売時に家具や照明などインテリアで演出するホームステージングでもAIの活用が広がっている。

AIによってバーチャル内見の動画を自動生成し、プロンプト等の指示語から様々な生活スタイルの家具やインテリアなども自動生成するバーチャルステージングが広がっている。

生成AIの登場により、物件の写真さえあれば、あたかも本物のホームステージングのような家具等インテリアを配置した画像や動画を簡単に生成できるため、こうしたサービスは続々登場している。

Webページへの物件掲載においてもAIの活用が進む。

野村不動産ソリューションズの「ノムコム」では、間取り図から部屋の特徴を抽出する「間取図特徴抽出AIモデル」が使われている。これにより、物件情報の登録漏れを防ぎ、業務効率化を実現している。

アットホームが提供する不動産業務総合支援サイト「ATBB」では、AIの活用により物件画像から特長と魅力を読み取り、画像のキャプションを自動生成する機能を搭載している。これにより業務負担を軽減している。

契約書周りもAIによって変化が起きている。

AI契約書レビューサービスは、契約書をアップロードするだけでAIが自動でリーガルチェックを行ってくれるサービスだ。

AIによって時間をかけずに契約書に潜むリスクやインシデントを洗い出し、指摘コメントを受けられる。

なかには、リーガルチェックだけでなく、ドラフトの作成や条文の修正もサポートしてくれる。

AI契約書レビューサービスによって、多くの契約書を扱う不動産業において従来からの課題であった業務の属人化や煩雑なやりとりなど業務を効率化できる。

AIによるチャット系サービスも広がっている（下図参照）。

不動産業はお客様から問い合わせや相談の多い世界だ。

これまでは1件1件、営業担当者が対応していたが、ChatGPTなど自然対話式のAIの登場により、AIによるチャット系サービスに置き換わり始めている。

背景にあるのは、労働集約的な業務による人手不足や24時間対応へのニーズ、LINEなどの浸透によるチャットの一般化だ。

社内文書やノウハウの検索、文書作成やSNS投稿などの社内業務においてもAIの活用が広がっている。

三井不動産株は、全従業員約2,500人を対象に自社特化型AIチャットツール「&Chat」を開発。「&Chat」によって、社員は文章の要約や翻訳、アイデア出しなど日常業務の効率化を実現している。

東急リバブルは、SNS投稿文章の作成業務に生成AIを活用した独自の業務システムを開発。不動産情報の読取・理解からSNS投稿文章の原案作成までを生成AIが担い、それを担当者が修正することで、1件当たり45分の作業時間を10分にまで短縮している。

本気となった国の不動産DXへの取り組み

国も不動産DXへの取り組みに積極的だ。

2020年にスタートした「PLATEAU」は、国土交通省が主導する日本全国の3D都市モデルの整備・オープンデータ化プロジェクトだ。誰もが自由に都市のデータを引き出せるよう、3D都市モデルをオープンデータとして提供している。

「PLATEAU」は、3D都市モデルの整備・活用・オープンデータ化を進めることで、まちづくりのDXや日本全国の都市デジタルツインを実現し、多くの地方公共団体や民間企業らと共にオープンイノベーションを創出している。

2024年にスタートした「不動産情報ライブラリ」も見逃せない。

「不動産情報ライブラリ」は、日本全国の取引価格や成約価格、周辺施設、防災情報、都市計画の情報など不動産取引の際に参考となる様々な情報を重ね合わせて地図上に表示させるWebサービスだ。

かつては「土地総合情報システム」という名前で知られていたが、現在はより広範な不動産情報をカバーし、使いやすく進化している。

注目すべきポイントがAPI公開だ。APIに接続することで、民間企業は自社のITシステムやWebサイトに「不動産情報ライブラリ」のデータを取り込め、その企業は新たな付加価値の高いITシステムやWebサービスを新たに作り出せる。

「不動産ID」の取り組みも進んでいる。

「不動産ID」とは、建物や部屋ごとに番号を振って一意に識別できるようにする制度だ。不動産データや各種データの紐づけるためには、不動産IDが必要不可欠だ。

従来は住所に数字や漢字、かなが交じっているため、表記が揺れやすく、業務の手間やミスが発生しやすかった。

これに対して不動産IDは、法務省の登記情報をもとに17ケタの番号を割り振って一意のIDとしている。

2024年12月からは、日本郵便が持つ郵便受けの所在地情報をもとに割り振った番号のデータベースを不動産IDと紐づけした形での実証実験をスタートさせている。

アナログ的だった業務スタイルがついに変わる

日本生産性本部が2024年12月に発表した日本と海外の労働生産性を比較したレポートによると、日本の不動産業は米国の生産性を100とするならば、わずか31.3と全産業のなかでも低い水準だ。

不動産業の業務は極めて多岐にわたっており、例えば不動産の販売や仲介であれば、来客対応やメール・電話対応、物件や顧客情報の管理、内見や商談・契約の対応、契約書など書類対応、売り上げ管理やアフタフォローなど労働集約的な業務が殆どである。

こうした業務を「紙・電話・FAX」に代表されるようなアナログな業務スタイルで実施していることが、低い労働生産性の要因となっている。

このようにアナログかつ労働集約的な業務の多い不動産業だからこそ、生成AIをはじめとするテクノロジーの活用によって、業務変革やビジネス変革を起こせる大きな伸びしろがある。

国主導の不動産データのオープン化の動きが進みはじめ、様々なシーンで生成AIを中心としたテクノロジーの活用が広がっている。

AIには質の高い膨大なデータが必要不可欠であるため、不動産データのオープン化とAI活用の両輪が揃うことで、より加速度的に広がっていくであろう。

「不動産テック」というトレンドワードが登場して10年。いよいよ日本の不動産DXは次のステージへと進もうとしている。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>「不動産テック」というトレンドワードが誕生してから10年ほどが経とうしている。矢野経済研究所によると、2022年度の不動産テックの市場規模は前年度比21.1%増の9402億円と推計され、2030年度には2022年度比約2.5倍の2兆3780億円に拡大すると予測されている。

国内の不動産テックを収録する不動産テックカオスマップでは2016年の初版から2024年時点の第10版までサービス数が実に6倍以上に増えている。そうしたなか近年、注目を浴びるのがAIの活用だ。

不動産業界に広がるAIの活用

以前から不動産価格の推定や賃料査定の一部サービスでAIが活用されていたが、「ChatGPT-4」の登場をきっかけに、生成AIを中心としたAIの活用が不動産の世界にも本格的に広がっている（下図参照）。

不動産ビジネスの肝となる用地取得。Penetratorが提供する「WHERE」は、衛星画像からAIによって全世界どこでも、空き家や駐車場や畑など指定した不動産を自動的に識別し、不動産所有者情報をワンクリックで割り出すサービスだ。

従来、紙の地図を見て有望そうな土地を特定し、現地調査をし、法務局で不動産登記情報を見て情報を得ていたものが、同サービスによって、パソコン画面上を操作するだけで不動産所有者情報を得られる。

他にも、オフィスデザインやオフィスレイアウト設計がある。イトーキは、東大発AIスタートアップ企業、燈と共に、オフィスデザイン自動生成AIと関連したアプリケーションを開発している。

オフィスデザイン自動生成AIは、イトーキの社内データベースに蓄積されたオフィスレイアウトなどのデータをもとに、様々なパターンのオフィスを自動でデザインできる。

この生成AIと連携させ、燈のもつ空間スキャン技術を活用し、オフィスデザインを瞬時にシミュレーションすることで、従来は膨大な工数と時間を費やしていたオフィス内の寸法測定などのアナログ作業を大幅に軽減し、オフィスデザインの初期提案をよりスピーディーに行える。

住宅販売時に家具や照明などインテリアで演出するホームステージングでもAIの活用が広がっている。

AIによってバーチャル内見の動画を自動生成し、プロンプト等の指示語から様々な生活スタイルの家具やインテリアなども自動生成するバーチャルステージングが広がっている。

生成AIの登場により、物件の写真さえあれば、あたかも本物のホームステージングのような家具等インテリアを配置した画像や動画を簡単に生成できるため、こうしたサービスは続々登場している。

Webページへの物件掲載においてもAIの活用が進む。

野村不動産ソリューションズの「ノムコム」では、間取り図から部屋の特徴を抽出する「間取図特徴抽出AIモデル」が使われている。これにより、物件情報の登録漏れを防ぎ、業務効率化を実現している。

アットホームが提供する不動産業務総合支援サイト「ATBB」では、AIの活用により物件画像から特長と魅力を読み取り、画像のキャプションを自動生成する機能を搭載している。これにより業務負担を軽減している。

契約書周りもAIによって変化が起きている。

AI契約書レビューサービスは、契約書をアップロードするだけでAIが自動でリーガルチェックを行ってくれるサービスだ。

AIによって時間をかけずに契約書に潜むリスクやインシデントを洗い出し、指摘コメントを受けられる。

なかには、リーガルチェックだけでなく、ドラフトの作成や条文の修正もサポートしてくれる。

AI契約書レビューサービスによって、多くの契約書を扱う不動産業において従来からの課題であった業務の属人化や煩雑なやりとりなど業務を効率化できる。

AIによるチャット系サービスも広がっている（下図参照）。

不動産業はお客様から問い合わせや相談の多い世界だ。

これまでは1件1件、営業担当者が対応していたが、ChatGPTなど自然対話式のAIの登場により、AIによるチャット系サービスに置き換わり始めている。

背景にあるのは、労働集約的な業務による人手不足や24時間対応へのニーズ、LINEなどの浸透によるチャットの一般化だ。

社内文書やノウハウの検索、文書作成やSNS投稿などの社内業務においてもAIの活用が広がっている。

The Dark Storm Team, a pro-Palestine hacker group, has claimed responsibility for a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on X on Telegram, but there is no evidence that it was committed by the group. Cloudflare, an internet security company that provides DDoS defense services, notes: "Spoofing a source IP address is not technically difficult. All machines connected to the Internet can send any number of bytes, for example, to set any value in the source IP address field." In fact, spoofing the source IP address is one way to carry out a DDoS attack. "A Twitter ASN (autonomous system number) that the origin server is unprotected (with Cloudflare) has been targeted."

"Cybercriminals offer discounts, loyalty programs, memberships and subscriptions," according to security company Heimdal. The attack on X is unlikely to be caused by DDoS service providers, but it is not an attack that requires sophisticated technical expertise. Blocking traffic from known and rogue ASNs can help you improve security by preventing malicious activities such as spam, botnets, and DDoS attacks. This is achieved through firewalls, security information event management (SIEM) systems, and DNS settings. Malicious ASNs often contain IPs to host phishing websites and malicious files, bots and scanners, according to Akamai, a content delivery network (CDN) company. Possibly malicious ASNs receive more than 5% of all online IPv4 addresses, but more than 2% of their internet traffic. Furthermore, ASNs in the "malicious" category receive more than 18% of Internet traffic, despite being less than 5% of all IPv4 addresses on the Internet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ABM history is the beginning of precision targeting

Account-based marketing (ABM) emerged in the 1990s as a strategy for business (B2B) marketing with corporate customers. Unlike traditional mass marketing, ABM was initially established as an approach to developing individual marketing initiatives, focusing on specific companies (accounts), and attracted attention as a method that allows for high return on investment (ROI) by sending customized messages to target accounts.

This marketing method is known as "precision targeting" (hyperprecision targeting), and has begun the method of delivering the most suitable advertising and promotions to the target audience. Precision targeting improves advertising click-through rates and conversion rates, contributes to customer re-engagement, increases engagement and lifetime value, and enables marketing to be more efficient.

As the 2000s began, ABM became even more refined with the evolution of customer relationship management (CRM) systems and marketing automation (MA) tools. Companies will be able to integrate customer data and adopt a more personalized approach.

However, in reality, despite its ideal, a packaged CRM requires the support of a large consultant, or it is not easy to meet the needs of individual companies due to packaging constraints, and sometimes the development of scratch costs can be incurred, resulting in many manual processes, making it extremely difficult to deploy large scale.

The transition and challenges to data-driven marketing

Currently, ABM is becoming more advanced with advances in digital technology. With the use of AI and big data analytics, businesses can understand intent data that indicates potential customers' purchasing intentions and take a more precise approach. On the other hand, there are several challenges when looking ahead to ABM.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>地域活性化が叫ばれて久しいが、その軸の一つとなるのがシステム全般のデジタルトランスフォーメーション（DX）だ。福島市の観光地域づくりを推進している法人（DMO）福島市観光コンベンション協会（福島市）も、DXに取り組みながら観光ウェブメディア「福島市観光ノート」などを展開しているが、その実情はどうなっているのだろうか。本稿では、宿泊施設向けITソリューションを展開するtripla（トリプラ）の代表取締役CEOの高橋和久が、地方都市の観光業におけるDXについて解説する。

triplaではホテル予約エンジンやAIチャットボットなどを提供しており、企業が抱えるさまざまな課題解決をサポートしている。当社がサポートしている福島市観光コンベンション協会の場合、運営しているメディア福島市観光ノートのアクセス数をアップさせられても、観光スポットや宿泊施設の紹介コンテンツと化し、宿泊予約に関しては、オンライン旅行代理店（OTA）頼みになり、シームレスな予約導線を確保できていなかったことが課題となっていた。



「福島市観光ノート」 「福島市観光ノート」

福島市観光コンベンション協会 データサイエンティスト コンテンツマーケターの三宅晃司氏は「民間のOTAは、集客効果はあるものの、どうしても手数料がかさむ。また継続的に利用することで地域外にお金が流れてしまう。そこで自社で予約システムを確立し、地域にお金を再還元する流れを作ることにつながっていく」と明かしているが、実はほかにも課題があった。

同協会では福島市の宿泊施設の利用者に対するアンケートやふるさと納税制度の利用者のデータを保有しており、顧客情報やマーケティング材料となる膨大なデータを蓄積していたものの、有効活用ができていなかったという。

そもそも福島市観光コンベンション協会は、福島市観光ノートの運用のほか、福島市へのふるさと納税の事務局全般や、福島市内の宿泊施設の利用者に対するアンケートを実施している。いうなれば、宿泊施設の利用者のみならず、ふるさと納税制度の利用者など福島市に興味関心がある層のデータを持ち、「デスティネーション（旅行の目的地）マーケティング」に有効活用できる材料を持ち合わせている状態だった。

そのため、福島市観光コンベンション協会では、福島市観光ノートの発信力や、保有する顧客データを活用し、福島市観光ノート上で宿泊予約であったり、一人ひとりに応じたレコメンドを掲出したりできる、DMO版のOTAの構築を目指した。

データ取得からOTA事業までを担うDMOとは

同協会がこれらのデータを所持しているのは、DMOであるからだ。DMOは観光庁から情報や人材、財源などさまざまな支援を受けられ、OTA機能も観光庁の調査事業に協力するという意味合いから保持している。そうした取り組みについて、三宅氏は次のように説明した。

「今回のDMO版OTA事業は、国と福島市がやりたいと思っていたマーケティング強化の方向性が合致して実現に至った。DMO版OTAをはじめとした事業の根底には、観光産業のDX推進に関わるマーケティング強化があって、例えば観光庁が課題を提示して、どう解決していくかされわれがアイデアを出すケースもある」

なお、今回活用した観光庁の調査事業において重視する項目の一つに「汎用（はんよう）性」があったというが、三宅氏は「我々がトリプラとともに作り上げたDMO版OTAが、ほかのDMOでも使えるような汎用性があることがポイントになると考えた。それがやがて業界全体、そして日本のためになっていく。それこそが国が求める汎用性なのではないか」と解釈したという。

今後はOTAなどで集めたデータを基に、「福島が好きな人」に対して的確にアプローチしていく予定だという。クーポンの配布や観光に関するおすすめ情報の提供のほか、宿泊施設を予約する時に、通常予約に加えてふるさと納税制度を活用する選択肢も設け、宿泊代金の一部をふるさと納税制度でまかなうような形も検討中で、観光業の活性化と地域貢献の両立を目指している。

今回のDMO版OTAの構築に当たり、同協会が地域の宿泊施設とコミュニケーションをとる中で、大きく分けて3つのマーケティング傾向があると感じたそうだ。

「1つ目は、ある程度の規模がある大きな旅館などにはマーケティング担当者がいて、担当者が自分でシステムの管理や設定ができるレベルのITリテラシーを持っているため、比較的スムーズにマーケティング戦略やDXを進められているケース。2つ目は、代表者がマーケティングも担当していて、ほかの業務が忙しいためにマーケティングにまで手が回らず、繁忙期または閑散期でも適切な値段設定ができていないため、顧客へのアプローチなども後回しになっているケース。3つ目はマーケティングに対する知識が全くないという理由から、すべて外注しているケース。この場合はプロに任せられるものの、手数料がかさんでしまいがちで、自社でやろうと考えてもスイッチングコストがかかったり、契約期間の縛りがあったりして、やめにくいというデメリットがある」

同協会では特に2つ目、3つ目のケースに対して、宿泊施設側にDX推進のためのシステム導入などもサポートしており、福島市観光ノートをOTAとして活用することを提案している。

同メディアを通して予約を受けることによって予約情報が福島市のデータとして蓄積され、さらに宿泊施設はこれまで他社のOTAに支払っていた費用が抑えられ、余った費用を広告費などに充てられ、集客につなげられる。地域と宿泊施設の双方にとっての好循環となっていくだろう。

「お客さまを呼んでくれる」ではだめ、宿泊施設に求められる意識改革

とはいえその道のりは簡単ではない。宿泊施設が、同協会のような観光協会に対してネガティブなイメージを持っていたり、そもそも外部からのアドバイスに抵抗を感じたりする場合もある。

福島市のみならず、その地方ならではの商慣習から抜け出すことは難しく、新しいものを取り入れるのが難しいという例は珍しくないと、三宅氏は明かす。

「自分たちで集客するよりも、OTAや旅行会社がお客さまを呼んでくれるという認識を持っている宿泊施設はいまだに存在する。その場合、顧客ターゲットやペルソナがそもそも定まっておらず、カスタマージャーニーマップもまとまっていないため、ゆえに客層に合わせたマーケティングもできない。ただ単にお客さまが宿泊して終わりではなく、宿泊施設として今後どうなっていきたいか、そのためにどんな施策が必要なのかを自分たちで考えなければならないという意識を持つことで、DXの必要性やマーケティング戦略の重要性を実感することにも結びついていくかもしれない」

なお、福島市観光ノートは年間400万PVという実績があり、広告プラットフォームとしての基盤は十分。OTAとしての機能のほか、観光にまつわる情報、ふるさと納税制度の返礼品といった地域の名産品にかかわる情報などを網羅的に発信することにより、地域の観光業、ひいては地域全体を盛り上げることになっていくだろう。

同協会では、これからも福島市との連携により力を入れ、市が行うキャンペーンやイベントとの連動企画や、キャンペーンやイベント参加者のデータを宿泊施設のマーケティングに生かすことなども考えているという。地域経済の持続的な発展のキーワードとなっている「官民連携」と「DX」だが、同協会が旅行業界におけるモデルケースを提示してくれる日が待ち遠しい。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Honda's motorsport division must be doing some spring cleaning. Today, the Honda Racing Corporation announced that it's getting into the memorabilia business, offering up parts and even whole vehicles for fans and collectors. And to kick things off, it's going to auction some components from the RA100E V10 engines that powered the McLaren Honda MP4/5Bs of Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger to both F1 titles in 1990.

"We aim to make this a valuable business that allows fans who love F1, MotoGP and various other races to share in the history of Honda's challenges in racing since the 1950s," said Koi Watanabe, president of HRC, "including our fans to own a part of Honda's racing history is not intended to be a one-time endeavor, but rather a continuous business that we will nurture and grow."

The bits from Senna's and Berger's V10s will go up for auction at Monterey Car Week later this year, and the lots will include some of the parts seen in the photo above: cam covers, camshafts, pistons, and conrods, with a certificate of authenticity and a display case. And HRC is going through its collections to see what else it might part with, including "heritage machines and parts" from IndyCar, and "significant racing motorcycles."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several top scientists charged with overseeing research into disease prevention and cures at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were notified that they were subject to a reduction in force on Tuesday as part of a devastating purge of federal employees carried out by US Health and Human Services secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., WIRED has learned. Among them is Dr. Richard Youle, a leading researcher in the field of neurodegenerative disorders previously awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his groundbreaking research identifying mechanisms behind Parkinson’s disease. HHS did not respond to WIRED's questions about the firings of NIH scientists. Vianca Rodriguez, an agency spokesperson, pointed to previous statements by Secretary Kennedy, including plans announced last week to eliminate 1,200 NIH jobs in areas of procurement, human resources, and communications. At an NINDS town hall meeting on Tuesday, leadership at that institute expressed confusion about the cuts, saying they were blindsided by firings of principal investigators, or PIs, who lead research teams. “To get rid of 11 of our senior PIs … we’re hoping that’s a mistake, because we can’t figure out why they would want to do that,” said Walter Koroshetz, director of the NINDS, according to a source present at the meeting. It is unclear, NIH staff said, what the plans are for the data they've accumulated or what will happen to patients involved in ongoing trials. An email sent out Tuesday to more than 2,000 recent college graduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows working at NIH seems to confirm the firings of multiple PIs. The NIH supports young researchers through various programs, typically temporary one- or two-years fellowships. In her email, Milgram tells fellows with NIH’s postbaccalaureate, cancer research, and visiting fellows programs whose PI received an RIF notice, “I can assure you that your fellowship appointment is not immediately terminated and that we will work with each of you to explore reassignment options soon.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Back in 2016, the original Nintendo Switch felt like a revelation. A home console you could pull out of its dock and carry with you — it was weird, playful, and perfectly Nintendo. Nearly a decade later, today’s announcement of the Switch 2 proves that Nintendo still plays by its own rules, taking its sweet time while the rest of the industry sprints on an annual hamster wheel. Just a quietly confident YouTube video showing off the hardware in clean, minimalist shots, motion graphics, and those now-iconic silhouetted hands. Yet, within hours, the video racked up half a million views. The original Switch, despite being underpowered compared to the PlayStation and Xbox crowd, remained sold out for nearly a year post-launch. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate — these games still feel fresh to new players and veterans alike. The Switch 2 does bring upgrades, but you won’t find Nintendo trying to win a teraflop arms race. The handheld now sports a 7.9-inch 1080p LCD with HDR and up to 120fps refresh rates. Dock it, and you’ll get up to 4K resolution, complete with a much-needed cooling fan to keep things stable during long sessions of Metroid Prime 4. Internally, it bumps up to 256GB of storage (though you’ll need MicroSD Express cards for expansion). Game Cards are sticking around but have been updated for faster read speeds — a quiet nod to physical media diehards. A microphone tucked into the top picks up voices clearly, even with background noise, and screen-sharing lets you show off your gameplay to friends in real time. This mechanic already fuels new games like Drag x Drive, a Rocket League meets NBA Jam mashup that uses dual-mouse controls for surprisingly fluid movement and shooting. Even existing titles like Mario Party Jamboree and Metroid Prime 4 will take advantage of this feature, with players able to aim and interact more intuitively. And while the visual uplift is nice — Zelda titles, for example, will get free 4K-enhanced “Switch 2 Editions” for Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers — it’s the longevity of software that steals the spotlight. Nintendo’s library ages like fine wine, and the Switch 2 respects that. You don’t have to repurchase everything; upgrade packs and enhanced editions are available, extending the life of beloved games without forcing you to start over. Launching June 5th, it brings along heavy-hitters like Mario Kart World, featuring 24-player races and free-roam tracks. Plus, GameCube classics like F-Zero GX and The Wind Waker are returning, playable through the Switch 2’s online service — complete with a retro-inspired wireless GameCube controller. Where competitors race to push out yearly hardware iterations wrapped in billion-dollar spectacles, Nintendo is content releasing something only when it’s ready.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo unveiled new details on Wednesday about its hugely anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 gaming console, which will be the company’s first new console since the Nintendo Switch was introduced in 2017. The Nintendo Switch 2 will be released on June 5 and cost $450. At launch, the console will arrive both on its own and as part of a bundle with Mario Kart World, a new game for the Switch 2. The device has a 1080p LCD screen that supports up to 120fps, as well as HDR — that could be a disappointment for users who got accustomed to their upgraded OLED Nintendo Switches. It will also only support microSD express cards for additional storage, however, which are a new kind of microSD card. The classic colorway for the Nintendo Switch 2 is matte black with light red and blue accents on each respective Joy-Con, nodding to its previous design but in a sleeker format. But we’re willing to wager that Nintendo will let you buy as many Joy-Cons as you want in every color you can imagine — and hopefully, this time around, there’s not a drift issue. The Joy-Cons will also function like a computer mouse for compatible games. With the gyroscope features, players can have more control over motion controls. To get users acquainted with the new Nintendo Switch 2 functions, there will be a Welcome Tour game that explains the device, and it’ll cost money, which is probably better spent on Mario Kart World. To sweeten the deal, Nintendo Online will now allow players to revisit GameCube games, in addition to its existing ports of Nintendo 64 and Game Boy games, including Fire Emblem Path of Radiance, Super Mario Strikers, Luigi’s Mansion, Pokémon XD, and others. Some titles will be available the day the Switch 2 comes out, along with a remade GameCube controller — which, don’t worry, comes with a C button. Many fans theorized about a C button that appears on the Joy-Cons, which Nintendo confirmed today to be GameChat, a feature that allows you to communicate with friends while playing the game. Your voice is recognized by a microphone in the system, supposedly making it possible to hear people if they’re in a loud room. Users can also share their game screens within the console, even if they are playing different games. The right Joy-Con has another C button that can be used for other chat functions, including muting your microphone if you need to do something else. GameChat will be available for all users until March 31, 2026, but after that, you will need to have a paid online membership to use it. Nintendo briefly mentioned that parental controls will be accessible on GameChat, but didn’t provide further details. Nintendo announced the Nintendo Switch Camera, which can attach to the console and transpose your face on top of your game, perfect for GameChat. Nintendo showed an example of the camera in which people play Mario Party together, and players’ faces appear in speech bubbles next to their characters, showing their reactions to the games. These new features will be backward-compatible with certain games, including Mario Party Jamboree. Of course, there will also be a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, which includes the new C button. Which games will be available for Nintendo Switch 2? There’s a large map of various regions and courses, but in a free drive mode, you can drive around wherever you may please — in single or multi-player — without the threat of a red shell lurking around every corner. The Switch 2 will support games from other developers — some in development and others already released. These include Hades II, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Street Fighter, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4, Yakuza 0, Borderlands 4, Enter the Gungeon 2, Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition, a Final Fantasy VII remake, Silksong, and others. There will also be a new game in the Zelda universe called Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, which is a prequel to Tears of the Kingdom. It’s expected to come out this winter. Donkey Kong Bananza, a new Switch 2 game, will launch on July 17, 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle, which includes the system and a full game download for the exclusive Mario Kart World game, will launch on June 5! April 2 (UPI) -- Nintendo has announced it will launch its new Switch 2 console on June 5. The Switch 2 will be available to purchase for $449, or in a $499 bundle that includes new title Mario Kart World, according to a press release. The Switch 2 features a 7.9 inch screen that can enjoy games in greater detail with 4K resolution when docked and connected to a television. Nintendo is also introducing a voice chat system that can be accessed by pressing a new "C" button on the Joy-Con 2. The voice chat system can also be used with a new camera peripheral (sold separately), or another compatible USB-C camera. The camera can show each players face while in a group chat, or be used with certain games such as Super Mario Party Jamboree. Games coming to the Switch 2 console include a new entry in the popular Mario Kart series titled Mario Kart World, which will be released on June 5. Mario Kart World features interconnected tracks that range from vast deserts to snowy mountains and city landscapes. The game also includes a free roam mode and a new mechanic where Mario and his friends can grind on rails and ride on walls with their cars. Nintendo additionally teased Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, a new game from famed studio FromSoftware titled The Duskbloods that is coming in 2026, a new Kirby game titled Kirby AirRiders, and an open-world Donkey Kong game titled Donkey Kong Bananza that will be released on July 17.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To recap: Rippling, a workforce management platform, very publicly announced last week that it was suing Deel over this alleged spying, leveling charges ranging from violation of the RICO racketeering act (often used to prosecute members of the Mafia) to misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition. That changed on Wednesday, when it released the affidavit signed April 1. In early 2024, he interviewed for a job at Deel and didn’t get it, but did, he testified, connect with Deel’s founder over LinkedIn. The employee later started a payroll consulting business, pitched Deel on working with him and eventually told them he planned to quit Rippling to work full time on it. O’Brien testified that they offered to pay him €5,000 per month, with the first payment at US$6,000, and later transactions in crypto. O’Brien testified that he conducted searches on Slack, Google Drive, and other Rippling resources for information and communicated to his contacts at Deel via Telecom. He turned over information on sales leads, product roadmaps, customer accounts, names of superstar employees, info on sanctioned countries, and whatever else was asked for, O’Brien testified. The lawsuit alleges that the spying took place for four months and says that in just a single day, he shared information about hundreds of companies that requested a Rippling demo, hundreds of notes about prospects from sales people, and details on Deel customers that Rippling was talking to. In its lawsuit, Rippling says the company set a trap to out the spy by sending a threatening legal letter to Deel’s leadership. The letter said that Rippling employees were talking about information that would embarrass Deel if made public in a Slack channel called “d-defectors.” The Slack channel existed but it was a ruse, the lawsuit said. (It says something about the relationship between these two companies that Rippling’s lawyer would even send such a letter, even as a ploy, and that it would be believed.) O’Brien was, however, apparently busted by searching that Slack channel. O’Brien, now panicked, immediately exchanged messages with Deel’s CEO and others that O’Brien believed to be lawyers for Deel, the affidavit said. One of them even suggested flying O’Brien and his family to Dubai, according to the affidavit, because of the extradition policies there. Deel did not respond to our request for comment, nor has its CEO responded on X. But after the initial complaint was filed last week, Deel told TechCrunch via a spokesperson: “Weeks after Rippling is accused of violating sanctions law in Russia and seeding falsehoods about Deel, Rippling is trying to shift the narrative with these sensationalized claims. We deny all legal wrongdoing and look forward to asserting our counterclaims.” However, Rippling’s attorney believes they’ve got a “smoking gun.“ The highest levels of Deel’s leadership are implicated in a brazen corporate espionage scheme, and they will be held accountable,” Alex Spiro, legal counsel for Rippling, told TechCrunch. Eynat Guez, CEO of another Deel competitor, global payments platform Papaya Global, tweeted, “As far as we know, this is not a one-off incident. Thank you @parkerconrad for taking the initiative and ending this practice.” Last year Rippling launched a marketing campaign called “Snake Game” that pitted itself against its rival.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo has finally peeled back the curtain on its highly anticipated Switch 2 console. Regional pricing wasn’t specified, so we’ll update this story once that information becomes available. Outside of that, Nintendo provided more detail about the hardware itself, following a brief tease in January. As previously confirmed, the Switch 2 will sport a design that’s largely similar to the original Switch, with some key changes. MicroSD Express cards are the only supported method of external storage; existing Switch microSDs aren’t compatible. These new Joy-Cons also feature bigger trigger buttons and the previously rumoured mouse-like functionality. That latter feature means that you can put the Joy-Con on a flat surface and scroll it around like a mouse. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which is releasing on Switch and also getting a Switch 2 edition, will feature mouse controls for the first-person shooting. Elsewhere, there’s a new ‘C’ button on the right Joy-Con that is centred around party features. This includes “GameChat,” which allows you to talk with friends and family while playing through a built-in mic on the Switch 2. You can also share your game screen with the C button. To accompany these new social features, Nintendo will also release a standalone camera. This camera will be available on the Switch 2 launch day. A new Pro controller will also be released with the C button as well as new customizable triggers on the back. It should be noted, however, that Nintendo didn’t explicitly address whether the Switch 2’s new Joy-Cons have been designed to address the “drift” issues that plagued some of the Switch’s Joy-Cons. Finally, another new teased Switch 2 feature is GameShare, which allows one user to share select games with up to three other systems. Some of the supported titles include Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury, Super Mario Odyssey and Captain Toad’s Treasure Tracker. For all of our Nintendo Switch 2 Direct content, follow this link. It does also support 120fps gameplay, but at lower resolutions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When OpenAI unveiled its o3 “reasoning” AI model in December, the company partnered with the creators of ARC-AGI, a benchmark designed to test highly capable AI, to showcase o3’s capabilities. Last week, the Arc Prize Foundation, which maintains and administers ARC-AGI, updated its approximate computing costs for o3. The revision is notable because it illustrates just how expensive today’s most sophisticated AI models may end up being for certain tasks, at least early on. OpenAI has yet to price o3 — or release it, even. But the Arc Prize Foundation believes OpenAI’s o1-pro model pricing is a reasonable proxy. For context, o1-pro is OpenAI’s most expensive model to date. “But this is still a proxy, and we’ve kept o3 labeled as preview on our leaderboard to reflect the uncertainty until official pricing is announced.” In early March, The Information reported that the company may be planning to charge up to $20,000 per month for specialized AI “agents,” like a software developer agent. Some might argue that even OpenAI’s priciest models will cost well under what a typical human contractor or staffer would command. For example, o3 high needed 1,024 attempts at each task in ARC-AGI to achieve its best score.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com, Tumblr, WooCommerce, and a range of other online services, is reducing its workforce. The layoffs will impact 16% of staff across divisions, an Automattic blog post published Wednesday reveals. However, the move also comes after a tumultuous year for Automattic, which has engaged in a controversial legal battle with hosting company WP Engine. In Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg’s opinion, hosting provider WP Engine did not sufficiently contribute to the open source project WordPress.org, and its use of the “WP” brand was confusing consumers about its affiliation with WordPress itself. In Wednesday’s announcement, Mullenweg explained that the newly announced layoffs will allow Automattic to become “more agile and responsive,” “break down silos that have created inefficiencies,” “focus on product quality,” and “ensure a viable financial model for long-term success.” “To support our customers and products, we must improve our productivity, profitability, and capacity to invest,” reads the post, authored by Mullenweg. “Automattic has multiple products with world-touching potential in WordPress and beyond. I’m confident we will come out of this situation in a better position, poised to create a vibrant, profitable, well-designed company that will continue our mission to democratize the internet,” Mullenweg wrote. The news follows Automattic’s cancellation of its annual “Grand Meetup” company retreat for 2025, a source also told us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three months after officially announcing the long-rumored Switch 2, Nintendo has revealed when you'll be able to buy the follow-up to its hugely popular hybrid game system -- and the good news is you won't have long to wait. Nintendo Switch 2 will hit store shelves in the United States on June 5, priced at $449.99, and it’s coming with a bunch of changes that might surprise longtime fans. One notable upgrade is the new pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers. These don’t just slide into place anymore -- they attach magnetically. Even more interesting, each one can apparently function as a mouse in certain games. While that sounds cool in theory, we’ll have to wait and see how well it actually works in practice. Nintendo is also promising faster performance and a more colorful gaming experience, thanks to a bigger screen and beefed-up internals. And yes, it still supports multiplayer with those detachable controllers. In the box, buyers will get the Nintendo Switch 2 console, a pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers, Joy-Con 2 Grip, Joy-Con 2 Straps, Nintendo Switch 2 Dock, Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable, AC Adapter, and a USB-C Charging Cable. Nintendo is also releasing a launch bundle for fans of its most popular racing franchise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While to some it may look like AI is headed in a similar direction, the founders of Parasail think AI infrastructure will look very different — and are betting their company’s fate on it. Parasail works with dozens of providers to deliver on-demand GPUs for companies and enterprises looking to build AI models and applications. Parasail gives customers access to hardware, including Nvidia’s H100, H200, A100, and 4090 GPUs, at a fraction of the cost that incumbents charge, according to the company. “There’s basically three cloud vendors who run the internet, and that isn’t exactly how the internet is being rebuilt when you look at AI,” Tim Harris, one of Parasail’s co-founders and the CEO of Swift Navigation, told TechCrunch. The compute is much more fungible and fluid, so you can actually inherently run it in a more horizontal nature, and that’s really what we were trying to do.” Harris added, “We didn’t want a world where AI was controlled from soup to nuts by the hyperscalers.” Henry, the former CPO of Groq, told TechCrunch that he had spent a long time thinking about what it would take to build AI infrastructure that could compete with Nvidia. “They’re barely keeping up with the open source model releases alone.” Sure, all these vendors provide GPUs and AI infrastructure, Henry said, but he thinks the proprietary technology Parasail has running under the hood helps it stand out. This tech is what connects Parasail’s GPUs from various sources. Wednesday marks the official launch of its platform, but Parasail is already working with dozens of customers, including Elicit, Weights & Biases, and Rasa. There is reason to believe that it will, but there are also signs — like Microsoft canceling some of its data center contracts — that the predictions around needed AI infrastructure may be a bit overblown. “We see literally no end [to] the demand,” Harris said. The models now are getting to a place where [companies] can just grab open source models and pretty much run them, but then being able to get access to GPUs, access to data centers, all the optimizations… we can do that with a click of a button.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Trump took office in January, a lot of users were confused as to why they were suddenly following President Trump on Facebook and Instagram when they hadn’t explicitly requested to do so. At the time, Meta explained this was part of a regular process in which White House social media accounts, including their followers, are handed over to the new administration when a new president takes office. Usha Vance is obtaining the former Second Gentleman’s Instagram followers now because the White House only recently created her @SLOTUS account, according to Meta. The first post on the Second Lady’s Instagram account is dated March 10, and Meta says she does not have an official Facebook account at this time. Be aware that if you try to unfollow @SLOTUS on Instagram, your request may not immediately go through. Meta says it may “take some time” to process follow and unfollow requests around the @SLOTUS account during this transition. It seems likely that users flood Meta with a barrage of follow and unfollow requests in these account transitions, which slows things down. Meta insists it never forces users to “auto-follow” accounts without a user’s consent. Many users forget they ever followed an official White House account in the first place, especially if they had done so four years ago when the previous administration took office. However, it becomes much more evident which White House accounts you’re following when the new administration, which may not be the party you voted for, takes over.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. Nonetheless, TikTok’s future remains uncertain, and a potential second ban on April 5 is looming. A number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app, and if a deal were to go through, the platform’s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of $60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research’s senior vice president, Angelo Zino. To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations. The drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. Shortly after, President Joe Biden signed the bill requiring TikTok to be sold or banned. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok. In January, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as “the TikTok ban.” TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19. Although TikTok indeed shut itself down in the U.S. when the act came into effect, it didn’t last long. The app came back online less than 12 hours later. On January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. No definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon. Below is a list of the investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok’s U.S. operations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new tier is aimed at higher education, and gives students, faculty, and other staff access to Anthropic’s AI chatbot, Claude, with a few additional capabilities. One piece of Claude for Education is “Learning Mode,” a new feature within Claude Projects to help students develop their own critical thinking skills, rather than simply obtain answers to questions. With Learning Mode enabled, Claude will ask questions to test understanding, highlight fundamental principles behind specific problems, and provide potentially useful templates for research papers, outlines, and study guides. Anthropic has historically tended to match OpenAI’s offerings, and this launch is no exception. In a press release shared with TechCrunch ahead of launch, Anthropic said university administrators can use Claude to analyze enrollment trends and automate repetitive email responses to common inquiries. The AI startup is also teaming up with Internet2, a nonprofit organization that delivers cloud solutions for colleges. Anthropic says that it has already struck “full campus agreements” with Northeastern University, the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Champlain College to make Claude for Education available to all students. Northeastern is a design partner — Anthropic says it’s working with the institution’s students, faculty, and staff to build best practices for AI integration, AI-powered education tools, and frameworks. Anthropic hopes to strike more of these contracts, in part through new student ambassador and AI “builder” programs, to capitalize on the growing number of students using AI in their studies. A 2024 survey from the Digital Education Council found that 54% of university students use generative AI every week. Research is mixed, with some studies finding that AI can be a helpful tutor and others suggesting it might harm critical thinking skills.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The fediverse, also known as the open social web that includes Mastodon, Meta’s Threads, Pixelfed, and other apps, is ramping up its security. On Wednesday, a nonprofit focused on bringing governance to open source projects, the Nivenly Foundation, announced the launch of a new security fund that will pay those who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities that affect fediverse apps and services. While all software can have security issues, Mastodon — an open source and decentralized alternative to X — has fixed numerous bugs over the years, leading to the need for such a program. Another issue found in the fediverse is that many servers are run by independent operators who don’t necessarily have a security background or understand best practices. Already, the Nivenly Foundation has helped a few fediverse projects set up their basic security vulnerability reporting process, and now it’s looking to distribute small payouts to anyone who responsibly discloses other security vulnerabilities that may still be in the wild. The payouts will total $250 for vulnerabilities with a vulnerability severity score (known as CVSS) of 7.0-8.9 and $500 for more critical vulnerabilities with a CVSS score of 9.0 or greater. A more recent issue came about when Pixelfed’s creator, Daniel Supernault made the details of a vulnerability public before server operators had a chance to update, which would have left the fediverse vulnerable to bad actors, she says. (Supernault has already apologized publicly for his handling of the issue that had affected private accounts.) “We came across several projects that just said ‘file security vulnerabilities in our public issue tracker,’ which absolutely isn’t safe, as any malicious actor watching that repository would now be able to attack instances of that software,” she added. However, this requires that project leads understand security best practices. In the case of the Pixelfed issue, for instance, the Hachyderm Mastodon server, which has over 9,500 members, decided it needed to defederate (or disconnect from) other Pixelfed servers that hadn’t been updated in order to protect their users.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senior members of the Trump administration’s National Security Council — including its top national security adviser, Michael Waltz — used Gmail to conduct government business, The Washington Post reported, citing documents and three unnamed government officials.

The report follows last week’s news that several cabinet-level officials, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, discussed highly sensitive war plans in a Signal group chat that also inadvertently included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.

Per The Washington Post, an aide to Waltz used the consumer version of Gmail, which is not cleared for government use, to discuss “highly technical conversations with colleagues at other government agencies involving sensitive military positions and powerful weapons systems relating to an ongoing conflict.”

As for the national security adviser himself, Waltz had “less sensitive, but potentially exploitable information” sent to his personal Gmail account, such as schedules and work documents, the report cited the officials as saying.

According to the Post, the officials described the national security adviser’s use of personal Gmail accounts as “problematic handling” of information.

A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately return a request for comment on the report.

Hackers, including those backed by nation states, frequently target the personal Gmail accounts of government officials with phishing attacks to obtain and steal information. In 2019, Microsoft found that Iran-backed hackers were targeting the personal email accounts associated with Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign. Security researchers later found evidence that China was targeting the personal accounts of Biden presidential campaign staff during the 2020 election.

In 2012, former CIA chief David Petraeus was found to have used a shared Gmail account to share draft messages with his biographer, with whom he was having an affair. Petraeus was spared jail after later pleading guilty to improperly retaining highly sensitive information in eight notebooks that he gave to the biographer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patreon, a subscription platform for online creators, has signed podcasting partnerships with Sony Music Entertainment and Amazon’s Wondery, the company announced on Wednesday.

Patreon says the partnerships are designed to make the site a home to fan engagement and exclusive perks for shows from major podcast networks, as the company looks to expand beyond its current base of podcasts.

The deal means that Patreon will now offer some of the podcasting industry’s big names on its platform. The addition of bigger partners will allow Patreon to stand out among other platforms that also support podcasts. As for Sony and Wondery, the partnership allows them to bring their content to more people to expand the reach of their podcasts.

As a result of the partnerships, select podcasts from Sony Music and Wondery will be available on Patreon, including: “Getting Better with Jonathan Van Ness,” “Lipstick on the Rim,” and “This Is History” from Sony Music; and “Scamfluencers,” “Killer Psyche,” and “Kurt Krömer – Feelings” from Wondery.

Patreon said podcasters on its platform earned more than $472 million from over 6.7 million paid memberships last year, making podcasting the single highest-earning category of creativity on the platform.

“From independent shows to networks, podcasters are choosing Patreon because it’s a place where they can share their work directly with their audiences, reach new fans, deepen connections with existing members, manage their businesses, and ultimately earn more money – all under one roof,” the company wrote in a blog post.

Patreon plans to add more podcasting partners in the future, it says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Redwood Materials has been on an expansion tear in recent years — growth that has extended the lithium-ion battery recycling and materials startup’s footprint well beyond its Carson City, Nevada headquarters as it locked up deals with Toyota, Panasonic, and GM, started construction on a South Carolina factory, and made an acquisition in Europe. And yet, Redwood Materials CTO Colin Campbell saw a gap in the company’s 1,100-person workforce. San Francisco was the answer, Campbell told TechCrunch, a longtime Tesla veteran who took the top tech spot in August 2023. The company, which was founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, is filling that gap with a new research and development center in San Francisco. The 15,000-square-foot facility located in the city’s Design District is equipped with lab space to support engineers who will eventually work on every point of the battery ecosystem, from chemical engineering and cathode science to software and electrical engineering. But Campbell expects it will eventually employ about 50 or more people. “We had a really good year, and we had great revenue,” Campbell said, adding that the company has been limited by its ability to expand. “And what’s limiting our ability to expand the engineering team is hiring. High on the list is deep talent pool of hardware and software engineers who are in the Bay Area, he added. Cathode foils, which account for more than half the cost of a battery cell, contain lithium, nickel, and cobalt. Redwood is able to capture all of those materials through its battery recycling and processing. “A major part of why they (factories) are hard to build in the U.S. is that the U.S. doesn’t have the industrial base to make a bunch of this machinery, and in particular, to make novel and cost-effective machinery,” he said. “So novel process equipment engineering is a big piece of it.” Campbell added that he didn’t think diagnosis would be a majority business for Redwood, but that it fits into the company’s overall ethos. “We have this constitutional distaste for retiring things before they need to be retired,” he said. “So even if it’s not a major part of the business, it’s the right thing to do for this ecosystem.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI sales rep startups are a very crowded market these days. Gupta claims classic AI sales reps aren’t the right approach, telling TechCrunch they’ve “failed” by focusing too much “pure volume” — that means contacting as many potential customers as possible. Founded in 2022, Actively AI argues it has a different approach. It’s a new way of leveraging reasoning tech, a technique that’s taken the AI world by storm by forcing AI models to flesh out their logic and double-check their work. The New York-based startup has now raised $17.5 million in Series A funding from Bain Capital Ventures, it exclusively told TechCrunch. “We call it ‘GTM Superintelligence’—a reasoning-driven approach that doesn’t just automate or assist, but actively makes the best possible decisions to drive growth,” Actively’s CEO (and other co-founder) Mihir Garimella said in a statement. Both founders previously studied AI at Stanford, with Garimella focusing on a field closely related to reasoning called active learning, giving Actively its name. Actively’s fundraise is the latest evidence that the boom in reasoning models could be spreading beyond foundational AI companies like OpenAI or DeepSeek to startups. That startup, Taxo, said it had passed $1 million ARR in six months. (Actively declined to share its exact ARR, but said it has grown tenfold in nine months.) It’s still a bit early to tell whether Actively’s reasoning-powered approach will work as advertised, or if this will become just a new spin on AI sales tools. After all, reasoning only really took off late last year with the rise of DeepSeek. For now, though, some investors are certainly buying the pitch.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As it prepares to transition from a nonprofit corporation to a for-profit, OpenAI says it’s convening a group of experts to “help OpenAI’s philanthropy understand the most urgent and intractable problems nonprofits face today.”

This group, which OpenAI says will incorporate feedback from “leaders and communities” in health, science, education, and public services, particularly within OpenAI’s home state of California, will be announced in April and submit insights to OpenAI’s board of directors in the next 90 days.

“[T]he Board will consider these insights in its ongoing work to evolve the OpenAI nonprofit well before the end of 2025,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “The Board recognizes the importance of engaging with the philanthropic community and those closest to the work to help inform how OpenAI’s philanthropy can best deploy its potentially historic resources.”

OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies, including Microsoft.

OpenAI today has a for-profit org controlled by a nonprofit, with a “capped profit” share for investors and employees. But as alluded to in the blog post, the company’s intention is to transition its existing for-profit into a traditional corporation, with ordinary shares of stock. The nonprofit would receive billions of dollars to cede control.

The stakes are high for OpenAI to complete the conversion expeditiously. If it isn’t successful by the end of the year, at least one of its backers, SoftBank, could claw back billions of dollars in pledged capital.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google DeepMind on Wednesday published an exhaustive paper on its safety approach to AGI, roughly defined as AI that can accomplish any task a human can. Others, including major AI labs like Anthropic, warn that it’s around the corner, and could result in catastrophic harms if steps aren’t taken to implement appropriate safeguards. DeepMind’s 145-page document, which was co-authored by DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg, predicts that AGI could arrive by 2030, and that it may result in what the authors call “severe harm.” The paper doesn’t concretely define this, but gives the alarmist example of “existential risks” that “permanently destroy humanity.” Anthropic, it says, places less emphasis on “robust training, monitoring, and security,” while OpenAI is overly bullish on “automating” a form of AI safety research known as alignment research. (OpenAI recently claimed that it’s turning its aim from AGI to superintelligence.) Absent “significant architectural innovation,” the DeepMind authors aren’t convinced that superintelligent systems will emerge soon — if ever. Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the nonprofit AI Now Institute, told TechCrunch that she thinks the concept of AGI is too ill-defined to be “rigorously evaluated scientifically.” Another AI researcher, Matthew Guzdial, an assistant professor at the University of Alberta, said that he doesn’t believe recursive AI improvement is realistic at present. “[Recursive improvement] is the basis for the intelligence singularity arguments,” Guzdial told TechCrunch, “but we’ve never seen any evidence for it working.” Sandra Wachter, a researcher studying tech and regulation at Oxford, argues that a more realistic concern is AI reinforcing itself with “inaccurate outputs.” “At this point, chatbots are predominantly used for search and truth-finding purposes. Comprehensive as it may be, DeepMind’s paper seems unlikely to settle the debates over just how realistic AGI is — and the areas of AI safety in most urgent need of attention.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Circle, the issuer of USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, filed to go public on Tuesday.

The company, which makes money from interest earned on its reserve assets, reported that its 2024 revenue and reserve income was $1.68 billion, up from $1.45 billion the year prior. Circle’s 2024 net income was $156 million, down from $268 million in 2023.

This is Circle’s second attempt at listing on the stock exchange. The company previously tried to go public by combining with a SPAC in 2022 but scrapped its plans when the SEC didn’t approve the merger within an expected timeframe. Before failing, the SPAC deal valued Circle at $9 billion.

While it is not clear what value the company will fetch in its IPO, Renaissance Capital estimates that the company will attempt to raise $750 million in its offering.

According to the regulatory filing, investors with more than 5% ownership in the company include Accel, General Catalyst, Breyer, IDG Capital, and Oak Investment Partners.

Circle USDC in circulation are valued at $60 billion, according to the filing.

The company is planning its IPO amid the Trump administration’s supportive stance on crypto assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The San Carlos, California-based startup, which came out of stealth last October, aims to eventually launch a constellation of low earth orbit satellites that can collect and transmit solar energy directly to “ground stations” on Earth. It’s an idea that was initially triggered by Isaac Asimov’s 1941 short story “Reason.” Bhatt is focused on turning this science fiction-inspired concept into reality. At least, that’s the goal with next year’s launch, which will be supported by the fresh capital Aetherflux has raised. The Series A round was led by Index Ventures and Interlagos, with participation from Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Andressen Horowitz, and NEA, as well as some other interesting names like Jared Leto rounding it out. Bhatt, who joined us on the TechCrunch Equity podcast earlier this year, told TechCrunch that Aetherflux will use the funds to hire more engineers and invest in the technology and infrastructure needed for its first several missions. A satellite bus is the core structure and system of a satellite that provides essential functions for its operation, like power, propulsion, and communications. Most buses generate power through solar panels, and Bhatt says that power – as much as a kilowatt of energy – will be sent back to Earth via lasers. On the receiving end will be Aetherflux’s “ground stations,” made up of photovoltaic arrays that convert sunlight to energy that is stored in batteries for later use. Bhatt said his team, which is made up of engineers and researchers from NASA, SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, Anduril, and the U.S. Navy, is also working on building out Aetherflux’s first ground station. The startup doesn’t have a location for the station yet, but it’s evaluating military sites where there’s more controlled air space. Few have accomplished the feat of sending solar power from space to Earth. One of the only successful missions was in 2023 when researchers at Caltech’s Space Solar Power Project demonstrated wireless power transfer from low-earth orbit using microwave beaming. That proved the concept, but falls short of Aetherflux’s pitch for a scalable, commercial system.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Brief

Amazon has submitted a bid to acquire all of TikTok, according to a new report from The New York Times. The last-minute bid comes as TikTok faces an April 5 deadline to shed its Chinese ownership or face a ban in the U.S. However, the parties involved in the deal talks do not appear to be taking Amazon’s bid seriously, according to The Times’ report.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with officials to discuss the app’s fate on Wednesday. Trump said earlier this week that a deal with TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to sell the app will be finalized before the April 5 deadline.

On Tuesday, Financial Times reported that Andreessen Horowitz is in talks to invest in TikTok as part of an Oracle-led bid that includes other American investors interested in purchasing the app.

Last week, Reuters reported that private equity firm Blackstone is considering joining ByteDance’s current non-Chinese shareholders, led by Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic, in providing fresh capital to bid for TikTok’s U.S. operations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fast-forward a few years and rates soared — to highs nearing 8% in 2023, with the national average 30-year fixed mortgage APR as of April 1 still at 6.84%. But what if there was a way to still get the interest rates of years past? Enter Roam, a New York-based startup with the mission of providing access to “thousands” of homes with assumable mortgages across the country. Roam helped facilitate $200 million worth of home sales for “several hundred” buyers in 2024. And more than 200,000 buyers have registered on its platform in the last 12 months. While Singh did not disclose hard revenue figures, he told TechCrunch that Roam charges each buyer 1% of the purchase price. A seller’s equity must be cashed out, Singh acknowledges, noting that Roam has built a product that makes it possible “for buyers to bring as little as 5% down so they can get a 5% (or less) blended rate.” Today, the startup operates in 17 states, including Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, and North Carolina. It has plans to be nationwide by year’s end and Singh expects that Roam will see $1 billion worth of home sales facilitated by its platform in 2025. “There’s an affordable housing crisis in America, and Roam is the best-positioned company to address it,” Rabois told TechCrunch. The investor, who is joining Roam’s board as part of the Series A round, noted that he knew Singh and other members of Roam’s team from the founder’s time at publicly traded proptech company Opendoor, which Rabois co-founded with Eric Wu in 2014. “Having worked with them previously, I was excited about their potential to mitigate the housing affordability crisis by reducing buyers’ monthly payments and bringing sellers with low-rate mortgages on the market,” Rabois said. Also participating in Roam’s Series A is existing backer Founders Fund. “We had a pitch meeting on Monday, term sheet in hand on Tuesday, and had signed by Friday,” he told TechCrunch exclusively. Since its inception, Roam has raised a total of about $16 million across three rounds. The latest round represents a tripling-down on Rabois’ part. Wu, Culdesac CEO Ryan Johnson, and #ANGELS Founding Partner Jana Messerschmidt also participated in the round. Then in May of 2024, it raised a $3 million seed round — also led by Rabois, while still at Founders Fund. Historically, according to Singh, if buyers searched on Zillow for assumable mortgages in a city like Houston, they’d likely find little to no results. “Very few sellers or listing agents know they have an assumable mortgage, so they don’t think to advertise it,” he said. With Roam, he claims buyers can find more than 2,000 assumable mortgages in Houston alone listed for sale today. And even if buyers were aware that a seller had an assumable loan, getting approval for an assumption could take up to 45 days, according to Singh. “Fall-throughs for not being approved were extremely painful for the seller since they’d have to re-list the home, and this made listing agents skeptical of accepting assumable offers,” he said. “With Roam, buyers can get a pre-approval before submitting an offer, which has dramatically increased the acceptance rate of offers made by Roam buyers.” Singh also claims that Roam speeds up the process of becoming a homeowner. “Without Roam, it takes 180 days to close an assumable mortgage,” he said. Singh said the startup has aimed to not grow headcount linearly — with staff increasing about 2.5x year-over-year compared to revenue increasing by about 5x year over year. “We’ve found that the product allows revenue growth without linearly increasing variable costs,” he told TechCrunch. “$1.4 trillion of fully assumable FHA/VA mortgages originated in 2020 and 2021,” he said, citing documents from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo unveiled new details on Wednesday about its hugely anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 gaming console, which will be the company’s first new console since the Nintendo Switch was introduced in 2017. The Nintendo Switch 2 will be released on June 5 and cost $450. At launch, the console will arrive both on its own and as part of a bundle with Mario Kart World, a new game for the Switch 2. The device has a 1080p LCD screen that supports up to 120fps, as well as HDR — that could be a disappointment for users who got accustomed to their upgraded OLED Nintendo Switches. It will also only support microSD express cards for additional storage, however, which are a new kind of microSD card. The classic colorway for the Nintendo Switch 2 is matte black with light red and blue accents on each respective Joy-Con, nodding to its previous design but in a sleeker format. But we’re willing to wager that Nintendo will let you buy as many Joy-Cons as you want in every color you can imagine — and hopefully, this time around, there’s not a drift issue. The Joy-Cons will also function like a computer mouse for compatible games. With the gyroscope features, players can have more control over motion controls. To get users acquainted with the new Nintendo Switch 2 functions, there will be a Welcome Tour game that explains the device, and it’ll cost money, which is probably better spent on Mario Kart World. To sweeten the deal, Nintendo Online will now allow players to revisit GameCube games, in addition to its existing ports of Nintendo 64 and Game Boy games, including Fire Emblem Path of Radiance, Super Mario Strikers, Luigi’s Mansion, Pokémon XD, and others. Some titles will be available the day the Switch 2 comes out, along with a remade GameCube controller — which, don’t worry, comes with a C button. Many fans theorized about a C button that appears on the Joy-Cons, which Nintendo confirmed today to be GameChat, a feature that allows you to communicate with friends while playing the game. Your voice is recognized by a microphone in the system, supposedly making it possible to hear people if they’re in a loud room. Users can also share their game screens within the console, even if they are playing different games. The right Joy-Con has another C button that can be used for other chat functions, including muting your microphone if you need to do something else. GameChat will be available for all users until March 31, 2026, but after that, you will need to have a paid online membership to use it. Nintendo briefly mentioned that parental controls will be accessible on GameChat, but didn’t provide further details. Nintendo announced the Nintendo Switch Camera, which can attach to the console and transpose your face on top of your game, perfect for GameChat. Nintendo showed an example of the camera in which people play Mario Party together, and players’ faces appear in speech bubbles next to their characters, showing their reactions to the games. These new features will be backward-compatible with certain games, including Mario Party Jamboree. Of course, there will also be a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, which includes the new C button. Which games will be available for Nintendo Switch 2? There’s a large map of various regions and courses, but in a free drive mode, you can drive around wherever you may please — in single or multi-player — without the threat of a red shell lurking around every corner. The Switch 2 will support games from other developers — some in development and others already released. These include Hades II, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Street Fighter, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4, Yakuza 0, Borderlands 4, Enter the Gungeon 2, Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition, a Final Fantasy VII remake, Silksong, and others. There will also be a new game in the Zelda universe called Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, which is a prequel to Tears of the Kingdom. It’s expected to come out this winter. Donkey Kong Bananza, a new Switch 2 game, will launch on July 17, 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, whose company makes Fortnite and tools for other developers, including Unreal Engine, called out Apple and Google as “gangster-style businesses” engaged in illegal practices while speaking at a Y Combinator event on Wednesday. The executive also emphasized how the big tech companies’ practices directly affected his own business by scaring away users from installing Epic’s Games Store software and preventing Epic from attracting developers to its offerings. Notably, Epic Games has played a big role in the fight against big tech monopolies over the past several years. The company sued both Apple and Google for monopolistic practices over their respective app stores. The court said app developers should now be able to link to other purchasing mechanisms besides Apple’s own. (Unfortunately for app developers, Epic is still battling with Apple in the courts over this change, as it alleges that Apple violated the court order by allowing developers to process their own payments, but only with a small, 3% reduction in commission, which doesn’t make it worth their while.) Onstage, Sweeney again called out the big tech companies for their practices and their “malicious compliance” with the courts’ decisions. “The sad truth is that Apple and Google are no longer good-faith, law-abiding companies,” Sweeney said. For instance, when users on Android try to install the Epic Games Store on their smartphone, Google warns them that the software is from an “unknown source” and might harm their device. This “scare screen,” as Sweeney calls it, is meant to warn users about the dangers of installing non-Play Store apps. A similar drop-off rate is found on iOS. Again, this leads to drop-off rates of 50-60%, Sweeney said. “Crime pays for big tech companies,” he said. “Obviously, we shouldn’t expect that to change until enforcement becomes much, much more vigorous,” he told the audience. Apple would bankrupt them if they did that.” Meanwhile, the Android version will open up to developer submissions later this year, which Sweeney hopes will boost the catalog further.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ZDNET's key takeaways The OnePlus 12 typically sells for a starting price of $799. The lack of generative AI features is felt, but for many, that may not be a problem. OnePlus is holding a new promotion for its old flagship phone. Instead of prematurely jumping onto the AI bandwagon, promoting its phones with features that aren't readily available, the Shenzhen manufacturer prioritized aspects that mattered more, such as charging tech, battery life, and performance. Also: Amazon's Spring Sale is over, but this Google Pixel 9 offer at Target is still my favorite spring phone deal live now A smartphone that excels at the things you actually want and need. I find it very difficult to recommend any other mobile device in 2025. My fondness for the OnePlus 12 is part of a bigger story. The OnePlus 12 has all three of those features and a very competitive price, especially in today's market. The device's edges are curved to make it sit smoothly in my hand, and I don't struggle to press any of the buttons. Also: 12 Android phone settings you should change to dramatically increase battery life For something that requires a toggle instead of a press, physically switching from "Ring" to "Vibrate" to "Silent" feels more cumbersome than it should. Otherwise, I'm a fan of OnePlus' industrial design, which is a little more distinct now that both Samsung and Google have officially ditched the curved glass form factor. The OnePlus 12 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which brings improved day-to-day performance and better efficiency of on-device AI applications. I've had no problem putting the phone through its paces, whether it's editing videos on Premiere Rush, playing demanding games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact, or multitasking with a PiP (Picture-in-Picture) video playing. While the marketed peak brightness of 4,500 nits puts even the Galaxy S24's 2,600 value to shame, I only found it to be slightly brighter when outdoors. Aside from Google's stock AI features, such as Magic Compose and Photomoji, this model has no killer generative AI service, as I alluded to in the introduction. That's not a bad thing, especially if you don't factor generative AI into your lifestyle anyway. Also: 5 tools I trust to keep my online conversations private and anonymous That said, the latest Android 15 update for the OnePlus 12 introduces some familiar generative AI tools that put the device closer to its competitors, such as Circle to Search, AI Unblur, AI Assistant for Notes, and more. The new software version also brings Open Canvas to the phone, a multitasking feature that deploys floating windows for quicker navigation between apps. Also: This Anker power bank is on sale and it's my everyday carry - Here's why Because the telephoto lens is capped to 3x optical zoom, shooting subjects that are further away tends to produce pictures that appear more washed out and lacking in detail. For images captured with Hasselblad Portrait Mode, the phone can struggle to apply a bokeh effect behind people with fuzzy and springy hairstyles. In both cases, a visual engine that can help amplify or better detect subjects would be immensely helpful. Ultimately, one of the most compelling reasons to buy a OnePlus phone is its battery life and charging speed. It's also a great phone for users who aren't fully bought into the AI craze. If you can shoulder the compromises, which are more subtle than ever, then I have no problem recommending the latest phone from OnePlus, especially at its Black Friday price. As per OnePlus, this deal will end on April 13, 2025. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable.
