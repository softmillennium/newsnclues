                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A House Financial Services Committee markup of stablecoin legislation appeared to go off course Wednesday, with Democrats spending hours hammering home the same message: Democrats would in principle support the STABLE Act, but see President Donald Trump’s personal involvement in the stablecoin sector as an unacceptable conflict of interest. One by one, over the course of hours, those amendments were shot down by voice vote the Committee's slim Republican majority. The Act would create a set of rules, involving compliance with anti-money laundering laws and reserve audits, that all stablecoin issuers would have to comply with to operate in American markets. “We're not picking winners and losers here,” Committee Chair French Hill (R-AR) said. “He is unlike any other issuer because he's the president of the United States,” Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) retorted. Some stablecoin issuers, like the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial, purport to strengthen U.S. dollar hegemony by encouraging the use of dollar-backed assets in both foreign and digital asset markets. But the Trump family’s announcement last week of a stablecoin product—right at the moment that stablecoin legislation is moving quickly through both chambers of Congress—appears to have struck a particularly resonant chord with Democrats. A source with direct knowledge of the matter told Decrypt that World Liberty did not intend to roll out its stablecoin so soon. It remains unclear whether the flare up over Trump’s crypto dealings will meaningfully change the calculus when it comes to bipartisan support for the STABLE Act, which has until now been widely expected to earn a fair number of Democrat votes. One House Financial Services Committee staffer told Decrypt Wednesday they do not anticipate much has changed after today’s mark up, in terms of Democrat support for the bill. Some Democrats already cosponsoring the STABLE Act, including Rep. Sam Liccardo (D-CA), issued forceful rebukes of Trump’s crypto dealings on Wednesday. Liccardo said the need to prevent high-ranking officials like Trump from offering their own stablecoins was “self-evident and obvious,” and highlighted the potential for such tokens to offer foreign actors a means to curry favor with the president. Another House staffer familiar with the work of the House Financial Services Committee told Decrypt, however, that Democrats who already cosponsored the bill embraced it last month as it was written then—and are unlikely to change their positions over tweaks that, while important, may not be existential. “You can connect the dots on what will happen if those amendments don’t get in,” the staffer said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fund manager Fidelity is allowing its clients to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin via individual retirement accounts. Starting Wednesday, investors have been able to get exposure to three virtual coins, which Fidelity already offers via its crypto trading service, by opening a "crypto IRA." Bitcoin is the biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $1.7 trillion. Ethereum, the second biggest virtual coin, has a market cap of $228 billion. Litecoin, which originally set out to be a faster, cheaper version of Bitcoin, is number 23 on the list, with a market cap of $6.4 billion. All of the virtual coins have been around since the digital asset industry's early days, with Litecoin launching in 2011—two years after Bitcoin's first block was mined. Fidelity has been offering customers crypto for years. In 2022, along with Wall Street giants Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Paradigm, it launched EDX Markets, a crypto exchange for institutional investors. That same year, Fidelity revealed it would allow workers to save 20% of retirement funds in Bitcoin. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) has generated nearly $11.4 billion in net inflows, the second most among the 11 funds currently trading, according to data from U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Those funds now manage almost $100 billion in assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Monday Marked the End of a Painful Quarter for Ethereum, as the Network’s Native Asset’s So-Called Burn Rate Fizzled Amid One of Its Worst Performanances in Recent Memory. The metric, which tracks the rate of Ethereum Removed from Circulation, Recently Hit Its Lowest Level Since August 2021, A Nagging Concern Among Investors That’s “Weighed on Ethereum’s Market Performance,” According to the Crypto Market Maker Wintermute. Last Week, Around 53 ETH Was Burned per day, The firm Said. MEAUHHILE, ETH’s Supply Has Increaseed 3% Since an upgrade Called EIP-1559 Took Effect, According to Ultrasound Money. The Lower Burn Rate Undercores How Eth’s Ability to Accrue Value Has Shifted Since Developers Embraced Layer-2 Scaling Solutions A Year Ago. Since then, Ethereum’s So-Called Issuance Has Be Net Net Positive, Yet Some Experts Believe Institutional Adoption Trends Could Change Change that. During the First Quarter, ETH’s Price Plummeted 45%, Wiping Away $ 170 Billion in Market Value, According to Crypto Data Providers Coingecko and Coinglass. Years AGO, User Activity on Ethereum Became A Core Driver of Eth’s Value, When Ethereum Developers Implemented A Fee-Burning Mechanism Called EIP-1559 in August 2021. While Ethereum’s Users Previously Paid Transaction Fees to Miners, The Network Started Burning Them Instead, Reducing The Asset’s Circulating Supply in Relation to Network Activity. When Ethereum Later Transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake Consensus Model in 2022, Making Miners Obsolete and Vastly Reducing The Network’s Carbon Footprint, The Rate At What New Eth is Issued what reduced. As user activity has gravitated Toward Those Scaling Solutions, Transaction Fees have fall on Ethereum Too, Recently Hitting a Five Year Low of $ 0.40. During the Pandemic-E-Crypto Boom, So-Called Gas Wars Plagued Ethereum Users, Who Sometimes Paid Upwards Of $ 4,000 for a Single Transaction. NFT Projects Were a Common Yet Ultimately Beneficial Source of Conesion, Like Those Tied to Bored Ape Yacht Club. As Wall Street Migrating on-Chain, some analysts Believe that eth Could Become Deflationary Again, if institutions end up Bringing Trillions of Dollars of Assets with Them. The Measure Excludes StableCoins, which Are Often Backed by Cash and U.S. Treasuries. That sum could Broadly Grow to $ 16 Trillion by 2030, According to a Paper Published by Boston Consulting Group in October, but Estimates from Experts Vary Widely. “We're not seeing the economic benefits from tokenization Yet,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon Told Decrypt.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Historically bitcoin has failed to live up to its investment thesis as an inflationary hedge or safe harbor asset. As the global economy anxiously awaits President Trump’s tariff announcements, some traders are already thinking about worst-case scenarios. “Tariffs are a stagflationary shock to the economy. They reduce growth and raise inflation,” says Zach Pandl, head of research at digital asset manager Grayscale and a former senior economist at Goldman Sachs. “What we don’t know is the mix in terms of stagnation and inflation. At the moment, markets are more focused on stagnation, but we very well may see more inflation persistence over time.” For many investors, especially those with bitcoin exposure, a key question is how the asset class will perform in such an environment. These are questions that have not needed to be addressed for 50 years — long before Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the famous Bitcoin white paper. Bitcoin’s history during periods of market turmoil is not necessarily encouraging. At other times of market stress, such as the unwinding of the Japanese yen carry trade in August 2024 or the broader market downturn in 2022, it behaved more like a speculative asset than the store of value that it is purported to be. But there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about bitcoin’s chances this time, Pandl says. “Much like the 1970s was a breakout period for gold [which had an average annualized 31% return], I believe that the coming decade will be a breakout period for Bitcoin. Stagflation is an exceptionally rare occurrence, even during poor economic climates. “Although there are concerns about stagflation, we’re nowhere near what occurred in the Seventies. At that period of time, there was a period of excess in the Sixties, the Vietnam War, and then you also had this exogenous shock of the Arab oil embargoes. The price of energy skyrocketed and the nation just was not ready for it,” says Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers. Sosnick went on to point out how, at 4% unemployment, the U.S. economy remains in an enviable position. “If you want to define stagflation as a period involving a stagnating economy and higher prices, then I think it’s hardly an idle concern,” he says. They bought gold and moved away from stocks, as indicated in the chart below. Conversely, gold offered 30% annualized returns for most of the decade, and then it surged more than 500% at the tail end of the decade after concerns about persistent inflation really took hold. This inverse relationship between gold and stocks has been consistent through the decades. It is even holding true again in 2025 as concerns about the impact of President Trump’s erratic tariff policies spook markets. Gold continues to set record highs, and it is currently priced at $3,171 per oz, while bitcoin is trailing both the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. It is important to start with some key assumptions. For starters, it seems likely that either due to reduced trust and confidence in the U.S. economy or pro-active policymaking from the Fed to reduce interest rates, the dollar is going to drop. Sosnick points out that other currencies could take some of its place: “When you’re trading currencies it’s A versus B.” The euro could be a strong contender, as it has appreciated almost 4% against the dollar in 2025, a gargantuan move for major currencies in such a short period of time, and its major stock indexes are outperforming their U.S. counterparts. So then it all comes back to the gold vs. bitcoin discussion. On the pessimistic side, historically, bitcoin has hardly traded like the store of value that it is purported to be. Additionally, most of the new flows into the assets have come from U.S. investors looking for outsize risk-weighted returns, not a hedge on local fiat. They may prefer to find their hedges somewhere else. But, this new demand for bitcoin may need to come from retail buyers outside of developed economies, a growing but still small part of the overall crypto investment economy. Many are also buying stablecoins as a way to de-risk themselves from their local currencies, but as access to this industry becomes more democratized, demand could grow for both asset classes, though it could take time. The bull case for bitcoin would be that a period of stagflation would depress the dollar to a point that bitcoin is seen as the better store of value for emerging market investors. But as the economy enters this uncertain period of time all investors need to take a long-term perspective with regard to their portfolios. If traders are confident in the long-term ability of bitcoin to manifest its mission as a hybrid of digital gold and a speculative asset, then it could serve as a welcome landing spot for them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A stablecoin called First Digital USD (FDUSD) lost its dollar peg on Wednesday after Tron founder Justin Sun claimed that its issuer, First Digital Trust, is effectively insolvent. The Hong Kong-based firm is currently “unable to fulfill client fund redemptions," Sun warned in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, urging “regulators and law enforcement to take swift action to address these issues and prevent further major losses.” First Digital Trust denied the allegation, saying on X that its stablecoin worth $2.5 billion is backed one-to-one with U.S. Treasuries. The firm described Sun’s rhetoric as part of a “smear campaign,” adding that it will pursue legal action to protect its rights and reputation. The recent allegations by Justin Sun against First Digital Trust are completely false. Every dollar backing $FDUSD is completely, secure, safe and accounted for with US backed T-Bills. FDUSD—which is prominently used by top crypto exchange Binance after it dropped support for BUSD in 2023—plunged as low as $0.95 and was recently changing hands around $0.96, according to the crypto data provider CoinGecko. Sun said on X that First Digital Trust’s insolvency is a “factual statement,” urging the company’s business partners to sever ties “as soon as possible to protect your assets.” The crypto billionaire recently helped a firm called Techteryx avoid insolvency, CoinDesk reported on Wednesday, citing Hong Kong court documents. The company, which acquired the stablecoin TrueUSD in 2020, reportedly needed a $456 million bailout from Sun after its reserves were allegedly misappropriated by First Digital Trust. First Digital Trust manages TrueUSD’s reserves, and the company diverted cash to a Dubai-based entity instead of an investment vehicle registered in the Cayman Islands, the publication reported, citing court documents prepared by U.S. law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel. When Techteryx tried to redeem funds between mid-2022 and early 2023, the company received “little or no funds back” from the Cayman Islands-based fund, and it allegedly defaulted on payments and failed to fulfill redemption requests, according to the court documents. Despite its small market cap, the disruption centered around FDUSD is “a big deal,“ Coinbase's Head of Product, Conor Grogan, said on X Wednesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grayscale Investments is listing two exchange-traded funds giving investors a modified source of income based on Bitcoin's volatile price movements, the crypto asset manager announced Wednesday. The Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (BTCC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Premium Income ETF (BPI) use covered call strategies that allow investors to buy equity shares they already own at a given price. BTCC and BPI, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange, are among the latest crypto offerings from issuers trying to meet investors’ voracious appetite for digital asset-focused products. Grayscale was among 10 asset managers that last year received the green light from the SEC to launch a Bitcoin ETF. GBTC, which traded as a trust before converting to an ETF, manages about $16.5 billion in assets. BTCC is "an income-first strategy, potentially ideal for investors seeking regular cash flows and high yielding opportunities," while BPI aims to generate income and increase the fund's value over time. The asset manager then converted its Ethereum trust to an ETF later that year. The asset manager also has trusts giving investors exposure to Bitcoin Cash, Filecoin, Chainlink, Litecoin, and other digital assets, and has taken steps toward debuting funds based on different altcoins. “Grayscale® Bitcoin Covered Call ETF may complement an investors existing Bitcoin exposure by adding income, while Grayscale Bitcoin Premium Income ETF offers an alternative to Bitcoin ownership, aiming to balance upside participation and income generation for investors,” said David LaValle, Global Head of ETFs at Grayscale. "We understand that every investor has unique needs, and we're excited to offer these new products that not only may capture and deliver income but also offer differentiated outcomes and behavioral characteristics tailored to their specific goals."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With over four years of development, Overtime has established itself as a fully onchain sportsbook offering functionality comparable to traditional offchain platforms. Users can access the new Overtime domain here: https://www.overtime.io/ Overtime distinguishes itself from traditional bookmakers by operating a fully decentralized, permissionless sportsbook platform. Anyone can seamlessly access Overtime with a simple connection without the barriers of traditional restrictive betting limits, arbitrary bans, or withheld payouts. Since its inception, Overtime has organically become the primary driver of Thales DAO growth. Comprehensive Onchain User Experience Enabled by Full Account Abstraction With this launch, Overtime is also introducing a new concept: Overtime Accounts—an onchain smart account designed to abstract wallet and EVM network complexities. Overtime Accounts use Particle Network for the seamless creation of wallets via Social Logins, and Biconomy’s SDK to handle the smart-account functionalities, enabling frictionless transactions through its Paymaster, Bundler, and Session Keys infrastructure. After creating an Overtime Account, users can deposit supported collateral into their designated address to access Overtime’s onchain sportsbook interface. Transactions are executed through an account abstraction framework, removing the need for manual confirmations or the use of ETH to cover gas fees. Overtime’s user experience has been designed to minimize blockchain-related complexities, allowing users to engage with the platform's sportsbook features without requiring technical knowledge of underlying blockchain processes. A new Overtime UX is available here: https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/ This means that 30.58M THALES tokens will be burned in preparation for the migration to $OVER. All THALES token holders will be able to migrate their $THALES to $OVER token at a 1:1 ratio on the new overtime.io domain. This aligns with the new sustainable tokenomics designed to foster growth and focus it entirely on the $OVER token. The new $OVER token will serve multiple utilities: $OVER as Betting Collateral: By using $OVER token as collateral on Overtime, users will enjoy improved odds (2% better than baseline odds) compared to other collaterals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With over four years of development, Overtime has established itself as a fully onchain sportsbook offering functionality comparable to traditional offchain platforms. Users can access the new Overtime domain here: https://www.overtime.io/ Overtime distinguishes itself from traditional bookmakers by operating a fully decentralized, permissionless sportsbook platform. Anyone can seamlessly access Overtime with a simple connection without the barriers of traditional restrictive betting limits, arbitrary bans, or withheld payouts. Since its inception, Overtime has organically become the primary driver of Thales DAO growth. Comprehensive Onchain User Experience Enabled by Full Account Abstraction With this launch, Overtime is also introducing a new concept: Overtime Accounts—an onchain smart account designed to abstract wallet and EVM network complexities. Overtime Accounts use Particle Network for the seamless creation of wallets via Social Logins, and Biconomy’s SDK to handle the smart-account functionalities, enabling frictionless transactions through its Paymaster, Bundler, and Session Keys infrastructure. After creating an Overtime Account, users can deposit supported collateral into their designated address to access Overtime’s onchain sportsbook interface. Transactions are executed through an account abstraction framework, removing the need for manual confirmations or the use of ETH to cover gas fees. Overtime’s user experience has been designed to minimize blockchain-related complexities, allowing users to engage with the platform’s sportsbook features without requiring technical knowledge of underlying blockchain processes. A new Overtime UX is available here: https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/ This means that 30.58M THALES tokens will be burned in preparation for the migration to $OVER. All THALES token holders will be able to migrate their $THALES to $OVER token at a 1:1 ratio on the new overtime.io domain. This aligns with the new sustainable tokenomics designed to foster growth and focus it entirely on the $OVER token. The new $OVER token will serve multiple utilities: $OVER as Betting Collateral: By using $OVER token as collateral on Overtime, users will enjoy improved odds (2% better than baseline odds) compared to other collaterals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Off the Grid creator Gunzilla Games added a Bored Ape Yacht Club-themed content pack Wednesday as part of an “Ape-ril” promotion for Pro subscribers of its battle royale game. “Time to go full ape sh*t with two Bored Apes battling for clout, coin, and chaos,” the game’s official account posted on X (formerly Twitter), alongside a promotional trailer that features Apes running around inside the game world. The APE-RIL Content Pack with @BoredApeYC is now live via OTG Pro. Time to go full ape sh*t with two bored apes battling for clout, coin, and chaos! Off the Grid also released a limited edition “Ape-fool Mask” that was only claimable on Tuesday for users that played at least one game on April Fool’s Day, making it a potentially rare in-game item given the limited availability window. Off the Grid's Bored Ape pack launch comes just days after Gunzilla’s GUNZ mainnet rollout and the token generation event for its Gunz token (GUN). GUNZ is a gaming-centric Avalanche L1 network that will support Off the Grid and potential other future crypto games. Its $32 million market cap is particularly small compared to other major crypto gaming tokens, due to only around 6% of tokens being in circulation. However, when comparing GUN by fully diluted value—or the current token price multiplied by its total supply—at a $550 million FDV, GUN is valued higher than other notable game-adjacent tokens like ApeCoin (APE) and Parallel’s PRIME, which are valued at $468 million and $395 million, respectively. Gunzilla’s Web3 Head Theodore Agranat told Decrypt on Tuesday that the mainnet migration is a “main priority” right now, but there’s no ETA yet on when that process will be completed. You get an ape and pfp it, I play your game. Token price and mainnet migration aside, Off the Grid drew in at least one new player thanks to its new Ape content pack and Bored Ape profile picture (or PFP) on X. “You get an Ape and PFP it, I play your game. Simple,” wrote Yuga Labs CEO and Bored Ape Yacht Club co-founder Greg Solano. Gunzilla did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment regarding the Bored Ape Yacht Club-inspired content pack.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether you’re casually trading meme coins or deeply immersed in DeFi, understanding your tax obligations now could help you avoid headaches—or penalties—later. For much of its existence, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ignored crypto. A crypto-related question appeared on Schedule 1 of Form 1040 in 2020, asking taxpayers whether they had made any cryptocurrency transactions during the year. “You may have to report transactions with digital assets such as cryptocurrency and non fungible tokens (NFTs) on your tax return,” the IRS said in a post. This article will examine current crypto tax policies in 2025, how Donald Trump's return to office influences the crypto regulatory landscape, and what these changes mean for investors. Purchasing cryptocurrency, by itself, is not a taxable event. Buying and holding digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana does not trigger tax liability. “Since the IRS classifies cryptocurrency as property, most transactions are taxable,” Navin Sethi, partner at Eisner Advisory Group LLC, told Decrypt. Capital gains taxes apply to profits from selling, trading, or using cryptocurrencies. Investors may owe capital gains tax if they made more money from selling their digital asset than they paid for it. Short-term gains refer to assets held for less than one year that are taxed at your ordinary income rate. refer to assets held for less than one year that are taxed at your ordinary income rate. Long-term gains, which refer to assets held for over a year, are taxed at reduced rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on income. Sethi noted that cryptocurrency transactions are reported on Schedule D of IRS Form 1040 as capital gains or losses. Whether a transaction is considered short-term or long-term depends on how long the asset was held. He added that the IRS is tightening its crypto reporting rules, requiring investors to track and report gains and losses by individual wallets rather than using a universal basis method. “Starting January 1, 2025, taxpayers can no longer use the universal basis method and instead must track their basis by wallet,” Sethi said. “Special situations could impact the character or treatment of the reporting; consult your tax advisor about your personal tax situation.” Getting paid in crypto : Whether it’s for goods, services, or a job, if you’re paid in cryptocurrency, the value at the time you receive it is taxed as income. Whether it’s for goods, services, or a job, if you’re paid in cryptocurrency, the value at the time you receive it is taxed as income. If you're mining as a business, it could also be hit with self-employment taxes. Any crypto earned from mining is taxable based on its value when you receive it. If you're mining as a business, it could also be hit with self-employment taxes. Like mining, staking rewards are taxed as income based on their fair market value at that time. Earnings from lending your crypto or participating in DeFi protocols (like earning yield or interest) are also taxable as ordinary income. Referral bonuses and promos: Any incentives, such as referral rewards or "play-to-earn" campaigns, are taxable income when you receive the crypto. “With crypto treated as property, taxpayers need to treat each transaction as a taxable event, calculating gains or losses based on their cost basis and holding period,” Derek Wride, Founder of crypto tax software CPAI, told Decrypt. “In 2025, this will become even more critical as IRS enforcement and new reporting requirements ramp up.” Capital gains are tricky enough in traditional finance, but as Wride explained, they get even more complicated with cryptocurrency, where every action is a transaction. “The challenge with crypto is tracking your cost basis over thousands of small transactions across wallets and exchanges, often with incomplete or conflicting data,” he said. NFTs may be taxed as collectibles—which carry a higher 28% tax rate on long-term capital gains—if they represent an underlying collectible item. This is higher than the typical 20% rate for other long-term capital assets. If it points to things like artwork, antiques, gems, precious metals, stamps, coins, or alcoholic beverages, it may be classified as a collectible. Short-term gains on NFTs held for less than a year are taxed as ordinary income, ranging from 10% to 37%. All NFT-related activities—buying, selling, trading, depositing, or transferring—must be reported on your tax return. Because guidance is still evolving, consult a tax professional to ensure compliance. Here are the key IRS updates taking effect in 2025: Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, brokers must also report the cost basis of crypto transactions to help investors determine gains or losses. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, brokers must also report the cost basis of crypto transactions to help investors determine gains or losses. Wallet-by-Wallet Accounting : Investors must now calculate the cost basis separately for each wallet. The cost basis is whatever you paid in U.S. dollars to acquire a token plus any associated fees. : Investors must now calculate the cost basis separately for each wallet. The cost basis is whatever you paid in U.S. dollars to acquire a token plus any associated fees. Temporary Safe Harbor: Beginning January 1 through December 31, 2025, the IRS will allow “alternative identification” methods for digital assets—giving exchanges and taxpayers time to adapt to new digital asset identification requirements. Up to 75% of unpaid tax as an additional penalty. It's important to note that while enforcement is increasing, these penalties represent the most extreme causes of tax fraud. Providing crypto tax services has become a booming industry, and several platforms are on the market that can help track transactions, calculate gains, and generate tax reports. CPAI: Uses AI to automate the crypto tax preparation process. ​In February 2025, the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee advanced a resolution to prevent the IRS from imposing tax reporting requirements on decentralized finance projects that would classify DeFi projects as brokers, obligating them to provide users with Form 1099 tax documents. This move reflects growing concern that applying traditional financial rules to decentralized technologies could stifle innovation and drive activity offshore. “As crypto tax legislation develops, I believe we’ll see some retracing of past regulatory oversteps,” Wride said. “If policymakers recognize the importance of maintaining healthy on-chain transaction volume, we could see fewer taxable events and a more rational approach to crypto taxation overall.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto and stock markets alike saw a jump Wednesday morning following a report that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk will depart his current role as a close ally to President Donald Trump. Tesla (TSLA)—one of the world's biggest publicly traded Bitcoin reserve holders—saw a surge following the report, rebounding following Wednesday's release of a brutal quarterly report showing falling demand and production for Musk's electric car maker. The stock has been battered in recent months, falling from a peak above $480 set in December as Musk's political moves have proven controversial. Bitcoin has since cooled to about $86,770 as of this writing, but remains up by nearly 2% on the day. According to the report, Trump has told his inner circle and members of his cabinet that Musk "will be stepping back in the coming weeks" from his prominent role as a close Trump advisor. Musk is unlikely to disappear entirely from Trump's administration, the report claims, but his departure may be timed with the end of his status as a "special government employee" in the coming weeks. The report comes following a Republican loss in Wisconsin's Supreme Court judge election on Tuesday—a race in which Musk personally spent $20 million to support Trump's favored candidate, Brad Schimel. While Musk was announced to head DOGE, the White House has since clarified that is officially a "senior advisor to the president." DOGE is indeed apparently inspired by Dogecoin (DOGE), Musk's longtime favorite cryptocurrency, with the meme logo briefly appearing on the government website in January. Trump also sells a t-shirt featuring himself, Musk, and the coin's familiar Shiba Inu meme mascot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over key benchmarks, Sentient claims it outperforms major closed-source competitors like Perplexity and OpenAI's GPT-4o Search Preview. Backed by Peter Thiel's Founder's Fund, Sentient claims its work represents America's answer to China's DeepSeek. When it broke out, DeepSeek's open-source model questioned industry beliefs and caused a $1 trillion tech slump. Operating as a nonprofit, Sentient argues AI development "should belong to the community, not controlled by closed-source corporations." According to Sentient testing, ODS scored 75.3% accuracy on the FRAMES benchmark, significantly outperforming GPT-4o Search Preview (50.5%) and Perplexity Sonar Reasoning Pro (44.4%). ODS uses Sentient's Open Search Tool, powered by an agentic framework, to rephrase queries and extract context from results. Asked about their testing methodology, Sentient co-founder Himanshu Tyagi told Decrypt that the benchmarking framework required models "to orchestrate knowledge from multiple sources." To make ODS more efficient, "ground truth" sources such as Wikipedia were excluded. This ensured that models "relied on their retrieval systems" instead of being artificially assisted, creating "a more realistic and rigorous evaluation," Tyagi claimed. ODS reached these numbers using an "agentic approach that writes self-correcting code," Tyagi said. That approach helped build out and determine which questions were needed to get a final answer. ODS and its evaluations can now be reviewed on their public GitHub repository. When DeepSeek came to global attention in January, Decrypt asked NYU Shanghai professor Bogna Konior why this was a key moment. "It's as if humanity is recreating that pivotal moment of language invention within computers." The parallels between DeepSeek and Sentient show these philosophical shifts for AI. "Once open-source technology is released into the world, it cannot be contained," Konior said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decentraland’s flagship virtual event returns April 9–12, showcasing digital fashion as a new canvas for storytelling, activism, and global identity. MVFW 2025 highlights digital fashion’s growing relevance as a meaningful response to these industry transformations. Under this year’s theme, “Infinite Identities,” more than 47 global designers and brands leverage digital mediums to challenge creative boundaries and articulate nuanced cultural identities. Hosted on Decentraland 2.0, the platform’s newly redesigned desktop client offers improved visuals, greater interactivity, and better accessibility. “This year’s Metaverse Fashion Week comes at a critical moment for fashion and our society at large; one marked by rethinking priorities, authenticity, and connection,” says Bay Backner, Head Producer of MVFW. In a time like this, when the physical world feels increasingly heavy or limiting, third spaces like Decentraland become places where people can breathe, create, and truly be themselves. MVFW 2025 channels that energy into a live moment for fashion’s next breakout names and creative economies.” Runways have always been the cornerstone of fashion weeks worldwide, but MVFW 2025 reimagines this classic format through immersive, collaborative, and interactive experiences. Cyberdog: London’s iconic brand brings its neon-infused, rave-culture aesthetic into the virtual realm, blending futuristic fashion with underground electronic subcultures. Free The Youth: Ghanaian collective Free The Youth highlights African streetwear and creativity, celebrating bold, culturally driven designs that bridge physical and virtual worlds. The Banners We Wear: Decentraland’s inaugural MVFW Prize unveils deeply personal collections from emerging designers. With a $15,000 prize pool, this unique competition challenged designers globally to create digital wearables that convey powerful messages about identity, activism, and resilience. Winning entries will debut on a dedicated runway, spotlighting urgent social narratives and elevating voices often marginalized in mainstream fashion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Elon Musk’s X, formerly Twitter, has filed a brief to the U.S. Supreme Court questioning the legality of sending “broad, suspicionless” requests for data to crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and other firms. And it’s not been limited to Coinbase: Competitor crypto exchange Kraken and USDC stablecoin issuer Circle received them in 2021. Harper’s civil case objected to the IRS using a subpoena to obtain three years of transaction records concerning over 14,000 customers from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, including himself. The X attorney’s brief, filed on Friday, asks whether these Fourth Amendment protections permit “warrantless searches of customer records held by third-party service providers if the records are contractually owned by the customer” and “if those records enable surveillance of future behavior.” In particular, the brief focuses on what is called the “third-party doctrine,” a legal precedent established in the 1970s that can enable these types of invasive data requests—as long as they are directed toward a third party, rather than a particular private individual. For example, the application of the “third-party doctrine” could allow the government to access an individual's bank records, which they gave consent for the bank to access, without a warrant, but not papers stored in their home. A decision by the Supreme Court in favor of Mr. Harper would bolster legal protections against data requests by all U.S. companies, outside of the crypto industry, including X. But the Supreme Court, the final court of appeal, has not yet agreed to hear James Harper’s case. There have also been judges who ruled against the third-party doctrine when it comes to accessing geolocation data from smartphones and smart home devices.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recent interview, Bill Miller IV outlined his firm’s investment approach in a rapidly shifting macro environment, spotlighting GameStop as a new position and reiterating strong conviction in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) as the blueprint for Bitcoin treasury strategy. Miller praised Strategy’s transformation from software company to capital allocator focused on Bitcoin. He emphasized that the company isn’t just investing in Bitcoin—it’s solving traditional corporate finance challenges through Bitcoin-backed innovation. He framed Strategy’s persistent accumulation of Bitcoin through share issuance as an intelligent response to monetary debasement and a model that others have yet to replicate effectively. He also noted that the rebrand from MicroStrategy to Strategy marked a shift not just in name, but in purpose—cementing the company’s identity as a Bitcoin development company. According to Miller, there’s a growing list of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets—more than 70 by his count—but his firm only invests in a select few. While not every company can become a Bitcoin development company like Strategy, Miller believes many can and should adopt Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. He described Bitcoin as a way for companies to preserve the purchasing power of their excess capital, especially in light of monetary policies designed to erode fiat value over time. He emphasized that companies facing secular challenges—such as declining core businesses or structural industry shifts—may find in Bitcoin a meaningful way to preserve relevance and shareholder value. Miller confirmed a new starter position in GameStop, explaining that the decision was driven by the company’s recent capital raise and signs that it may be exploring a Bitcoin strategy. Though the position is small, it reflects his firm’s broader interest in companies that show signs of innovation and unorthodox capital allocation. He highlighted Ryan Cohen’s role at GameStop as a potentially powerful catalyst, pointing to Cohen’s cultural influence and willingness to think outside traditional finance norms. The ability to shape narratives, Miller suggested, is increasingly important in a world where memetics and capital markets are intertwined. Miller made the case for Bitcoin adoption as a response to ongoing monetary debasement. He explained that if policymakers openly target 2% annual inflation—or more—then it is rational for companies and individuals to move an equivalent portion of their fiat-denominated capital into Bitcoin. Miller also noted that more companies are waking up to this logic, especially as regulatory clarity improves. He believes corporate leaders who ignore this trend risk falling behind. But the broader takeaway is this: in a competitive, inflationary world, companies that fail to evolve risk irrelevance. Bitcoin offers a path forward—one rooted in long-term thinking and strategic capital deployment. Disclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solana meme coin Act I: The AI Prophecy (ACT) crashed 55% in less than an hour on Tuesday, as millions of dollars worth of positions were liquidated on Binance. This has led to a campaign across social media to stop using the popular centralized exchange, spurred on by the hashtag #BoycottBinance. Traders believed these liquidations came following the exchange changing its leverage and margin tiers. Put simply, Binance increased the amount of collateral traders needed to keep leveraged positions open, both long and short. In the hour following the change, according to CoinGlass, over $3.89 million worth of ACT positions, mostly long contracts, were liquidated on Binance as the token tumbled 55%—causing a cascade of liquidations across other exchanges, including $785,540 on Bybit and $612,600 on OKX. “We understand the ACT community's concerns regarding today's unforeseen price action, and want to clarify that these market movements were outside of our control,” the ACT X, formerly Twitter, account posted. “We will release a postmortem report once there is complete clarity on the situation and finality in the solutions we are working on.” Specifically, there were four sales from the firm’s public wallet on Solana decentralized exchange Raydium totalling $255,503. But this was then followed up 15 minutes later by three larger purchases of ACT via Binance totalling $377,656. Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO at Wintermute, told Decrypt that this was a “basic arbitrage” move made by its algorithm to automatically sell on Raydium while purchasing on Binance. Gaevoy was describing an arbitrage strategy, which takes advantage of the difference in the price of ACT between two liquidity pools. Meanwhile #BoycottBinance started to spread across social media as traders found a number of other meme coins on the exchange that had also crashed, including Sui based token Sudeng (HIPPO) that dropped 36.5% in an hour. “If the entire space collectively stopped using Binance, they’d no longer be the absolute terror they are [to] this industry,” pseudonymous crypto sleuth Crypto Rug Muncher posted on X. “All they do is list scams, and they’re no better than any of the other rotten CEXs out there despite their market share. Stop giving them your money, and they’d quickly become irrelevant.” Another pseudonymous on-chain detective, Dethective, highlighted that the majority of Binance listings in 2025 are currently in the red, with an average loss of 44%. Similar figures through 2024 can be seen via a Dune dashboard. Some traders believe this is because the exchange only lists “scam shitcoins” rather than focusing on legitimate projects. ACT was listed by Binance in November, causing the token to skyrocket over 2,000% over a 10 hour period from a market cap of just $21 million to about $460 million. In fact, they still call the project a “scam” to this day. The Act I project is not affiliated with any crypto token. “I have already withdrawn all my assets from the platform and will no longer conduct any trading activity on Binance.” Editor's note: This story was updated to include comment from Binance.</p>

Nintendo also shared some details about what new hardware features mean for the Switch 2 experience. And the dock will enable 4K resolution when you play on your TV. As previously announced, the Switch 2 will also play original Switch games, both physical and digital, with a Switch transfer feature available to move data over to the new console. The new Joy-Con controllers feature a magnetic attachment, as previously hinted, with larger control sticks that hopefully will be less susceptible to breaking down (or "drifting") over time. Chat, share your game screen, and hang out with friends using GameChat, a new online feature for #NintendoSwitch2! For example, the previously spotted "C" button on the right Joy-Con controller will pull up a GameChat feature that lets you connect with friends in a Discord-like audio conversation while you game. There's also a screen-sharing feature available, though even Nintendo's own stream suggested that the video quality will be pretty choppy for external observers. You can add your own image to streams via a USB camera, including one that Nintendo itself will release on day one, as well as put your face in certain supported games. GameChat will be free to use for any Switch 2 owner through March 31, 2026, though it will require a Switch Online paid subscription after that. Drive virtually everywhere in Mario Kart World, a brand-new Mario Kart game releasing exclusively on #NintendoSwitch2 as a launch title! You'll even drive between the interconnected courses alongside your rivals, with a separate Free Roam mode letting you explore all of the connected terrain. Nintendo will host another livestream dedicated to Mario Kart World on April 17 to showcase more details from the game. Nintendo also teased another racing game, Kirby's Air Riders, and a new 3D Donkey Kong game called Donkey Kong Bananza—yes, like "bananas." Meanwhile, an upgraded version of last fall's Mario Party Jamboree brings in various new features, including gameplay that uses cameras, while Kirby and the Forgotten Land adds a new world alongside visual upgrades. The stream also featured various third-party games coming to Switch 2, such as Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades 2, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Street Fighter 6, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, Hitman: World of Assassination, Borderlands 4, and enhanced versions of Sid Meier's Civilization 7 and Hogwarts Legacy. From fan favorites, highly anticipated games, and sports phenoms, take a peek at some upcoming #NintendoSwitch2 games from our publishing and developing partners shown during the #NintendoDirect! Nintendo is also working on a new Hyrule Warriors action game with Koei Tecmo, Age of Imprisonment, featuring a storyline set before the start of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The Switch 2 will also feature GameCube games available exclusively to Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, with titles like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2, and F-Zero GX offered digitally—with both local and online multiplayer available. Additional titles like Super Mario Sunshine and Luigi's Mansion are also planned for the library, with Nintendo set to sell a GameCube-like wireless controller for Switch 2 as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump will implement an exhaustive rates policy under what he calls 'Liberation Day'. Key conclusions The Bhutan government today transferred $ 32 million in Bitcoin, part of ongoing movements that total $ 95 million in two weeks. The Bhutan government today transferred $ 32 million in Bitcoin to a new portfolio, its second crypto movement in two weeks, according to Arkham Intelligence data. The Druk Holdings portfolio extends beyond Bitcoin to include Ether, Linqai, Phil and Tokens from Apu Apustaja. Although the crypto is not legal tender in Bhután, the country has been undermining Bitcoin using hydroelectric resources since 2019, accumulating crypto wealth equivalent to 30.7% of its GDP. Crypto markets prepare for volatility before Trump's tariff announcement Agne Linge, head of growth in Wefi, warned that the growing link between digital and traditional markets amplifies the vulnerability of the crypto to macroeconomic changes, especially when investors become aES avers to risk. "The recent fall in the S&P 500, reaching a new minimum, serves as a strong sign that global markets face high uncertainty, which in turn is putting pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies," Linge said in a statement. According to Linge, economic volatility indicators have exceeded the historical reference points, exceeding both the financial crisis of 2008 and pandemic in early 2020. This environment could be initially unfavorable for Bitcoin, since investors seek safe assets. Bitcoin was quoted above $ 84,000 at the time of publication, according to Coingcko.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump is set to implement a sweeping tariff policy under what he calls 'Liberation Day.' Bhutan’s government transferred $32 million worth of Bitcoin to a new wallet today, its second crypto movement in two weeks, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The transfer follows last week’s movement of $63 million in Bitcoin to three separate wallets. Druk Holdings’ portfolio extends beyond Bitcoin to include Ether, LinqAI, Phil, and Apu Apustaja tokens. While crypto is not legal tender in Bhutan, the country has been mining Bitcoin using hydroelectric resources since 2019, building crypto wealth equivalent to 30.7% of its GDP. In January, Bhutan’s newly established Gelephu Mindfulness City Special Administration Region announced plans to include Bitcoin, Ether, and BNB in its strategic reserves. Crypto markets brace for volatility ahead of Trump’s tariff announcement The Bitcoin transfer comes as markets prepare for potential volatility ahead of President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. Agne Linge, Head of Growth at WeFi, cautioned that the growing link between digital and traditional markets amplifies crypto’s vulnerability to macroeconomic changes, especially when investors become risk-averse. “The recent downturn in the S&P 500, hitting a new low, serves as a strong signal that global markets are facing heightened uncertainty, which in turn is putting pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies,” Linge noted in a statement. This environment might initially be unfavorable for Bitcoin, as investors seek safe assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin could soon find a place on state balance sheets, with Alabama and Minnesota both pressing ahead with legislative frameworks for state Bitcoin reserves. In Minnesota, House File 2946, also called the Minnesota Bitcoin Act, introduced by Rep. B. Olson (R-MN) on Tuesday, would allow the state to invest in Bitcoin directly. Its Senate counterpart, SF 2661, was introduced earlier in March. The identical bills seek to authorize the State Board of Investment to allocate public funds into Bitcoin, marking a direct acknowledgment of the digital asset’s long-term financial potential. Meanwhile in Alabama, Senate Bill 283, filed this week by Sen. April Weaver (R-AL)is a companion to House Bill 482, introduced earlier in March. Though neither bill explicitly names Bitcoin, the legislation limits eligibility to digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $750 billion. HF 2946/SF 2661 would allow the state to not only invest in Bitcoin but also accept it for tax payments and government transactions. The bill amends more than a dozen statutes to incorporate crypto, including tax codes, pension plans, and investment rules. The Alabama legislation also outlines digital assets must be held directly by the treasurer, by a qualified custodian, or via exchange-traded products, and cannot exceed 10% of any state fund. While some states, including Wyoming, Montana, and Pennsylvania, have recently paused or withdrawn their Bitcoin reserve plans, the momentum remains strong elsewhere. Oklahoma’s House Bill 1203, which allows for crypto asset reserves, passed overwhelmingly and is pending Senate review. Texas passed Senate Bill 21 to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve and is awaiting gubernatorial approval. Sentiment around the passing of a state Bitcoin reserve proposal appears to have turned negative, however. Users of MYRIAD, the decentralized prediction market launched by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN, overwhelmingly predicted that no state would implement such a reserve, in a market that closed at the end of March.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin was broadly flat on Wednesday as the crypto markets await details of Donald Trump's planned tariffs. Uncertainty looms about which products imported to the U.S. will be most affected—as well as the countries that will be hardest hit. European stocks were trading lower in the run-up to Trump's address, and according to Bloomberg, many Wall Street firms are expecting heightened volatility in the S&P 500 as details emerge. That could prove problematic for Bitcoin, as stock market sell-offs tend to have a negative impact on the world's biggest cryptocurrency. ETH is currently changing hands for $1,880.45, according to CoinGecko data. Data from Newhedge suggests the fates of BTC and U.S. equities are closely tied right now. In a note seen by Decrypt, BRN lead analyst Valentin Fournier warned the threat of a global trade war is prompting institutional investors to scale back risk exposure. Tuesday saw $158 million flow out of ETFs tracking BTC's spot price, according to SoSoValue. "Notably, this capital rotation coincides with new inflows into gold, as investors hedge against uncertainty surrounding Trump’s upcoming 'Liberation Day' announcements," he wrote. With BTC's bull run on ice, a wider question is how long Trump's tariff campaign will last and whether struggling markets will force the president to change tack. Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is slated to release its March employment numbers on Friday morning. Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, believes the president will be forced to backtrack in the next 6 to 12 months because this policy risks "choking global supply chains and hiking prices for U.S. "History teaches us that trade wars are easy to start but hard to win, and the early signs of strain are already visible across markets and boardrooms," he warned. Green went on to argue that a reversal is "almost inevitable" because "markets crave clarity, businesses need stability, and consumers demand relief."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It’s why XRP saw its early rise and why many believe a new wave of payment-based tokens could drive the next bull run. At the center of that conversation now is Remittix—a rapidly rising PayFi project that’s already being called “XRP 2.0” by those watching its growth. With $RTX continuing to gain traction in presale, some analysts are now calling it a potential 1,000x play. Ripple paved the way for blockchain-powered cross-border transactions, promising faster, cheaper international payments. But as Ripple got caught in years of regulatory uncertainty, the space was left wide open for innovation. While XRP’s strength lay in its banking partnerships, Remittix focuses on peer-to-peer and business-to-business transfers with an eye on speed, transparency, and fiat integration. The platform’s PayFi model enables users to send crypto that gets automatically converted into local fiat currency and deposited into a bank account. This removes the need for third-party off-ramps or complex exchange processes. Its price currently sits at $0.0734, with early investors already seeing sizable gains. While other projects rely on hype cycles or influencer shills, Remittix is winning over long-term holders by solving actual problems. This is what sets it apart from countless other tokens that claim utility but fail to deliver. Unlike meme coins or short-lived trends, Remittix taps into the same fundamentals that helped XRP reach a multi-billion-dollar valuation in its prime—only now, it’s doing so with better tools and a stronger foundation. The appeal of Remittix becomes clear when viewed in action. Imagine a small publishing company in Eastern Europe that sources content and design services from freelancers worldwide. Traditional banking methods are slow and costly, particularly when paying partners in countries with restrictive financial infrastructure. As the financial world continues to digitize, blockchain-based payment systems will become more embedded in daily life. Remittix is positioning itself as one of the frontrunners in that space, building an ecosystem that could see massive adoption over the next few years. With more use cases rolling out, increased exchange listings, expected post-presale, and ongoing developer updates, it’s no surprise some investors see Remittix as a 1,000x opportunity. Remittix builds on that framework but adds better user experience, decentralization, and regulatory foresight from day one. XRP made history by proving that crypto could compete with legacy financial systems. But its momentum was halted by lawsuits and outdated infrastructure. With an already strong presale, a real solution to global payment inefficiencies, and a growing community, Remittix isn’t just living up to the XRP 2.0 nickname—it’s redefining what that title means.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shiba Inu recovered with a 20% price bounce after dropping from $0.0000152 resistance SHIB maintains a bullish structure on daily timeframes despite short-term bearish pressure Shiba Inu, the second-largest meme cryptocurrency, has shown resilience in recent days following a substantial rejection from key resistance levels. The popular token is navigating mixed market conditions while its underlying blockchain infrastructure continues to demonstrate impressive growth metrics. This pullback came amid broader market uncertainty, with Bitcoin falling from $87,600 to $82,400, representing a 5.8% decline that triggered panic selling across altcoins. Despite this setback, bulls have maintained control of the overall market structure on higher timeframes. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator has been trending higher for three consecutive weeks, signaling increased buying pressure. Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain solution, reached a remarkable milestone on March 31, processing its billionth transaction since launching in August 2023. For comparison, Bitcoin needed 15 years to reach the same transaction volume. The network has mined over 10.23 million blocks with an average block time of 5 seconds, demonstrating robust performance despite early technical challenges that briefly took the system offline after its initial launch. The 4-hour chart reveals that SHIB struggled to defend short-term support levels at $0.000013 and $0.0000125 during its recent decline. Derivatives market data indicates growing optimism despite these technical hurdles. The long-to-short ratio stands at 1.0321, suggesting a positive shift, while open interest has increased 3.47% to $121.57 million. The funding rate has risen to 0.0073%, reflecting traders’ heightened expectations for a potential breakout. This points to increased whale activity that could influence price action in the coming days. AI prediction tools project a possible 63% rise later this week, with SHIB potentially reaching $0.00002069 by April 4. While sentiment appears optimistic, it’s worth noting that 85.22% of holders currently find themselves in losing positions, underscoring the volatile nature of meme cryptocurrency investments. For now, Shiba Inu maintains its position as the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. To climb into the top 10 and overtake ninth-ranked Cardano, SHIB would need a 224% price increase—still leaving it 55.56% below its all-time high.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have partnered with Hut 8 to launch American Bitcoin Corp., aiming to create one of America’s largest Bitcoin mining operations Hut 8 will contribute most of its ASIC miners for an 80% ownership stake, while the Trump brothers’ American Data Centers holds 20% Eric Trump cites being “debanked” as his motivation for entering crypto, calling Bitcoin “cheaper, faster, more transparent, uncancelable, global” The venture plans to eventually go public and can reportedly mine Bitcoin at nearly half its current trading price On Monday, Hut 8 announced it would merge with American Data Centers Inc., a company formed by investors including Eric and Donald Trump Jr. Under the agreement, Hut 8 will contribute most of its Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners to American Bitcoin. Hut 8 will serve as American Bitcoin’s exclusive infrastructure and operations partner going forward. Eric Trump will take on the role of chief strategy officer. “The vision here is to give shareholders a pure play mining company that has the ability to produce Bitcoin cheaper than just buying it,” Genoot explained. For Eric Trump, the move into cryptocurrency was spurred by personal experience with traditional banking. “I never thought I’d fall into the world of crypto—until every bank started canceling us for no reason other than my father being in politics,” Trump told host Maria Bartiromo. This experience led to what Eric Trump calls an “epiphany” about the value of cryptocurrency. “That’s when I realized how important crypto is—cheaper, faster, more transparent, uncancelable, global. It’s always been so murky that people didn’t know what guidelines to follow.” The Bitcoin mining venture appears well-positioned from an economic standpoint. Eric Trump told Bloomberg TV that the company can mine Bitcoin at “nearly half its current trading price while scaling rapidly.” He also pointed to Bitcoin’s long-term performance as a key factor in the decision. Hut 8 stock initially rose in early trading on Monday but later reversed course to close down 0.9%. Bitcoin was trading at approximately $84,900 on Tuesday, a more than 2.5% gain over 24 hours. Bitcoin miners at industry events have expressed optimism about opportunities under the Trump administration despite these concerns. The American Bitcoin venture adds to Eric Trump’s recent cryptocurrency moves. In March, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet named him to its newly formed Strategic Advisory board, citing his “business expertise and passion for Bitcoin.” For the Trump family, cryptocurrency appears to be a long-term strategy. It’s solving so many financial problems,” Eric Trump told Fox Business. “When we look out 10 years, the nature of finance and banking in this country will be very different.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These workers operate in teams, working impossibly long hours and sharing access Organizations that hire them risk espionage, data theft, and system disruption According to recent reports from Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), these workers have infiltrated projects in the UK and across Europe. This expansion comes as US authorities increase scrutiny and enforcement actions against the regime’s IT worker scheme. This shift follows heightened awareness and stricter employment verification procedures in the US. In the UK, North Korean workers have been found working on blockchain applications, including projects involving Solana and Anchor smart contract development. They’ve also worked on traditional web development and AI applications that leverage blockchain technologies. These tech workers pose serious risks to the organizations that hire them. “This places organizations that hire DPRK IT workers at risk of espionage, data theft, and disruption,” Collier warned in the report. Google identified one North Korean worker using at least 12 different personas across Europe and the US. According to Mohan Koo, co-founder and president of insider risk management firm DTEX, their research indicates the scheme is more extensive than previously thought. This level of access presents serious security concerns for affected organizations. The North Korean operation employs a team-based approach that allows them to work impossibly long hours. Rob Schuett, director of insider intelligence investigations at DTEX, explained that these workers typically show anomalous login patterns. “What we see with the DPRK worker is completely anomalous compared to everybody else, meaning you’ll see a login time that runs an extremely long amount of time and then there is no logout activity,” Schuett said. DTEX observed instances where workers remained logged in for four to five days continuously, with one case lasting three weeks. This unusual productivity occurs because the North Korean workers share their desktop access with other co-conspirators who have similar technical skills. Since late October 2024, North Korean IT workers have increased extortion attempts, targeting larger organizations. The data at risk includes proprietary information and source code for internal projects. The rise in extortion coincides with increased US law enforcement actions. This suggests pressure on these workers to maintain revenue streams through more aggressive measures. Now, suspecting their true identities have been discovered, they resort to extortion. The firm estimates thousands of critical infrastructure organizations have been infiltrated by North Korean operatives. Once hired, these workers move quickly to further infiltrate the organization. They pivot into virtual desktop infrastructure environments and use their access to target trusted partners, creating supply chain risks. Nearly 40% of CrowdStrike’s incident response cases involving North Korea last year were insider-threat operations. Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 reported that insider threats tied to North Korea tripled in 2024. In January, the US Justice Department indicted two North Korean nationals for their involvement in a fraudulent IT work scheme involving at least 64 US companies from April 2018 to August 2024. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also sanctioned companies accused of being fronts for North Korea that generated revenue via remote IT work schemes. Koo from DTEX suggests it’s “inconceivable” to think these workers won’t eventually plant backdoors, disable critical infrastructure, or commit other forms of sabotage. Organizations can take steps to identify potential threats during the hiring process. Security professionals recommend requiring remote job candidates to be on camera and show government-issued identification. “We can see other people in the room with them taking an interview,” Schuett said. Other red flags include long pauses during interviews and inconsistencies on resumes, such as claimed expertise in technologies before they were widely available. Human resources professionals and recruiters serve as the first line of defense. North Korean technical workers “don’t ask how your kid did in soccer last night,” Schuett noted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bybit announced the closure of its NFT and Inscription marketplaces effective April 8, 2025 The shutdown is part of a broader industry trend as NFT trading volumes have fallen over 95% from peak levels Other major platforms including X2Y2, Kraken, RTFKT, and LG have also recently exited the NFT marketplace business Bybit’s decision comes weeks after suffering a $1.4 billion hack attributed to North Korea First quarter 2025 NFT sales dropped 63% year-over-year, though some collections like Pudgy Penguins and Doodles showed growth Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit announced it will shut down its NFT marketplace on April 8, joining a growing list of major platforms abandoning the once-booming digital collectibles sector. The decision comes as NFT trading volumes have plummeted more than 95% from their 2021 peak. In an April 1 statement, Bybit said it would close its NFT Marketplace, Inscription Marketplace, and Initial DEX Offering (IDO) product pages as part of an effort to “streamline offerings and enhance user experience.” Users have been advised to transfer assets from their Bybit web3 wallets before the deadline. Several other major platforms have made similar moves in recent months, pointing to a broader market shift. Just days earlier, Ethereum NFT marketplace X2Y2 announced it would shut down its trading platform at the end of April. Kraken also closed its NFT marketplace on February 27, saying it needed to reallocate resources toward “new products and services.” Nike-owned RTFKT ceased operations in January following steep declines in the value of its NFT collections. Television manufacturer LG plans to close its NFT platform, LG Art Lab, on June 17, stating it’s “the right time to shift our focus and explore new opportunities.” Sales in March alone were down 76% compared to the prior year. The number of active wallets engaging in NFT trades has plummeted from over half a million at the market’s height to less than 20,000 today, according to blockchain analytics firm DappRadar. Charu Sethi, president at NFT-focused Polkadot and Kusama chain Unique Network, told Cointelegraph that “the speculative phase focused on collectibles and trading is over, but NFTs are now entering their next growth era as core infrastructure.” This shift may explain why some collections have bucked the downward trend. Doodles also performed well, benefiting from a recent partnership with McDonald’s to hit $32 million in quarterly sales. Milady Maker was another collection that outperformed market expectations, according to recent reports. NFT project Gutter Cat Gang (GCG) reportedly had a difficult token launch for its GANG token on Apechain on March 31, attributed to a “technical issue” by the team. The NFT Paris conference in February 2025 drew an estimated 20,000 attendees, suggesting continued interest from creators and collectors even as investor enthusiasm wanes. Industry analysts point to a shift from purely speculative trading toward utility-based applications. Future growth may come from gaming, AI, fan engagement, and content authentication rather than digital art speculation. Users of Bybit’s NFT and Inscription marketplaces have until April 8 at 4:00 pm UTC to manage their assets before the platform becomes inaccessible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Circle, the company behind USDC stablecoin, has filed for an IPO aiming to list on NYSE under ticker “CRCL” JPMorgan and Citigroup are leading the IPO with a valuation target of $4-5 billion This marks Circle’s second IPO attempt after a failed SPAC merger in 2022 This marks Circle’s second attempt to go public. That deal collapsed in late 2022 due to regulatory challenges and timing issues with the SEC. Circle has positioned itself closer to global finance since its failed SPAC attempt. The company moved its headquarters from Boston to One World Trade Center in New York as part of this strategy. The company posted net income of about $156 million for 2024. This valuation is lower than the $9 billion figure from February 2022 when Circle revised its SPAC merger terms. Most of Circle’s revenue comes from interest generated by the assets backing USDC. According to unaudited financial statements from early 2023, interest income generated 99% of the firm’s revenue. President Donald Trump has taken a pro-crypto stance since taking office. Trump has stated he hopes lawmakers will send stablecoin legislation to his desk before Congress’s August recess. This potential regulation has boosted confidence in the stablecoin sector. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee advanced a stablecoin bill in March 2025. This improved regulatory outlook has given more assurance to firms in the crypto space. Bernstein has described this sector as a “systemically important” part of the crypto market. Ripple, another major blockchain player, is reportedly considering going public despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny from the SEC. Coinbase has a close relationship with Circle and USDC. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has stated a “stretch goal to make USDC the number 1 stablecoin.” This partnership could help USDC compete against Tether, which currently holds 67% of the stablecoin market. Circle faced challenges in March 2023 when it revealed that $3.3 billion of its reserves were stuck at the failing Silicon Valley Bank. USDC briefly lost its $1 peg but recovered after regulators stepped in to backstop the bank. Despite this setback, USDC’s market cap has recovered and now sits at an all-time high of around $60 billion. This recovery demonstrates market confidence in the stablecoin and Circle’s management. The IPO market has shown signs of improvement in 2025. So far this year, 73 companies have gone public on U.S. exchanges, a 70% increase from 2024, with the total value reaching $11.8 billion. Several well-known companies have filed to go public alongside Circle. Circle’s public debut will occur as tech stocks face volatility. The Nasdaq recently wrapped up its steepest quarterly drop since 2022, creating a challenging environment for new tech listings.</p>

It adds that “a resolution would conserve judicial resources” and notes that “no party or non-party would be prejudiced by a stay.” If granted, the parties would submit a joint status report within 60 days. The regulator alleged that Gemini and crypto lending firm Genesis Global Capital offered unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program. Genesis later filed for bankruptcy in January 2023. These belonged to roughly 340,000 Gemini Earn customers who could not access their funds. Genesis did not admit wrongdoing as part of this settlement. Gemini has denied any wrongdoing in the case. The exchange is run by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who Forbes magazine estimates are worth $3 billion each. The letter does not specify what a possible resolution might look like. This potential resolution comes amid a changing regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency in the United States. Cameron Winklevoss commented on this development saying, “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation.” These include cases against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. The regulator also agreed to settle a case against Ripple Labs over the unregistered sale of securities. OpenSea, Crypto.com, and Uniswap have all recently reported that the SEC closed probes into their operations. These investigations were examining alleged breaches of securities laws. The Winklevoss twins were among industry leaders who participated in the White House Crypto Summit in March 2025. The case is officially listed as SEC v Gemini Trust Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. Both parties are now awaiting the court’s decision on their request for a 60-day pause.</p>

Their strategic guidance ensures Vaulta stays compliant, credible, and ready for mass adoption.” This feature has been gaining traction as traditional financial institutions like BlackRock expand their crypto presence. The EOS team has also announced that Vaulta will bring Web3 to portfolio investments, including real estate and commodities, through Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. This breakout suggests a potential shift from bearish to bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for EOS stands at 77, indicating a surge in buying activity. The Bull Bear Power reading has been increasing since March 18, suggesting that bears have found it challenging to keep bulls out of the picture. This pattern often signals the potential for a longer-term upward move. Another factor driving EOS’s recent gains is the project’s upcoming rebranding to Vaulta, expected to go live by the end of May 2025. The rebranding comes with a shift in focus toward blockchain-powered banking solutions. This rate is much higher than those offered by major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (2.03%) and Solana (5.14%). Testing Multiple Trendlines, Successful Breakout Could Send It Towards 1$. Social media metrics also point to growing interest in EOS. Data from Santiment shows that social dominance around EOS has jumped to 0.31%, indicating rising market attention. This price point represents both a major psychological level and a technical target that EOS hasn’t reached since mid-December last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Breez SDK was initially developed to simplify the process of integrating Lightning Network support into different consumer applications. Dozens of existing projects and companies currently build on Lightning using the SDK. The SDK supports two methods of Lightning integration. Native, which allows app developers to integrate a Lightning wallet or functionality utilizing the Greenlight service offered by Blockstream, which allows the wallet provider to host a cloud based Lightning node for users while keeping private keys solely in the users control, and Nodeless, which allows Liquid support to seamlessly integrate with the Lightning Network. Misty Breez is built on the Nodeless SDK tooling. The wallet supports BOLT 11 and BOLT 12 invoices, LNURL-Pay, Lightning Addresses, on-chain BTC addresses, and even Matt Corrallo’s BIP 353 using DNS to fetch payment details for another user’s wallet. It also supports offline payments based on mobile notifications in the phone’s operating system. Breez SDK’s goal is to provide developers with the tooling to build a seamless and use-case specific user experience with as little effort as possible. In that vein Misty Breez aims to set a benchmark for a simplified user experience that other developers can use as a reference for Lightning integration into their own applications, or even to build on top of Misty Breez itself. If you want, feel free to simply integrate the functionality you seek to build into Misty Breez itself and rebrand it however you want (it is 100% opensource).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Born out of a hackathon at TABCONF 2024, Frostr may have just solved Nostr’s most pernicious issue: the inability to reset your password if your private key gets compromised. Started in October of 2024, Frostr just announced the alpha release of Igloo and Frost2x, a desktop and accompanying browser extension key signers for the Nostr ecosystem. And yet, we find ourselves in a strange place with our digital identities. Who we are online and how we assert ownership of our online profiles often depends on trusted third parties like Facebook that are too big to care about any individual customer and fundamentally have the power to change the rules at any time, or even cancel your account altogether. Still, much of the world continues to operate on this digital neo-feudalism structure. It seems there’s a fundamental problem with the “decentralization” of identity that is yet to be solved. Whether you are a citizen of Rome 2,000 years ago or of the United States today, doors open and close based on what ID you hold. Today’s systems, as advanced as they may seem, rely on a pre-digital conception of identity and security: They depend on authenticating your face. (For example, the Equifax Data Breach in 2017, which affected 147.9 million Americans, or the National Public Data Breach of 2024 with over 200 million Americans compromised.) Fiat payments are often reversible, so if you hack into a bank and move money to your account somehow, not only can that be reversed, but you just exposed a link to your identity. Today, the online equivalent of a robber is not looking to steal cash, gold or other valuables, but rather, personal identity data. Indeed, identity fraud costs more than all other forms of theft combined, totaling over $56 billion in 2020. Not only have many of these centralized platforms had their data vaults hacked and their contents sold on the dark web for pennies on the dollar, but AI is improving quickly and has already passed the Turing test of image generation. We are at a point where rogue actors can create fake selfies holding fake IDs with leaked user data and fool the gatekeepers to your digital wealth. Take California’s mobile driver’s license app as an example, mDL — developed in partnership with both Google and Apple — is initially integrated with airports for identity verification. But the app also invites developers to integrate it as a form of authentication for websites in general. ID.me takes a similar approach and is already fully integrated with the IRS, boasting 136 million members. Many of these apps require face or fingerprint authentication, and ask for increasingly complex KYC selfies from their users who must hold up IDs and recent newspapers to be authenticated. Despite the obvious weakness of using your face to authenticate your identity in the age of Facebook, tech giants continue to rely on biometric data, combining it with mass surveillance tools seen in the social credit score systems being built up in China. We need an identity system that does not rely on our face. Born out of the Bitcoin developer ecosystem, Nostr has quickly grown into a social media network in its own right. As a self-custody system that fundamentally democratizes the internet away from its current structure, it opens up a whole new set of possibilities for social media. Proponents of Nostr argue that users can finally own their own data and no longer need to depend on the charity or benevolence of the Silicon Valley giants when they decide to move platforms or pick the wrong political party. Nostr works via a distributed client-server network topology, which allows you to access content across various servers called relays. If one goes down or starts censoring users unfairly, chances are there’s another window into the Nostr content feed that will grant you access and allow you to publish your thoughts. The dream of Nostr is to unlock a new generation of social media technology that does not turn users into products by mining their data, that does not force biometric authentication, compromising their privacy, and that allows developers to build in an open network whose cryptography and specs are already open source and which is natively integrated with Bitcoin, the internet’s money. Pushing identity ownership to the edges comes with a whole new set of problems that up until now have not really been solved and which have personally held me back from investing in building up my brand on Nostr. There’s currently no real way to reset your password for a Nostr nym or identity. Built on a simple public key pair system, if your private key gets hacked or leaked, your identity is essentially now under the control of whoever got it. (You both have the secret, so no one has exclusive control of it.) Although the examples of such hacks are not too common, they are a significant deterrent for brands that might consider putting serious capital into building on this new social network protocol. This particular risk is made worse by the intended design of Nostr, which invites many different interfaces to be created to access content of various kinds with the same user identities and means that users give their private keys to multiple clients, thus multiplying the risk of compromise. While this works well enough today it doesn’t solve the fundamental problem. One mistake and the nym is effectively compromised, the value of that built-up brand or reputation not just harmed but potentially exploitable by scammers wearing your identity to harass your friends or customers. This is similar to the very common impersonation scams on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which clone your profile and DM your known associates with phishing schemes, but even worse. In Nostr such an attack would be done with your identity — not a fake profile — significantly harming confidence in the authenticity of all content for those who are aware of the issue. The solution should be simple: just create a password reset feature. Well, it turns out some very creative engineering is needed here, because password resets are basically only possible by giving up your control over your identity to a third party who can update a central database and give you a new key set. One specific innovation that is quickly entering the market is Frost, a Schnorr-based key management and key rotation scheme that achieves similar functionality as Bitcoin multi-signature addresses and transactions, but without the on-chain transactions costs or privacy trade-offs. A few years after the expiration of its European and U.S. patents, Schnorr started being discussed as a possible future upgrade to Bitcoin, and was ultimately introduced in the Taproot soft fork upgrade of 2020. That same year Chelsea Komlo and Ian Goldberg published “FROST: Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures”, a technical spec that set the foundation for its use in the Lightning Network infrastructure as well as new multi-signature schemes for self custody known as FROST. The cryptographic principles involved allow users to create a 24-word seed with Trezor’s hardware wallet, split up into three shares of 12 words each. This same principle is used in FROST, a scheme which is designed to enable multi-party, multi-signature wallets, like those used by exchanges, potentially replacing multi-signature Bitcoin scripts, benefiting users with more privacy and lower costs. It also adapts the technology to single-user wallets, rather than industrial-grade, multi-user schemes, allowing simpler setups and unlocking key rotation (password resets) for individual users with single key pairs, like those used in Nostr. Threshold key signing, so that if one key gets compromised, it can be rotated out, and a fresh set of sub keys are generated, which generate the Nostr private keypair. No need to change your Nostr public and private keys (nsec). Similar to — for example — a 2-of-3 multisignature Bitcoin wallet, where if one key is lost or compromised, the other two can be used to move the coins to a new stable structure, and regain control of three fresh keys, but off-chain. No need for application-layer solutions to Nostr key rotation, only the key signers like Alby would have to integrate Frostr; Nostr apps like Primal or Damus would not even know that Frostr is being used for key rotation by its users. Users who already have Nostr accounts, whose nsecs have not been compromised, do not need to migrate to new keypairs and identities but simply remove their nsecs from current key signers and start using Frostr as a more secure key management system instead. A major piece of the decentralized social media puzzle is unlocked: Trustless identities with password resets that do not depend on centralized gatekeepers for authentication. The Nostr ecosystem would be wise to take a look at Frostr; it might just be enough of a security and UI improvement that a whole new generation of non-biometric, trustless digital identities, and sovereign data ownership use cases are unlocked for the Bitcoin age. For a deeper dive into Frostr, check out their website at Frostr.org or have a look at this podcast I recorded with Topher and Austin on the topic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whales accumulated over 220 million DOGE throughout March, signaling strong buying interest Major resistance levels at $0.18 and $0.21 could be catalysts for the next bull run if broken Analyst Javon Marks predicts a potential 270% rally for DOGE, targeting $0.65 in the long term The buying pressure has been instrumental in pushing prices higher. The uptick is supported by growth in Dogecoin’s derivatives market. Trading volume for the cryptocurrency also saw a 22% increase, reaching $1.22 billion. A key factor behind the recent price movement appears to be whale activity. Large investors accumulated over 220 million Dogecoin throughout March, suggesting strong buying pressure from major market players. This accumulation by whales signals growing optimism about DOGE’s future price trajectory. When large holders increase their positions, it often precedes upward price movements. The increased whale activity coincides with technical indicators pointing to further upside potential. A falling wedge breakout pattern has emerged, which typically precedes price rallies. Dogecoin’s four-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered oversold territory, which often signals a price bottom. Analyst Ali Martinez has identified two major resistance levels for Dogecoin based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). These price points represent psychological barriers where investors who bought at these levels might be inclined to sell when the price returns to their break-even point. Martinez notes that breaking through both levels “could be the catalyst for the next major bull rally” as there are no other supply walls as large in sight beyond these points. Technical analysis shows a bullish crossover on Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index, suggesting that buyers have regained control of the market. Dogecoin’s Long/Short Ratio further confirms this trend, with longs spiking to 71.47% over the past day. Success at this level could strengthen its position for a push toward $0.19. Looking further ahead, analyst Javon Marks has made a more ambitious prediction. Marks suggests that Dogecoin could rally over 270% from current levels, potentially reaching $0.65 in the long run. His analysis shows historical correlation between price rallies and the pattern of higher lows. The recent breakout from a descending triangle pattern is seen as confirmation of this bullish setup. Despite previous downward trends that saw Dogecoin decline by 5.45% weekly and 15.5% monthly, the current market indicators suggest a potential reversal of this trend. With Bitcoin maintaining its current pace and technical indicators aligning favorably, Dogecoin appears well-positioned for potential price increases in the coming weeks.</p>

Community members have expressed dissatisfaction with the Core Team’s communication approach. Critics argue that monthly updates are predictable and insufficient for maintaining an engaged community. The exchange rate maintains its position within this support interval while trading at $0.7212. Market movements in this zone demonstrate a balance between bullish and bearish pressures. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a neutral value of 50.46, indicating indecisive market conditions. Previous market upward movements occurred when the RSI value fell below 30 during oversold conditions. The Pi Network has made several controversial moves recently, including strengthening its Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols. Pi Network is adding email-based two-factor authentication to the overall account management and verification. https://t.co/UeoJ0F8H17 This change addresses challenges with current SMS (text message) account verification, improves security, and lays the groundwork for future… — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) March 29, 2025 These decisions, along with allegations from prominent figures in the crypto industry who claim that Pi is a scam, have contributed to depressing its price. The Pi Network’s base mining rate has also dropped by 1.18% this month, now standing at 0.0029030 π per hour. This adjustment continues the network’s trend of gradual mining rate reductions. Some community members speculate that the declining interest in mining may be linked to Pi’s current low trading value on exchanges. Despite talks of the Pi Network listing on top crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, these have not materialized so far. Market experts suggest monitoring both RSI and MACD indicators as they provide clear signals for investors. The Pi Network Mainnet Launch has been highly anticipated, with many expecting a price rally. However, market changes have caused concern among investors after Pi Coin fell by 68% during its latest dip.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is struggling to maintain support at $1,900 after recovering from the $1,750 level ETH options worth $2.13 billion expired on March 28, creating market uncertainty ETH’s leverage ratio reached a new all-time high, with nearly $100 million in long liquidations Ethereum price has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent days, recovering from support levels but facing strong resistance as it approaches the $1,920 mark. The cryptocurrency market has been watching ETH closely as it battles to regain momentum after a period of selling pressure. Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $1,820 and $1,850 levels recently. However, sellers have become active near the $1,920 zone. Currently, Ethereum is trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $1,860 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, Ethereum faces several key resistance levels that may determine its short-term price action. However, if Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could start another decline. A major market event occurred when an Ethereum early adopter, referred to as an “Ethereum OG,” sold their last 2,001 ETH for $3.82 million. The transaction took place at a price of $1,909 per ETH and has sparked discussions about shifting dynamics in the Ethereum market. Following this large sale, Ethereum’s price experienced a slight dip of 0.5%, dropping to $1,899. This movement coincided with a surge in trading volume, with 1.2 million ETH traded in the hour following the sale. ETH has been struggling to maintain the $1,900 price level after approximately $2.13 billion worth of Ethereum options expired on March 28th. ETH had a 0.39 call-put ratio, which is traditionally considered favorable for bulls. This is an important price level because it previously served as a support zone. However, selling pressure has forced ETH to remain under this mark for now. Adding to the concerns, ETH’s estimated leverage ratio reached a new all-time high recently. As a result, the market was primed for liquidation events. Data revealed that two wallets received 14,064 ETH from Chainflip and Thorchain. These addresses then sold the ETH at a $1,956 price tag, receiving about $26.87 million worth of DAI. Traders and investors are closely watching key support and resistance levels as ETH attempts to regain its footing in a volatile market environment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Price could test $0.73 resistance with some analysts predicting eventual rise to $2 Cardano’s price has been consolidating around $0.67, showing early signs of potential recovery despite significant ecosystem challenges. The third-generation blockchain has experienced a steep decline from its December peak, falling nearly 50% as network activity slowed substantially. This price action comes amid a broader downturn in the platform’s on-chain metrics. This continues a downward trajectory that began after fees peaked at $977,000 in December 2024. This revenue decline coincides with substantial capital outflows from major Cardano applications. Other protocols experienced even steeper losses, with Liqwid, Indigo, Splash Protocol, and Lenfi each seeing asset reductions exceeding 40%. The performance gap between Cardano and competing networks has become increasingly apparent. Even Sonic, a relatively new blockchain that rebranded from Fantom, produced more than $200,000 in the same period. These metrics have fueled criticism from some quarters of the crypto industry, with detractors labeling Cardano a “ghost chain” due to its relatively underdeveloped application ecosystem compared to other major layer-1 networks like Solana and BNB Chain. Despite these fundamental challenges, technical indicators suggest Cardano may be preparing for a bounce. This technical support has so far prevented further declines despite broader market uncertainty. Cardano now faces immediate resistance at approximately $0.73, which aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. The 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is also approaching this resistance, making it a key level for bulls to overcome. Some analysts remain optimistic about Cardano’s long-term prospects despite near-term challenges. Elliott Wave theorists suggest the current price action represents the second bearish phase of a larger pattern, which is typically followed by a third phase characterized by extended bullish momentum. Under this scenario, Cardano could eventually reach $2, which corresponds to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from all-time highs. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has warned that if Cardano cannot reclaim the critical $0.70-$0.80 range, it could face a deeper correction toward the $0.31-$0.24 range—a decline of more than 50% from current levels. The coming days will be crucial for determining Cardano’s direction.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A bearish divergence has emerged on SOL’s weekly chart, testing critical support levels Solana (SOL) finds itself at a critical juncture after falling from its recent all-time high of $295. The cryptocurrency is now testing key support levels as traders closely monitor technical indicators to determine its next move. After reaching new heights just three months ago, the altcoin has faced increased volatility and downward pressure. Market experts have identified a bearish divergence on SOL’s weekly chart. This pattern suggests weakening momentum despite previous price increases and has raised concerns about further downside risk. Currently, SOL is testing horizontal support that has held over the past year. This support coincides with the Fibonacci 0.618 level at around $117, creating a critical zone that must hold to prevent deeper drops. Traders are watching this indicator closely for signs of a potential reversal. Despite technical concerns, excitement continues to build around a potential Solana ETF. If approved, this could unlock substantial institutional investment and drive a new wave of adoption. Analysts believe approval could propel SOL toward the $180-$200 range, potentially setting new all-time highs. With the RWA market potentially worth $240 trillion, Solana’s fast transactions and low fees make it a strong contender in this space. Solana’s price action suggests we’re approaching a pivotal moment. The $109-$130 range has emerged as a key battleground between bulls and bears. However, a breakdown below $105 would confirm bearish control and likely trigger deeper corrections. Market participants are closely watching for confirmation of either a bounce or breakdown. #Polymarket is now pricing in the chances of a #Solana #ETF approval at just under 90%. Despite the bearish flag pattern on daily charts, some indicators display hidden bullish divergence. Trading volume has decreased during this consolidation period, indicating reduced market activity. Bulls have defended the $123 support since March 2024, suggesting continued buying interest at these levels. External factors like the announcement of new tariffs could increase volatility and push prices lower.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Trump is making friends in the cryptosphere! World Liberty Financial (WLF) is working on its own USD-backed stablecoin – and Trump is handing out pardons across the board. Biden and Gens…wait…what was his name again? Anyway those losers are long gone and now Big Daddy Trump is pimp-slapping the anti-crypto squad right across the face. Thankfully the USA isn’t Iran or North Korea – yet – so Biden and his crew won’t face no-casket funerals. We knew Trump would be good for crypto. Hey snowflakes – you feel safe now? If you’re feeling triggered – talk to state security – they carry weapons with triggers! It looks like President Trump is more than cleaning the Federal “house” in the USA. McTrumper is burning the house down! Four years down the drain for whoever was running that dog and pony show. In addition to ripping apart existing anti-crypto policy in the USA, McTrumper is pardoning everyone but SBF. BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo all received full McTrumper pardons. We think Trump is looking for business opportunities – and people who will help him grow into the next boom market – crypto! Fascism was originally used in the 1930s to unify state and private interests with violence – at every level. Norway didn’t do this BTW – they learned from earlier mistakes and gave away loads of cash. One could be forgiven for thinking Trump&Co. are taking a few pages from the 1930s fascist playbook – and aligning the state with private interests. Namely – the President’s business interests. Now that Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo are all free – thanks to McTrumper – they are all more than likely to work with WLF in whatever capacity the company desires. Don’t look down on them – we would take the same deal! No less a charlatan than Jim Cramer thinks SBF will be the next crypto felon to get the tap. SBF seems like a low value asset at this point. If you look at Cramer as a Wall St. sell-side marketer without ethics of any sort – his brilliance stands alone. No, we think President Trump has something much larger brewing. We go on and on about how cryptos are never going to be money (at least anytime soon). Take at look here for more on that: The use of stablecoins is screaming higher. While the total amount (market cap) of stablecoins isn’t impressive, their overall volume is incredible. “The use of stablecoins has increased in recent years with the average supply of stablecoins in circulation increasing roughly 28% year-over-year. Total transfer volume, meanwhile, hit $27.6 trillion last year, surpassing the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard transactions in 2024.” WLF is already planning to issue its own stablecoin (USD1) – and the US Dems are furious. The US opposition says that USD1 poses huge risks to the US financial system – yeah right! Did something really bad happen to the US Military? are also planning to work with Crypto.com on investment products that could take the form of ETFs. BTW – the SEC just dropped its investigation into Crypto.com. What’s He Building In There? The Trump-era crypto policy shift is welcome – but we wonder what Trump&Co. Clearly Trump wants into crypto in a big way. He is setting up the pieces for a big move into new crypto products – with his interests at the center of his policy moves. Trump sees that stablecoins are a way to shore up demand for the USD, and finance the next generation of USG borrowing. With global access to the USD market – there is no limit to how much the USG can expand its market size. Unlike the USD cash market – all stablecoin transactions are recorded on a blockchain. We have zero doubt that Trump wants to make big money on the shift to blockchain-based assets. But we think there is a security angle here too. It is a perfect fit for Trump – money and power! If you want to use common sense around here – don’t bother. There are two major themes you need to understand going forward: The US Financial system can be the epicenter of a global collapse – and the USD/bond market will thrive (it happened in 2008-9 – and will happen again). It will rarely be prosecuted – and in most cases – the more corrupt you are, the higher you rise (take a look at the USG). What a pretty dress you have on today. It isn’t about any kind of colored pill – black, white, red, whatever color you like – it’s about reality. Your stupid as f#^k opinions don’t matter. If you think we are wrong – go find a safe space circa 2015. Just so everyone knows – we don’t mind what McTrumper and Musk et al. are doing in the cryptosphere. We worry about what they are building.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It looks like GameStop is ready for its first Bitcoin purchase. According to a new SEC filing, the offering, completed on April 1, saw strong demand, which allowed GameStop to fully exercise the initial purchaser’s option to sell an additional $200 million in notes beyond the initially planned $1.3 billion. The notes, which will mature on April 1, 2030, are unsecured obligations of the company and carry a 0.00% interest rate. This means that investors will not receive regular interest payments. Michael Saylor’s firm often leverages zero-interest convertible notes to raise capital without immediate dilution, offering investors potential upside through stock conversions. After January 1, 2030, holders can convert the notes at any time before maturity, regardless of these conditions. Upon conversion, GameStop retains the flexibility to settle its obligation in cash, shares, or a combination of both. The initial conversion rate is set at 33.4970 shares of GameStop stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, translating to an initial conversion price of approximately $29.85 per share. While GameStop cannot redeem the notes before April 6, 2028, it has the option to do so thereafter if its stock price meets a certain threshold. GameStop proposed the private offering on March 26 after confirming its plans to invest in Bitcoin. At the time, it was said to also mull over other cryptocurrencies to see whether it made sense to put one or some of them on its balance sheet. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen also met with Strategy’s Saylor in early February. Some remarkable examples are Rumble, a video-sharing platform and cloud services provider, and Metaplanet, a Tokyo-listed company often referred to as “Asia’s Strategy.” The decision came after CEO Chris Pavlovski’s poll that resulted in 93.9% of respondents voting in favor of the move. The company then made its first Bitcoin purchase in March, scooping approximately 188 Bitcoin at an average price of $91,000 per coin, totaling $17.1 million. GameStop (GME) shares surged after its first Bitcoin announcement, but plummeted over 20% shortly thereafter. Factors behind the decline could vary, but many experts suggest that investors could be uncertain about how GameStop’s pivot to Bitcoin makes sense for its struggling retail business. Initial excitement among retail investors, who often follow GameStop as a “meme stock,” quickly gave way to skepticism. Investors are concerned about whether this move will help stabilize or grow the company’s core business.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto analysts divided on price direction with some predicting a drop to $73,000 Trade war impact on Bitcoin may be overstated compared to other market factors Bitcoin prices remain in a state of flux as markets await President Donald Trump’s upcoming “Liberation Day” tariffs, scheduled to roll out this Wednesday and Thursday. Currently trading around $85,000, the leading cryptocurrency faces a critical juncture that could determine its short-term price direction. Traders are watching closely as $9.41 billion in short positions could face liquidation if Bitcoin reaches the $90,000 mark. This potential short squeeze might trigger even higher prices if the market continues moving upward. The cryptocurrency is now trading below its 200-day average, while 24-hour liquidations remain low at under $250 million. This indicates momentum could again be on the downside, according to market watchers. “Unlike gold, bitcoin has a growth component, meaning it reacts to economic trends and liquidity cycles,” Butterfill explained. Initially, tariffs could slow economic growth, reducing demand for risk assets like Bitcoin. Inflation would also increase, leading to speculation on higher interest rates. Tariffs could cause a temporary price drop, as crypto often correlates with stock markets. Despite Bitcoin’s recent struggles to break above $89,000, several other factors had already been weighing on investor sentiment long before the tariff announcements. “We really could go either way right now, showing just how uncertain the current macro backdrop is,” he said. If tariff news is milder than expected, Puckrin anticipates a potential breakout with $88,000 as the short-term price to watch. The crypto Fear & Greed Index is still hovering around fear, which Puckrin said could indicate that the market is at or very close to a low. The firm noted that retail traders loaded up on memecoins during Bitcoin’s postelection rally to record highs in January. 10X said that Bitcoin would need a refreshed narrative to power the next major upward swing. Some analysts point to broader market factors affecting Bitcoin’s performance. The weakening job market dampens traders’ demand for risk-on assets, including Bitcoin. In February, the US Labor Department reported job openings near a four-year low. This data suggests rising risk aversion, which is unfavorable for Bitcoin. As of Tuesday, Bitcoin traded near $85,000, up 2.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent weeks, volatility has once again returned to the crypto market. As headlines focus on new tariffs, unresolved lawsuits, and roadmap delays from some of the biggest names in the space, traders are beginning to reassess what they want from their holdings. Instead of chasing hype or momentum, many are looking for projects with real-world application and a clear direction. There’s no denying that recent macroeconomic tensions are affecting crypto. Trade policy decisions, including sudden tariff announcements, have left many investors on edge. Major tokens are reacting in kind, with price dips and reduced momentum. This shift has created space for new, utility-focused projects to gain traction. Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to give users control over their digital assets. Instead of locking capital into idle wallets, users can supply assets and earn interest through automated smart contracts. The platform doesn’t rely on custodians or middlemen, ensuring transparency and trustless execution. One connects borrowers and lenders via shared liquidity pools with real-time rate adjustments based on pool usage. The other model allows users to create one-on-one loan agreements, offering flexibility—especially for tokens that aren’t traditionally accepted in pooled systems. One of Mutuum Finance’s standout features is its mtToken system. These mtTokens also maintain utility, meaning they can be transferred, stored, or potentially used in other DeFi applications. It’s a model designed for both functionality and passive growth. The protocol’s reward mechanism also plays a big role in long-term value. Mutuum Finance is currently in the fourth stage of its presale, priced at $0.025 per token. More than $5.9 million has already been raised, and over 7,600 holders have joined the ecosystem. Earlier presale rounds sold out quickly, and demand continues to rise as the token approaches its next price tier. This current phase may be the last chance for investors to secure MUTM at its lowest price. With strong momentum, transparent mechanics, and a growing community, MUTM is positioning itself as a serious contender in the DeFi space—especially as traders continue to move away from hype and look toward meaningful, utility-driven projects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Smarter Web Company, founded in 2009 by Andrew Webley, has announced plans to go public on the AQUIS Stock Exchange in April 2025 through a reverse takeover of a business originally incorporated in 1907. Since 2023, The Smarter Web Company has accepted Bitcoin as payment. Now, as it prepares to list its shares, it’s laying the groundwork for a formal Digital Assets Treasury Policy—one that includes holding Bitcoin alongside cash. As the company pursues both organic growth and strategic acquisitions post-listing, Bitcoin will serve as part of its long-term capital preservation toolkit—a move echoing the playbooks of early movers like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet. The company’s plans have already attracted aligned investors. In January 2025, The Smarter Web Company closed a pre-IPO funding round of more than £1 million, backed by UTXO Management—a Bitcoin-focused investment manager and operator of the hedge fund 210k Capital, LP. UTXO and other mission-aligned backers are building a new class of public company—firms with long-term Bitcoin alignment and treasury discipline integrated from the start. Once listed, The Smarter Web Company will become one of the first UK-listed businesses to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy from day one. Most publicly traded companies that hold Bitcoin did so as a pivot or response to broader macro shifts. Smarter Web is taking a different route—baking Bitcoin into its financial DNA before it ever hits the public markets. This signals something much larger than a single company’s conviction. It shows that the Bitcoin treasury model is becoming accessible, practical, and strategically relevant for companies beyond the usual early adopters. You don’t need a multibillion-dollar balance sheet to begin integrating Bitcoin into your corporate strategy—you need alignment, vision, and a framework that prioritizes capital preservation and long-term value. For mid-sized and growth-stage businesses, Bitcoin increasingly fits the bill. The same financial pressures that push large enterprises toward more efficient capital strategies—persistent inflation, fiat depreciation, and the opportunity cost of holding idle cash—apply equally, if not more urgently, to smaller firms operating in competitive environments. It’s portable, non-sovereign, resistant to dilution, and optimized for long time horizons. For companies seeking to store the value they’ve earned today and deploy it tomorrow without losing purchasing power, Bitcoin represents a new operating standard—not just a hedge. As public company disclosures begin post-listing, The Smarter Web Company has committed to including material treasury updates alongside core business performance—a level of transparency that will give investors and analysts insight into how digital assets play a role in managing corporate capital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Bitcoin miners continue to face challenges, with 14 top public companies in the space collectively having their worst month on record in March, according to investment bank JP Morgan. In a Tuesday report, the Wall Street giant said that the Bitcoin miners it tracks, which include the likes of MARA and Core Scientific, collectively shed 25%—or about $6 billion—of their value market cap last month. Analysts at the bank Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce added in their report that companies with high-powered computing exposure “generally underperformed pure-play miners for the second consecutive month.” Some Bitcoin miners have branched out to the AI data center industry in a bid to earn more cash. The data from the investment bank comes after the 14 miners also struggled in February, when they also lost over 20%—again around $6 billion—of their combined market cap. President Donald Trump promised to help the digital asset industry on the campaign trail, and specifically spoke about the mining space, claiming that he wanted all future Bitcoin to be 100% American-made. The industry is far from easy, though, as miners told Decrypt at last week’s annual Mining Disrupt conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, as the price of Bitcoin dips while mining difficulty steadily rises. Bitcoin miners are typically industrial operations of warehouses full of computers that work to secure the network. Miners are rewarded in newly minted coins for processing blocks on the decentralized payment network, but when the price of BTC drops, businesses can struggle to cover their costs. Bitcoin is down nearly 22% from its all-time high of nearly $109,000—which it hit when President Trump was inaugurated on January 20.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, is pushing deeper into crypto with introducing a blockchain-based platform for tokenized collateral management. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Collateral is a fundamental part of risk management in financial markets, ensuring stability amid market fluctuations. However, traditional systems often suffer from inefficiencies due to fragmented infrastructure and lagging settlements. DTCC said its new platform seeks to address these challenges by tokenizing collateral on blockchain rails, allowing for real-time transfers and automation through smart contracts, according to a Wednesday press release. "Collateral mobility is the ‘killer app’ for institutional use of blockchain," Dan Doney, chief technology officer of DTCC Digital Assets, said in a statement. "By using smart contracts to automate the full range of collateral operations, we enable complex trade execution across markets in real-time at any time, even in volatile conditions." "This platform is unique in that we’ve created something that’s more open, flexible, dynamic, and comprehensive than any previous digital collateral initiative," said Nadine Chakar, global head of DTCC Digital Assets. The initiative comes as tokenization of traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and other traditional investments has become one of the hottest use cases for blockchain technology. Multiple financial heavyweights like BlackRock, CME Group and Fidelity have thrown their hat in the ring pursuing benefits such as operational efficiencies, speedier settlements and increased transparency compared to using traditional financial plumbing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justin Sun bailed out Techteryx's TrueUSD stablecoin after nearly half a billion dollars of its reserves were rendered illiquid, people close to the matter confirmed, and the stablecoin issuer said in Hong Kong court documents. An excerpt of the writ Techteryx filed in Hong Kong See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . After acquiring TrueUSD from TrueCoin in December 2020, Techteryx appointed First Digital Trust (FDT), a Hong Kong-based fiduciary, to manage its stablecoin reserves. According to documents prepared by U.S. law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel, FDT was instructed to invest the reserves in the Aria Commodity Finance Fund (Aria CFF), a Cayman Islands-registered vehicle. However, court filings allege that approximately $456 million was instead improperly diverted into Aria Commodities DMCC, a separate, unauthorized entity based in Dubai. However, emails from Aria's Matthew Brittan are signed with an address in Dubai. ARIA DMCC engages in trade finance, asset development, and commodity trading, while ARIA CFF finances commodity traders, including ARIA DMCC and third parties, according to Matthew Brittain, who described the relationship between the two companies in an email to CoinDesk. Hong Kong court filings also say Vincent Chok, First Digital's CEO, allegedly directed around $15.5 million in undisclosed commissions to an entity called "Glass Door" and separately structured approximately $456 million in unauthorized trade finance loans from FDT to Aria DMCC, later retroactively mischaracterizing them as legitimate fund investments in actions plaintiffs describe as fraudulent misrepresentation and misappropriation. "The remittances to Aria DMCC were blatant misappropriation and money-laundering," a statement of claim reads. These statements have not been tried in court as of press time. Aria DMCC invested funds in global projects that they described as relatively illiquid, such as manufacturing plants, mining operations, maritime vessels, port infrastructure, and renewable energy ventures. When Techteryx attempted to redeem its investments from Aria CFF between mid-2022 and early 2023 it received little or no funds back, with Aria entities allegedly defaulting on payments and failing to fulfill redemption requests, the court documents say. Techteryx then took full operational control of TUSD in July 2023, after TrueCoin terminated its involvement. According to the complaint Cahill prepared for the U.S. DOJ, Sun stepped in around this time to provide emergency liquidity support, which was structured as a loan. Chok told CoinDesk that First Digital Trust acted strictly as a fiduciary intermediary, executing transactions precisely according to instructions provided by Techteryx and its representatives. He asserted that his company was not responsible for independently evaluating or advising on these investment decisions. "It is our understanding that one of the main blockers voiced by ARIA for early redemptions of funds (as requested by Techteryx) has been their AML/KYC concerns regarding the deal between TrueCoin and Techteryx and the true identity of the ultimate beneficial owner of Techteryx," Chok said in an email to CoinDesk, adding that he believed nobody named in the case considers Aria illiquid. "We are fully committed to clarifying these matters in due course as the legal and arbitration process continues." Aria Group's Matthew Brittain said to CoinDesk that he "completely rejects Techteryx’s claims against ARIA DMCC and any related entities," adding that "a number of false allegations were made in the court proceedings." Brittain also echoed Chok's concerns about Techteryx's beneficial ownership, pointing to Wall Street Journal coverage of the topic. In mid-2023, Prime Trust, an independent crypto custodian based in Nevada that is not connected to this case, but which TrueUSD used for its fiat ramps, was put into receivership by state regulators. State regulators alleged Prime Trust had improperly used customer funds to cover withdrawal requests, raising serious concerns about its financial stability. In September 2024, TrueCoin and TrustToken (the stablecoin's owners before Techteryx) settled with the SEC over allegations they falsely marketed TrueUSD as fully dollar-backed while secretly investing reserves in risky offshore funds. Without admitting wrongdoing, or detailing the nature of their offshore investments with Aria's companies, both TrueCoin and TrustToken agreed to pay civil penalties and disgorge profits to the tune of just over $500,000 to resolve charges of fraud and unregistered securities offerings. "ARIA CFF has never held [its] strategy out as highly liquid, or appropriate for the reserves of a stablecoin," he said in an email.

Select Ripple Payments customers including cross-border payment providers BKK Forex and iSend are already using the stablecoin to improve their treasury operations, the company said. Ripple plans to further expand the token's availability of its token to payments customers. Additionally, crypto exchange Kraken added RLUSD to its platform, following recent listings on LMAX and Bitstamp. Ripple entered the rapidly growing stablecoin market with its short-term U.S. government bond-backed cryptocurrency after receiving regulatory approval from the New York New York Department of Financial Services in December. Since then, RLUSD reached a $244 million market capitalization, growing 87% over the past month and reaching a monthly transfer volume of $860 million, rwa.xyz data shows. Jack McDonald, Ripple's senior vice president of stablecoins, said in a statement that RLUSD's growth is "outpacing our internal projections" with adoption spanning multiple financial sectors. Ripple is also working with NGOs exploring stablecoins for more efficient aid distribution, he added.</p>

"While retail interest is weak due to the fixation on price action, professional investors are recognizing the global adoption momentum spurred by the Trump administration’s embrace of bitcoin, and many are seeing these market conditions as an opportunity to start or increase an allocation," Leon added. That's because of the so-called basis trade (also known as cash-and-carry). It's collapsed to the 5% area of late, suggesting arbitrage-related ETF inflows may dry up. “While a favorable price environment would certainly be a boost, it's important to remember that adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs by these groups is still in its infancy," said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, who is also bullish on the outlook for inflows throughout the rest of the year.. "As they grow more comfortable allocating to bitcoin, this should provide a meaningful tailwind for inflows,” he added.., While many institutions have indeed already made their first allocations into bitcoin in the past year, it represents only a small fraction of ETF investment, with most of the money still coming from retail investors — something recently noted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose IBIT is the asset-gathering leader among the spot ETFs. During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, a survey showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs this year as crypto has lost its “reputational risk” attribute among advisors. The view that bitcoin could serve as a “safe haven” in times of an economic decline, which investors remain anxious about, could also boost confidence in the asset, especially as fears of a potential recession grow. “If we see continued rate cut expectations, signs of economic uncertainty, or deepening fears of a potential recession in the US, Bitcoin’s role as 'digital gold' will likely support additional inflows,” said David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets. “While some short-term traders may rotate out if price weakness persists, long-term players will continue to keep inflows strong, especially as institutional adoption takes off and drives demand throughout the year."</p>

Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . The brokerage firm offers bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) to any U.S. citizen over the age of 18. The new product comes as financial advisors are increasingly offering crypto to their clients. A survey by TMX Vetta Fi recently showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs, although their biggest focus is in crypto equity ETFs. “Fidelity is committed to offering investment products and solutions to meet the changing needs and interests of our customers, accompanied by education and support,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk. Clients of the brokerage firm have increasingly voiced interest in a tax-advantaged way to trade and hold crypto, a person familiar with the matter, said. Fidelity already offers a number of crypto exchange-traded funds, which let investors track the prices of digital assets without directly investing in them. UPDATE (April 2, 16:15 UTC): Corrects first paragraph to state that the plan was introduced on Wednesday, not Thursday, and clarifies that assets are custodied by Fidelity Digital Assets.</p>

Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . As of writing, the number of open positions in the $80,000 put option tallied 10,278 contracts, equating to a notional open interest of $864.26 million, according to data source Amberdata. It also marks a significant positioning shift from early January when the call option at the $120,000 strike was the most popular bet with an open interest of nearly $1.5 billion. BTC fell 11.66% in the first quarter, with prices slipping below $80,000 at one point as President Donald Trump's tariffs shook Wall Street. Later Wednesday, Trump is expected to announce sweeping reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners, which could lead to a full-blown trade war. That has BTC traders chasing downside protection. "BTC volatility smiles have shifted sharply towards OTM puts, reaching levels not seen since the US Banking Crisis in March 2023. ETH's short-tenor volatility smile skews have partially recovered from their strong tilt toward OTM put," analytics firm Block Scholes said in its market update Wednesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto asset manager Grayscale has listed two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer investors a differentiated source of income through bitcoin's (BTC) characteristic volatility. The two New York Stock Exchange-listed funds will start trading on Wednesday. Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Call options are derivatives contracts betting on the price of an asset rising. BTCC will write calls very close to spot prices to deliver income for investors seeking regular cash flow, with the options premiums possibly also providing a cushion against market downturns. BPI meanwhile will target options with strike prices that are well out-of-the-money, meaning the price is much higher than the spot price. This would allow investors to participate in much of BTC's upside potential while possibly benefiting from some dividend income, according to an emailed announcement from Grayscale on Wednesday. Despite the surge in institutional investment into BTC through spot ETFs since their introduction in January 2024, bitcoin's volatility does not appear to be going anywhere for the time being. Therefore, as institutional investors increase their exposure to bitcoin, there may be more demand for products such as Grayscale's that can offer differentiated sources of income to cushion against this volatility.</p>

Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . "Our bid for TikTok isn't just about changing ownership, it's about creating a new paradigm where both creators and their communities benefit directly from the value they generate," Zoop co-founder RJ Phillips told Reuters. The HBAR Foundation is the entity behind Hedera (HBAR), a proof-of-stake smart contract platform that launched in 2018. With a market capitalization of $7.2 billion, HBAR is the 22nd-largest cryptocurrency in existence as of press time. Online retailing giant Amazon (AMZN) is also looking to acquire the platform, according to The New York Times. The HBAR Foundation confirmed to CoinDesk that it had indeed submitted a bid to acquire TikTok US with Zoop. "This strategic initiative aims to disrupt the traditional big tech model where platforms can capture up to 90% of revenue while creators - who generate the content – receive a disproportionately small share," the companies said in a press release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FDUSD, the stablecoin issued by Hong Kong-based First Digital, has wobbled from its $1 price peg as investor concerns mounted over its reserves, though the company said Wednesday that it was "completely solvent." See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . The token has stabilized around $0.98-$0.96 later, still trading below its supposed price anchor. The sudden price action happened as CoinDesk earlier Wednesday reported that some of the TrueUSD stablecoin's reserve assets were stuck in illiquid investments, according to filings. "First Digital Trust (FDT) is effectively insolvent and unable to fulfill client fund redemptions. I strongly recommend that users take immediate action to secure their assets," Tron founder Justin Sun claimed in a Wednesday X post. First Digital refuted the allegations in an X post, saying that "First Digital is completely solvent" and "every dollar backing FDUSD is completely, secure, safe and accounted for with US backed T-Bills." As we told the reporter at CoinDesk, we have not yet had the opportunity to defend ourselves and instead of letting the TUSD matter be dealt with in court, Justin has instead resorted to a coordinated social media effort to try to damage FDUSD as a business competitor," the company said. "FDT will pursue legal action to protect its rights and reputation." FDUSD's latest monthly reserve report showed that the $2 billion of reserve assets were held mostly in U.S. Treasury bills and a lesser part in repo facilities and fixed deposits. Stablecoin analytics firm Bluechip told CoinDesk it gave FDUSD a C grade (on a scale from F as least safe to to A+ being safest) and expressed concerns over reserve assets being bankruptcy remote from the issuer company. "FDUSD appears to be backed by reasonably sound reserves. But we concluded that in case of bankruptcy, the reserves could be used to pay off the parent company’s debt," Garett Jones, Bluechip's chief economist, said in a message. "It’s hard to predict what would really happen in a crisis, but safer stablecoins do exist."</p>

“The unique thing about Avalanche is how it is attempting to achieve scale. Unlike Ethereum or Solana, Avalanche (AVAX) uses a set of subnets, or sidechains,” Kendrick said in a note on Wednesday, initiating coverage on AVAX with a $55 price target for the end of 2025, $100 for 2026, $150 for 2027, $200 for 2028 and $250 by the completion of 2029.

“While it is still too early to tell whether the new subnet approach will work, we think the fact that one-quarter of active subnets are already Etna-compatible is encouraging.”

He also pointed out the network’s growing developer number since its upgrade in December, which cut the cost of establishing a subnet close to zero.

Avalanche, which stands at a $9 billion market cap, is currently the 15th-largest cryptocurrency by that metric, making it a great candidate to profit from a big impact even through incremental improvements, according to Kendrick. Among blockchains, it is the tenth-largest by total value locked (TVL).

“As a result, we see AVAX outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of relative price gains in the coming years, reaching a level around USD 250 by end-2029, more than 10x today’s price.”

Ahead of the December upgrade, the Avalanche Foundation, the issuer of AVAX, raised $250 million in a token sale, led by Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly and ParaFi Capital.</p>

In this conversation leading up to the ai summit, at consensus in Toronto, field gives a primer on ai swarms, explains how blockchain snaps into the puzzle, and shares why all innovators - not Just Tech Giants - “Should have the right to Build machine learning technology.” This interview has been to condensed and lightly edited for Clarity. Ben Fielding: It’s the Addition of the First Mvp Features of Blockchain Integration with what we've launched so far. So we launched rl [Reinforcement Learning] Swarming a FEW Weeks Ago, which is Reinforcement Learning, Post-Training, as a Peer-to-Peer Network. Here’s the Easiesse Way to Think About it. When a pre-trained Model Goes Through Reasoning Training-Like Deepseek-R1-It Learns To Critique Its Own Thinking and Recursively IMPROVE AGAINST The Task. It can then Impove its own Answer. We take that process one step Further and Say, “It’s great for models to critique their own thinking and recursively IMPROVE. What if they can talk to other models and critique Each Other's Thinking?” If you get many models together in a group that Can All Talk to Each other, they start learning how to send information to the other models… with the overall goal of improving the entire swarm itself. It’s this training method which allows many models to Kind of Combine, in parallel, to improve the outcome of a final meta-model that you Could Could From Those Models. But at the same time, you have every single individual model just improving on its own. So if you were to come to come with a model on a MacBook, Join a Swarm for an Hour and then Drop Back Out Again, You would have an impured local model based on the knowledge in the Swarm, and you would have so IMPODED the other models in the Swarm. It’s this Collaborative Training Process That Any Model Can Join Join and Any Model Can Do. Okay, that's what you released a few Weeks AGO. Let’s just pretend that someone doesn’t understand The Phrase “Lower-Level Primitive.” What do you mean by that? Yeah, so I Mean, very close to the resource itself. So if you think about the software stack, you've got a gpu stack in a data center. You've got drivers on top of the gpu. You've got all this stuff going up. And the rl Swarm is a demonstration of what's possible, basically. It's just a Somewhat Hacky Demo of Doing Really Interesting Large Scale, Scalable Machine Learning. But what Gensyn's Been Doing for the Past Four-Plus Years, realistic, is building infrastructure. And so we'Re in this period now where the infrastructure is all at that v0.1 sort of beta level. It sounds like you guys are doing a lot more than decentralized compute, or even infrastructure? We have three main components that Sit Undernath our infrastructure. We have reproducible libraries for any hardware target. So Assume You Can Just Run a Model on Anny Device In The World That's Compatible, Can You Get Talk to Each Other? So we build the those libraries and rl swarm is an example of that communication. Ah, and i’m guessing this is where blockchain commes in ... Imagine a scenario where every device in the world is Executing Consistently. If I Connected My MacBook to Yours, YES, They Could Execute the Same Task. Yes, They Could Send Tensors Back and Forth, but do they know that what they send to the other device is actually happening on the other device or not? In the Current World, you and I would proximity sign a contract to say, yes, we agree that we'll make Sure our devices do the right Thing. In the Machine World, It Needs to Happen Programmatically. It gives us all of the benefits of blockchain you can imagine, like persistent identity, payments, consensus, etc. and so what we doing with is taking rl swarm and the primitives of the other infrastructure and we're adding in the Blockchain Components and Saying, ‘Hey, When you Join a Swarm now, you have a persistent identity, which exists out there on a decentralized ledger.’ In the future you’ll have the ability to make payments, but right now, you have that trust consensus mechanism where where terminates disputes. So, it's kind of an mvp of the future genyn infrastructure, where we’re going to add in components as we go. Give US A Tease of What's Coming Down The Pipeline? When we recach Main-Net, All of the Software and Infrastructure is live against blockchain as the source of trust, payments, consensus, etc., identity. It's Adding Identity in and Saying When You Join A Swarm, You Can Register as The Same Person. Everyone Knows Who You Are Without Having to Check Some Centralized Server Or Website Somewhere. Now Let’s Get Wild and Talk Further in the future. The ultimate vision is to take all of the resources that sit under machine learning and make theme instantaneously programmatical accessible to eachone. Machine Learning is heavy constrained by its core resources. People Should have the right to build machine learning technologies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto enthusiasts might have heard of the ERC-20 token standard, which provides guidelines to ensure that tokens created on the Ethereum smart contract blockchain are compatible and can interact with other tokens and applications within the network. A similar standard for data-backed tokens, called VRC-20, has now emerged. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Vana, an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that helps users monetize personal data by bundling it into DataDAOs for AI model training, introduced the new standard early this week to boost trust and transparency in the market for data-backed digital assets. "For data markets to work, tokens must be reliable, secure, and useful. As a universal standard for data-backed tokens, VRC-20 delivers this by ensuring fair and transparent data token trading," Vana announced on X. The VRC-20 standard design includes specific criteria such as fixed supply, governance, and liquidity rules while ensuring real data access by tying tokens to actual data utility. Additionally, it promotes continuous liquidity through rewards that ensure market stability. This is real financialization of data," Vana noted. DLPs are where data is contributed, tokenized and made ready for use in applications such as AI model training. Monday's announcement replaced VANA emissions as DataDAO inventive with a new feature that calls for DAOs to issue VRC-20-compliant tokens to receive liquidity support. Additionally, the protocol introduced data validator staking, where VANA holders can lock their coins in data validators instead of individual DataDAOs. "Rewards are based on network security and usage. Earnings are tied to real network utility and reliability," Vana said.</p>

The firm's Investment Banking arm will also use Galaxy Digital UK’s FCA authorization to provide capital raising and investment banking services, according to a statement on Wednesday. The Galaxy U.K. subsidiary will also support its asset management business with fund distribution activities.

Galaxy Digital UK is on the FCA's investment firms register, which is for firms authorized to perform MiFID investment services or activities. Galaxy also joined the FCA's crypto register in 2021.

“London is a critical financial hub, and this authorisation allows us to deepen our presence in the U.K., aligning with our mission to bridge traditional finance with the digital asset ecosystem,” Leon Marshall, CEO of Galaxy Europe and Global Head of Sales said.

The U.K. has attracted crypto companies like Coinbase, Bitpanda and most recently assigned BlackRock a slot on its crypto register.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto industry's primary political action committee, Fairshake, flooded support to Republican candidates in the U.S. House of Representatives special elections this week in Florida that aimed to fill vacant seats in Congress. Both candidates won, further reinforcing the party's narrow national majority. The two seats in Florida had been vacated when President Donald Trump tapped the previous members to join his administration, including his national security advisor, Michael Waltz, and the congressman Trump initially picked as attorney general, Matt Gaetz, who quickly bowed out under the pressure of accusations that he'd had sex with a minor and was linked to illegal drug use. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Florida voters elected state Senator Randy Fine to take Waltz's former seat and picked the state's chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, to replace Gaetz. While Democrats failed to steer the conservative districts onto their side, they did win much more support in both districts than they had in the recent 2024 elections. An affiliate of the Fairshake PAC had paid for advertising supporting the pro-crypto candidates, Patronis and Fine, in the primary and general elections in Florida, including a last-minute $1.5 million to help ensure their victory. "We are thrilled to see two strong champions of innovation headed to Washington," said Fairshake spokesman Josh Vlasto, in a statement. "Both leaders have shown a deep commitment to advancing pro-growth policies and ensuring the United States leads the world in crypto and digital assets innovation."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlackRock managed to land on the Financial Conduct Authority's tough crypto register on Tuesday, the regulators website showed. The world's biggest asset manager will be allowed to act as an arranger for iShares Digital Assets AG, which issue Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) — a financial instrument that is pegged an underlying asset, in this case a crypto asset. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Registration on the U.K.'s crypto register is not an easy feat. The FCA's crypto register was set up in 2020 to ensure that crypto firms wishing to serve U.K. clients could only do so after they had registered to comply with the country's anti-money laundering rules. The U.K. has received 368 applications but only 51 firms have been approved. As an arranger, BlackRock will be able to "arrange the execution of transactions in cryptoassets to support ETP subscriptions and redemptions" between issuers and authorized participants but it will not be able to onboard any new customers. Also, it will not be able to operate a machine that "utilizes automated processes to exchange cryptoassets for money" vice versa - without written consent from the regulator. BlackRock joins the likes of crypto exchange Coinbase who recently managed to get on the register this year, though a new crypto regime awaits.</p>

The motion mirrors similar stay requests filed by the SEC in other crypto-related cases, including its cases against Binance and Tron, both of which were granted by the court. The SEC filed suit against Gemini and bankrupt crypto lender Genesis in January 2023, alleging that both companies had violated securities laws through the Gemini Earn program. Through the Earn program, retail investors were promised as much as 8% interest — paid by Genesis — on tokens invested through the program. Two days later, the SEC filed charges against both companies. A separate SEC probe into Gemini was closed in February.
