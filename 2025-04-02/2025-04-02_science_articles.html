                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In January, the Trump administration ordered a broad pause on all US funding for foreign aid. Among other issues, this has significant effects on US funding for HIV. A large part of this is the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which oversees programs in low- and middle-income countries to prevent, diagnose and treat the virus. What’s more, recent funding cuts for international HIV assistance go beyond the US. In a new study, we found the worst-case scenario could see more than 10 million extra infections than what we’d otherwise anticipate in the next five years, and almost 3 million additional deaths. HIV can be transmitted at birth, during unprotected sex or thorough blood-to-blood contact such as shared needles. If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), a condition in which the immune system is severely damaged, and which can be fatal. There’s still no cure for HIV, but modern treatments allow the virus to be suppressed with a daily pill. People with HIV who continue treatment can live without symptoms and don’t risk infecting others. A sustained global effort towards awareness, prevention, testing and treatment has reduced annual new HIV infections by 39% (from 2.1 million in 2010 to 1.3 million in 2023), and annual deaths by 51% (from 1.3 million to 630,000). Most of that drop happened in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic was worst. Today, nearly two-thirds of people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, and nearly all live in low- and middle-income countries. To do this, we used our mathematical model for 26 low- and middle-income countries. These 26 countries represent roughly half of all people living with HIV in low- and middle income countries, and half of international HIV spending. We set up each country model in collaboration with national HIV/AIDS teams, so the data sources reflected the best available local knowledge. For each country, we first projected the number of new HIV infections and deaths that would occur if HIV spending stayed the same. Finally, we modelled scenarios for the possible immediate discontinuation of PEPFAR in addition to other anticipated cuts. For children, there could be up to an additional 882,400 infections and 119,000 deaths. In the more optimistic scenario in which PEPFAR continues but 24% is still cut from international HIV funding, we estimated there could be 70,000 to 1.73 million extra new HIV infections and 5,000 to 61,000 additional deaths between 2025 and 2030. This would still be 50% higher than if current spending were to continue. The wide range in our estimates reflects low- and middle-income countries committing to far more domestic funding for HIV in the best case, or broader health system dysfunction and a sustained gap in funding for HIV treatment in the worst case. Some funding for HIV treatment may be saved by taking that money from HIV prevention efforts, but this would have other consequences. But most of our assumptions were cautious, so these results likely underestimate the true impacts of funding cuts to HIV programs globally. Sub-Saharan Africa will experience by far the greatest effects due to the high proportion of HIV treatment that has relied on international funding. In other regions, we estimate vulnerable groups such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and trans and gender diverse people may experience increases in new HIV infections that are 1.3 to 6 times greater than the general population. The Asia-Pacific received US$591 million in international funding for HIV in 2023, which is the second highest after sub-Saharan Africa. Notably, more than 10% of new HIV infections among people born in Australia are estimated to have been acquired overseas. But concern is greatest for countries that are most acutely affected by HIV and AIDS, many of which will be most affected by international funding cuts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On March 27, scientists bid farewell to the Gaia telescope, bringing to a close its groundbreaking 11-year mission of mapping the Milky Way and our cosmic neighborhood. Though not as famous as some of its peers like the Hubble or James Webb space telescopes, Gaia has reshaped our understanding of our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Since 2014, the European Space Agency's ( ESA ) telescope has meticulously charted the cosmos, creating a vast catalog of nearly 2 billion stars, more than 4 million potential galaxies and around 150,000 asteroids, with moons possibly circling hundreds of them. After 11 years of operations — nearly double its expected lifetime — Gaia ran out of fuel, prompting its operators at ESA to power down and retire the spacecraft. Since it launched in December 2013, Gaia charted the cosmos from a vantage point about a million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth, at a spot called Lagrange point 2 (L2), where the gravitational forces of Earth and the sun, and the orbital motion of a satellite balance each other. To do so, it was equipped with twin telescopes pointed in different directions to measure the distances between stars, while three onboard instruments collected data on the positions, velocities, colors as well as chemical compositions of celestial objects. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors The telescope's observations have also led astronomers to discover previously hidden stellar streams. For example, in 2020, its database of stars revealed the presence and shape of the largest structure ever observed in our galaxy: a vast ensemble of interconnected stellar nurseries spanning 9,000 light-years, known as the Radcliffe Wave , which may have had a lasting impact on Earth's climate . "Gaia has changed our impression of the Milky Way," Stefan Payne-Wardenaar , a scientific visualiser at the Heidelberg University in Germany, said in a previous statement . The spacecraft has serendipitously captured thousands of starquakes — tiny motions on surfaces of stars that cause them to swell and shrink periodically — providing unique insights into the inner workings of stars, and spotted high-velocity stars both escaping our galaxy and, surprisingly, racing toward it. It also uncovered several cosmic "sleeping giants," or black holes — one of which is lurking extremely close to Earth . Last week the mission team deactivated the spacecraft's instruments, which were designed with multiple redundant systems to ensure it could reboot and resume operations after any failure. To prevent its computers from powering back on in the future, operators deliberately corrupted its onboard software, according to the ESA statement. "We had to design a decommissioning strategy that involved systematically picking apart and disabling the layers of redundancy that have safeguarded Gaia for so long," Tiago Nogueira , Gaia spacecraft operator, said in the statement. "We don't want it to reactivate in the future and begin transmitting again if its solar panels find sunlight." As part of this process, some of Gaia's onboard software is being overwritten using farewell messages from its team on Earth, as well as the names of around 1500 people that have contributed to the mission over the years. The telescope may have gone dark, but scientists hope its discoveries will continue to shine brightly. The next batch of science data is set to be released in 2026, covering a little over five years of observations, with the fifth and final release scheduled for 2030, which will encompass the full 10 years of data.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Your body weight does not account for your body fat, muscle mass and bone density, and will not tell how much of it is due to water retention or digested food. To put it into perspective, two identical twins can weigh exactly the same, but based on body weight alone, one can be considered athletic and the other classified as obese. This is the key issue smart scales are trying to solve. Some of the best smart scales on the market can give you an in-depth explanation of your health stats, offer basic diet advice and even measure your heart rate. Their functionality outstrips that of analog devices by a long mile. What are the potential benefits of using a smart scale? Smart scales are not just for fitness enthusiasts and can benefit a wide range of population groups, Dr. Michael Chichak , a general practitioner and clinical reviewer at MEDvidi, a health clinic based in San Jose, California, told Live Science by email. "These include athletes who track muscle mass for improved performance and recovery, elderly individuals who need to monitor changes in bone density and muscle mass to avert complications associated with sarcopenia [age-related loss of skeletal muscle] and people suffering from chronic conditions like heart diseases or diabetes where body composition can affect the management strategies of these conditions," Chichak said. However, smart scales should not be treated as diagnostic devices, he emphasized. They are not as accurate as clinically validated diagnostic methods, such as the “gold standard” Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ), which uses rays of ionizing radiation to penetrate the body and produce images of bones and soft tissues inside. DEXA scans are the "gold standard" of measuring body composition. That is because most smart scales work using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). While this method has its perks — it is non-invasive and relatively cheap, for example — it is also prone to distortions, according to a 2014 review published in the International Journal of Clinical Nutrition . BIA works by sending a small, unnoticeable electrical current through your body (often through bare feet and/or hands) and measuring your body's impedance, or resistance, to this current. Then, a smart scale feeds these measurements into its proprietary algorithms (often incorporating self-reported metrics like age, sex and height) that calculate your body composition. The accuracy of results depends on how well a device measures resistance and which equations it uses to interpret this data, the review authors noted. In that regard, some commercially available smart scales leave a lot to be desired, according to a 2021 study published in the journal JMIR Mhealth Uhealth . Studies have also shown that typical stand-on smart scales tend to be less accurate than devices that use foot-to-hand technology (a stand-on platform and handles), according to a 2022 review published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology . Some studies suggest that foot-to-hand technology may improve the accuracy of body composition measurements. "Even in products that use a handle to better include the upper body in the measurement, companies may not provide transparent information about what algorithms are used to give you their final measurements," Dal Molin said. What other factors can affect the accuracy of a smart scale? As we mentioned before, how and when you take measurements may also affect the accuracy of your smart scale’s readings. For example, one 1988 study has shown that BIA can overestimate body water content and underestimate body fat percentage when the measurements are taken in warm ambient temperatures. For example, some high-end smart scales use multiple frequencies of electrical current to improve accuracy. These devices measure impedance in different body segments, such as the arms, legs and torso, so they can provide a more detailed analysis of body composition, according to a 2024 study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition . Home scales can still allow us to appreciate trends fairly accurately, but it is important to understand that BIA measurements are data points that can be flawed, Dal Molin said. "Lastly, few smart scales are studied for accuracy and many studies have small sample sizes. Our knowledge within specific brands and products is therefore even more limited," she added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The idea comes from the discovery in Denmark of a bronze metalworking die or stamp that depicts a warrior on horseback. Similar motifs have been found on helmets from Sweden and jewelry from southern Germany, and scholars have suggested that the Sutton Hoo helmet may have been an heirloom or diplomatic gift from those regions. The latest discovery confirms that the motif of a horse and riding warrior was indeed widespread throughout Northern Europe at that time. "It's definitely connected to the aristocracy," archaeologist and prehistorian Peter Pentz , a curator at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, told Live Science. He noted that nobles from these times and places were expected to ride horses into battle.

It was rebuilt from hundreds of fragments found at the Sutton Hoo site, which also yielded ornate grave goods — including musical instruments, jewelry, tableware, weapons and armor — from a burial chamber built on the deck of the buried ship. Although Anglo-Saxon smiths were certainly capable of crafting such a helmet, the new discovery adds strength to the idea that it originated overseas, Pentz said. (Image credit: John Fhær Engedal Nissen, National Museum of Denmark) (Image credit: Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 It now seems likely that the helmet was made in southern Scandinavia in the late sixth or early seventh century, or that it had been heavily influenced by the artistic style of that area, Williams told Live Science in an email. "The motifs from Taasinge and Sutton Hoo are similar but not identical, reflecting a popular design used on helmets across a wide region," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is China intent on a D-Day style invasion of Taiwan? The fact that China launched a two-day military drill in the Taiwan Strait on April 1, 2025, has only intensified such fears. To me, the curious thing regarding these musings about a potential war involving China, which has one of the world’s most advanced militaries, is that it is supported by reference to technology first used some 80 years ago – specifically, the Mulberry Harbours, floating piers that allowed Allies to deploy land vehicles onto the beaches at Normandy on June 6, 1944. Indeed, while the new Chinese ships may be operationally similar to their historical forebears, the strategic situation in China and Taiwan is far different. While one reading of Xi is that his rhetoric is in part a strategic move to burnish Chinese power globally, labeling Taiwan as a renegade or breakaway province is, for many, a clear indication of an intention to invade and bring the island within the geography of Chinese sovereignty. Aside from the geopolitics, any China decision to invade Taiwan would mean attempting an extremely challenging military operation that is, historically speaking, a risky proposition. Seaborne invasions have often led to high casualties or even outright failure. The Gallipoli landings on the coast of Turkey during World War I, for example, led to the withdrawal of mainly Australian and New Zealand forces after high casualties and barely any territorial gains. In World War II, island-hopping by U.S. forces to push back Japan’s advance achieved strategic goals – but at a high human cost. That’s where the barges come into play. They reasoned that Germany would either retain control of French ports or sabotage them, and that tanks, guns, food, soldiers and other necessities were not going to be brought up from reserve via ports. The Mulberry Harbours fixed that problem by creating a set of floating piers that would rise up and down with the tide by being fixed to sophisticated anchors. Ships could moor to these piers and unload needed material. The piers were protected by an inner ring of concrete caissons, dragged across the channel and sunk into position, and an outer breakwater of scuttled ships. The Mulberry Harbours were a combination of cutting-edge pier technology and improvisation. Yet the geography of any invasion is very different. In World War II, the Mulberry Harbours were part of an invasion from an island to conquer a continent. The use of Mulberry Harbours, as innovative as it was, was only a moment in a longer geopolitical process. Simply, the United Kingdom became a giant warehouse – mainly for U.S. soldiers and equipment. I describe this as a process of a seapower moving from its near or coastal waters to far waters in another part of the globe. Certainly, barges would help an invasion across the Taiwan Strait. But China sees Taiwan as part of its near waters, and it wants to secure those waters from global competition. From its perspective, China is surrounded by a U.S. military based in Okinawa, Guam and the Philippines. This chain of bases could restrict China’s ambition through blockade, and controlling Taiwan would help China create a gap in this chain. Of course, China does not just have an eye on its near waters. It has also created a far water presence of its own in its building of an ocean-going military navy, established a military base in Djibouti, and through its Belt and Road Initiative become an economic and political presence across the Indian, Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Chinese invasion barges could be deployed quite early in China’s process of moving from near to far waters. But as with the World War II case, China-Taiwan tensions are simply a modern example of a local theater – this time, the Taiwanese Strait – being part of a greater global process of power projection. The comparisons to Mulberry Harbours, therefore, are not with the technology itself but its role in a mechanism of historical geopolitical change.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A small study of people who ran a marathon found that their brains ' energy demands increased in the aftermath of the race. Marathon running may seem like the ultimate sport for staying in shape. Let's not forget that the original marathon runner, the ancient Greek soldier Pheidippides, is said to have dropped dead immediately after reaching his destination. Luckily for long-distance runners, these effects appear to be reversible. Once the body has exhausted the supply of its standard energy source — glucose, or sugar — it turns to backup generators, metabolizing fats as an alternative fuel source. Pedro Ramos Cabrer — a neuroscientist at CIC biomaGUNE, a nonprofit research institute in San Sebastian, Spain, and a co-author of the study — told Live Science that he and his colleagues wanted to identify the brain's reserve energy sources. They suspected that fatty myelin could be the answer. Whether these preclinical findings would be replicated in humans was still a mystery, though.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors "We needed to really deplete all the sources of energy of a body to prove this," Cabrer told Live Science. They used MRI, which can reveal the presence of water molecules trapped between myelin layers. Changes to the brain's overall myelin levels were not statistically significant, however, suggesting that any changes were very isolated to specific regions. For any runners concerned about this cerebral cannibalism, there's good news: After two months, all of the runners' myelin measures had recovered to their baseline levels. Klaus-Armin Nave , director at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Germany, was not involved in the study but has also studied how myelin stores energy , using lab mice.

The findings don't mean runners should avoid marathons on their brains' behalf. Both Nave and Cabrer noted that the study's small size means more work will be needed to draw concrete conclusions about marathons' effects on the brain. Nevertheless, these effects may carry increased risks for certain athletes. For example, in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), metabolic molecules typically made by myelin are in short supply , and the researchers think that excessive exercise could potentially exacerbate the problem. Further research will be needed to confirm this theory, Cabrer said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As I sprinted across the flower-rich meadow on the eastern coast of Cyprus, I could barely see my car. The air was full of tiny black dots, pelting like bullets past me. I hauled open the car door and breathed a sigh of relief once inside. The migration cameras my team and I use to monitor these insects counted nearly 6,000 flies per metre per minute. Being hit by a fly travelling over 25mph (helped by the wind) hurts enough to make you want shelter quickly. All of these flies had just travelled at least 60 miles (100km) across open sea from the Middle East to Cyprus. This journey forms part of their springtime migration towards northern Europe. Butterflies and dragonflies are well-known insect migrants, but not because they’re the most numerous. My colleagues and I set out to change this. We have spent months collecting written sources that mentioned fly migration from anywhere in the world. Previously, nobody really knew the extent to which flies migrated, yet they are the most numerous and most ecologically important of all terrestrial migrants. Fly migration has been part of written human history for millennia. Then God removed flies from the land until “not a fly remained”. If these flies had been misidentified mayflies coming out of the river Nile, which are known to amass in huge numbers, their exhausted bodies would have remained for days. Egypt is on an important fly migration route. So perhaps fly migration was significant enough to be the subject of divine intervention. All over the world, it’s mostly females that migrate. They have been recorded migrating through mountain passes high in the Himalayas, on ships hundreds of miles out to sea in the Gulf of Mexico and in their millions migrating through western Europe. More than half (62%) of all migrating flies, including hoverflies, are pollinators. As they migrate, flies transport and disperse pollen between flowers. This could help plants adapt to climate change by maintaining genetic diversity. Many migratory fly species (34%) are decomposers, ensuring the planet isn’t covered in rotting carcasses and animal dung. One study showed that the larvae of just 50 houseflies (Musca domestica), – the very ecologically similar and equally abundant autumn housefly Musca autumnalis migrate south through the Pyrenees in their millions – can decompose up to 444kg of pig manure. The ecological roles of flies are not all positive, though. My latest study shows that monoculture crops provide lots of food for some migratory fly species (18%) that have subsequently become crop pests. But migratory flies have an overwhelmingly positive impact on the planet. Hoverfly larvae eat trillions of aphids each year in southern England. The movement and subsequent death of trillions of migrating flies, whose bodies contain elements, such as phosphorous and nitrogen which plants need to grow, could be vital to soil health of the soils too. Migratory birds have been noted feeding on and moving at the same time as migratory flies, perhaps using them as fuel for their journeys. We’re only just waking up to the significance of flies. Hopefully, it’s not too late to protect them. These brilliant migratory flies have so many young that if we improve landscape connectivity, reduce pesticide usage and provide suitable habitat, they can bounce back really quickly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new NASA space telescope has turned on its detectors for the first time, capturing its first light in images that contain tens of thousands of galaxies and stars. Within each image's full field of view — an area roughly 20 times wider than the full moon — roughly 100,000 light sources from stars, galaxies, and nebulas can be glimpsed. "Our spacecraft has opened its eyes on the universe," Olivier Doré , a SPHEREx project scientist at Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a statement . Costing a total of $488 million to build and launch, the new telescope has been in development for roughly a decade, and is set to map the universe by observing both optical and infrared light. It will orbit Earth 14.5 times a day, completing 11,000 orbits during its lifetime to filter infrared light from distant gas and dust clouds using a technique called spectroscopy.

After lofting it to space, NASA scientists and engineers have performed a nail-biting series of checks on the new telescope. This includes ensuring that its sensitive infrared equipment is cooling down to its final temperature of around minus 350 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 210 degrees Celsius) and that the telescope is set to the right focus — something that cannot be adjusted in space. Based on these stunning preliminary images, it appears that everything has worked out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SpaceX images shared on April 1 revealed that the private Fram2 mission has successfully put humans in a "polar orbit" for the first time. However, several experts have questioned how much they can learn during such a short mission, and whether science is the true motivation of the project at all. On Monday (March 31), the Maltese cryptocurrency mogul Chun Wang and the other members of the "Fram2" mission entered low-Earth orbit aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon "Resilience" capsule, which was propelled into space by a Falcon 9 rocket that launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at around 9:46 p.m. EDT, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com . Wang, who is leading and funding the mission, was accompanied by Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics engineer Rabea Rogge and Australian polar explorer Eric Phillips — all of whom received around 8 months of astronaut training before launch, according to Spaceflight Now . There are 22 planned experiments, which range from classic space tests that measure physiological changes experienced by the astronauts to first-of-their-kind experiments, such as growing mushrooms and taking X-rays of one another — all of which will be carried out inside a 13-foot-wide (4 meters) living space. "The science and research projects onboard will inform how we prepare for future missions, ultimately helping make space more accessible to us all." Related: Futuristic, 'alien-like' nuclear fusion rockets developed in total secret could revolutionize space travel — if they actually work Despite the mission's rapid-fire agenda of world-first experiments, several experts have raised doubts about how much useful science the civilian crew will be able to produce. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors Because this is a private mission, "you need something to say [it's] different and exciting," which is likely why they are attempting to do so many things that have never been done before, he added. Meanwhile, John Prussing , an aerospace engineer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, thinks so little of the mission that he initially thought it was an April Fools' joke, as the initial launch window stretched into April 1, CNN reported. After reading all the "marketing hype" around the mission, "I didn't feel I really had a handle on the intentions of those on board or how their skills or background relate to the experiments [they will be conducting]," Fionagh Thompson , a researcher at Durham University in England that specializes in space ethics, told Live Science. "The claim that it will open up space for all is arguably an exaggeration," Thompson added. "Extrapolating any results from short time-span studies is ill-advised," Thompson said. Some of the data could be incorporated into existing research, she added, "assuming they share their results." However, "we will have to wait and see" if this is the case. Experts have questioned whether the Fram2 crew will be able to contribute any meaningful data toward "advancing" space exploration. While this type of scanning can reveal changes in human physiology over time, the astronauts are unlikely to experience any detectable changes after just four days in orbit, which raises the question of why they are doing it at all. The time limitation will be a similar problem for other tests that will assess physiological changes to things like blood flow, brain anatomy and bone density. These metrics have also already been extensively studied in astronauts on long-duration space missions, such as Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams who recently returned to Earth after spending 286 days on board the ISS . If the true intention behind these experiments was to improve our understanding of space travel for future generations, then the funding for this mission may have been better spent on other long-term research projects, Thompson argued. However, this endeavour has also been questioned by experts. "There's nothing unique to a polar orbit, and the science advantages are kind of overblown," Prussing told CNN. The only reason this has not been done before is that it is very fuel-intensive to put a spacecraft into a polar orbit compared to circling the equator, he added. While no astronauts have ever passed over the Arctic or Antarctica before now, these areas have been extensively mapped by satellites with instruments much more advanced than those available to the Fram2 crew, meaning that the team is unlikely to see anything we haven't seen before. Thompson says she has no problem with billionaires funding space exploration, but is less impressed with "vanity projects," and adds that it is important that we can identify them when they happen. "If it's about being 'heroic in space' then [just] say so." Human spaceflight quiz: How well do you know our journey into space?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several years later, Paul regrets his unwanted unemployment, but at the time there didn’t seem to be an alternative. It is striking then, that despite government and business commitments to support longer working lives and inclusive employment practices, workers with dementia are largely ignored. What little evidence we have paints a picture of widespread and unwanted unemployment. For some, this takes the form of redundancy or retirement. Alongside workforce ageing, digital transformation is perhaps the single most important development in modern industry. Almost all our working lives are now shaped by digital technologies in some form. This can be even worse for people with dementia. When exciting digital innovations are discussed in relation to them, the focus is almost always on providing care. The reality is that many people with dementia use digital tools every day. This ranges from familiar products like Google Maps to more cutting-edge technologies. These companions can provide vital social interaction for people fearing judgement or isolation because of their cognitive decline. Far from being a barrier, digital technologies could offer ways to help people with dementia to enjoy positive working lives, just as they help workers who don’t have dementia. For example, if a worker is struggling to remember appointments, automated and shared calendar scheduling can take care of that. If a worker has impaired wayfinding, mapping apps can be tailored to working environments and live location data can be used to guide staff around complicated sites. Many of us would struggle without our online calendars and maps. Research shows that touchscreens can be particularly challenging for older people with dementia. To make interfaces more suitable, developers could encourage the integration of voice-operated smart assistants into employee workstations (think of Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri). But recent developments in generative AI (like OpenAI’s ChatGPT) are proficient at predicting and expressing the next word in a sequence. These tools are also excellent at transforming text into different formats. Guidance on dementia-friendly information recommends features such as large fonts, single-clause sentences and single-syllable words. A generative AI tool could quickly transform documents into dementia-friendly formats. The integration of these tools into emailing and writing applications could make a lot of work far more accessible to people with dementia. These days, it makes little sense for workers to be manually entering costings into a spreadsheet. By outsourcing them to digital technologies, we can free up our ageing workforces to use their unmatched skills, such as networking and experience. The best way to do this will be to develop strategies, in consultation with people with dementia, that identify interventions suitable for the workplace. Then, when an employee is diagnosed, they can pick and mix a personalised collection of tools to address their needs. Right now, we are not aware of any workplace that has such a strategy. But many organisations already have robust policies for other conditions. Our own employer, the University of Bath, has a repository of reasonable adjustments that can be tailored to support staff and students experiencing mental illness. Dementia could be approached in much the same way. The potential of a digital working life for people with dementia highlights both promise and peril. But providing tailored support for those who want to work can enrich organisations and workers alike.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China’s intentions when it comes to Taiwan have been at the centre of intense discussion for years. Ever since then, mainland China – the People’s Republic – has maintained a claim over Taiwan. But in recent years, Chinese leaders – including the current president, Xi Jinping – have talked of plans for “reunification” which would bring Taiwan and its population of 23 million under the control of Beijing. The Shuiqiao barges filmed in March 2025 working together to form a relocatable bridge – the name means “water bridge” – enable the transfer of vehicles, supplies and people between ship and shore, over shallow beaches and potential obstacles on to firm ground. Analysts have already pointed out that there is no obvious commercial role for such large vessels, so the most likely purpose is for landing armed forces during amphibious operations. All major navies maintain some form of amphibious capability. The UK’s Royal Fleet Auxiliary, for example, operates the UK’s three bay class landing ships, which are due to be replaced by six modern multi-role strike ships. The specialised nature of these landing barges, with only one real purpose – to help land large numbers of military forces, stands in contrast with mainstream amphibious vessels. Bay class ships, for example, continue to be used for civilian evacuations, humanitarian aid, disaster relief and a wide range of military roles. That is a crucial distinction as amphibious operations present huge logistical challenges. D-Day required 850,000 troops, 485,000 tons of supplies and 153,000 vehicles to be landed safely over the first three weeks. That also reduces the number of specialised landing ships required, by enabling the use of commercial vessels for ferrying troops to those makeshift ports. What is of concern is that such specialised landing barges are not normally constructed until shortly before they are intended to be used. This is both to ensure they are in good working order when required, but also as they tend to offer little additional value and yet come at a significant price. This would offer one or two beach bridges, each an estimated 820 metres long. That would be of minimal value in a major invasion. The single US Navy Jlots modular floating pier in Gaza, for example, was only able to land 8,800 tonnes of aid in 20 days. While the Gaza effort was affected by bad weather, any Shuiqiao landing bridges would face much more dangerous wartime conditions. Three to six barges could also still plausibly be intended for disaster relief, even if does not seem a particularly cost-effective means of delivering aid. Historically, neither the UK, US or any other major power has maintained more than a handful of such highly specialised landing vessels, except for when they intended to use them. Assuming that an invasion does not trigger a world war, it might still be unsuccessful. Furthermore, getting forces ashore is only part of the challenge. Taiwan’s geography is not suited to rapid movement inland and in similar historic cases that has led to significant additional casualties and delays. Likewise, at Gallipoli in 1915, repeated failures to move inland saw allied forces suffer hundreds of thousands of casualties only to eventually withdraw. As a historian who is fond of China, I can only hope that these prototypes will remain just that and this will join the list of other forgotten moments in world history. If not, then the conflicts we have seen since the cold war and even those of the past few years may look minor in comparison to what could be unleashed as a result of an invasion of Taiwan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The extremist organisation had existed as a mere “paper state” since its founding as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) in October 2006. But the video release of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declaring himself the caliph on July 4 2014 marked a turning point in contemporary history. Ideological enemies of the caliphate were executed by beheading or being burned alive. The group’s official videos, generally described as “slick” and “Hollywood-esque”, heavily emphasised two vital aspects of its identity: Islamic and state. The Islamic aspect of IS has been debated at length by scholars – especially the question of how much they had to do with Islam, if at all. But little research has been done to investigate the statehood claim made by IS. The fact IS termed itself as Islamic State, or ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah (الدولة الإسلامية) in Arabic, demonstrated its claim to be a state in the truest sense of the word – not just to citizens living in the territory it controlled, but to its supporters and enemies worldwide. These aimed not only to back up its statehood claims but to seek recognition from its subjects and supporters for the caliphate project. For our book, Islamic State, Media and Propaganda: Performances of the ‘Visual Caliphate’, we conducted an in-depth visual analysis of 374 official IS videos. These were published between the caliphate’s establishment in July 2014 and its dismantlement in July 2017, and collected from various online IS channels before their takedown in mid-2015, when Twitter started suspending thousands of pro-IS accounts en-masse. We looked at the videos IS produced through four different analyses. The population analysis reveals IS’s portrayal of itself as a vibrant Islamic society. IS depicted its people as a cohesive community living under shariah law, emphasising gendered roles and the Bay’ah citizenship agreement, which privileged Sunni Muslims while marginalising minorities. This analysis highlights the disproportionate portrayal of men as fighters and breadwinners. Women, meanwhile, were largely invisible on screen, confined to domestic roles as wives and mothers. Young boys were groomed as future fighters while girls were portrayed as “pearls of chastity” and trained to raise the next generation of the caliphate. Surprisingly, women did make a one-off appearance when they were shown fighting alongside men on the battlefield as the caliphate was on its last legs. This analysis unravels three stages of IS’s expansionist territorial strategy. Finally, project the victory to followers and opponents alike. The group projected itself as a de facto sovereign state capable of capturing, controlling and defending its territory with the help of modern technology such as drones, maps and weaponry. This showcases IS’s efforts to project itself as a modern state by documenting its governance practices, including law enforcement, public services and administration. They regularly featured state symbols such as the IS flag and its gold dinar currency. These displays of performative governance were made at a time when the caliphate was constantly pummelled by military operations conducted by both US- and Russia-led coalitions. Despite its strict Salafi identity (an orthodox Islamic movement that advocates a return to the practices and beliefs of the first three generations of Muslims), IS presented itself as a modern state by deploying tools such as its own branding, currency, infrastructure and taxation. IS interactions with other states and non-state actors were presented as foreign policy. Instead, IS engaged in “rebel diplomacy” with other jihadi groups. The aim was to co-opt them into its global network of affiliates. Our analysis reveals how IS used civilian casualties caused by coalition airstrikes to justify terror attacks abroad. According to a narrative attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, burning alive as a form of punishment is forbidden in Islam. This was an unprecedented feat in contemporary history, and shows how IS’s theatrical performances of statehood were carefully scripted and staged. But it has risen in other regions of Asia and Africa, including Central Asia, East Africa and the Sahel region.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For some people, the mere sight of someone tapping their foot, twirling their hair or clicking a pen can trigger an intense sense of discomfort, or even rage. This reaction is known as “misokinesia”, a sensitivity to repetitive movements that can make everyday interactions challenging. It is only a recently explored phenomenon in research. Misokinesia may affect a person’s job and their personal lives. Misokinesia produces what has been likened by some as a “fight or flight” response in people living with the condition, with reactions including an increase in blood pressure, adrenaline and heart palpitations. Other physical reactions such as nausea are possible too. There can also be cognitive reactions, such as a lack of focus or patience, negative or violent thoughts, and feelings of anger and disgust. Misokinesia is similar to misophonia, which is a strong dislike or hatred of certain sounds, often made by people, such as yawning, breathing or chewing. It can also be person-specific and can affect a person’s day-to-day life, including their ability to regulate their emotions. While the two conditions can co-occur, they are distinct experiences. Given that some people with misophonia report experiencing misokinesia too, it suggests a possible shared neurological basis. But research into both conditions remains in its early stages. The exact causes of misokinesia remain unclear, but it may be due to a combination of neurological, psychological and genetic factors. There is evidence that neurodivergent people, including autistic people and those with ADHD, may be more likely to experience both misokinesia and misophonia. Read more: Misophonia – when certain sounds drive you crazy It can also reduce the likelihood that they will seek support. Discussions are ongoing about whether they should be recognised as clinical conditions, however. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be one way to reduce the effects of both misokinesia and misophonia on a person’s life. Practical strategies, such as subtly blocking one’s view of the movement, shifting focus to another part of the environment, or explaining triggers to those around them may also help reduce distress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The central U.S. could experience historic flash flooding this week as torrential rains and thunderstorms repeatedly strike the same areas, forecasters have announced. Weather website AccuWeather has warned of the potential for a 1-in-1,000-year flood across northeastern Arkansas to western Kentucky, with the worst-hit areas to receive the equivalent of four months' worth of rain in just five days. In some cases, this will fall on areas that could be vulnerable to flooding, having already received a great deal of rainfall in recent months. "We're concerned about the risk of life-threatening and historic flash flooding, which could evolve into a major river flooding event," Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather, said in a statement. "Dangerous situations can escalate to life-threatening emergencies in a matter of seconds with a flash flooding threat as serious as this."

Some of these same regions have already battled deadly flooding this year, particularly Kentucky, where flooding led to the deaths of at least 24 people in February. Porter noted that people in the affected areas should be prepared to make for higher ground. "Relentless rainfall will cause problems along creeks, streams, and low-lying flood-prone areas first before evolving into a river flooding problem as all of the water tries to flow downstream," Porter said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the study, researchers used three-dimensional simulations to reveal unexpected disturbances around fast-moving cones. At hypersonic speeds — above Mach 5, or more than 5 times the speed of sound (3,836 mph or 6,174 kilometers per hour) — the flow of air around a vehicle's surface becomes complex and bumpy. Most simulations assume that the flow is symmetrical around the whole cone, but until recently, studies of the transition from streamlined to turbulent were only possible in two dimensions so we couldn't be sure that there weren't any asymmetries in flow around a three-dimensional structure. The findings could help engineers design stronger, faster vehicles able to withstand the extreme temperatures, pressures and vibrations felt during hypersonic flight. "Transitioning flows are 3D and unsteady in nature, regardless of the flow geometry," study co-author Irmak Taylan Karpuzcu , an aerospace engineer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said in a statement . "Experiments were conducted in 3D in the early 2000s [but they] didn't provide enough data to determine any 3D effects or unsteadiness because there weren't enough sensors all around the cone-shaped model. Using the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, Karpuzcu and aerospace engineer Deborah Levin simulated how air flow around a cone-shaped object — often used as a simplified model for hypersonic vehicles — changes in three dimensions at high speed. They studied both a single cone and a double cone, which helps scientists study how multiple shock waves interact with each other.

The disturbances also seem to develop at high speeds. It would be too expensive to run the simulation at every speed, but we did run it at Mach 6 and did not see a break in the flow," Karpuzcu said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Still, it performs reasonably well in small to medium-sized rooms and does not cost the earth or require expensive filter replacements, striking a good balance for the budget-conscious. If you type "air purifier" in Amazon's search bar, chances are you will see the Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier as one of your top choices. This unassuming appliance has gathered hundreds of positive reviews and it is often on sale, at times costing as little as $79.99. It sounds like a great budget-friendly alternative to some of the best air purifiers — but does the Morento MR5866 offer good value for money? The Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier is easy to assemble and comes with a detailed manual. The Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier is available in three colors: white, gray and black. We were also somewhat underwhelmed by its chunky shape. True, this inoffensively basic design may blend in with various home decors easily, but it lacks the uniqueness and character of some of the more premium models. Looks aside, it is quite a well-designed air purifier. This air purifier measures only 17.7 inches (45 cm) in height and 13.6 inches (34.5 cm) in width, making it a good option for desktops and tight spaces. This means it requires two sets of air filters, each consisting of a pre-filter that captures hair, dust and other large particles, a HEPA filter that traps airborne pollutants as small as 0.3 microns, and an activated carbon filter that helps reduce bad smells and VOCs (volatile organic compounds.) While this dual-layer design may sound expensive to maintain, that is fortunately not the case. On the contrary, a two-pack of filter replacements costs a very reasonable $23.99 — much cheaper than similar filter replacements from other air purifier brands. In terms of smart features, this air purifier lived up to our expectations. Our Morento MR5866 swiftly connected to third-party devices and we did not experience any connectivity issues during testing. The Morento MR5866 has three manually adjusted fan speeds, an auto mode, sleep mode and timer, so you can schedule its working hours in advance and leave it to regulate its fan speed based on air quality readings. This air purifier features a built-in air quality monitor and its measurements are displayed in the app and on the unit's control panel. However, the Morento MR5866 can only track airborne particles that measure at least 2.5 microns. While this accounts for many common pollutants like dust, pollen and some mold spores, it does not include any smaller particles, of which there are plenty in the indoor air — the aforementioned VOCs, for example. We were also disappointed that the Morento MR5866 shows only real-time air quality measurements, meaning we could not track changes over time. The Havaworks app can only display real-time air quality measurements. However, we think it is better suited to small- and medium-sized rooms than large spaces, for which it is often advertised. This corresponds with our experience — the Morento MR5866 made a tangible difference to the air quality in our relatively small bedroom, but its effects were less noticeable in larger spaces. To fully assess its air-cleaning capabilities, we conducted a series of performance tests using a Perfect Prime air particle monitor , a professional device capable of detecting airborne pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. We started with an ambient air quality test: We put the Morento MR5866 in an enclosed medium-sized room, measured baseline air quality and then ran it on auto mode for 30 minutes. These numbers are not too impressive — other air purifiers in this price range can deliver better results. That said, the Morento MR5866 managed to redeem itself during our smoke tests. We burned matches and incense sticks to create different types of heavy pollution, then measured the changes in air quality before and after running the air purifier for 30 minutes. We conducted several tests on the maximum fan speed and auto settings, and on average, the Morento MR5866 achieved an 86% reduction in 0.3-micron particles, a 97% reduction in 2.5-micron particles, and a 99.5% decrease in particles measuring 10 microns or more. While it is not the most powerful air purifier we tested, it still delivers a good air-cleaning performance for the price. The Morento MR5866 offers accurate measurements of airborne particles measuring 2.5 microns and more. We measured how loud the Morento MR5866 was at different fan speeds using a Sound Meter decibel-counting app, and we did not get a measurement higher than 58 dB — equivalent to the sound of a quiet conversation. At its lowest fan speed, we could barely hear it working. Our only grumble about this air purifier is that it has underpowered fans. The Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier has plenty of positive online reviews. Amazon 's customer reviews place the Morento MR5866 at a 4.5 out of 5 stars rating, with 79% of users giving it a full five stars. Positive reviews praised this air purifier for its compact design, quiet fans, wide app compatibility, ease of use and good value for money. As one happy user commented: "I’m very satisfied with this air purifier’s performance. While it truly shines in smaller rooms, it still makes a noticeable difference in larger spaces, helping to improve overall air quality. [...] The noise level is low on standard settings, and while higher speeds are slightly louder, it’s definitely nothing that would keep you awake. And if you are very sensitive to sound, it has a “night mode” which is almost impossible to hear, it makes the operation quiet enough that I sometimes have forgotten it was even on. [...] For the price, it’s a fantastic option that I’d wholeheartedly recommend!" Negative reviews, on the other hand, often revolved around individual faulty units and network-related app issues that render the air purifier "unusable." Should you buy the Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier? The Morento MR5866 Air Purifier offers great value for money. For as little as $79.99, the Morento MR5866 does a good job of trapping airborne pollutants without being too noisy or taking up much space. Plus, it connects to a range of smart home apps and does not require costly filter replacements. ❌ Don't buy it if: You want cutting-edge performance and advanced air quality monitoring. If Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier isn't for you Its looks and performance closely match the Morento MR5866, but it tends to be cheaper by around $50. Then you can't go wrong with the Levoit Core 600S . It is one of the best air purifiers on the market for functionality and air-cleaning performance, but it will set you back by around $299.99. We tested the Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier using a professional-grade device that can detect airborne pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. We spent over two weeks testing the Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier, looking at its design, functionality, day-to-day performance, ease of use and value for money. We started with an ambient air quality test: we put the Morento MR5866 Smart Air Purifier in an enclosed, medium-sized room and ran it on auto mode for 30 minutes, taking note of air quality changes every 15 minutes. We burned matches and incense sticks to create different types of heavy pollution, then measured the air quality before and after running the air purifier for 30 minutes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An ancient slab of Earth's crust buried deep beneath the Midwest is sucking huge swatches of present-day's North American crust down into the mantle, researchers say. These drips are located beneath an area spanning from Michigan to Nebraska and Alabama, but their presence appears to be impacting the entire continent. The dripping area looks like a large funnel, with rocks from across North America being pulled toward it horizontally before getting sucked down. As a result, large parts of North America are losing material from the underside of their crust, the researchers said. "Luckily, we also got the new idea about what drives this thinning," said Hua, now a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors Cratonic thinning refers to the wearing away of cratons, which are regions of Earth's continental crust and upper mantle that have mostly remained intact for billions of years. Despite their stability, cratons can undergo changes , but this has never been observed in action due to the huge geologic time scales involved, according to the study. Now, for the first time, researchers have documented cratonic thinning as it occurs. The discovery was possible thanks to a wider project led by Hua to map what lies beneath North America using a high-resolution seismic imaging technique called "full-waveform inversion." This technique uses different types of seismic waves to extract all the available information about physical parameters underground. A map showing seismic speed in Earth’s crust at 125 miles depth across the continental U.S. and portions of Central America and Canada. The North American craton (outlined in black dashes) has a high seismic velocity (dark blue) compared to its surroundings. "This sort of thing is important if we want to understand how a planet has evolved over a long time," study co-author Thorsten Becker , a distinguished chair in geophysics at UT Austin, said in the statement. "Because of the use of this full-waveform method, we have a better representation of that important zone between the deep mantle and the shallower lithosphere [crust and upper mantle]." A dripping area formed when the slab was present, but it disappeared when the slab was absent, confirming that — theoretically, at least — a sunken slab can drag rocks across a large area down into Earth's interior .</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For me, then a 22-year-old master’s student in construction engineering, that day shattered everything I understood about my future. Air raid sirens wailed, their sound slicing through the early morning stillness. Outside, people hurried past with suitcases, their faces pale and tense, while others lined up at pharmacies and ATMs, their hands trembling as they stocked up on essentials. My family and friends sent frantic messages (Are you safe? Fear settled in like a second skin, thick and suffocating. We were all touched by the war, including my family. My father, who is a scientist and professor of Mykolaiv University of Shipbuilding, voluntarily joined the military forces to fight for Ukraine and give my family the possibility to work and study while the war raged outside. Meanwhile, my hometown, Mykolaiv – previously a strategically important shipbuilding and port city on the Black Sea – became a key stepping-stone for Russian forces on the road to Odesa. It is very close to currently occupied territories and the frontline. The Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges. As my home was attacked, I realised something fundamental: bridges were not just engineering projects. Rebuilding bridges and roads is about more than repairing physical structures; it is about restoring security, economic stability and vital connections between communities. A collapsed bridge isolates people from essential services, disrupting supply chains and deepening vulnerability. The war has exposed just how critical Ukraine’s infrastructure is for survival. The Snihurivka Bridge, another key crossing, was also wiped out, leaving thousands stranded without reliable access to healthcare and supplies. For months, humanitarian aid and commerce were forced onto alternative, unreliable routes, further isolating communities. My laptop battery was draining and a single candle flickered beside me. I was writing a research paper on strengthening methods for buildings and infrastructure. Yet, all around me real infrastructure was collapsing, making my work feel disconnected from reality. Simple tasks like boiling water for tea, charging a phone, or even sending an email became unpredictable challenges. Read more: Ukraine: the UN’s ‘responsibility to protect’ doctrine is a hollow promise for civilians under fire At that moment, a question struck me: what if science could help rebuild Ukraine? Could research, something that had once felt so theoretical, actually make a difference in the aftermath of war? My supervisor introduced me to BridgeUkraine: a research alliance of people focused on rebuilding Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. The project aimed to not only repair what was damaged but to build better infrastructure: homes that are more resilient, more sustainable and ready for future crises. Mitoulis recalled that the whole idea for BridgeUkraine was born out of a deeply personal moment: I first thought of BridgeUkraine when I spoke with my former MSc student, Marat Khodzhaiev, who was in Ukraine when the war started. He was stranded in his house and at risk of missing the opportunity to graduate from his MSc course in the UK. All bridges around him had collapsed, there was no escape route. BridgeUkraine became more than just a research alliance, it became a mission that ensures that Ukraine’s recovery will be driven by its own people, equipped with the best knowledge and tools to rebuild their country. The KSE Institute estimates that more than 300 bridges across Ukraine require urgent reconstruction, with damages exceeding US$2.6 billion. But this isn’t all about infrastructure; it is about securing Ukraine’s independence and ensuring that its economy and society can function even under the most difficult conditions. To address these challenges, rebuilding Ukraine’s infrastructure cannot follow conventional methods. At BridgeUkraine, we are developing solutions that prioritise resilience over quick fixes. Instead of rebuilding vulnerable structures, we are integrating sustainable materials, climate-adaptive engineering, and strategic planning to ensure that Ukraine’s transport networks are built to last. There are no academic guidelines on how to rebuild after such destruction. What is the most effective way to approach reconstruction in this context? It must not only reconnect communities but also support economic recovery and long-term resilience. But such ethical reconstruction must be inclusive, sustainable and community-driven, ensuring that those who depend on infrastructure have a say in how it is rebuilt. Reconstruction must be a participatory, creative effort – one that rebuilds cities with beauty and meaning, connecting them to their past while preparing for the future. Too often, post-war recovery efforts have been dictated by external donors, prioritising short-term economic gains over long-term resilience. It was only through the persistence of local architects and historians that parts of the Old Town were painstakingly restored to reflect their original designs. Instead, it must empower local communities, integrating their knowledge, needs and skills into the reconstruction process. Read more: Rebuilding Homs: how to resurrect a city after years of conflict This vision started to take shape through workshop discussions with experts in geography and urban planning. Everyone agreed on the need for an adaptable transportation system where modular designs and relocatable, prefabricated bridges (like the Mabey bridge in US) could respond to evolving demands and disruptions. Revolutionising damage assessment with AI, radar and satellite imagery A clear picture of what has been destroyed allows for smarter decisions, prioritising the most urgent repairs and using resources effectively. Our latest research, published in Automation in Construction, introduces a faster, more precise way to assess damage to key infrastructure, particularly bridges. By providing rapid, data-driven insights, our method helps ensure that reconstruction efforts start where they are needed most, speeding up recovery and making rebuilding efforts more effective. It significantly improved both the speed and accuracy of damage assessments. Using Sentinel-1 SAR images (radar satellite images from the European Space Agency’s Copernicus program), crowdsourced data (photos and reports from people on the ground), and high-resolution imagery, we developed a comprehensive approach for damage detection and classification. This approach works on multiple levels: it provides a big-picture view of damage across entire regions while also zooming in on specific structural issues in individual bridge components. By combining satellite data with detailed images, our method makes damage assessments more precise, faster and safer, ensuring that reconstruction efforts focus on the most critical areas first. These findings can play a crucial role in damage and needs assessment such as those conducted by the World Bank. In war zones, destruction often affects vital humanitarian and evacuation corridors, making it essential to prioritise reconstruction based on factors such as the national importance of a bridge, its role in border crossings, and its impact on social services. For instance, the failure of a bridge could disrupt emergency response efforts, further complicating recovery. But rebuilding after a disaster is also an opportunity to create something stronger, smarter, built to last – and with a sustainable focus. Given Ukraine’s commitment to net-zero emissions and resilience, we expanded our research [and published a study] which introduced an innovative model for rebuilding infrastructure that can withstand future hazards while minimising carbon emissions. At its core, the model features a “smart prioritisation system” that helps decision-makers allocate resources effectively. It assesses key factors such as repair urgency, community impact and long-term durability, ensuring that rebuilding efforts provide the greatest benefits where they are needed most. As Stanislav Gvozdikov, deputy director of Euro-integration Process at Ukraine’s State Road Research Institute, told me: “Every bridge we restore, every road we reopen, isn’t just about infrastructure, it’s about restoring life, reconnecting families and ensuring that communities have the resilience to withstand whatever comes next.” This is already a reality near my home town, Mykolaiv, where newly rebuilt bridges have restored transport links and also revived local economies, giving people hope for the future. The UK-Ukraine 100-year agreement, announced in February 2025, underscored a deep commitment to Ukraine’s security, economic resilience, and post-war reconstruction. A key part of this mission is training engineers, equipping them with the latest knowledge in damage assessment, resilience-based and people-centred design and international standards to lead Ukraine’s reconstruction. We come from different backgrounds – engineering, economics, policy, humanitarian efforts, and governmental bodies. But we all share the same motivation in wanting to help our country. Leading researchers from Ukraine specialising in AI technologies, infrastructure engineering, sustainable and energy-saving buildings or climate change, are also members of BridgeUkraine. AI-specialist, Ivan Izonin has spoken passionately about how he believes that the collaborative efforts we have started “will lay the foundation for large-scale scientific projects that will be pivotal in post-war reconstruction…”. Another enthusiastic Ukrainian researcher, Khrystyna Myroniuk, who specialises in building physics, told me how the collaboration had given her the opportunity to continue her “research on sustainable housing solutions for Ukraine”. This trend has had a significant impact on the country’s ability to rebuild. Engineers, architects and other highly trained specialists have long been a pillar of Ukraine’s development. Our engagement with Ukrainian engineers then sparked another idea: what if we trained local professionals to apply our expertise, equipping them to drive this transformation within their engineering communities? This vision became the foundation of the Empower Ukraine programme, through which, over 5,000 engineers and scientists will be trained in European (Eurocodes) and international design standards. This ensures that Ukraine’s recovery is driven by its own people, equipped with the latest global knowledge. By bridging the knowledge gap and integrating the best methods and ideas from across Europe, Ukraine can position itself as a leader in resilient infrastructure design. To date, our expertise has been shared with over 1,500 Ukrainians. Argyroudis emphasised to me how critical the role of engineers will be in Ukraine’s reconstruction, saying: “It’s about rebuilding Ukrainian identity as a country.” The ultimate goal is to build a culture of innovation and self-reliance among local professionals who have the expertise and passion to drive this change. Professionals can now contribute to projects and be part of a larger community of practice, which brings together engineers, academics and international partners. My hometown, Mykolaiv, still bears the scars of war. War has taken, and continues to take so much, but it has also forged a new generation of engineers who understand that our profession is no longer just about calculations and designs. Three years ago, I would have imagined a very different career for myself. I am committed to ethical and inclusive infrastructure recovery in Ukraine, because science must be the foundation of national resilience. Ethical reconstruction must prioritise people over profits, creating systems that empower and strengthen communities. Ukraine’s recovery is about setting a global precedent for post-conflict reconstruction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, has backed a move for Adolescence to be shown in schools, and Netflix has now made the series available to be shown for free in classrooms through charity Into Film+, which has also produced a guide for teachers. Resources for teachers and parents will also be produced by relationships charity Tender. Adolescence is a drama and deserves the praise it has attracted. Not all boys will see themselves reflected in this portrayal. And as a researcher working on masculinity and misogyny, my concern is that showing the series in schools may lead boys to think that they are all perceived as potential threats. Showing the series as a teaching tool risks framing boyhood as monolithic, with one particular – and problematic – way of being a boy. In research I have carried out for a forthcoming book on boys and masculinity, I worked with young men and boys aged 13 to 19. One 15-year-old boy said that “I am always told that I am part of the problem but never allowed to be part of the solution”. I also found that this broad blame culture leads to feelings of worthlessness in young men and boys, which shuts down vital dialogue and also may lead them to resort to looking for direction from negative spaces such as the manosphere. There is evidently a serious, endemic and complex problem. The misogyny that can be popularised by toxic influencers online also needs urgently addressing. Other aspects of identity, such as race, age, class, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, sexuality and physical and mental health will have implications for the approaches that need to be taken. My ongoing research has demonstrated that boyhood means differing things to different boys. This was also highlighted in a further 16 focus groups carried out on the project, again with a range of boys. The external self is what they felt they should show as a boys to fit into the hierarchy of masculinity and how they should portray themselves to fit within the social expectations of being a boy. This causes a conflict of external and internal self. The monolithic perspective of “boys” and the ensuing group blame oversimplifies complex issues, resulting in less than effective solutions and interventions that do not acknowledge or account for the nuances and complexities that surround individual boys. It risks stereotyping them and causing prejudicial approaches. When boys are stigmatised in such a way, it compounds issues across genders, breaks down valuable communication and can also cause resentment and hostility. One of the key voices and valuable perspectives that is missing from this debate is that of young men and boys themselves. We need to truly listen to their perspectives and their needs and build upon these as they are the experts in the world they are experiencing. Good practice accounts for and builds upon these experiences, with young people. My research has demonstrated that young people want to be a part of these discussions rather than having things decided for them. It also shows that, quite often, we are teaching them what they already know and providing support and education that is too little, too late. We need to move away from the broad brush blaming of boys and young men and begin to approach them based upon their own individual identities – of which gender is only a part.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The success of Netflix drama Adolescence, along with concerns about misogynistic influencers such as Andrew Tate, has brought the “manosphere” into public discussion. Many parents, particularly of young boys, may fear they don’t know enough about what their children are exposed to online. I research radical misogyny online, and the pathways by which young people encounter these spaces. Here is what parents should know about this content. It includes multiple groups that differ in their aims and focus, but are all largely anti-feminist. These groups discuss masculinity, but also topics such as health, gaming, politics and finance. They trivialise hateful rhetoric through memes, comedy and trolling (provocation or bullying for amusement) by framing it as self-help, entertainment and tools for financial success. Manosphere content is promoted by various influencers on popular social media platforms. These influencers often showcase unattainable wealth and status, selling the illusion that followers can achieve success by adopting their teachings. The most notable manosphere influencer is Andrew Tate, who rose to fame in 2022. However, he is not the only influencer out there. The extent of real-world effects is difficult to measure, and not everyone who engages with the manosphere will go on to commit violence. But it’s clear that these communities can promote violence or spread harmful ideas about women and girls. It is important to note, however, that this content also harms men and young boys. In the manosphere, this rule is used to blame women for mens’ feelings of sexual or romantic rejection. Influencers and community members promote step-by-step instructions that people can follow to improve their social standing. Many of these guides involve extreme or harmful physical transformations in a phenomenon known as “looksmaxxing”, which can even involve facial surgery in a bid to increase their sexual “value”. Read more: ‘Looksmaxxing’ is the disturbing TikTok trend turning young men into incels The manosphere has an expansive lexicon which is used to incite hatred towards women and fuel rivalry between men. White Knight, Soyboy : Derogatory terms describe men who are viewed as being subservient to women. Parents should not panic if they hear their children using manosphere terms. Most adolescents will come across manosphere content at some point. A recent survey found that 59% of boys accessed manosphere content through innocent and unrelated searches. This doesn’t necessarily mean that they endorse the misogynistic values spread by these groups. Here are some steps you can take to support your child. Research commissioned by media regulator Ofcom found that children were more likely to come across harmful content if their parents are less engaged in what they are doing. It is important that you are not trying to intervene or critique, but rather understand why they enjoy watching certain influencers or content. Research suggests that teaching children to be sceptical about what they see online can inoculate them against mis- and disinformation. The most obvious disinformation they are most likely to come across in the manosphere may be in the form of statistics, summaries of “academic” reports, and news articles about instances of female aggression or false rape allegations. These kinds of questions can help them develop their own fact-checking skills without it seeming like a lesson. The best way to get around this is to ask simple open-ended questions such as “How do boys in your class talk about girls?” or “Have you ever heard of…?” What you hear may be shocking, but approach it with curiosity and without judgment or dismissal to let them know they can share things with you. If you are concerned about your child’s behaviour, you can also get support from resources such as Young Minds mental health support, the Center for Countering Digital Hate’s free parents guide or the government’s radicalisation helpline ACT Early. Getting support from government services is not a punishment. It won’t go on a person’s criminal record, but can provide access to governmental services like Prevent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As soon as the genetic testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy on March 23, 2025, concerns about what would happen to the personal information contained in its massive genetic and health information database were swift and widespread. Michigan’s attorney general released a statement warning that “23andMe collects and stores some of the most sensitive personal information, our genetic code.” When customers originally signed up for 23andMe, they agreed to terms and conditions and a privacy notice that allows the company to use their information for research and development as well as share their data, in aggregate, with third parties. If consumers consented to additional research, which the vast majority did, the company can additionally share their individual information with third parties. 23andMe has also been clear that if it is involved in a bankruptcy or sale of assets, consumer information might be sold or transferred. While 23andMe has warned customers all along about everything that is currently happening, many are still surprised and concerned. Understanding what information 23andMe has been collecting, and how it might be used if sold or shared, can help clarify concerns for consumers. It was backed by a large investment by Google, which quickly attracted the interest of other investors, allowing 23andMe to thrive when many other direct-to-consumer genetic companies went quickly out of business. The direct-to-consumer business model is fairly straightforward: A consumer orders a genetic test kit online, spits into a tube that comes in the mail, returns it to the company and accesses their results in an online portal. Over 15 million consumers bought 23andMe, and the vast majority consented to its research. Reasons for this rapid decline include a decrease in the sale of test kits after a 2023 hack of almost 7 million people’s data, as well as a failure to profit enough from providing data access to other private sector companies. Lack of private interest in 23andMe data may be related to the fact that much of the information the company collects is self-reported, which is often considered less reliable than information written down by a doctor in a medical record. And 23andMe collected more than just genetic data generated from consumers’ spit. This means that not only does 23andMe possess the genetic data of 15 million people, but it also possesses almost a billion additional data points associated with this genetic information. When 23andMe went public in 2021, its $6 billion valuation reflected the promise of this business model. But for over a decade, scholars, including me, have been warning that allowing 23andMe to collect and use personal data was not one that customers fully understood, or were actually comfortable with. In response to current public concern about data privacy, 23andMe has stated that there will be no changes to how it stores and protects data during its bankruptcy proceedings. But once that stage is through, what exactly should customers worry about? First, law enforcement could use genetic information in civil or criminal cases. Police pretended they were customers looking for genealogy data and sent in an old crime scene blood spot. Second, genetic information could be used to discriminate against customers if it shows that they have or are at high risk of developing a genetic disease or disorder. The federal Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act prohibits health insurers and employers from asking about genetic information or using it to discriminate in work or health insurance decisions. It does not, however, protect against discrimination in long-term care or life insurance. Many of the warnings from the media and attorneys general are focused on genetic information because it is unique to only one person. But direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies also retain a massive amount of personal information from the surveys consumers are asked to complete. Much of this information could be embarrassing if it were inadvertently or intentionally revealed, such as a person’s intelligence. In the 2025 book “Careless People,” former Meta executive Sarah Wynn-Williams reported that Facebook would use indications of self-consciousness about personal appearance, such as deleting a selfie, to promote beauty products. If companies know such intimate details about a person, they could not only be used to sell products, but also potentially manipulate them over social media or the internet in ways they do not even realize. It could be used for targeted advertising or to build algorithms that exploit a person’s vulnerabilities. But the survey data containing all sorts of other personal information are at least as much, if not more, of a privacy problem. This is particularly concerning if the data is pooled together with other information available on the internet, like a dating profile, to create a more detailed – and personal – picture of an individual. In the future, I would also warn consumers against freely gifting the private sector with information about their fears, hopes, limitations and successes. That information is valuable to more people than just you.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Imagine you’ve planned the trip of a lifetime for your animal-loving family: a cruise to Antarctica with the unique opportunity to view penguins, whales and other rare wildlife. Your adventure-loving kids can kayak through fjords, plunge into icy water and camp under the Antarctic sky. But rather than being ecstatic, as you anticipated, your kids whine about skipping an after-school scout meeting at a neighbor’s house. Missing this ordinary weekly event triggers such intense FOMO – “fear of missing out” – for them that they don’t want to go on your amazing expedition. The three of us are marketing professors and social psychologists who focus on how consumers make decisions and how this shapes well-being. We’ve been studying FOMO for over a decade and recently published our work in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Over the years, we’ve learned what really drives intense feelings of FOMO – which explains why a run-of-the-mill meeting might feel more crucial than an over-the-top vacation. People use the term FOMO in many different ways. In our research, we focus on a very specific type of FOMO: the kind that occurs when people miss out on events that involve valued social connections. With this kind of FOMO, we found that the pain of missing out is not related to missing the actual event or opportunity – although that could be there as well. So, the critical part of FOMO is missing out on interactions with people you value. Imagine the scenario where all your best friends go out to dinner without you. If they get closer to each other, where does that leave you? People with what psychologists call an anxious attachment style chronically fear rejection and isolation from others. Because FOMO involves anxiety about future social belonging, it may not come as a surprise that people who are naturally more anxious about their friendships tend to get more intense FOMO. When we asked people in one of our studies to scroll social media until they encountered something social they missed, we found that the more anxiously attached a participant was, the more intense FOMO they experienced. Getting FOMO for an amazing event you can’t attend makes sense. But if FOMO is less about the event itself and more about the social bonding, what happens when you miss something that’s not really fun at all? We find that people anticipate FOMO even for unenjoyable missed events. One of our studies found that people anticipated more FOMO from missing an un-fun event that their friends would be at, than a fun event without their friends. For better or for worse, sad and stressful events can often be emotionally bonding: Going to a funeral to support a friend, cleaning up the mess after a party, or even white-knuckling through a harrowing initiation ceremony can all offer opportunities to forge stronger connections with one another. Stressful contexts like these can be fertile grounds for FOMO. Consequently, much of the suggested advice on how to mitigate FOMO centers on turning off phones or taking a vacation from social media. Those recommendations may be tough for many people to execute. In an experiment testing multiple interventions, we asked 788 study participants to look through their social media feeds until they encountered a post of a missed social event. We asked about 200 of these participants to immediately rate how much FOMO they were feeling. Another group of about 200 participants also scrolled through their social media feeds until they encountered a post of a missed social event. But before indicating how much FOMO they were feeling, we asked them to think back to a prior experience socializing and bonding with their friends. Their average FOMO rating was 2.7 out of 7, a significant drop. And missing out on social bonding experiences doesn’t have to be anxiety-provoking. To quote Stuart Smalley, the fictional self-help guru of 1990s “Saturday Night Live,” reminding yourself that “I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!” might be just the trick to mitigate FOMO.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I fondly remember trips to the Fellow-Reeves Museum in Wichita, Kansas, and the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. A 1908 photograph of my great-grandparents picking cotton has been used as a poster by the Oklahoma Historical Society. This love of learning history continued into my years as a graduate student of history, when I would spend hours at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum learning about the history of human flight and ballooning. As a professor, I’ve integrated the institution’s exhibits into my history courses. On March 27, 2025, the president issued an executive order, “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which asserted, “Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth. Under this historical revision, our Nation’s unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed.” There will always be a variety of views about what should be included and excluded from America’s story. For example, in my own research, I found that Prohibition-era school boards in the 1920s argued over whether it was appropriate for history textbooks to include pictures of soldiers drinking to illustrate the 1791 Whiskey Rebellion. But most recent debates center on how much attention should be given to the history of the nation’s accomplishments over its darker chapters. The Smithsonian Institution was founded in 1846 thanks to its namesake, British chemist James Smithson. Smithson willed his estate to his nephew and stated that if his nephew died without an heir, the money – roughly US$15 million in today’s dollars – would be donated to the U.S. to found “an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.” In her book “The Stranger and the Statesman,” historian Nina Burleigh shows how Smithson’s bequest was nearly lost due to battles between competing interests. Southern plantation owners and western frontiersmen, including President Andrew Jackson, saw the establishment of a national museum as an unnecessary assertion of federal power. They also challenged the very idea of accepting a gift from a non-American and thought that it was beneath the dignity of the government to confer immortality on someone simply because of a large donation. In the end, a group led by congressman and former president John Quincy Adams ensured Smithson’s vision was realized. Today the Smithsonian runs 14 education and research centers, the National Zoo and 21 museums, including the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which was created with bipartisan support during President George W. Bush’s administration. In the introduction to his book “Smithsonian’s History of America in 101 Objects,” cultural anthropologist Richard Kurin talks about how the institution has also supported hundreds of small and large institutions outside of the nation’s capital. In 2024, the Smithsonian sent over 2 million artifacts on loan to museums in 52 U.S. states and territories and 33 foreign countries. YouGov has periodically tracked Americans’ approval of the Smithsonian, which has held steady at roughly 68% approval and 2% disapproval since 2020. In 1991, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which was then known as the National Museum of American Art, created an exhibition titled “The West as America, Reinterpreting Images of the Frontier, 1820-1920.” Conservatives complained that the museum portrayed western expansion as a tale of conquest and destruction, rather than one of progress and nation-building. But the debate raised questions about whether public museums were able to express ideas that are critical of the U.S. without risk of censorship. Meanwhile, other activists protested the exhibition by arguing that a symbol of human destruction shouldn’t be commemorated at an institution that’s supposed to celebrate human achievement. The first Trump administration quickly responded by forming its 1776 commission. In January 2021, it produced a report critiquing the 1619 project, claiming that an emphasis on the country’s history of racism and slavery was counterproductive to promoting “patriotic education.” Trump reissued it after retaking the White House, and pointed to figures he’d like to see included, such as Christopher Columbus, George Washington, Betsy Ross, Sitting Bull, Bob Hope, Thurgood Marshall and Whitney Houston. I don’t think there is anything wrong with honoring Americans, though I think a focus on celebrities and major figures clouds the fascinating histories of ordinary Americans. I also find it troubling that there seems to be such a concerted effort to so forcefully shape the teaching and understanding of history via threats and bullying. Yale historian Jason Stanley has written about how aspiring authoritarian governments seek to control historical narratives and discourage an exploration of the complexities of the past. In his executive order, Trump noted that “Museums in our Nation’s capital should be places where individuals go to learn.” I share that view. Doing so, however, means not dismantling history, but instead complicating the story – in all its messy glory.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In April 1994, an Israeli rabbi named Ido Alba published an article that read, in part, “In war, as long as the war has not been decided, it is a commandment to kill every non-Jew from the nation one is fighting against, even women and children. An Israeli court convicted Alba for incitement to racism and encouraging violence and sentenced him to four years in prison. Now the legal system is ignoring similar rhetoric. In December 2023, following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which resulted in the killing of approximately 1,200 Israeli civilians, soldiers and migrant workers, Rabbi Moshe Ratt, who’s seen as a public intellectual among Israeli West Bank settlers, composed a long post on Facebook. In it, he noted that in the past, some people may have struggled with the morality of destroying an entire people, including women and children. Obliquely referring to the Palestinians, he added, “Some nations have descended into such depths of evil and corruption that the only solution is to eradicate them completely, leaving no trace.” More recently, on Feb. 24, 2025, Nissim Vaturi, one of the deputy speakers in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, called for killing all Palestinian adults in Gaza. They date back to the 1930s, and have gained steam – and more public acceptance – as prospects for peace fell apart in the 1990s, existential anxiety among Israelis has grown, and religious Zionists have gained more political power in the 21st century. The founding fathers of Zionism openly discussed ideas for relocating Palestinians, which were usually envisioned as voluntary. These notions are not entirely unlike U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to transfer Palestinians from Gaza to other countries. Attempts to dispossess majority indigenous populations are usually violent themselves, however, and almost always run up against resistance. In that same vein, conflict between Zionist settlers and Palestinians has existed from the outset. Repeated violence and attacks can fuel existential anxiety among settlers, along with fantasies of achieving “permanent security” or absolute safety against future threats. In Israel, there’s also a history of biblical justifications for violence and genocide. This sort of rhetoric has waxed and waned over time; it’ll often exist on the margins in times of relative peace, but move into the mainstream during periods of violence and existential anxiety. Nonetheless, they adopted major Jewish symbols and treated Jewish tradition and religious texts as a source of inspiration, even as they didn’t ascribe them legal authority. The Bible contains some explicit narratives of annihilation. In Chapter 20, the Israelites are commanded: “You shall not leave a single soul alive. Throughout Jewish history, these edicts and stories have generally been interpreted as historical accounts or as metaphors, not commands to commit genocide. However, settlers of lands occupied by indigenous peoples – not just in Israel, but in other countries, too – have deployed these texts to condone mass violence. For example, in colonial America, Puritan settlers justified massacres of Native Americans by comparing them with Amalek. During the Arab-Israeli war in 1948, Israeli army education officers distributed texts to soldiers that read, “In biblical times, Saul exterminated all of Amalek, men and women, youth and elderly, and even sheep and cattle.” The materials also noted that “biblical Joshua was commanded to annihilate the nations of the land and was forbidden to make any treaties with them.” During that war, Israel uprooted an estimated 750,000 Palestinians. Israeli forces and civilians killed thousands who attempted to return over the ensuing years. Many religious Zionists perceived the military victories as miraculous. For religious Zionists, the state of Israel is a sacred endeavor. They’ve generally been less interested than secular Zionists in adhering to international norms and taking geopolitical considerations into account when pushing for the settlement of contested territories. For these religious Zionists, the settlement project is not simply a land grab: Settlers are taking land that the Bible has promised to them. In 1980, Israel Hess, who then held the official position as rabbi of Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, wrote in the student bulletin, “In a war between Israel and Amalek, it is a commandment to kill and annihilate infants and babies. Anyone who launches a war against the Jews.” These words triggered public backlash and prompted protests from several secular Zionist politicians. In the 1990s, calls for widespread violence were largely marginalized, since there was hope for a political compromise with the Palestinians. With no peaceful solution for the conflict on the horizon, Israeli and Palestinian figures who viewed politics through a theological framework kept accumulating power. As each side retaliated against the other, annihilation started to sound like a reasonable solution – a process that historian Yoav Di-Capua has termed “genocidal mirroring.” Israel, with its superior military capabilities, has a significantly greater capacity to inflict harm on Palestinians. The party has three official rabbis who advise its politicians. Another, Yisrael Ariel, has written that the Torah’s commandment “Thou shalt not kill” does not apply to non-Jews. When the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks reignited Israelis’ deep-seated fears of annihilation, calls for indiscriminate revenge grew louder. The Torah tells you: ‘Do not keep alive any soul,’ so you should not keep alive any soul.” Danny Neuman, a former football star and television commentator, said on TV in December 2023, “I am telling you, in Gaza, without exception, they are all terrorists, sons of dogs. They must be exterminated, all of them killed.” Kinneret Barashi, a lawyer and a television host, tweeted in February 2025, “Every trace of the murderous mutations in Gaza must be erased, from the delivery rooms to the last elderly person in Gaza.” These statements coincide with a grim reality on the ground. In the representative sample of Jewish Israelis who were polled from March 10-11, 2025, 82% supported the forced expulsion of Gaza’s population to other countries, while 56% endorsed the expulsion of Israel’s Arab citizens.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On any given day, 1.9 million people are incarcerated in more than 6,000 federal, state and local facilities. Another 3.7 million remain under what scholars call “correctional control” through probation or parole supervision. Yet despite its vast reach, the criminal justice system often fails at its most basic goal: preventing people from being rearrested, reconvicted or reincarcerated. Criminal justice experts call this “recidivism.” About 68% of people who leave prison in any given year are rearrested within three years, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. It’s certainly easy to blame individuals for getting rearrested or reincarcerated. But if you take a closer look at life after release – which often includes employment discrimination, housing barriers and exclusion from basic social services – recidivism seems less like a personal failure, I would argue, and more the workings of a broken system. Instead, they must navigate a web of legally imposed restrictions. I’ve recently undertaken research to understand the scale of this issue, aided by my former undergraduate student Skylar Hathorn, who is set to begin a master’s degree in the fall. As sociologist Reuben Miller and historian Amanda Alexander have put it, people convicted of felonies are transformed into “carceral citizens.” Why probation and parole are part of the problem Probation is community supervision, typically imposed by courts as an alternative to incarceration, and parole is a type of prison release under community supervision. While community supervision was originally designed to help those convicted of crimes reintegrate into society – through mentorship, supportive services and other resources – today, in my view, it largely functions as a punitive surveillance system. Instead of helping people reintegrate, the system enforces rules – such as forbidding contact with friends or family members who have criminal records – which create new challenges for people trying to rebuild their lives after prison. As one individual from my recent study on reentry put it, “That shit ain’t helping nobody.” On average, people under community supervision must comply with 10 to 20 conditions, such as mandatory drug tests, regular check-ins with supervising officers, or curfews. But while community supervision is supposed to encourage reintegration and personal responsibility, its conditions are often unrealistic, creating hidden traps rather than pathways to success. For example, imagine you’re lucky enough to find a decent job despite having a criminal record – but your probation officer schedules weekly meetings during your work hours. In one study of almost 4,000 people on probation, 55% missed at least one meeting with their parole officer, increasing their risk of reincarceration. What if you aren’t able to find a job or can’t afford to pay the supervision fees charged each month? What happens if you struggle with addiction and fail a drug test? Importantly, if you’re on probation or parole, your chances of being sent back to prison are very different depending on where you live. You can see just how different by visiting the Justice Outcomes Explorer, a new data dashboard created by the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System. Among those released on parole in 2018 from Utah prisons, roughly 51.6% were reincarcerated within a year. Although some variation may come from differences in data collection, much of it reflects policy choices. Part of the problem is that probation and parole offices vary considerably. This creates a system where, in effect, parole boards operate as resentencing entities. Differences in supervision fees, restrictions on associating with others, and the use of electronic monitoring also vary by state. Research suggests that Americans under community supervision must comply with many more conditions than they did just a few decades ago, which raises the question: Does any of this work? While some studies suggest that contemporary forms of supervision may reduce reincarceration, recent analyses call this into question. For example, one study compared people who were randomly placed under intensive probation supervision — requiring more office check-ins, home visits and drug tests — with those under traditional supervision. Researchers found that while both groups committed new crimes at the same rate, those under intensive supervision received technical violations – such as failing a drug test or not following curfew – more often, and were incarcerated more. In another rigorous study out of Kansas, using what researchers call a “natural experiment,” legal scholar Ryan Sakoda found that post-release supervision significantly increased reincarceration rates. This suggests that community supervision keeps people trapped in the system, rather than helping them escape it. For instance, Massachusetts sends a relatively small number of people back to prison or jail while they are on parole. But after retrieving data from a public records request, Skylar and I found that between 2020 and 2022, roughly 80% of all parole revocations were due to technical violations. In 2018, roughly 133,000 people were admitted to prison for technical violations. But that’s not the way it currently works. In 2021, New York implemented the “Less is More” Community Supervision and Revocation Reform Act, which reformed parole and reduced incarceration for technical violations. By April 2022, technical violators only made up 1.7% of the daily state jail population. On a similar note, criminal records limit access to a range of resources and opportunities such as housing, higher education, voting and social benefits like basic food assistance. That’s why Skylar and I support automatic criminal record expungement, among other structural reforms. Put plainly: Research points toward a system in need of comprehensive solutions. Without them, many will remain in the incarceration trap. Skylar Hathorn, a recent graduate of Suffolk University and master’s student starting in September 2025, contributed to this article.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When churchgoers learn how widespread this belief is, they report taking steps to reduce its effects, as we found in our research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. According to that data, while the overwhelming majority of Christian religious leaders accept the human-driven reality of climate change, nearly half have never mentioned climate change or humans’ role in it to their congregations. Further, only a quarter have spoken about it more than once or twice. When it comes to climate change, faith communities are often seen as divided. We then surveyed a sample of Christian Americans from major denominations across the country and found they think roughly half of Christian leaders in the U.S., and in churches like their own, deny that humans cause climate change. Churchgoers who think their religious leaders don’t believe humans cause climate change report being less likely to discuss it with fellow congregants and less interested in attending events that aim to address climate change or raise awareness of the issue. The research also tested what would happen if we informed churchgoers of the true level of consensus among their religious leaders who accept that climate change is driven by humans. In a brief survey, Christians were told the percentage of Christian leaders nationally, and among their denomination specifically, who accepted that human activities cause climate change. Specifically, churchgoers who were informed about the actual consensus among religious leaders in accepting climate change were more likely to state that “taking action to reduce climate change” was consistent with their church’s values. Churchgoers who received this information were also more likely to feel it would be inconsistent with their church’s values to vote for a political candidate who opposes actions that could slow climate change. These findings highlight that religious leaders have a unique power to influence climate action – but only if they let their beliefs be known. Religious leaders, often viewed as moral guides, have the ability to reshape climate discourse within faith communities. If they vocalize their acceptance of human-made climate change, we believe they can correct widespread misperceptions, foster dialogue and encourage action in ways that secular authorities may struggle to achieve. The Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During confirmation hearings, Mike Huckabee, President Donald Trump’s nominee as ambassador to Israel, told senators that he would “respect and represent the President,” not his own views. “The spiritual connections between your church, mine, many churches in America, Jewish congregations, to the state of Israel is because we ultimately are people of the book,” he said on March 25, 2025, in response to a question from a senator. “We believe the Bible, and therefore that connection is not geopolitical. Huckabee is one of the GOP’s most prominent “Christian Zionists” – a phrase often associated with conservative evangelicals’ support for Israel. American Christian attitudes toward the idea of a Jewish state have been evolving and changing dramatically since long before Israel’s creation. Zionism’s modern form emerged in the late 19th century. Its declared aim was to create a Jewish homeland in the region of Palestine, then under control of the Ottoman Empire. This was the land from which Jews were exiled in antiquity. Catholic leaders, however, were not among the supporters of a Jewish state. The prospect of a Jewish state in the Christian Holy Land challenged the church’s view of Judaism as a religion whose people were condemned to permanent exile as punishment for rejecting Christ. But it would be three decades until that change was reflected in the Vatican’s diplomatic recognition of the Jewish state. Within a few years, Congress endorsed the Balfour Declaration. They have long desired the land, though as yet unrepentant of the terrible crime which led to their expulsion.” This “terrible crime” refers to Jews’ rejection of Jesus – one of multiple anti-Jewish tropes in the sermon. Two decades later, prominent American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr declared himself a supporter of political Zionism. Unlike evangelicals, Niebuhr’s support for a Jewish state was based on pragmatic grounds: Considering the dangerous situation in 1930s Europe, he argued, Jews needed a state in order to be safe. His biographer Richard W. Fox called these articles “an eloquent statement of the Zionist case: The Jews had rights not just as individuals, but as a people, and they deserved not just a homeland, but a homeland in Palestine.” Thus, in the 1930s and ‘40s, two different types of American Christian Zionism emerged. “Politically, we would like to see the lands of the Middle East practice democracy as we do here,” they wrote. Among them was journalist Dorothy Thompson, who had turned against the Zionist cause after a Jewish militant group bombed Jerusalem’s King David Hotel in 1946. These opponents made the case for supporting emerging Arab nationalism and Palestinian autonomy and asserted that recognizing Israel would deepen America’s entanglement in the unfolding Middle Eastern conflicts. But by the late 1950s and ‘60s, American criticism of Israel was increasingly muted. Liberal Christians, in particular, viewed it as a beleaguered democratic state and ally. Conservative Christian Zionists, meanwhile, continued to often view “love of Israel” through a biblical lens. In the late '60s, the American journal Christianity Today published an article by editor Nelson Bell, father-in-law of famous evangelist Billy Graham. Fifteen years later, televangelist Jerry Falwell told an interviewer that Jewish people have both a theological and historical “right to the land.” He added, “I am personally a Zionist, having gained that perspective from my belief in Old Testament scriptures.” They considered any territorial compromise with Arab states and the Palestinians to be an act against God. Some liberal Jews who supported Israel grew alarmed by these ties and by the rightward shift in Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. Yet this brand of Christian Zionism is clearly the forerunner to today’s – and holds sway in Washington. And in Huckabee, they see a potential ambassador who shares their views. In 2009, when Huckabee was considering a presidential campaign, he visited Israel and met with settler leaders. On hearing of Huckabee’s presidential aspirations, a rabbi said, “We hope that under Mike Huckabee’s presidency, he will be like Cyrus and push us to rebuild the Temple and bring the final redemption.” The rabbi was referring to the biblical story of Cyrus, King of Persia, and his proclamation that the exiled Jews be allowed to return to Zion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 Los Angeles wildfires reduced more than 15,000 structures to ash in a matter of days. We are a disaster epidemiologist and a disaster planner at the University of Southern California with almost 40 years of experience between us. But when the destruction impacts your own community, it hits differently. We both had friends and colleagues who suffered property damage in the fires, including Rita’s best friend who lost her home in the Altadena fire. Our work, which focuses on disaster recovery and resilience in children, suddenly felt deeply personal. We are currently studying the effect of wildfires on families and what factors help children recover faster and lead to more resilient lives. School districts across the region closed their doors due to dangerous air quality and structural damage. Even when schools reopened, many parents and caregivers were worried about sending their children back into classrooms that might not be safe. This disruption in education extends beyond a few lost school days. Research shows that prolonged school closures can significantly affect children’s learning, mental health and sense of security. After major disasters, students often experience academic setbacks, increased anxiety, and emotional distress. After the 2020 Slater Fire in Happy Camp, California, a rural town about 25 miles south of the Oregon border, we conducted focus groups with children who had lost homes and schools. Our study found that despite experiencing profound loss, many of the children expressed gratitude for their communities and an eagerness to rebuild. One of the biggest lessons from the Slater Fire and other disasters is that children recover best when they are given a sense of stability and normalcy as quickly as possible. Schools, child care facilities and structured activities all play a crucial role in this process. For families navigating the emotional toll of this disaster, open conversations are key. Avoiding the topic in an attempt to protect children can make them more anxious. Instead, caregivers should create space for children to express their emotions and ask questions. Children’s responses to trauma vary based on their age and experiences, but common reactions may include anxiety about future wildfires, trouble sleeping, and withdrawing from activities they once enjoyed. Children may react differently, and it is important to be on the lookout for signs of stress. They may also begin to act out or engage in risk-taking behaviors. Strategies that can help children process the experience include maintaining routines, keeping an open line of communication, encouraging creative outlets and modeling desired behaviors. Tweens and teens may also find comfort in the shared experience with their friends. Rita’s best friend shared that her 11-year-old daughter and 10 of her friends named their chat group “70% homeless,” a telling reflection of how they are processing the disaster together. Organizations such as Project:Camp, a nonprofit that provides pop-up camps for children affected by disasters, have stepped in to offer immediate child care relief in Eagle Rock, California, about 8 miles from Altadena. These programs not only support children’s mental health by offering structured, trauma-informed care in a fun environment, but they also give caregivers the time and space necessary to begin rebuilding their lives. The services provided by these sorts of programs can serve as models that can be incorporated into the planning process for cities and counties. For families still struggling after the LA fires, we recommend talking to school counselors, seeking community support and contacting local disaster relief programs. Rebuilding after a disaster is about more than just reconstructing homes and infrastructure. It’s about restoring a sense of security for families, especially children. Rather, it comes from strong support systems, thoughtful policies and communities that put their youngest members first in times of crisis. Prioritizing schools and child care centers in recovery plans helps to ensure that children can return to safe, supportive environments as soon as possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fermenting foods in space could provide a new culinary frontier. When fermented aboard the International Space Station, the Japanese condiment miso tasted nuttier than two earthbound versions, researchers report April 2 in iScience. Astronauts usually munch on freeze-dried foods void of most microbes, says industrial designer and researcher Maggie Coblentz of MIT’s Space Exploration Initiative. “Fermentation is a really exciting way to open that up, so to invite a diverse community of microbes that will interact with one another and also preserve food while growing and enhancing flavor.” Sign up for our newsletter We summarize the week's science breakthroughs every Thursday. Miso was chosen for the experiment because of its firm structure, strong flavor and cultural significance, among other reasons. It represents the first known food deliberately fermented in space, says interdisciplinary food researcher Josh Evans of the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen. Evans and colleagues combined cooked soybeans, salt and fermented rice called kōji to make about 1 kilogram of a miso-to-be mixture, keeping one-third of it. The rest went to Coblentz in Cambridge, Mass., who split her portion and sent one-third of the total mixture to launch into space from Florida in March 2020. Fourteen tasters tried miso fermented in Copenhagen (left), the International Space Station (center) and Cambridge, Mass. Fourteen tasters including chefs and researchers thought the space miso had nuttier and more roasted notes compared with the earthbound ones. (On average, the environment surrounding the space miso was roughly 36° Celsius — possibly due to heat-generating equipment nearby — compared with 23° C in Cambridge and 20° C in Copenhagen.) All three misos bore similar microbes, although one bacterial species was found only in the ISS miso. The researchers could not isolate the ISS miso’s fermentation variables, including radiation, temperature and microgravity, to attribute specific properties to them, Coblentz says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tropical cyclones in the Caribbean are getting more frequent — and could increase significantly in the coming decades, evidence found buried deep within the Great Blue Hole suggests. Researchers took a sediment core from the Great Blue Hole sinkhole, situated about 50 miles (80 kilometers) off the coast of Belize, which revealed that tropical cyclones have increased in frequency over the past 5,700 years. "A key finding of our study is that the regional storm frequency has increased continuously since 5,700 years B.P. (before present)," study lead author Dominik Schmitt , a researcher at Goethe University Frankfurt's Biosedimentology Research Group, told Live Science. Tropical cyclones are intense, rotating, low-pressure systems that form over warm ocean waters. Tropical cyclones can be extremely destructive, producing strong winds, heavy rainfall and storm surges. To learn more about these storms over a long period of time, the researchers extracted the sediment core from the bottom of the 410-foot-deep (125 meters) Great Blue Hole — a massive underwater sinkhole that formed as sea levels rose during the last ice age , around 10,000 years ago. This sediment core, measuring 98 feet (30 m) long, is the longest continuous record of tropical storms in the area. Two layers of fair-weather sediment are usually laid down every year, enabling the researchers to count back the years like the rings of a tree and compare when storm-event sediment layers were deposited. The researchers found that tropical cyclones have been getting more frequent over the past 5,700 years, with a particular increase in frequency since we started burning fossil fuels during the Industrial Revolution.

(Image credit: Schmitt et al. 2025; Supplementary Materials) The ITCZ usually moves northward in the summer and southward in the winter as a result of changing sea surface temperatures, but it has also been steadily moving southward over the past few thousand years. This southward migration of the ITCZ "has probably led to a southward displacement of the major Atlantic storm genesis region, and a shift of the main storm trajectories from formerly higher to now lower latitudes," Schmitt explained. Increases in global sea surface temperatures as a result of human-caused climate change are likely responsible for the recent spike in tropical storms, and will likely result in even more frequent tropical cyclones in the coming decades, according to the study. "The nine modern storm layers from the last 20 years indicate that extreme weather events in this region will become much more frequent in the 21st century," Schmitt said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Further labs, as well as CT scans and a review of the patient's medical history, suggested the buildup was caused by a lung infection, kidney injury and, potentially, heavy drinking , as the patient had a history of alcohol dependence. The patient later tested positive for COVID-19 and a bacterial infection. Toward the end of his ICU stay, he had started having diarrhea. His doctors put him on a probiotic that they thought would ease the symptoms, and he continued taking that probiotic in the general ward. But then, after nearly two months of treatment, the man suddenly developed swelling and "severe, continuous" pain in his abdomen. Tests again revealed a high level of acid in his blood, and scans showed signs of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia , a dangerous condition in which the intestines don't get enough blood. "His treatment was transitioned to palliative care and he died on the 60th hospital day," his doctors wrote in a report of the case .

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors When they do occur, the infections are seen most often in older adults with multiple medical conditions. In the man's case, he had a history of alcohol dependence, smoking, colon cancer, high blood pressure and chest pain due to heart disease, along with the conditions that caused his initial trip to the ER. While being treated, he'd also been given a steroid to tamp down the inflammation driven by his COVID-19 infection, and steroidal drugs suppress the immune system. The probiotic is widely used, especially in Japan, and generally has a good safety profile . It's given in hospital settings as a diarrhea treatment, in part because it's thought to make the gut less favorable to pathogens and more favorable to bacteria that aid digestion and help mitigate inflammation. Antibiotics , which the man was given for his bacterial infection, can also deplete the gut of bacteria, and probiotics can help restore some of those lost microbes. But in medically unstable and immunocompromised patients, these probiotics can occasionally go rogue , the doctors warned in the case report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Such electric spikes are a surprise because only nerve cells were thought to communicate this way. These signals move at a snail’s pace compared to nerve impulses and can be detected at least 500 micrometers away — about the distance of 40 cells — researchers report in the March 25 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The pulsing electrical waves may help injured cells’ neighbors prepare to heal wounds. Sign up for our newsletter We summarize the week's science breakthroughs every Thursday. But they didn’t know that skin cells can send spikes of electricity the way nerve cells do, says Zhao, who was not involved with the new work. To capture this phenomenon, bioengineer Sun-Min Yu and engineering scientist Steve Granick — both of the University of Massachusetts Amherst — grew human skin cells or dog kidney cells on electrode-lined chips. After blasting some cells with lasers, Yu measured tiny shifts in electrical activity. But the spikes move at a crawl compared to nerve cell signals, Granick says. Whereas nerve cell impulses last just milliseconds, epithelial cells take one to two seconds to spit out their electrical messages. The software Yu was using was set to detect speedier nerve cell pulses and wouldn’t flag spikes slower than 500 milliseconds. “I asked the software engineer to release that constraint, and then it worked,” Yu says. And it may give researchers new respect for the role of electrical activity. Electric fields are often dismissed as less important than biochemical or mechanical signals. “We also need to understand [wound healing] as a complicated, complex process involving many different aspects,” including short bursts of electrical activity. The study looked at electrical propagation only in roughly two-dimensional sheets just one cell thick. Yu hopes to next explore how epithelial cells use these pulses to communicate in 3-D structures and with other cell types.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leading man of 1990s Hollywood, Val Kilmer, has died at 65 from pneumonia. Battling cancer since 2014, he has not been a frequent presence on our film screens for most of this century. While he has recently done some interesting projects, he never recaptured his fame and box-office draw of the 1980s and ‘90s, when he appeared in iconic films such as Top Gun (1986) and Batman Forever (1995). His standout performance as Tom Cruise’s swaggering, self-assured rival Iceman in Top Gun made him a star. But the film that really cemented his reputation as a leading man was Oliver Stone’s The Doors (1991), in which he played Jim Morrison to astonishing effect. He is the best thing about that film. In 1993, he starred as Doc Holliday in Tombstone, a stylish modern western, which he co-headlined with Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp. Kilmer’s performance was crowd-pleasing and critically acclaimed. His 2020 memoir, I’m Your Huckleberry, took its name from a line Kilmer spoke in the film. In some ways, it is a superhero film with cowboys – as you can see so clearly in the poster. It was this performance that put Kilmer on the radar of Warner Bros when they were looking to cast a new Batman after Michael Keaton abandoned the suit. We’ve got used to superhero films having cinematic universes and narrative continuity between films, but in the 1990s that had not quite been established. Warner Bros had struck cinematic gold with the first modern superhero blockbuster, Superman (1978) starring Christopher Reeve, but faced diminishing critical and financial returns with each subsequent film in the series. In those days, one superhero film every couple of years was seen as sufficient. Joel Schumacher was brought on as director and, perhaps due to the departure of Burton, Keaton also chose to leave the series. Fresh off Tombstone, Kilmer was cast as the superhero. Batman Forever took a goofier tone, inspired just as much by the campy 1960s TV series as the dark gothic noir style of Burton. Worse for Kilmer, rumours of being difficult to work with on the set of Batman may have set his career back in subsequent years. But, despite these difficulties, Kilmer makes a good Batman. He was underrated, and certainly better than George Clooney, who took over in Batman and Robin (1997) after Kilmer declined to return. In recent years, Burton’s movies have become more or less canonised as the “real” Batman of the era. Keaton has since reprised his role as the caped crusader on the silver screen as a major supporting character in The Flash (2023), which also featured cameos from Batman alumni Clooney and Ben Affleck as alternate universe versions of the Dark Knight. But Batman Forever stands the test of time. Batman Forever was the pinnacle for Kilmer in terms of critical and commercial success. He followed it with great performances in films such as The Ghost and the Darkness (1996), Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) and Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009), but he was often the supporting character rather than the lead. He plays action figures who are tough and macho on the outside, but have a melancholy just below the surface. Although he never reprised his role as Bruce Wayne, a fitting coda for Kilmer’s career was the long-awaited sequel Top Gun: Maverick (2022), in which he gives a cameo as an ailing version of Iceman. In 2021, a documentary about Kilmer, Val, was released, based on decades of archive footage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Democrats have been under intense pressure to find an effective way to challenge US President Donald Trump without control of either chamber of Congress or a de facto opposition leader. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker took the Senate floor on Monday evening in Washington to give a speech lambasting Trump’s actions. He didn’t stop talking – aside for the occasional question from a fellow Democrat – until Tuesday night, 25 hours later. In 1957, Congress was going to pass a civil rights bill that would make it harder for officials in southern states, in particular, to prevent Black people from voting. So Thurmond, the South Carolina senator and fierce proponent of segregation, launched what was (until today) the longest speech in Senate history to oppose it. Thurmond, however, was unable to stop enactment of the bill. In 2016, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who represents the state of Connecticut where the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School took place, launched a nearly 15-hour filibuster to force the Republican Senate leadership to allow votes on two gun control measures. It wasn’t all focused on health policy; he filled the time by reading the children’s book, Green Eggs and Ham by Dr Seuss. Booker’s speech was not technically a filibuster – he wasn’t holding the floor to talk against a specific bill, as Thurmond was. He was giving time to his Democratic colleagues to just control the shape of the general debate about Trump. Senators use speeches like this when they’re losing on a issue, and Booker feels the Democrats are currently losing to Trump. They have been unable to stop any of his executive actions, so they feel they need to cut through in some way to reach the American people. Trump has been “flooding the zone” from the moment he took office in January with hundreds of policies and executive actions – and he has been extremely successful at it. These actions cut across so many areas, it’s been very hard for the Democrats, on any given day, to pick out the top things to fight against. Because they don’t have control of the House or Senate, and there is no opposition leader, there is no single, principal Democrat who can stand up day by day and say, “This is what happened, this was what the threat to the country is, this why we’re opposing it and this is the way we’re going to attack it”. And the Democratic leadership has been unable to counter it, even though, at the grassroots level, Democrats and many others who voted for Trump are really angry. There comes a certain point in a human drama that transcends partisanship when you’re looking at someone speaking from the heart, speaking their convictions and you can come to respect them. Booker ran for the presidency in 2020 and ultimately yielded to Joe Biden, and I expect we’ll hear much more from him in 2028 when the next presidential election occurs. He is most likely going to run again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I thought it was too narrowly constrained to life as we know it here on Earth, but life elsewhere may take a completely different evolutionary trajectory. So how do we abstract far enough away from life on Earth that we’d be able to notice life elsewhere even if it had different chemical specifics, but not so far that we’d be including all kinds of self-organizing structures like hurricanes?” The pair soon realized that they needed expertise from a whole other set of disciplines. “We needed people who came at this problem from very different points of view, so that we all had checks and balances on each other’s prejudices,” Hazen said. They suspected that functional information was the key to understanding how complex systems like living organisms arise through evolutionary processes happening over time. “But it seems like there’s a much more idiosyncratic pathway that the universe takes. We think it’s because of selection for function — a very orderly process that leads to ordered states. At first glance, it doesn’t seem a promising idea. All it really implies, Hazen said, is that some selective process favors one entity over lots of other potential combinations. A huge number of different minerals can form from silicon, oxygen, aluminum, calcium and so on. But only a few are found in any given environment. Information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge and energy. This might seem trivial, like saying that some objects exist while other ones don’t, even if they could in theory. But Hazen and Wong have shown that, even for minerals, functional information has increased over the course of Earth’s history. Minerals evolve toward greater complexity (though not in the Darwinian sense). These gathered into the nuclei of hydrogen, helium and lithium atoms. And only when some stars had exhausted their fusion fuel did their collapse and explosion in supernovas create heavier elements such as heavy metals. “There is a more universal description that drives the evolution of complex systems.” Second, he said, there might be “an arrow in time that describes this increasing complexity,” similar to the way the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the increase in entropy, is thought to create a preferred direction of time. Finally, Wong said, “information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge and energy.” Biologists have long recognized transitions where the complexity of organisms increases abruptly. The arrival of humans was arguably another major and rapid evolutionary transition. Evolutionary biologists have tended to view each of these transitions as a contingent event. But within the functional-information framework, it seems possible that such jumps in evolutionary processes (whether biological or not) are inevitable. In these jumps, Wong pictures the evolving objects as accessing an entirely new landscape of possibilities and ways to become organized, as if penetrating to the “next floor up.” Crucially, what matters — the criteria for selection, on which continued evolution depends — also changes, plotting a wholly novel course. On the next floor up, possibilities await that could not have been guessed before you reached it. For example, during the origin of life it might initially have mattered that proto-biological molecules would persist for a long time — that they’d be stable. But once such molecules became organized into groups that could catalyze one another’s formation — what Kauffman has called autocatalytic cycles — the molecules themselves could be short-lived, so long as the cycles persisted. Ricard Solé of the Santa Fe Institute thinks such jumps might be equivalent to phase transitions in physics, such as the freezing of water or the magnetization of iron: They are collective processes with universal features, and they mean that everything changes, everywhere, all at once. Yet finding new uses for existing components is precisely what evolution does. This repurposing reflects how biological evolution is jerry-rigged, making use of what’s available. From the soup of single-celled organisms that constituted life on Earth 3 billion years ago, no elephant could have suddenly emerged — this required a whole host of preceding, contingent but specific innovations. However, there is no theoretical limit to the number of uses an object has. “Not only do we not know what will happen, we don’t even know what can happen.” Photosynthesis was such a profound development; so were eukaryotes, nervous systems and language. But this upper level of rules itself needs to evolve. The physicist Paul Davies of Arizona State University agrees that biological evolution “generates its own extended possibility space which cannot be reliably predicted or captured via any deterministic process from prior states. Davies and his co-workers have recently suggested that evolution in an expanding accessible phase space might be formally equivalent to the “incompleteness theorems” devised by the mathematician Kurt Gödel. Gödel showed that any system of axioms in mathematics permits the formulation of statements that can’t be shown to be true or false. We can only decide such statements by adding new axioms. Davies and colleagues say that, as with Gödel’s theorem, the key factor that makes biological evolution open-ended and prevents us from being able to express it in a self-contained and all-encompassing phase space is that it is self-referential: The appearance of new actors in the space feeds back on those already there to create new possibilities for action. This isn’t the case for physical systems, which, even if they have, say, millions of stars in a galaxy, are not self-referential. This connection between biological evolution and the issue of noncomputability, Davies said, “goes right to the heart of what makes life so magical.” Is biology special, then, among evolutionary processes in having an open-endedness generated by self-reference? A watch gets made faster if the watchmaker is not blind. If Hazen and colleagues are right that evolution involving any kind of selection inevitably increases functional information — in effect, complexity — does this mean that life itself, and perhaps consciousness and higher intelligence, is inevitable in the universe? That would run counter to what some biologists have thought. The eminent evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr believed that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence was doomed because the appearance of humanlike intelligence is “utterly improbable.” After all, he said, if intelligence at a level that leads to cultures and civilizations were so adaptively useful in Darwinian evolution, how come it only arose once across the entire tree of life? Humans attained planetary dominance so rapidly (for better or worse) that the question of when it will happen again becomes moot. If the new “law of increasing functional information” is right, it looks as though life, once it exists, is bound to get more complex by leaps and bounds. It doesn’t have to rely on some highly improbable chance event. What’s more, such an increase in complexity seems to imply the appearance of new causal laws in nature that, while not incompatible with the fundamental laws of physics governing the smallest component parts, effectively take over from them in determining what happens next. Arguably we see this already in biology: Galileo’s (apocryphal) experiment of dropping two masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa no longer has predictive power when the masses are not cannonballs but living birds. In place of functional information, assembly theory relies on a number called the assembly index, which measures the minimum number of steps required to make an object from its constituent ingredients. “Laws for living systems must be somewhat different than what we have in physics now,” Walker said, “but that does not mean that there are no laws.” But she doubts that the putative law of functional information can be rigorously tested in the lab. “I am not sure how one could say [the theory] is right or wrong, since there is no way to test it objectively,” she said. Hazen acknowledges that, for most physical objects, it is impossible to calculate functional information even in principle. Even for a single living cell, he admits, there’s no way of quantifying it. But he argues that this is not a sticking point, because we can still understand it conceptually and get an approximate quantitative sense of it. Wong sees a potential application of their ideas in astrobiology. That’s because natural selection has picked out some favored compounds. There’s much more glucose in living cells, for example, than you’d expect if molecules were simply being made either randomly or according to their thermodynamic stability. So one potential signature of lifelike entities on other worlds might be similar signs of selection outside what chemical thermodynamics or kinetics alone would generate. Hazen’s team has been fielding queries from researchers ranging from economists to neuroscientists, who are keen to see if the approach can help. But whether or not functional information turns out to be the right tool for thinking about these questions, many researchers seem to be converging on similar questions about complexity, information, evolution (both biological and cosmic), function and purpose, and the directionality of time. It’s hard not to suspect that something big is afoot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1807, President Thomas Jefferson founded the nation’s first scientific agency. The focus of these three agencies was eventually brought together in 1970 as part of the new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. Under the new administration of Donald Trump, this agency with 218-year-old roots is undergoing another significant change — one that experts fear could significantly hamper NOAA’s work. To carry out its work, NOAA has at its disposal an array of tools, including satellites, airplanes, weather balloons, maritime buoys, and radar systems. In March, a U.S. district judge ordered thousands of fired federal workers to be temporarily reinstated, but many have been put on administrative leave. The administration has also discussed possibly terminating leases for properties housing NOAA operations. Moreover, all federal agencies are currently subject to a purge of certain words and phrases. The New York Times has found that “climate science” is among them. “One could make a strong case that NOAA was under-resourced and under-staffed before these cuts, so this is simply making the situation worse,” wrote Keith Seitter, former executive director of the American Meteorological Society, in an email to Undark. Trump and his supporters have long criticized NOAA’s climate research efforts as being politically motivated. Massachusetts-based meteorologist Brian Gonsalves wrote in an email to Undark: “We are already seeing immediate impacts from these cuts, which will only worsen if further cuts are made.” The reduced staffing could make it more difficult to gather and process the data coming in from across the country — on temperature, wind speed, and dew points, among other things. “It would not be a surprise to see insufficient staffing available to do some of the really important planning and preparation with state and local emergency managers,” he said. This could compromise forecasts of and preparations for tornadoes, for example, that have ripped through parts of the country in March with more likely throughout spring. Hurricane season, which extends from June to November, could be an issue, too. For instance, companies like AccuWeather depend on data collected by NOAA, among other sources. NOAA gathers weather data (daily balloon launches) and feeds it into the modeling so your phone can tell you it’s going to rain tomorrow. It would be extraordinarily difficult for private companies like AccuWeather to do its work in the absence of NOAA-provided data, according to the meteorologists who communicated with Undark. Gonsalves, for example, said “it’s impossible to adequately fill the void from a forecasting standpoint, as well as data collection for climate study.” Seitter echoed this opinion, noting that the business models of private companies “are built on the foundation of a strong NOAA providing data from which they can create specialized products and services.” During the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to rescind unspent funds earmarked for climate mitigation in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. Through the IRA, Congress allocated billions of dollars in resources to counter or prevent the effects of climate change, particularly in areas most likely to be affected, such as coastal cities. The IRA also funded efforts to improve NOAA weather forecasting capabilities. The U.S. might well relinquish its role as a global leader in climate research and forecasting. And with NOAA’s monthly climate change briefings indefinitely suspended in April owing to personnel reductions, staff may become less aware of what, precisely, is happening to the climate. And as CBS News reported in February, a former top NOAA scientist in the first Trump administration, Craig McLean, is worried about the politicization of science could undermine objectivity going forward. McLean gave as an example so-called Sharpie-gate, which occurred in 2019, when President Trump claimed that Hurricane Dorian would hit Alabama and displayed an altered graphic in front of news cameras to show the direction the storm would take. Trump has denied human-caused climate change, calling it “one of the great scams of all time.” And now the president oversees agencies such as NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency, which traditionally have conducted climate research work predicated on the long-standing scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases caused by human activity are primary drivers of global warming. Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, went so far as to call climate change a “religion” at a briefing in March, outlining steps his agency would undertake to deregulate.</p>
