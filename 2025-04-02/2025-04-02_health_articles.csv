Journal in which the study was published: Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research

Author: Claudia Tonelli, PhD, a research investigator in the laboratory of AACR Past President David A. Tuveson, MD, PhD, FAACR, at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

Background: PDAC is the most common type of pancreatic cancer, a highly lethal malignancy that is often preceded by precancerous lesions. These lesions are relatively common, but only a small portion will progress to PDAC, Tonelli explained.

While mutations in the KRAS protein are known to drive pancreatic cancer, these do not appear to be sufficient to promote the transition from precancerous lesions to cancer, Tonelli noted. ""Understanding the additional pathways that promote progression from a precancerous pancreatic lesion to a malignant tumor could help identify more viable treatment strategies as well as cancer interception approaches to stop PDAC from developing in the first place,"" she added.

How the study was conducted: By analyzing murine and human pancreatic tissue specimens, Tonelli and colleagues found that, compared with normal tissue, FGFR2 expression was higher in KRAS-mutated precancerous lesions and some KRAS-mutated PDAC. Notably, FGFR2 expression in murine precancerous lesions correlated with an increase in mutant KRAS signaling.

""We know that precancerous pancreatic lesions often carry KRAS mutations,"" said Tonelli. ""Our observation that FGFR2 expression was associated with increased KRAS signaling suggests that FGFR2 may play a key role in driving the progression of KRAS-mutated precancerous lesions to malignancy.""

Results: Consistent with this hypothesis, the researchers found significantly fewer precancerous lesions and delayed PDAC tumors formation in KRAS-mutated mice in which the FGFR2 gene had been deleted compared with those with an intact FGFR2 gene. In addition, the combined inhibition of FGFR2 and another signaling protein, EGFR, significantly reduced the formation of precancerous lesions in mice carrying mutated KRAS.

Author's comments: According to Tonelli, the findings suggest that targeting FGFR2 could potentially benefit patients at high risk of their precancerous lesions progressing to PDAC. While FGFR inhibitors are clinically available, Tonelli cautioned that their effectiveness in intercepting PDAC would first need to be tested in clinical trials before they could be used for this purpose.

""Our study provides critical insights into pancreatic cancer development and could guide the development of strategies for the interception and prevention of pancreatic malignancies,"" she summarized.

Study limitations: A limitation of the study is that it did not directly examine whether FGFR2 inactivation in precancerous lesions would also block or delay subsequent PDAC. This could be addressed in future studies by performing long-term FGFR2 inhibition, or alternatively by genetic experiments, Tonelli noted.",news-medical

What

Blood pressure patterns observed in the first half of pregnancy, even among women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), can identify women at greater risk of developing hypertension up to 14 years after giving birth. The new findings are from a large observational study supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death. This study identified a new, previously undefined risk group of postpartum women who are not currently recognized as being at high risk for future hypertension and cardiovascular disease because they did not develop HDP during pregnancy. HDP includes serious complications such as preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy and are known to increase the risk of heart disease later in life. When the history of HDP was combined with women's early pregnancy blood pressure patterns, these data together provide a new and improved tool for risk assessment.

The study followed 174,774 women who received prenatal care at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2009 and 2019. None of these women had hypertension, kidney, liver, or heart disease, or a history of preeclampsia before pregnancy. Researchers tracked their health records up to 14 years after delivery to identify new cases of hypertension.

The research found that women who showed certain blood pressure patterns during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy were more likely to develop hypertension later in life. Six distinct risk groups of blood pressure trajectory were identified, ranging from ultra-low to elevated-stable patterns. Women with elevated-stable blood pressure patterns were at the highest risk.

This study shows that blood pressure trajectories during early pregnancy can stratify this risk, even for women without HDP. By identifying women at higher risk, healthcare providers can offer targeted surveillance and early interventions, potentially preventing future heart problems.

Detailed results:

The study showed that these blood pressure patterns could differentiate risk levels among women with and without HDP.

Among groups of women who did not develop HDP, those with higher risk blood pressure patterns — including elevated-stable patterns — during early pregnancy were still 11 times more likely to develop hypertension years later than those women with less risky blood pressure patterns.

Researchers suggest that this previously unrecognized risk group may warrant closer monitoring after pregnancy. Additionally, they suggest that early pregnancy blood pressure trajectories may improve predictions of cardiovascular disease risk in women. The findings appeared in the journal Hypertension.

The study was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the NIH, through R01 HL145808 and R01 HL145808-02S1.",news-medical

The Study Entitled ""Advancing Age is not Associated With Greater Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage"" is published in the Journal of Ageing and Physical Activity (Japa).

Younger adults were categorized as between 18 to 25 and older adults More than 35 years old.

The Research Co-Autthored by Lancaster University Provides a understanding Analysis of How Ageing Affects Muscle Function, Soreness, and Biochemical Markers of Muscle Damage after Exercise. By Pooling Data from 36 Studies, Researchers Found That Older Adults Do Not Experience Greater Muscle Function Loss after Exercise Compared with Younger Individuals.

One striking Discovery was that muscle soreness was consistently lower in older adults, with discounts of around 34% at 48 hours and 62% at 72 hours compared with younger individuals. Creatine Kinase Levels, An Indicator of Muscle Damage, Were Approximately 28% Lower in Older Adults at 24 Hours Post-Exercise.

The Findings Suggest That, Despite Physiological Changes With Age, Muscle Resilience Remains Relatively Stable, Allowing Older Individuals to Continue Engaging in Regular Physical Activity Without Increased concern for prolonged weakness or loss of fun.

Interestingly, Sex Appeared To Play A Role in Muscle Function Recovery, with Males Showing Slightly Greater Decreases in Muscle Function after Exercise Than Females. There was no observed impact of upper- or low-body or exercise type (resistance training or endurance training) on ​​muscle damers

These findings are meaningful to be their challenge the widespread belief that ageing muscles recover more sweetly or are more prone to exert-induced damage. This misconception often discourage older adults from engaging in regular physical activity due to fears of prolonged soreness or weakness. ""Dr. Lawrence Hayes, Senior Author from Lancaster Medical School

If Older Individuals Experience Less Muscle Damage Symptoms Than Previously Thought, Recovery Strategies, Training Programms, and Post-Excise Care Could be Adjuded Accordly. For Example, Older Adults May Not Require significantly prolonged Recovery Periods Compared With Younger Individuals, Putentiallly Allowing for More Frequent or Intense Training Sessions, Leading to Better Long-Term Health Outcomes.

Overall, this study reinforces the importance of staying active throughout life and dispels myths that ageing Equates to Frailty or Impaired Recovery. These Findings Could Contribute to Greater Participation in Fitness Activities Among Older Adults, Improving Overall Health, Mobility, and Quality of Life in Ageing Populations.

Dr. Hayes Said: ""This Means Exercise has no age limit so move to live along and healthier. Aim for 150 minutes of Activity Each Week, Add Strength Training Twice Per Week, and Most Importerly, Find A Workout You Love. When you are, you are more like.""

Among the numerous genetic factors implicated in IRD, mutations in the CRB1 gene stand out as significant contributors to severe forms of retinal degeneration, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Recent research has unveiled a novel mechanism linking CRB1 mutations to retinal degeneration through bacterial translocation from the gut to the eye, opening up promising therapeutic avenues.

The CRB1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein crucial for maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers in both the retina and the colon. In the retina, CRB1 plays a vital role in the structure and function of photoreceptor cells and the blood-retinal barrier (BRB). Recent studies have shown that CRB1 is also expressed in colonic enterocytes, where it maintains the integrity of adherens junctions (AJ) and the colonic epithelial barrier. Mutations in CRB1 disrupt these barriers, creating a ""leaky gut"" and ""leaky retina"" phenomenon that allows gut bacteria to translocate to the retina.

This bacterial translocation triggers inflammatory responses and retinal damage in CRB1-mutated eyes. Research using the naturally occurring retinal degeneration 8 (Rd8) mouse model, which carries a nonsense mutation in CRB1, has demonstrated that retinal lesions contain bacterial species originating from the gut. These findings establish a clear connection between CRB1 mutations, barrier dysfunction, and retinal inflammation.

The therapeutic potential of targeting this bacterial translocation has been explored through both antibiotic treatment and gene therapy approaches. Systemic antibiotic treatment of newborn Rd8 mice effectively prevented retinal damage by reducing bacterial translocation. Similarly, gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to restore CRB1 expression in enterocytes improved intestinal barrier function and reduced retinal inflammation.

These findings suggest that combining antibacterial therapy with gene correction could offer a promising treatment strategy for CRB1-associated retinal degeneration. The research highlights the importance of considering both local retinal treatment and systemic approaches addressing gut barrier function.

The discovery of this gut-eye axis in CRB1-related retinal degeneration has broader implications for understanding other ocular diseases where gut microbiota may play a role. Future research should explore whether similar mechanisms operate in human patients with CRB1 mutations and investigate the potential for probiotics, prebiotics, or other microbiome-modulating therapies to complement traditional gene therapy approaches.

In conclusion, this research represents a significant advancement in our understanding of CRB1-associated retinal degeneration and offers new therapeutic directions that could potentially slow or prevent vision loss in these currently untreatable conditions.",news-medical

Proteins are essential for a wide range of cellular functions-as enzymes, transporters, hormones, antibodies, receptors, and more. They must be folded into the correct three-dimensional shape to function properly. If the ER is unable to manufacture or fold proteins correctly, the cell develops ER stress, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR)-a protective mechanism aimed at restoring cellular function.

While UPR begins as an adaptive response, it can become maladaptive-ultimately causing cell death-if ER stress persists for too long.

Recently, a team of Chinese researchers led by Prof. WANG Likun from the Institute of Biophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has provided new insights into metabolic disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies by identifying a novel intercellular signaling mechanism between adipocytes (fat cells) and hepatocytes (liver cells). The study reveals how ER-stressed adipocytes remotely regulate UPR activation in hepatocytes through the secretion of ceramide (Cer), a fat molecule that plays a major role in cell structure, signaling, and stress response.

These findings were published in the Journal of Cell Biology on March 26.

In the study, the researchers first confirmed that ER-stressed adipocytes secrete bioactive signaling molecules capable of activating the UPR pathway in hepatocytes across tissues. Using lipidomics analysis and functional validation, they identified Cer as the key effector molecule responsible for this process.

Further investigation revealed that the UPR pathway in adipocytes does not directly regulate Cer secretion. Instead, ER stress promotes the extracellular hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM)-a type of lipid-into Cer through the secretion of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), highlighting an indirect regulatory pathway.

By investigating how lipid-soluble Cer is transported between cells, the researchers demonstrated that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) serves as the primary carrier for Cer transport. Upon reaching hepatocytes, Cer alters membrane fluidity, influencing membrane protein function, and contributing to UPR activation.

Notably, the researchers also found that exogenous supplementation of SM effectively reversed the Cer-induced changes in membrane fluidity and UPR activation-underscoring the critical role of lipid metabolic balance in cellular homeostasis. The ability to suppress UPR activation suggests that maladaptive responses to ER stress may be reversible.

Expanding on these findings, the researchers discovered that this Cer-based intercellular UPR signaling mechanism has broader applicability, offering a new theoretical framework for understanding multi-tissue coordinated stress responses.

By systematically mapping the molecular pathway of UPR signal transmission between adipose and liver tissues, this study reveals a previously unrecognized form of organ crosstalk in metabolic diseases. These discoveries pave the way for lipid metabolism-targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring cellular balance and mitigating metabolic disorders.",news-medical

The Role of Senescent Cells in Aging

Current Research and Theories

Therapeutic Strategies

Challenges and Controversies

Future Outlook

Aging is a complex biological process characterized by the progressive decline of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to disease. It is the strongest risk factor for numerous chronic conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

Among the various cellular and molecular changes associated with aging, cellular senescence (a state of permanent cell cycle arrest triggered by damage or stress) has emerged as a key player.

Senescent cells secrete pro-inflammatory and tissue-degrading factors, collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can impair neighboring cell function and tissue homeostasis.

While cellular senescence plays an essential role in processes like wound healing and development, its chronic accumulation contributes to age-related dysfunction.

This duality raises a compelling question at the heart of aging research: Is cellular senescence merely one feature of aging, or is it the primary driver of age-related decline and disease? Addressing this question could redefine strategies for promoting healthy aging.1​​​​​​​

What Is Cellular Senescence?

Cellular senescence is a stress response in which cells permanently stop dividing to prevent the spread of damage. It acts as a protective mechanism, halting the proliferation of cells that have undergone deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, telomere shortening, oxidative stress, or oncogene activation.

The key feature of senescence is irreversible growth arrest, enforced by two critical tumor suppressor pathways: the Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A / Retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/Rb) pathway and the Tumor protein p53 / Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p53/p21CIP1) pathway. These systems block the cell cycle, ensuring damaged cells do not divide.2

Beyond growth arrest, senescent cells undergo profound changes: they remodel chromatin, reprogram metabolism, and increase autophagy. They also release a range of inflammatory molecules called the SASP, which can signal the immune system to remove them but may also harm surrounding tissues.2

Senescence is beneficial in development, wound healing, and tumor suppression. However, over time, senescent cells accumulate and are not efficiently cleared, contributing to aging and age-related diseases by promoting chronic low-grade inflammation.

Excitingly, research shows that removing senescent cells genetically or pharmacologically can extend lifespan and reduce age-related decline, highlighting the dual role of senescence in both protecting and impairing tissue health.1,2

Overview of Cell Senescence Play

The Role of Senescent Cells in Aging

Senescent cells are cells that have permanently stopped dividing, usually in response to stressors such as persistent DNA damage. This process, known as cellular senescence, serves as a defense mechanism against cancer. However, as senescent cells accumulate with age, they begin to negatively impact tissues through the SASP- a pro-inflammatory secretion profile.3

SASP includes a mix of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases. While it plays beneficial roles in acute tissue repair, immune surveillance, and developmental processes, its chronic activation leads to tissue dysfunction, low-grade inflammation, and age-related diseases. SASP factors can reinforce senescence in the same cell (autocrine effect) or spread it to nearby cells (paracrine senescence), altering the tissue microenvironment.3

A key internal trigger for SASP is the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS–STING) pathway, which is activated by abnormal cytoplasmic DNA fragments.

These fragments often result from reduced activity of DNA-degrading enzymes like DNase2 and Three Prime Repair Exonuclease 1 (TREX1) in senescent cells, leading to type I interferon signaling and inflammation.3

External triggers such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA)- byproducts of gut microbiota- can also induce SASP in cells like hepatic stellate cells, promoting liver cancer. Controlling SASP, including through senolysis (selective elimination of senescent cells), may offer therapeutic strategies for aging and age-associated disorders.3

How PFAS Are Impacting Human Health

Current Research and Theories

Cellular senescence and SASP are now understood as a key driver of aging and numerous age-related diseases. While senescence initially protects against cancer by halting the proliferation of damaged cells, its chronic accumulation leads to tissue dysfunction and persistent inflammation.2

In cardiovascular tissues, senescent endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells contribute to atherosclerosis by increasing inflammation and impairing vascular integrity. Animal studies reveal that these senescent cells accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques.

Pharmacological clearance using senolytic agents like dasatinib and quercetin, or navitoclax, enhances plaque stability, improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction (heart attack), and reduces tissue damage following ischemia-reperfusion injury.2,4

In osteoarthritis, senescent chondrocytes secrete inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tissue-degrading enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases.

These exacerbate cartilage deterioration. Preclinical studies show that eliminating senescent cells from joint tissue improves mobility and reduces joint inflammation.2,4

Senescence acts as a double-edged sword in cancer. Although it prevents tumor formation through growth arrest, the SASP can promote tumor progression by modifying the tissue environment and enabling immune evasion. Cytokines like IL-6 and IL-8 released by senescent cells facilitate tumorigenesis.2,4

Senescence also impairs stem cell regeneration, promotes metabolic disorders, and triggers chronic low-grade inflammation- termed ""inflammaging.""

This contributes to osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, neurodegeneration, and other degenerative conditions. In vivo genetic mouse models, such as INK-linked Apoptosis Through Targeted Activation of Caspase (INK-ATTAC) and p16-driven Trimodality Reporter (p16-3MR), show that targeted removal of senescent cells delays age-related decline and extend health span.2,4

Together, these findings affirm that senescence is a central mechanism underlying age-related pathologies and a promising therapeutic target across multiple diseases.

5 Easy Ways to Reduce Your Microplastic Intake

Therapeutic Strategies

Therapeutic strategies targeting cellular senescence are advancing, focusing on senolytic drugs and gene therapies. Senolytics are agents designed to selectively eliminate senescent cells, which accumulate with age and contribute to various chronic diseases.

Notable examples include dasatinib and quercetin; dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, while quercetin is a flavonoid, both shown to reduce senescent cell burden in preclinical studies.5

Gene therapies offer another avenue by introducing genetic material into cells to counteract aging processes. For example, BioViva has explored gene therapies to extend lifespan by targeting factors like telomerase and myostatin.6

Biotechnology firms are actively developing senolytic therapies. Unity Biotechnology focuses on creating treatments to clear senescent cells, particularly in age-related diseases such as diabetic macular edema.

Their investigational drug, foselutoclax (previously UBX1325), inhibits B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL), a protein crucial for the survival of senescent cells in the retina, aiming to restore vision in diabetic macular edema patients.7

These advancements underscore the growing interest in targeting cellular senescence to promote healthier aging. These therapeutic strategies represent promising approaches to mitigate age-related diseases by addressing the underlying mechanisms of cellular senescence.

Challenges and Controversies

Cellular senescence plays a paradoxical role in health and disease. On one hand, it is essential for tissue remodeling, embryonic development, and wound healing.

Transient senescence, for instance, facilitates fibrosis resolution and immune clearance, offering protection against tumorigenesis. However, when senescent cells persist, they can contribute to chronic inflammation, tissue dysfunction, and aging-related pathologies.

This duality has fueled debate: should senescence be suppressed or supported? In the kidney, for example, senescence aids in recovery from acute injury but also accelerates chronic kidney disease progression.

The SASP further complicates this picture, as its cytokines can be either reparative or harmful depending on context. Moreover, the lack of highly specific biomarkers hampers accurate detection and targeted therapies.

While senolytic and senomorphic drugs show promise in animal models, translating these findings into safe and effective treatments for humans requires careful consideration of timing, dosage, and individual context.8

Why More Young Adults Are Getting Colorectal Cancer

Future Outlook

To validate causality and therapeutic viability of targeting cellular senescence, large-scale, placebo-controlled clinical trials are essential. These must assess senolytic and senomorphic interventions across diverse populations and disease contexts, with precise biomarkers to confirm senescent cell targeting.

Improved identification and classification of senescent cell subtypes using multi-omics and single-cell technologies will aid in understanding tissue-specific roles and intervention effects.

Investigating the senescent-like states of non-dividing cells, long-term safety of senotherapeutics, and their combination with disease-specific therapies will be crucial.

Further exploration of immune-based strategies and clarification of “beneficial” versus pathological senescence are also needed.9​​​​​​​

But what exactly are superbugs, and how did they come to be?

What are superbugs?

What are microbes?

Microbes are tiny biological organisms that exist all around us. They can be found in the air, on surfaces, in food, and even within our bodies. They are present in enormous numbers throughout the human body. The human body contains an estimated 30 trillion human cells and 38 trillion bacterial cells.2

The beneficial microbes in your body work together to support functions such as digestion, immunity, and reproduction. In contrast, harmful microbes (pathogens) can cause disease and illness in humans, animals, and plants. They reproduce quickly and spread easily, posing a serious threat to health.

What are antimicrobials?

Antimicrobial medications can treat a wide range of diseases. There are several types of antimicrobials: antibiotics are used to treat bacteria, antifungals to treat fungi, antivirals to treat viruses, and antiparasitics to treat parasites.

The battle against infections (mostly bacterial infections) was believed to have been won in the late 1920s when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin (a commonly used antibiotic). This was followed by the discovery of many additional broad-spectrum and specialized antibiotics.

However, with the widespread overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals, microorganisms have grown stronger than previously imagined. Superbugs are microorganisms that were once sensitive to specific antibiotics but have become resistant to them.

What are some common superbugs?

One in every five instances of urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli is resistant to commonly used medications such as ampicillin and fluoroquinolones. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common intestinal bacterium that resists beta-lactam antibiotics, which are widely used.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major concern due to its high mortality rate and resistance to several medications used to treat common staph infections.3 Between 2017 and 2021, approximately 20 % of MRSA bloodstream infections in Canada resulted in death within 30 days of diagnosis.4

Other prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria include vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE).5

AMR is a dangerous and rapidly growing global health crisis. Understanding how it develops can provide researchers and medical staff with the tools needed to address this urgent threat.

What causes antimicrobial resistance?

Several factors contribute to the emergence and spread of AMR, the most significant of which is the misuse and overuse of antibiotics in clinical settings. Antibiotics work by killing bacteria and/or disrupting their reproductive cycles.

Incorrect use of antibiotics occurs when a patient misses one or more doses of their prescribed medication or discontinues therapy earlier than recommended. This allows the bacteria to begin reproducing, with the potential to develop resistance to the remaining antibiotic in the system.

Overprescribing antibiotics for mild infections, as well as misdiagnosing viral infections, is accelerating AMR.

AMR is especially concerning in low-income communities and developing countries, where inadequate sanitation, lack of access to clean water, and limited immunization programs are often the primary causes of infection.

Antibiotics are often used inappropriately for these infections, even when they are unnecessary, worsening the problem. In some areas, antibiotics are widely available without a prescription, further contributing to their overuse.6

In addition, farming practices, such as the use of unnecessary antibiotics for growth promotion in livestock, contribute significantly to the spread of drug-resistant bacteria in both animals and humans. A 2015 study projected that total antibiotic use in livestock in 2010 was 63,151 tons.

It is estimated that antibiotic use in livestock will rise by 67 % by 2030.7 Antibiotic use in agriculture promotes the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes in the soil, which eventually enter the water system as pollutants.8 A 2009 study found antibiotic-resistant genes and bacteria in the tap water supply.9

While antibiotics have an important role in agricultural production and growth, their long-term, low-dose use may contribute to the development of AMR, potentially costing the healthcare system millions of dollars in treatment.

How does antimicrobial resistance occur?

The mechanism of antimicrobial resistance is well studied and is generally divided into two categories.

Intrinsic resistance

The first way AMR originates is through intrinsic resistance, which is a microorganism’s innate ability to withstand antibiotics. ""For example, an antibiotic that affects the wall-building mechanism of the bacteria, such as penicillin, cannot affect bacteria that do not have a cell wall.""10

Acquired resistance

Acquired resistance occurs when antibiotic-susceptible bacteria gain the ability to withstand the effects of an antibiotic, allowing them to reproduce and spread under selective pressure.

This type of resistance is achieved either by modifying existing genetic material (gene mutation) or by acquiring new genetic material from another source (horizontal gene transfer).

Acquired resistance genes may allow bacteria to degrade or chemically modify antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. They may also produce or upregulate efflux pumps, which actively transport antibiotics out of the cell, preventing the drug from reaching its intracellular target.

Additionally, bacteria may alter the drug’s target site or develop an alternative metabolic pathway that bypasses the drug’s effects.11

How to prevent antibiotic resistance

The first step in preventing AMR is to stop the spread of infections entirely.

This includes staying home when sick, practicing proper hygiene, and keeping up to date with vaccinations, among other precautions. The Canadian government emphasizes that the appropriate use of antimicrobials (primarily antibiotics) is critical to preventing the emergence of superbugs.

Overuse and misuse of antibiotics are among the primary drivers of AMR development.12 According to a 2017 study, ""up to 40 % of antibiotic prescriptions for these conditions are unnecessary."" 13 This not only leads to more mutant bacteria but also harms the gut microbiome since antibiotics kill both beneficial and harmful bacteria.

Doctors must accurately diagnose bacterial infections and prescribe antibiotics only when truly necessary. Patients must also take responsibility for using antibiotics properly.

Sharing medication, flushing it down the drain, failing to complete the full course of therapy, or not taking the prescription as directed can all contribute to the rapid spread of AMR.

We must each do our part to help prevent the rise of superbugs.

Things you may wonder

Does hand sanitizer cause superbugs?

No, using hand sanitizer does not lead to the emergence of superbugs. Hand sanitizers contain ethanol, which kills bacteria immediately by breaking down their cell walls, whereas antibiotics inhibit bacterial growth. Hand sanitizers also evaporate quickly, preventing bacteria from developing resistance.

Does bleach create superbugs?

No, bleach does not promote the emergence of superbugs. Bleach destroys microorganisms by breaking down their cell structure. It is a fast-acting disinfectant that gives microbes no time to develop resistance.

CRC usually develops gradually, taking months or even years to spread to other parts of the body. Due to this slow progression, early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment.

A major challenge with CRC is that symptoms are often mild or absent in the early stages, highlighting the importance of routine screening. Gaining a thorough understanding of this disease is a crucial first step toward adopting preventive measures to reduce its impact.

Common symptoms of colorectal cancer

Patients in the early stages of CRC typically have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. In the later stages of CRC, symptoms may vary depending on the tumor's size and location, but they often include:

Persistent changes in bowel habits

Individuals' bowel habits vary, and ""normal"" behaviors differ from one another. Bowel habits include how often someone has a bowel movement, as well as changes such as constipation, diarrhea, or differences in the size, shape, and consistency of stool.

Blood in the stool or rectal bleeding

Polyps and tumors can bleed for various reasons, including rupture of blood vessels in the gut lining, ulceration, inflammation and irritation of surrounding tissue, or physical injury from bowel movements caused by a blockage.

Abdominal discomfort, such as cramping or pain

Bloating and a persistent sense of fullness are possible symptoms. The location of the discomfort often varies based on the tumor’s position. In women, these symptoms may resemble menstrual pain and are frequently overlooked.

Unintended weight loss, fatigue, or weakness

A significant loss of weight (more than 10 pounds) in a short period of time, accompanied by a loss of energy, is a symptom of cancer and should be addressed immediately.

If you notice any of these symptoms, consult a doctor right away.

Understanding the causes and risk factors of colorectal cancer

CRC results from genetic mutations that lead to abnormal cell proliferation. Some mutations are inherited, while others are caused by environmental or lifestyle factors.

Key risk factors

Age: CRC primarily affects individuals over the age of 50. However, since the mid-1990s, there has been a 1–2 % increase in incidence among younger adults. 1,2 Alarmingly, rates in those under 50 have increased by 2.4 % each year, with mortality rising by 1 % each year. 3

Alarmingly, rates in those under 50 have increased by 2.4 % each year, with mortality rising by 1 % each year. Family history: Having a family history of CRC, especially in a first-degree relative, significantly increases the risk of developing the disease. Approximately one in every ten cases is linked to family history, highlighting the importance of early and regular screening for those at high risk. 1,4

Having a family history of CRC, especially in a first-degree relative, significantly increases the risk of developing the disease. Approximately one in every ten cases is linked to family history, highlighting the importance of early and regular screening for those at high risk. Diet: Consuming red and processed meats raises the risk of CRC, while a fiber-rich diet, such as one including whole grains, can help lower it. Studies have shown that consuming 300 milligrams of calcium daily (the amount found in a large glass of milk) can reduce the risk by 17 %. 5, 6

Studies have shown that consuming 300 milligrams of calcium daily (the amount found in a large glass of milk) can reduce the risk by 17 %. Lifestyle: Lifestyle behaviors strongly influence CRC risk. Prolonged sitting increases the risk of colon cancer by 28–44 %. Other contributing factors include smoking and alcohol consumption. Alcohol, in particular, is associated with several types of cancer, including CRC. 7,8

Alcohol, in particular, is associated with several types of cancer, including CRC. Medical conditions: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, increase the risk of CRC. According to studies, long-term inflammation in the colon significantly raises this risk, highlighting the importance of routine screenings.9

How is colorectal cancer diagnosed?

CRC is diagnosed using a combination of screening tests, diagnostic techniques, and laboratory analysis. Early detection is critical for improving outcomes and survival rates.

Patients will be asked to undergo the tests and procedures listed below based on their medical history, physical exam, and CRC screening test results.

Colonoscopy

The gold standard for detecting polyps and cancers. A flexible tube equipped with a camera inspects the entire colon and rectum. A colonoscopy may include a biopsy or the removal of polyps.

Flexible sigmoidoscopy

Similar to a colonoscopy, but less invasive. It examines only the lower part of the colon and the rectum.

CT colonoscopy

No sedation is required for this minimally invasive colon imaging treatment. This method checks the large intestine for polyps, cancers, and other abnormalities. It uses computed tomography (CT) scanning technology to provide detailed, high-resolution 3D images of the colon and rectum.

Stool-based tests

The presence of blood in stool could be an indicator of CRC. Fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical assays (FIT) can both detect blood in stool samples.

Blood tests

Blood tests cannot be used alone to diagnose CRC. However, they provide insight into a person's overall health and can detect abnormalities that may be related to the presence of cancer. Individuals suspected of having CRC are evaluated with a complete blood count, liver function tests, and kidney function tests.

Cell and tissue studies

When a tumor is discovered, the presence of certain mutations in the tumor cells can help determine the most effective treatment and therapy options for the individual.

Norgen Biotek offers researchers a variety of methods for isolating DNA and RNA from cell and tissue samples.

Tumor marker tests

Advanced approaches, such as RNA or DNA analysis, identify cancer-related genetic markers and support early tumor detection. Tumor markers can be found in blood, tissue, and other bodily fluids.

An abnormal level of a tumor marker may indicate CRC. Tumor marker tests are also used to monitor your response to cancer treatment.

Norgen Biotek provides cutting-edge technologies for liquid biopsy biomarker testing, ensuring accurate and reliable results.

How to prevent colorectal cancer

Prevention is crucial in reducing the occurrence of CRC. Individuals can significantly lower their risk by implementing effective measures.

Healthy diet

A nutritious diet is an effective way to reduce the risk of CRC. Increasing fiber intake from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains improves digestive health and lowers cancer risk.

At the same time, limiting the consumption of red and processed meats is important, as studies have linked excessive intake to a 29 % increased risk of colon cancer.10 Even small, consistent dietary changes can have a significant impact on CRC prevention.

Healthy lifestyle

Adopting healthy lifestyle habits is another important aspect of CRC prevention. Regular physical activity, such as 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week, helps maintain a healthy weight and reduces cancer risk.11

Similarly, limiting alcohol intake is essential, as excessive consumption has been linked to an increased risk of developing CRC.12 Making these small but meaningful changes to your daily routine can have a significant impact on your long-term health.

Genetic testing for colorectal cancer

Individuals with a family history of CRC should consider genetic testing to identify inherited conditions such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which significantly increase cancer risk.

Understanding these genetic predispositions allows for early and regular screenings, providing opportunities to detect and address cancer before it develops. Proactive genetic testing encourages individuals and families to better manage their health.13

Colorectal cancer screening

CRC should be conducted regularly to ensure early detection and prevention. The American Cancer Society recommends that individuals at average risk begin screening at age 45. Screening options include stool tests and visual exams such as colonoscopies.

These methods help detect and remove precancerous polyps, preventing cancer from forming. Early detection through screening significantly improves treatment outcomes.14

Things you may wonder

Who should be screened for colorectal cancer?

Screening should begin around age 45 for most people and earlier for those at high risk. Consult your doctor to determine whether you should start screening sooner.

What foods are linked to increased colorectal cancer risk?

Diets high in red or processed meats and low in fiber have been linked to an increased risk of CRC.

Are stool-based tests reliable?

Stool tests are useful for initial screening and can help detect early signs of cancer.
