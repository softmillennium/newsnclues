Chancellor Rachel Reeves has appeared to indicate that the UK is unlikely to respond quickly to President Trump should he impose damaging tariffs.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that the UK is unlikely to respond quickly to President Trump should he impose damaging tariffs on goods coming from Britain.

In a hearing at the Treasury Committee on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK would not “rush into action to get a quick headline”.

“The prize on offer is a good economic agreement between us and the United States,” Reeves said. “We won’t do anything to put that in jeopardy.”

Reeves’ comments suggest the UK may not retaliate in the short term if tariffs are imposed.

Trade deal negotiations are also “ongoing”, according to Reeves.

“We do not want to see trade barriers go up. Indeed, we want to see trade barriers fall.”

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said that the UK is “preparing for all eventualities” ahead of Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ announcements.

Reeves warned that even if the UK avoids tariffs and agrees a trade deal with the US,it would not be “out of the woods”.

“The specific tariffs on the UK are less relevant to growth and inflation than the global picture because we are an open trading economy.”

The European Union has drawn up a “strong plan” to retaliate against Trump’s tariffs, Commission chief Ursual von der Layen said on Tuesday.

Reeves said she spoke to EU economic commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis ahead of the hearing at the Treasury Committee.

The US president is set to announce sweeping tariffs on imports at around 21:00 BST on Wednesday. The tariffs are expected to wreak havoc on the global economy.

The Chancellor was also questioned by Liberal Democrat MP Bobby Dean on whether she had left herself enough headroom in “volatile times”.

“There’s a balancing act when you’re doing a spring statement or a budget around what you want to do on taxes, on spending and on headroom, everything else being equal. Would we like more headroom? Of course we would.”

“I think we’ve got the balance about right.”

Reeves did not rule out further tax rises in the autumn.

She also claimed the Treasury did not restore its headroom to the exact figure of £9.9bn on purpose.

“It was by accident, rather than design, that it was exactly the same amount of headroom [as in the Autumn Budget].”",cityam

McLaren team principal Zak Brown has admitted to cynically using Red Bull’s 2024 investigation of Christian Horner to destabilise their Formula 1 rivals.

McLaren team principal Zak Brown has admitted to cynically using Red Bull’s 2024 investigation of Christian Horner to destabilise their Formula 1 rivals.

Horner was accused of sending inappropriate messages to a Red Bull colleague, something he denied and was cleared of by an independent investigation last year.

The news played a part in the recent Drive to Survive Formula 1 Netflix documentary, with Brown’s public reaction angering Horner behind the scenes.

Brown, whose McLaren team are looking to defend their Constructor’s Championship this year, has admitted, however, that he saw an opportunity to cause chaos amid the fall out from Horner’s unwanted publicity.

“Our sport, perhaps more than others – though I wouldn’t claim to be an expert on other sports – has a highly competitive and political aspect,” he Kaleidoscope’s TechStuff podcast this week.

“The goal is to make ourselves as fast as possible, but there’s also a strategy of destabilising the competition. We try to create tension or disrupt other teams, which isn’t unique to F1 but is particularly pronounced here.

“You’re constantly fighting for employees, drivers, sponsors, and media attention plays a big role. If you can generate some instability in rival teams – and it doesn’t always work in our favor – it can slow them down while we focus on speeding up.”

Brown tactics worked?

Some would suggest Brown’s “slowing down” tactics worked, with Red Bull’s performance falling off a cliff midway through the 2024 season, allowing McLaren to close the gap and win the team title. Max Verstappen won the solo crown for a fourth consecutive year but McLaren’s Lando Norris leads this year’s title charge.

Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs could spark a global recession

The world is bracing for Trump’s ‘Liberation day,’ with the President set to impose a fresh batch of tariffs on nations across the globe this evening.

Trump will speak from the White House Rose Garden at 16:00 (21:00 BST) to unveil his new set of levies.

The President’s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the tariffs will be “effective immediately” after the announcement on Tuesday.

Since his inauguration in January, Trump’s bait and switch on tariffs has caused turbulence in global markets.

The President had previously said in March that tariffs would be reciprocal – charging countries what they charge the US – however, he backtracked at a later date and told reporters the numbers could be lower.

The billionaire co-owner of Aston Villa football club has become the latest wealthy foreigner to leave the UK in response to the government’s decision to abolish the non-dom regime.

According to registry filings, Nassef Sawiris, Egypt’s richest man, is now a resident of Italy. He previously lived in the UK and claimed the country’s generous non-dom status for over a decade.

The chemicals magnate, who owns Aston Villa and is executive chair of OCI Global, has been gradually cutting ties with the UK in recent months.

He resigned as a director of the London branch of his family office, NNS Group, in November last year.

Shortly after, NNS Group was registered in Abu Dhabi, a tax-friendly jurisdiction that is becoming an increasingly attractive bolt-hole for the world’s super-rich.

Now Sawris has formally moved away from the UK, just days before the non-dom regime, a 200-year-old tax status allowing wealthy foreigners only to be taxed on their UK income and assets, is annulled on April 6.

Ultra-high net worth individuals flee the UK

Sawiris’s decision to quit the UK, first reported by the Birmingham Mail, follows several other high-profile departures of ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) fleeing what they perceive to be a government assault on wealthy investors.

Last week, it emerged that Lakshmi Mittal, a steel tycoon ranked seventh in the Sunday Times Rich List, had decamped from the UK in favour of the United Arab Emirates.

And in September last year, German crypto investor Christian Angermayer moved to Switzerland before unleashing a fierce broadside at the government’s plans to scrap the non-dom status.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Angermayer said that every non-dom he knew “has left, or [was] about to leave”, and branded the Chancellor’s plans, which had not been formally announced at the time, as a “huge mistake”.

Sawiris is now likely to take up Italy’s attractive flat tax scheme. The regime, which is levied at a blanket rate of €200,000 (£166,600), allows wealthy foreign nationals to reside in the Mediterranean country without paying tax on their global income and assets.

A representative for the Egyptian billionaire declined to comment.

Non-dom reforms

His departure comes despite the Chancellor watering down some of the UK’s non-dom reforms to stem the exodus of UHNWIs from Britain.

At the World Economic Forum at Davos, Rachel Reeves committed to extending the terms of the Temporary Repatriation Facility (TRF). This new tax status allows people moving to the UK to bring capital into the country at a generous rate.

The non-dom community gave the concession short shrift at the time, and a fresh study published on Wednesday has warned that the reforms will create a “punitive and arbitrary” set of rules that will continue to drive out former non-doms.

The Adam Smith Institute paper, titled Wealth Exodus: Stopping non-dom flight, argued that a lack of clarity around the TRF – combined with other changes contained in the Finance Bill – means that wealthy foreigners could face an effective tax rate of 67 per cent on foreign businesses.

Andrew Griffith, shadow business secretary, said the study showed the government was “presiding over the biggest brain drain of talent in a generation”.

“Everyone left in the UK is a victim as we lose the jobs, businesses and spending of the wealth creators,” he added.",cityam

Heathrow Airport, British Airways Airbus A380 come in to land,

Heathrow Airport was warned about its power supply in the days before it closed because of an outage, MPs were told.

Nigel Wicking, chief executive of Heathrow Airline Operators Committee, which represents airlines that use the west London airport, said there were a “couple of incidents” which made him concerned.

The airport was closed to all flights until about 6pm on Friday, March 21, after a power outage caused by a fire at a nearby electricity substation which started late the previous night. This disrupted more than 270,000 air passenger journeys.

Wicking told the Transport Select Committee he spoke to the Team Heathrow director on March 15 about his concerns, and the chief operating officer and chief customer officer on March 19.

He said: “It was following a couple of incidents of, unfortunately, theft of wire and cable around some of the power supply that, on one of those occasions, took out the lights on the runway for a period of time.

“That obviously made me concerned and, as such, I raised the point. I wanted to understand better the overall resilience of the airport.”

T5 reopening

Wicking said he believed Heathrow’s Terminal 5 could have been ready to receive repatriation flights by “late morning” on the day of the closure, and that “there was [an] opportunity also to get flights out”.

Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye said keeping the airport open during the outage would have been “disastrous”.

He told the committee: “It became quite clear we could not operate the airport safely quite early in this process, and that is why we closed the airport.

“If we had not done that, we would have had thousands of passengers stranded at the airport at high risk to personal injury, gridlocked roads around the airport, because don’t forget 65,000 houses and other institutions were powered down.

“Traffic lights didn’t work, just to give you an example, many things didn’t work. Parts of the civil infrastructure didn’t work.

“So the risk of having literally tens of thousands of people stranded at the airport, where we would have nowhere to put them, we could not process them, would have been a disastrous scenario.”

Power outage

Woldbye told the committee the substation which caught fire was “by far the biggest” that served the airport, with a capacity of 70 megawatts.

Asked if some of the airport’s terminals could have reopened sooner, he said: “The fact that the lights were on at Terminal 5, which is entirely correct, doesn’t mean the terminal was operational.

“We didn’t have all CCTV, we didn’t have fire surveillance. The fire systems would work… but the fire surveillance systems of the airport (were) down, so we didn’t know where the systems were up and safe. All that had to be secured before we started operation.”

Woldbye added: “I cannot guarantee you whether T5 could have opened an hour earlier.

“We did all we could to get it open as soon as we could, because we fully understand the airlines’ concerns around getting repatriated flights, repatriated passengers, and also getting flights in there.”

Woldbye said the airport has contracts with energy company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks for “resilient power set-ups”, and “we have to rely on the contracts we have”.

He added: “Should we have further resilience? But that, of course, comes at a very high cost, and that is the discussion we have to have with airlines, because we cannot make investments without having airlines (agree to them).”

Wicking responded: “We already pay enough for Heathrow. I don’t feel that we should be paying more for further resilience. The resilience should have been there in the first place, frankly.”

Soho House has continued to attract new members to its clubs.

Private members’ club Soho House has accused FTSE 100 retail giant Next of copyright and design right infringements over selling furniture that “closely resembled” that of Soho Home.

Launched in 2016, Soho Home is a retailer and interior design studio within Soho House. It sells furniture, artwork, and lighting, replicating those in their Soho House.

According to legal documents seen by City AM, the members club alleged that it became aware in February that Next was “advertising, promoting and selling into the UK market interior design products that closely resemble [Soho] products.”

The claim form showcased a range of furniture stated to be Soho’s “best-selling” or “best known”, including its Oxleydark emperador marble coffee table, priced at £2,795.

The legal documents highlighted that both are in the home and interior design business, alleging Next “was well aware of the existence and commercial success of [Soho]’s products”.

Soho’s lawyers outlined in its allegation for copyright infringement that Next Home featured a book in one of its promotional pictures with the Soho House logo visible on its spine.

The claim also quoted an article by MailOnline, which focused on Next at Home’s ‘dupes’ that went viral on social media in February, including a side table alleged to be similar to Soho.

The private member’s club has hired partner Nick Buckland from City-based Lewis Silkin for its claim against Next, while the British retailer has opted for Oxford-based Open Plan Law.

The claim asks the court for a declaration that Next infringed on Soho’s copyright and design rights and committed acts of passing off.

The legal document also states that Soho’s lawyers are asking the court for an injunction against Next, costs, and an enquiry about damages.

When approached for comment, a spokesperson for Next told City AM: “Next is aware of the situation and has been in legal correspondence with the claimant’s solicitors for some time. As this is now a High Court matter, Next cannot comment further at this time.”

“It will, however, defend itself vigorously,” they added.

Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ has markets on the backfoot.

The FTSE 100 joined European markets back in the red on Wednesday, as investors braced for Trump’s forthcoming tariff announcement.

The UK’s flagship index closed at 8,608.48p, marking a 0.3 per cent dip.

Rolls-Royce lost over three per cent, making it the index’s top faller. Vodafone and GSK also saw losses of around 2.5 per cent.

Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown: “Nervousness about incoming wave of US tariffs has kept the FTSE 100 in the red, as investors assess the UK vulnerability and the knock-on effects for the global economy.”

Germany’s Dax closed at 0.66 per cent and Cac 40 in Paris made losses of 0.22 per cent.

Amidst this, the FTSE 250 managed to scrape a marginal gain, edging up 0.3 per cent.

Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said: “In the immortal words of Nat King Cole, ‘there may be trouble ahead’.

“Investors are braced for impact but it’s hard to prepare for what’s about to come when there are few clues about exactly what Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ will deliver and whether today’s tariffs might be mitigated for some countries with a few swift trade-offs.”

Since his inauguration in January, Trump’s bait and switch on tariffs have left global markets in turbulence.

The President’s mixed messaging over the nature of the tariffs and who could be slapped with the fresh levys have spiked investor concerns.

US markets turn tide but Tesla woes deep

Despite opening on a lull, US markets managed to claw back gains in later trading.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq Exchange all had minor bumps as the European markets closed.

The President is expected to speak at 21:00BST, which will coincide with the closing of American markets.

Whilst Wall Street remains calm, the woes for Nasdaq giant Tesla continued on Wednesday.

Elon Musk’s electric vehicle firm announced sales had plummeted to their lowest levels since the first quarter of 2025.

Tesla said it had delivered 336,681 vehicles in the first three months of the year, which fell short of the 390,000 cars and trucks – according to Bloomberg analysts.

This was driven by a refresh of its highly popular Model Y, as well as growing backlash against Musk from his ties to the Trump administration.

Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown: “The brand is under pressure, and while it’ll take a few months to get clean year-on-year delivery comparisons to truly assess the damage, there’s clearly an underlying impact.

“It’s rare to see sentiment toward a company so closely tied to a polarising White House, and until Musk pulls his focus back to Tesla, shares will remain volatile.”",cityam

The UK has been “supine” to US President Donald Trump and should be “firm” and “find some way to retaliate”, Lord Rose has said.

The businessman and former boss of M&S and Asda told Times Radio the government has been “supine” to President Trump and should be “firm” in threatening retaliatory tariffs.

He said it’s “quite sad” that the UK is “sitting there with our little begging bowl” in the hope that Trump goes easy on us.

The US President is expected to unveil sweeping tariffs at an event at the White House around 9pm UK time, in a move he has dubbed ‘liberation day’.

Ministers are still hopeful of securing a deal with the US that would protect the UK from the import taxes, but Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged “the likelihood is there will be tariffs” on UK exports, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said it would have an “impact”.

Economists at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) have warned US tariffs could eliminate Reeves’s fiscal headroom against her debt target, requiring more spending cuts or tax rises to meet her economic rules, as well as shrinking the economy by one per cent.

While analysis from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggested tariffs on car imports would put 25,000 UK jobs at risk and “completely destabilise the UK car industry”.

UK being ‘supine’ – Rose

Speaking to the broadcaster, Lord Rose was critical of the government’s approach, stating: “I think we have been supine.

“Businesses like to have a vision. Businesses like to know where they’re going. Businesses like to plan, and businesses like to therefore make the investments following all of those plans.

“And at the moment, whether we like the plans or not, we know that the US has a plan. We know, interestingly enough, China’s got a plan. We know Russia’s got a plan, and we might not like that. And we know certainly the EU’s got a plan. Well, what do we stand for today?”

He added: “I want to look forwards, and I think the people in the UK PLC want to look forwards as well. They want certainty, and they want confidence.”

Asked if the UK was powerless to respond, Lord Rose insisted: “If you believe that sort of a mantra, I’m afraid we’re all finished. We all have power to change anything.”

He advised Starmer: “I think we should be quite firm and say, ‘listen, guys, we believe in free market economics’. We have actually got a situation here where our trade is relatively balanced.

“We clearly don’t want to be unfairly hit, and if you do hit us, I’m afraid we are going to, reluctantly but we will do it, retaliate.”

Call to ‘retaliate’

And he added: “It’s quite sad in the 21st century, and I’ve been around a long time, seeing how our relationship has or hasn’t developed with the USA, that we’re sitting there with our little begging bowl, hoping that Trump, because he’s got a Scottish mother, or had a Scottish mother, and he owns a golf club in Scotland, is going to be nice to us.”

He urged the government to strike a more positive note and to say: “Look, guys, it’s a bright, sunny morning this morning… things will be fine. I’m going to do this, this and this and this.

“And if Trump comes and hits me around the head with a wet kipper tonight, I’m going to find some way to retaliate.”

It is unclear what Trump will announce on Wednesday, but his administration views the application of VAT rate as discriminating against US goods and could respond with a 20 per cent tariff on imports from the UK.

He already announced a 25 per cent import tax will be introduced on all cars imported to the US, a blow to the UK’s automotive industry which sent exports worth £7.6bn there last year.

Shoosmiths wants to boost productivity using AI

Law firm Shoosmiths has become the first major firm to link a firmwide bonus to its workforce’s use of artificial intelligence (AI).

The firm exclusively told City AM that it set a “clear and ambitious annual target”: one million Microsoft Copilot prompts to unlock a £1m bonus pot for staff in the new financial year.

The bonus metric will form one element of the firm’s multi-million collegiate bonus pool, available to all staff except partners and business services directors.

If the AI target is achieved, Shoosmiths staff will share £1m of the reward, which equates to one per cent of each individual’s salary.

The firm’s partners can and are encouraged to contribute to the target.

The firm worked out that if every staff member uses its AI just four times per working day, the target “will be comfortably” surpassed.

The target will be tracked and shared transparently across the firm, with monthly updates internally.

David Jackson, CEO at Shoosmiths, stated, “This initiative is about creating a culture where everyone plays a role in embracing change and using technology to raise the bar on client service.”

“We don’t fear AI—it won’t replace our people. Instead, it frees them to spend more time on the human-to-human work that really matters: solving problems, building trust, and supporting clients through complexity,” he added.

Shoosmiths gears up for growth

This comes as Jackson told City AM last October, as part of the Eyes on the Law column, that the firm has sharpened its structure over the last couple of years, becoming one of Europe’s busiest corporate law firms.

Kirsten Hewson, chair of Shoosmiths, added that over the last two years, the firm has been doing a lot of work internally to “get ourselves structured properly” and reach the “objectives for 2030.”

Last July, the firm revealed it had surpassed £200m in revenue for the first time, up six per cent from the previous year’s £194.1m.

Profit rose five per cent to £66m, up from £62.7m. At the same time, its equity partners each took home over £780,000 in profit.

Shoosmiths’ new AI target is a dramatically different approach than Liverpool-headquartered law firm Hill Dickinson, which reportedly blocked general access to several AI tools after it found a “significant increase in usage” by its staff.",cityam

Russian oligarch and billionaire Oleg Deripaska. Credit: Beauchamp Estates

The UK government is sitting on around £1.1bn of sanctioned London housing stock from Russians accused of corruption or Kremlin links.

Many Russians have withdrawn from new purchases in the capital due to the difficulty of getting a mortgage.

There are still Russians who own property, and live, in London, but – and this is particularly true for estate agents – there are noticeably fewer than there were in January 2022.

Before sanctions were put on Russian individuals and assets by the UK government in February 2022, Russians were major players in the super-prime game, owning huge amounts of London residential property, according to Beauchamp Estates.

“[If sanctions are lifted], we’re in a whole new ballgame again,” estate agent at Beauchamp Estates, Paul Finch, said.

With talks between Russia and the US making headlines across the world, and US President Donald Trump reportedly very anxious to broker a peace settlement, are Russian buyers about to return to the UK capital?

“[Russians] prefer London because of the cultural side of things. I think they love the ballet, they love the opera, they love the restaurants, they love the clubs, the members clubs, the architecture, everything about London,” Peter Wetherell of Wetherell said.

“So I think, yeah, we’ll see them coming.”

Home sweet home

There are two reasons someone might want to buy property in London: to live or to invest (or maybe both).

Let’s start with individuals who might want to return to the capital to live.

A number of Russians have, so far, migrated from London to places like Dubai or the UAE – estate agent Paul Finch says Dubai is “packed” with Russians, but “they’ve always had an affection for London.”

“I think we’ll see some of the Russians coming back [if the war ends]… They all want to be in London,” Wetherall said.

Higher demand for super-prime properties would likely help to prop up a flagging market: During the first quarter of 2025, only 15.8 per cent of prime London properties had found a buyer marking a 3.9 per cent reduction on the previous quarter, according to Benham and Reeves.

The average property in prime central London is 21.2 per cent lower than its peak in June 2014 – a saving of £1.2m on the average prime central London property, which is currently worth £4.6m, according to Savills.

Values fell by 2.6 per cent in the year to the end of June, historic discounts equivalent to those seen in the early 1990s and in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, Savills added.

The real end of ‘ghost streets’?

While many Russians came to London to live and raise their children, a significant number owned houses on ‘ghost streets’, where owners of houses would only occasionally reside at the property.

Transparency International, an organisation that investigates corruption, has previously branded Britain as a “laundromat” for suspicious wealth from Russia.

In 2022, the organisation estimated that £1.5bn worth of property was bought by Russians accused of corruption or Kremlin links.

“These figures highlight Britain’s continued role as a global hub for suspicious and illicit wealth, from Russia and elsewhere,” Transparency International said.

In 2022, the Government froze the assets of those accused of corruption or links with the Kremlin, hoovering up a lot of those houses – many of which have sat empty ever since.

“The majority of Russians that were here who own property here… stayed here [but] there have been quite a few houses that sat empty,” Wetherell said.

“One would hope that as soon as sanctions are lifted, these restrictions will be lifted as well, and these people will be able to either sell their assets or come back and sort of live in them.

“Kind of quite what state they’ll be in… we don’t know,” he added.

“They’ve been… with the shutters down for nearly three years with weeds growing out of the gutters because they’re not being serviced,” Finch said.

With the famously tough Baroness Hodge appointed as the UK’s anti-corruption champion, the capital is a less appealing environment for illicit wealth, making it more likely that these houses will simply return to the main market.

Transparency International UK has called Hodge “uniquely positioned” to make the UK “the anti-corruption capital of the world”.

Is London still a good place to invest?

There is also legitimate investment from Russian buyers in the capital, but it’s possible that this will be limited by high taxes going forward.

“The whole dynamic of the top end of the market has changed… People aren’t dipping in, dipping out. They’re buying for generations,” Finch said.

“If you want to be in London, it’s like [joining] a club. There’s a joining fee, and then, fantastic,” he added. “The joining fee at the moment for the prime end is pretty significant.”

Many of the reasons for this stem from changes announced in last year’s Autumn budget.

Policy changes announced in the budget include Labour’s decision to continue with Jeremy Hunt’s scrapping of the non-dom regime, higher VAT on private schools, and higher taxes on second homes.

Stamp duty on a £20m super-prime home is just under 12 per cent for the portion above £1.5m, amounting to around £2.3m – equivalent to years of renting a super-prime property.

“The abolition of the non-doms tax regime and imposition of an increased stamp duty surcharge on additional homes sits firmly behind a further easing in prices in central London,” Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, said.

Interest rates, too, plus council taxes and changes to VAT rules, have pushed and will push the cost of buying even higher.

“It looks like we’re saying to [potential buyers], ‘Go away and go elsewhere’,” Finch said.

Changing tides?

Significant geopolitical tensions between major global players mean that nothing is set in stone.

Jeremy Gee, managing director of Beauchamp Estates, said that London prime property benefits from being “stable” compared to other areas, regardless of the ‘joining fee’.

“We have continued to see a significant inflow of international buyers into London, dominated by US dollar-based buyers from American, Middle East and Indians based in the UAE… over recent months we have seen an upturn in buyers from continental Europe and Asia.”

An inflow of Russian buyers – even if they are buying to live rather than invest – might even boost demand enough to prop up prices.

Ultimately, Wetherell doesn’t think enough has changed in the last three years to push legitimate Russian buyers out of London – in fact, he thinks Russian buyers will even look in the same areas of the capital.

“They will start buying up… good quality prime central London stock… good quality prime Surrey stock in Wentworth estates and Georges Hill, which they pretty much made their own 10 to 15 years ago. I think they’ll come back to that,” Wetherell said.

“[Anecdotally] they do want to come back. They do want London. So yes… there will definitely be a marketplace for them.

“And I think we will see them. We will see them as and when the political landscape changes.”

Reeves’ fearmongering has scared Brits into saving. The consequences will be more frightening than Reeves’ ‘black hole’, writes Paul Ormerod

A very bad piece of news for the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, slipped out last week with relatively little comment.

The personal savings ratio – the proportion of incomes, net of borrowing, which individuals save – rose sharply. From 10.3 per cent in the third quarter of last year, it went up to 12 per cent in the final three months of the year.

Obviously, if people save more, they spend less.

In the final quarter of 2023, savings were only 8.1 per cent of personal income. Consumer spending is just over £1,700bn a year in the UK. So by the end of 2024, people were choosing to spend £70bn less at an annual rate than a year ago.

These are big chunks of money which are being taken out of action. No wonder the economy is teetering on the brink of recession if consumers are becoming much less inclined to spend.

It is a major headache for Rachel Reeves and her desire to see the economy grow. But it is also an interesting test of an important theory in macroeconomics, one which has key practical implications.

Beware of Ricardian Equivalence

The theory goes back just over 200 years. For 20 years from the mid-1790s, Britain had been engaged in a titanic struggle with Napoleon’s France.

To pay for the conflict, the government had borrowed on a massive scale. The cumulative financial deficit – the difference between income from taxes and what the government spends – in the twenty years from 1795 amounted to over £2 trillion in the prices of today.

David Ricardo, Member of Parliament, multi-millionaire and one of the greatest ever economists, tried to answer the question: how should the war be paid for?

Obviously, one way to pay off the cumulative deficits would be to raise taxes. The other was to issue government bonds.

Ricardo argued that whichever of the two were used in whatever combination, the impact on the economy would be the same.

When the government runs a deficit, spending power is injected into the economy. But an increase in taxes cancels this out. But what if the government simply finances the debt by issuing bonds?

Ricardo believed the private sector would act rationally. People would anticipate that in the future, taxes would have to go up anyway to pay off the debt. As a result, they would save more and spend less now to be able to pay these taxes.

This is a key idea in modern macroeconomics, known as “Ricardian equivalence”. The two methods of financing a deficit – taxes and issuing bonds – are equivalent in their impact on total spending in an economy.

Why Brits are saving

The modern version of the theory makes a number of qualifications to Ricardo’s original idea. But the basic principle survives: if a government runs a large deficit, the private sector will save more because people anticipate that taxes will have to rise at some point to pay off the public debt.

At every conceivable opportunity the Chancellor, and other members of the government prompted by her, has trotted out the phrase “£22bn black hole in the public finances”.

People have indeed taken note of the fact that the public finances are heavily in the red. They realise that taxes may well have to rise even more to pay off public debt. And they save in order to be able to pay the taxes.

The more that people believe that taxes will rise, the more they will save. And the more they save, the weaker is economic growth and the less are government receipts from taxation. So the deficit rises, which makes even more tax increases likely to fund it.

The Chancellor is creating her very own black hole, this time a genuine and frightening one.

Trump’s presidency is yet to spook retail investors. In fact, many are increasing their investments, writes Carl Hazeley, the newly-appointed CEO of Finimize, in today’s Notebook

Retail investors are yet to run scared

The first three months under Trump have revealed something interesting – while investors are less confident about the markets, they’re not running away. They’re getting smarter about where they put their money.

The latest Finimize Modern Investor Pulse, which surveyed over 2,200 modern retail investors, shows that market confidence has fallen significantly – only 60 per cent now believe stocks will be higher in a year, down from 71 per cent. Yet the majority (84 per cent) plan to invest the same or increase their investments this year.

Instead of panicking, nearly half of investors are simply reshuffling their approach. Many are holding more cash (59 per cent) while also exploring investments beyond traditional stocks (53 per cent) and looking at opportunities outside the US (51 per cent).

This comes as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has warned the US economy might be entering a “detox period”. Even in cryptocurrency, we’re seeing more sophisticated behaviour – though fewer people believe in Bitcoin’s prospects, more are planning to invest in digital assets generally.

The tech sector remains the top choice (65 per cent), followed by energy (49 per cent) and healthcare (36 per cent), showing investors are still confident in specific areas despite recent drops in tech stocks.

What’s clear is that regular investors are thinking long-term. They’re not letting short-term market swings rattle them, but are adapting thoughtfully to the changing financial landscape by building more balanced portfolios that can weather whatever comes next.

Some personal news…

After seven incredible years at Finimize, I’m stepping into the CEO role to lead our next phase of growth. When I joined, we were an ambitious company with a clear vision: empower retail investors with world-class financial insights. Today, that community has grown to over 1m strong. Through Finimize for Business, we’ve helped hundreds of financial institutions connect with modern investors. As a result, Finimize reaches tens of millions of people every year. The rise of retail investing isn’t slowing down, and neither are we.

Earnings season rundown

The end of the first quarter means we’ll shortly be entering earnings season, where companies lift the veil on how things have been going. It’s an important time for investors to sense-check their assumptions and recalibrate their views. Expect a lot of focus on the biggest US companies: overall, analysts expect S&P 500 firms to show seven per cent first-quarter year-on-year earnings growth, with healthcare, information technology and utilities expected to lead the line – and energy, materials and consumer staples firms to lag.

(Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images)

As Keir Starmer calls for schools to pay attention to the hit drama Adolescence, could a smartphone ban be next? We get two writers to argue for and against banning phones in schools in this week’s Debate

YES: There is a clear correlation between smartphones and mental health issues

I believe schools should ban smartphones, and I petitioned for this alongside fellow parents at my son’s school. This is due to the clear correlation between social media and gaming with mental health issues. Despite the government citing insufficient evidence linking phone use to mental health issues, the effects are undeniable to parents.

The recently rolled out Online Safety Act is designed to ensure safer online environments and places more responsibility on technology companies and online platforms. If executed correctly, it is a much-needed measure to safeguard our children and govern the unethical practices of some advertisers who target under-16s. It means that advertisers will need to ensure their campaigns are ethically sound and do not contribute to negative outcomes like mental health issues, unhealthy habits or misinformation. Continued innovation around first-party data strategies within advertising will also help with this, ensuring that brands still find value in their campaigns but minimise tracking.

While we all know new technology can be a powerful force for good, more research is needed to guide schools, parents and children alike to navigate these new technologies. This is ever more profound and important with the rise of AI. Parents need tools and understanding to know how to keep potentially harmful algorithms at bay, and to be informed about the implications and opportunities that new legislation like the Online Safety Bill provide.

Sarah Pettitt, Senior Group Business Director at Seedtag

NO: Education – not prohibition – is the key to guiding responsible phone use

While the intention behind banning smartphones in schools is understandable, a blanket ban risks creating more problems than it solves.

Logistically, schools face serious challenges managing large volumes of phones daily. Collecting, storing and returning hundreds of devices safely takes time and resources – particularly difficult for schools spread across multiple sites. There’s also the matter of responsibility. If a phone is lost or stolen, who is liable? These are practical issues that can’t be ignored.

Moreover, bans aren’t foolproof. Reports of students using “burner phones” – handing in old or inactive devices while keeping their real phones – highlight how easily rules can be undermined. Instead of eliminating distractions, bans may simply push phone use out of sight and make it harder to monitor.

Beyond logistics, we must also consider the role smartphones play in modern life. They’re used to top up lunch accounts, coordinate family plans and stay connected in emergencies. In a world where most adult coordination – from group chats to transport – is done digitally, expecting students to rely solely on receptionists or landlines seems outdated.

But most importantly, banning smartphones ignores a fundamental responsibility: to teach young people how to use technology responsibly. Simply removing devices doesn’t help students develop digital discipline or understand context-appropriate use. Education – not prohibition – is the key to guiding responsible behaviour.

Rather than banning smartphones altogether, schools should focus on structured guidance and clear expectations. Helping students learn when and how to engage with technology is a far more sustainable, and educational, approach.

Josh Blackburn, CEO at online tutoring company TLC LIVE

THE VERDICT:

Whether you think TV setting policy agenda is a good thing or not, there is no doubt the success of Netflix drama Adolescence could prove significant in moving the dial on the growing debate around online safety for young people. Jack Thorne, who wrote the show alongside actor Stephen Graham and attended a roundtable with Keir Starmer yesterday, has urged the PM to consider a smartphone ban in schools, as recently implemented in Australia. But is a ban really the answer?

Ms Pettitt cites many reasonable points. Social media’s potential to negatively impact mental health is certainly hard to ignore.

But, ultimately, as Mr Blackburn, a former secondary school teacher, points out: a ban misses the point. Smartphones are sewn into the fabric of modern life, and it’s unrealistic to portion off a section of society from that. Kids are smart, and will find ways to use them anyway. Better, then, it be done without the added glamour for teenagers of doing something they’re not meant to.",cityam

There aren’t many decade-old Guardian articles that still resonate with me, but I can recall (and often revisit) a 2014 column by Oliver Burkeman. He was writing in response to the latest example of institutional failure that week (something to do with the bungled sacking of the New York Times editor) and he was able to list a slew of other gaffes, cock-ups and embarrassments from the recent news cycle (featuring Ed Miliband and Barack Obama) noting that we’re always “shocked whenever authority figures who are supposed to know what they’re doing make it plain that they don’t.” He wrote that stories of incompetence “illustrate one of the most fundamental yet still under-appreciated truths of human existence, which is this: everyone is totally just winging it, all the time.”

We like to think that “somewhere, in the highest echelons of society, there are some near-infallible adults in charge,” but look around – in politics, across Whitehall, in public institutions, maybe even at your company – and ask yourself, is this really the case?

I’ll never forget being told by a Downing Street official, years after I read the Burkeman column, that “the room with all the really clever people in it doesn’t actually exist.” Do you doubt me? Read any of the lurid accounts of the Brexit negotiations, read the emoji-laden war-planning group chat between Trump’s top officials, consider the rat-infested streets bankrupt Birmingham or dip into the Covid inquiry (or the Post Office inquiry, or the infected blood inquiry, or any of our seemingly continuous inquiries into failures) and then tell me that the people in charge really know what they’re doing. High status does not necessarily infer high calibre.

This column isn’t supposed to be nihilistic; on the contrary – it can be liberating to realise that leaders, experts and systems are fallible and, once we appreciate that, we can work with a clear head to make improvements. Nor is this line of argument designed to excuse serious failures or to shield anyone from ultimate responsibility. Instead, it’s about recognising why we so often have to endure what might be termed ‘low level incompetence’ – often masked by a title, a uniform or even institutional secrecy.

All of this has served as a rather long winded introduction to the point I set out to make, which is that we shouldn’t be surprised to discover that the Office for National Statistics is making a hash of vital data collection and analysis, and has been for years. The important thing is that now their fallibility is well understood by all concerned, we should demand vigorous efforts to review, learn, test and improve in a spirit of candour and transparency. That might seem radical, but it shouldn’t be too much to ask.",cityam

Small businesses let down by Spring Statement

Income tax threshold freezes are a de facto tax rise but the revenue won’t be fully realised until the end of the parliament. She should adjust rates now while there’s still time to improve public services before the next election? And fix distortive cliff edges while she’s at it, says Will Cooling

Rachel Reeves has lost all control over the nation’s finances.

For all her talk of tough decisions, she has repeatedly taken the easy way out and as a result has had to return to the well for public spending and welfare cuts. For all her promises to be fiscally responsible, she has given herself no leeway. Above all, Reeves is trying to dig her way out of a hole she dug herself back with her first budget. Scrambling to find a tax she could increase without breaking the letter of her party’s manifesto commitments, she settled on increasing employer rather than employee National Insurance Contributions. This was always a cynical dodge, given that ultimately employers would pass the cost onto their employees through lower wage increases.

Alas, the sheer size of the increase is causing real pain for businesses in the short-term, forcing them to either sack people, jack up prices, or both. To add insult to injury, the public sector as the nation’s largest employer has been particularly badly hit by this tax increase, meaning that much of the extra spending Reeves proudly announced last year is being used to pay for the tax rises that funded it! A problem compounded by another above-inflation increase in the national minimum wage and the impending cost of implementing Angela Rayner’s package of new worker’s rights.

What makes her passivity all the more remarkable is that slowly but surely she is increasing income taxes, having signed-up to continue Jeremy Hunt’s plan to freeze the personal allowance until March 2028. By the time of the next election, that will be adding over £30bn to the government’s annual bottom line. But of course that benefit will be back loaded, because she’s waiting for inflation to slowly inflate away the personal allowance.

Reeves should seize the moment

Why not seize the moment and bring that additional income forward? Lowering thresholds now would bring in revenue while there’s actually time to make meaningful improvements to public services before the election. She could also fix the bizarre bottlenecks that have arisen where some higher rate taxpayers are faced with excessive marginal rates when their personal allowance or child benefit is aggressively withdrawn. Surely it would be better to just start the additional rate at a lower level than engage in convoluted kludges that are arbitrarily forcing people to stop working.

Nobody could argue that Labour didn’t secure a mandate to manipulate income tax thresholds; they explicitly left themselves the freedom to continue Hunt’s freeze. They could even sweeten the pill by promising to resume the inflationary increases, from a new, much lower baseline.

The reality is that we can only go back to having the type of public services we had in the 2000s if we rebuild the tax base that once funded them. A big part of that is undoing the ramping up of the personal allowance that actually began back when Gordon Brown screwed up the abolition of the 10p income tax band. Before Alistair Darling’s emergency repair job, the personal allowance represented about a quarter of average earnings, something that today would be around £9,000. Bringing the personal allowance down to this level would represent no more than a £60 monthly tax increase for the low paid, something that Labour should be more than able to compensate for by improving public services.

Rachel Reeves could not have looked less in control than she did last week. Nobody buys that she has given herself sufficient headroom to avoid further spending cuts, and few believe that such spending cuts are politically or practically possible. She needs to find tax increases from somewhere. Absent any fresh ideas, she should bring forward one of the tax rises she already has planned.

Labour’s only hope for growth is new housebuilding – but Britain doesn’t have the workforce to deliver even the newly downgraded targets. There is an obvious solution, says Jamila Robertson

In the Spring Statement, Rachel Reeves acknowledged that she will no longer be able to meet the government’s manifesto pledge to build 1.5m homes by the end of this parliament, pointing to the OBR downgrading cumulative net additions to UK housing stock to 1.3m.

Nevertheless, Angela Rayner’s National Planning Policy Framework was the one bright spot in an otherwise bleak emergency Budget – with the OBR predicting planning reforms would yield 170,000 new homes, boosting growth by 0.2 per cent a year.

But there’s an elephant in the room: we don’t have the skilled workforce to build these homes. To solve this, Labour has worked with the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) and the National House-Building Council (NHBC), who have invested £140m into developing the pipeline of construction workers. This will result in 32 ‘homebuilding skills hubs’ to “fast-track training to local areas that need more housing” and ultimately deliver 5,000 more construction apprentices a year.

Yet, there are two problems. Firstly, the hubs aren’t scheduled to launch until 2028. Secondly, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) chief executive, Tim Balcon: “Under the government’s homebuilding plans, up to an additional 152,000 workers will need to be found, and this doesn’t include the quarter of a million additional construction workers we need to meet all forecasted construction demand through to 2028”. While admirable, 5,000 apprentices by the end of this parliament will not plug a vacancy gap of 402,000 workers, or deliver 1.3-1.5m homes.

While admirable, 5,000 apprentices by the end of this parliament will not plug a vacancy gap of 402,000 workers, or deliver 1.3-1.5m homes

One thing Labour’s plans do right is radically reduce the time it takes to train a construction apprentice, halving apprenticeships from 24-30 months to 12-18 months. In 2010 the average age in the industry was 45, rising to 50 by 2020. Based on current projections, over 20 per cent of the workforce will retire in the next decade. So, how can we plug this 402,000 worker gap? Welfare reform.

The total number of people on Universal Credit in January 2025 was 7.5m, the highest level since the introduction of Universal Credit in 2013. According to the January 2025 figures, we currently have 1.6m people on Universal Credit searching for work. In 2023, the Conservative government stipulated that benefit claimants who failed to find work for more than 18 months would have to undertake work experience placements. This should now go further. The government should reduce this to six months and insist that roles are taken up in industries like construction, where there are staff shortages and a lot of work.

Welfare reform is a no-brainer

For the young, it should be a no-brainer. The average Universal Credit payment for under 25s is £311.68pcm and £393.45pcm for those over 25. An average construction salary, according to Total Jobs, is £42,500, with higher salaries rising to £62,500. On a construction starting salary of £31,787, take-home pay would be £2,200pcm, £1,391 a month more than they would receive on Universal Credit, and much better for their mental health.

But, carrot rather than stick will, of course, be the best way to ensure job seekers see construction as the thriving and future-proof industry that it is.

There are already great initiatives like Open Doors, which provide the opportunity to see live construction sites in action. These should be embraced by schools and colleges, to inspire those who aren’t yet sure of what they want to do. Encouraging more young people, or career switchers, to consider the industry starts with outlining attractive salaries, explaining roles and opportunities for growth and development, and the option to work for yourself down the line. It also has a lot to do with persuading parents.

With traditional first jobs like retail and hospitality facing hiring freezes and redundancies due to Rachel Reeves’ Autumn Budget, now is a great time for the construction industry to present itself as the alternative for young people – and if that doesn’t work, they can always share the story of Pimlico Plumbers.

The Nikkei has plummeted 4.5 per cent amid tariff fears. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images

If there’s one thing every economist agrees on, it’s that the only people who benefir from tariffs are cynical politicians, says Daniel Freeman

Economists almost never agree on anything. Even if you ask a single economist their view on a subject they will generally give you at least three contradictory positions.

This makes the overwhelming consensus among economists across the political spectrum in favour of free trade and against tariffs – taxes on imported goods – all the more remarkable.

The reasons for this consensus are numerous and well evidenced: tariffs result in higher costs for your own consumers and producers that buy foreign inputs, they shift investment and labour away from more productive industries into less productive ones, and they reduce the specialisation which drives much economic growth.

And yet the world’s largest economy under the leadership of President Trump is now heading in the opposite direction. The US has now imposed tariffs on various countries and goods. The UK is expecting to be hit by a 25 per cent on all cars imported into the US from today.

Trump’s protectionist argument goes like this: for decades the US has been reducing tariffs and buying more goods from abroad. This weakened the US manufacturing sector as Americans chose to buy more foreign goods that are cheaper, higher quality or both.

It also means the US runs a trade deficit (meaning it imports more than it exports) with many countries. This is a bad thing because the US is sending them more money than they’re using to buy goods from America.

The solution to both these problems, they say, is to raise tariffs making foreign goods more expensive for American consumers and therefore boosting demand for US produced goods.

Read more No 10 says Donald Trump’s tariffs not responsible for UK economy shrinking

There are numerous issues with this. While it’s true that the US, like most other rich countries, buys more manufactured goods from abroad than they once did. But this has not been accompanied by a long-run rise in unemployment or reduced growth, in fact the result has been the opposite as people and investment have shifted into higher value sectors in which developed countries have more of a competitive edge.

The idea that running a trade deficit with another country is a sign you’re being taken advantage of is absurd. You could just as easily say that I must be being conned by my nearest Chinese takeaway, because I’ve spent hundreds of pounds there and yet they have never bought anything from me.

The economic equivalent of snake oil

So why do politicians support the economic equivalent of snake oil?

Partly there is a nostalgic element to protectionism, particularly in the US. Trump has made repeated references to the high tariffs of America’s late 19th century Gilded Age as a model to follow – even if the work of economic historians like Douglas Irwin and Alex Klein has shown the US industrialised in spite of a high tariff regime not because of it.

But there is an appeal to tariffs in that they allow politicians to pose as defenders of certain industries while the cost of doing so is diffused across society and therefore less likely to be noticed.

An example of this is the first Trump administration’s imposition of tariffs on washing machines. This did lead to the establishment of a few new washing machine plants in the US which was of course trumpeted as a great success for the tariff regime. What was less obvious was (as a later study found) that every additional job in the US manufacturing cost American consumers over $800,000 (£627,000) in higher costs per year.

Tariffs make people dependent on the state maintaining the tariff regime and therefore more likely to support the politicians who impose them in future. Trump may cynically claim that the bill is being paid by foreigners. But the reality is that trade enriches everyone and when it is choked off, especially in an arbitrary and random way, we all pick up the tab.

But prospective Hundred franchise owners could soon be able to do their own deals, beginning by selling space to sponsors on the sleeves of their shirts and then incorporating the front of shirts when the KP Snacks deal concludes.

It would allow the owners, who have placed down huge sums of money to buy a stake in one of the teams, to claw back some of their expenditure.

Hundred concessions

The Hundred’s eight mini-auctions saw eight ownership groups take stakes in teams based across the country. Some – such as India’s mega-wealthy Ambani family and a consortium of tech executives from Google, Microsoft and Adobe – bought 49 per cent stakes, while the Sun Group and RPSG group, owners of Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants respectively, took majority stakes.

Those deals aren’t concluded, however, with negotiations ongoing between host counties and the prospective owners in an exclusivity period. It is understood that some want a reduction in investment cost, while others want further concessions.

Four of the eight prospective owners are also shareholders in the Indian Premier League. Oval Invincibles will have a Mumbai Indians relationship through the Ambani family, Southern Brave have a connection with Delhi Capitals through GMR Group, Manchester Originals will be in the same family as the Lucknow Super Giants and Northern Supercharges will be entirely owned by Sunrisers Hyderabad’s owners.

Those new owners could choose to seek sponsors aimed at the UK and European markets or pivot to Indian brands if, as they hope, the Hundred can build a substantial audience in Asia. The ECB declined to comment.",cityam
https://cityam.com,British Basketball Federation hands 15-year licence to Glickman,https://www.cityam.com/british-basketball-federation-hands-15-year-licence-to-glickman/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 08:40:58 GMT","British Basketball Federation hands 15-year licence to Glickman

The BBF has granted a 15-year licence to a US group led by Glickman, defying the SLB clubs

The British Basketball Federation (BBF) has defied Super League Basketball (SLB) clubs by signing a 15-year deal with Marshall Glickman’s GBB League Ltd (GBBL) to operate the men’s professional league from 2026.

SLB clubs warned last week that they would take legal action to block the sale of the licence, which they say is illegal. They claim they were deemed to be key stakeholders but not sufficiently consulted on the tender process.

BBF chair Chris Grant said: “We’re delighted to welcome GBBL to the British Basketball family. The award of this licence not only heralds the biggest ever level of financial investment into the league, it also brings the knowhow, connections and vision to excite those who already love the game and to attract new fans and participants.

“The GB women’s and men’s teams have both qualified for Fiba EuroBasket this summer, and our progress on the court will be boosted through the LA Olympic Cycle funding recently announced by UK Sport.

“To have booming professional leagues which enable our top players to compete in front of British fans, week in and week out, is just what we need in order to fulfil British Basketball’s huge potential.”

Who are Marshall Glickman and GBB League?

Glickman is the former acting CEO of Euroleague Basketball and one-time president of the NBA’s Portland Trail Blazers. GBBL also includes partners Chris Dillavou, former COO of the Greg Norman Companies, and Arjun Metre, former investment director in sports, media and entertainment for Intel Capital.

“We are fully committed to uplifting the popularity of basketball in Great Britain,” said Glickman. “We are especially focused on making our league attractive to homegrown players, both in terms of economics and development. We want to see our players lead the GB national team to the 2028 LA Olympics.

“It is also essential that we use the league as a platform to celebrate British culture – we believe in the fusion of sports with music, fashion, wellness and equality. We believe basketball is a next generation experience that we will embrace in a variety of ways – both physically and digitally.”

The BBF said there could be scope for the clubs, who formed SLB last summer following the dissolution of the British Basketball League, to continue running the men’s top division next season as an interim measure.

How has SLB and its clubs responded to BBF?

However, in response – and amid simmering animosity – the SLB said it planned to continue regardless of GBBL acquiring the licence, raising the prospect of two rival leagues.

“The new league operator proposed by the British Basketball Federation has no clubs, fans, arenas or expertise to build the infrastructure and future that British basketball and its communities deserve,” a spokesperson said.

“Super League Basketball (SLB) has been clear from the outset that the tender process undertaken by the British Basketball Federation (BBF) was illegal and unjust.

“SLB would like to make clear that it does not legally require a BBF license to continue to operate the professional basketball league in Britain.

“SLB clubs and their owners have worked tirelessly and invested well over £15m this season alone to create a sustainable future for professional basketball in Britain, its fans and the communities it serves.

“All nine partner clubs are united in the vision to continue operating a stable and viable league for the 2025-26 SLB season and beyond.”

BBF eyes new teams in Liverpool and Edinburgh

“In a defining moment for the sport, the deal will see the greatest ever direct investment of funds into the professional league, with an upfront commitment of £15m to support operations and growth activities in the first two years,” said the BBF.

“The agreement will align the men’s professional league, its clubs and GB academy structures to provide a radical boost in the development of talented British players and will bring the excitement of high-quality basketball competitions to fans across England, Scotland and Wales.

“Following an open tender process, a majority-independent panel of experts assessed GBBL’s credentials, plans and finances before the BBF Board accepted their recommendation to enter an exclusive negotiating period.

“The successful conclusion of those negotiations means that the new operator will prepare to take control of the premier men’s professional league from the start of the 2026/27 season (September 2026) bringing new expertise and capacity to the British game.

“SLB elected not to bid for the long-term licence to run the league and the BBF has now activated a clause in the interim licence agreement enabling it to be terminated at the end of the current season.

“Options under consideration for the management of a transitional 2025/26 season include another club-led arrangement. Meanwhile, GBBL will seek to engage with the current SLB owners as well as conducting a process to evaluate opportunities in population centres currently without a presence at the highest level such as Liverpool, Leeds, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Birmingham.”",cityam

The reason for departure is that he would like to focus on his companies, who have suffered a lot under his participation in the government.

But insiders say it has to do with conflicts between musk and other members of government, who describe him as unpredictable and unmanageable.

US President Donald Trump has said against confidants, including members of his cabinet, that Elon Musk will play his current role in the government in the coming weeks. That writes news site Polito based on anonymous sources.

The president is happy with Musk and the results he has achieved with Doge, but both men have decided in recent days that it is time for Musk to return to his companies, who have suffered a lot under his participation in the government, and to play a more supporting role, according to the sources.

Since Trump's appointment, Musk has been working as a kind of cutback of the new government. He has deleted many government organizations and projects in recent months with the aim of a more efficient government. As a result, many officials already lost their jobs and more redundancies may follow.

According to the proponents of Musk and Doge within Trump's government, the time is on for Musk because he ""can only cut so much on government agencies without putting the knife too close to the bones.""

But opponents tell politico that he is leaving because he is unpredictable and unmanageable. Musk would be constantly in conflict with other government members and with the Chief of Staff of the White House Susie Wiles, because he regularly shares plans and ideas for Doge on X, who have not yet received official approval.

Trump alluded to departure

This week Trump seemed to be somewhat prepared for the departure of Musk. During a cabinet meeting, he announced that Musk would leave the government in the short term to better concentrate on his companies.

Immediately after he shared the news, Trump invited reporters for the last part of the meeting, where he addressed Musk full of praise.

""Elon, I want to thank you - I know you have experienced a lot,"" said Trump, with whom he referred to the vandalism with which Musk's Tesla has had to deal with in recent weeks. Trump also called him ""a patriot"" and ""a friend of mine"".

Both men subsequently publicly on a transition. In an interview with Fox News, Musk said that his mission was completed: ""I think we have done the most work that is needed to reduce the budget deficit with 1 trillion dollar.""

The White House reacted annoyed to the message from the news site. ""This 'scoop' is sewer journalism,"" wrote spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on X, the message service of Musk. ""Elon Musk and President Trump both openly stated that Elon will resign as a special government officer once his incredible work is completed at Doge.

After the announcement of the news, the Tesla share increased by more than 5 percent in value at the New York stock exchange.",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,"A Brit that fought for Ukraine, saw 3 types of war volunteers",https://www.businessinsider.nl/een-brit-die-vocht-voor-oekraine-zag-3-soorten-oorlogsvrijwilligers/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 10:24:07 GMT","The Brit Macer Gifford is a former stock market trader who fought as an international volunteer for the Ukrainian army.

He tells Business Insider what he found good and bad about the forces who voluntarily came to Ukraine.

According to Gifford, these fighters are generally to be praised, but there were a few ""crazy"" in between.

Also read: Ukraine probably needs a heavily armed peace force with a clear mandate to survive.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, thousands of people around the world reacted to President Volodymyr Zensky's passionate call to help defend his country. Ukraine welcomed a large group of foreign volunteers, from people without combat experience to experienced fighters.

Macer Gifford, the Nom de Guerre of former currency trader Harry Rowe, joined the Ukrainian army in 2022 and became one of the most famous war volunteers. The Brit spent two years at the front. He tells Business Insider about the chaotic first inflow of volunteers and the bad and good sides of this international group.

Thousands of foreign volunteers to Ukraine

Estimations of the number of international volunteers who signed up to fight for Ukraine range from 4,000 to 20,000.

""There was a lot of energy, goodwill and passion from the international community,"" says Gifford, who initially helped with help and training, but felt forced to fight with the Russian troops in Bucha.

He says that the military infrastructure of Ukraine was not ready for a large influx of volunteers and that the training and organization was initially bad.

It even seemed that the Ukrainian organization would collapse under the large influx, while it was still busy training its own troops.

But in the end, Gifford adds, Ukraine was able to effectively include the volunteers in their force.

The 'gems' that showed up - and stayed

Volunteers with a variety of experience and motives to participate came from all layers of the population.

""You saw very capable people with fantastic skills who were eager to share their knowledge,"" says Gifford.

According to him, for example, there were people who were submitted in the field of war medicine or were already familiar with Western weapon systems, the deliveries of which just started at the time.

Gifford mentions those who remained, were humble and won the trust of the Ukrainians with respect for the language and culture, the ""real gems"". They soon showed themselves very useful in the fight, says Gifford.

The 'passionate' types

There were also volunteers without any experience.

Gifford calls them ""the passionate"", those who heard Zensky's desperate call at the start of the conflict and were touched by it, motivated by politics and ideology.

He has no criticism of people who showed up inexperienced but full of enthusiasm. That's how he started. In 2015 he fought together with the Syrian Democratic forces against ISIS, initially without any experience.

According to Gifford, it is about whether people can adapt and how they deal with themselves. ""You are not a hero if you only show up,"" he says. ""You are a hero for what you do.""

The 'wrong' types

There are also ""horror stories"" about international volunteers, according to Gifford. The international legion of Ukraine, which was founded early to deliver the fighters that Zenskyy asked for, received a very bad reputation.

Gifford says he would rather work with Ukrainians. According to him, there are also ""very dangerous people"" in between, ""but they are rare"".

Some people were in ""the first place looking for satisfaction"" in Ukraine, he says. ""But to be honest, many should not have been there at all.""

He thinks they might fling something in their home country, for example an addiction to drinks or drugs. ""They saw the war in Ukraine as an opportunity to prove themselves,"" said Gifford.

At the start of the war, volunteers would also have accidentally passed on the location of a training location, which was subsequently attacked by Russian troops.

According to Gifford, the worst kind of volunteer is the volunteer who shows up and thinks he knows everything immediately.

People like this ""thinks two broadcasts to Afghanistan or Iraq means they can play the boss about people in Ukraine,"" he says. While the conflict in Ukraine differs enormously from everything that even the most experienced fighters have experienced.

Wandering 'winds'

Another type of foreigner that pops up at the front in Ukraine is what Gifford calls ""the bladder jaw""

According to him, a bladder jaw is someone who has put himself entirely in a Ukrainian uniform, but who is often not part of a unity and who is not even in the Ukrainian army.

""They wander around and sit in coffee kicks in cities such as LVIV and Odesa, which are completely safe and are outside the radius of a thousand kilometers of the Ukrainian front line,"" says Gifford.

Gratitude from Ukraine

Gifford does not like to talk about the negative sides of the international voluntary participation in the war, for fear of shaving everyone together.

According to him, there are many who went to Ukraine and have worked hard to prove themselves, for which Ukrainian citizens are unmistakably grateful.

""Ordinary Ukrainians just like it that they are not alone and that there are people who are willing to risk their lives,"" says Gifford, who was offered drinks and meals from the population.

He says that the international volunteers generally went to Ukraine to support the country in times of need. ""I see them as a 'band of brothers', with a few crazy people in between,"" concludes Gifford.",businessinsider

BYD has tormented its rival this year so far, with a rising sale and turnover while Tesla is stagnating.

Business Insider has converted the most important figures into five well -arranged graphs, so that you can see how the two companies are doing.

Read also: Sell Tesla Dalen in the first quarter of 2025 stronger than expected, with minus of 13%

The Chinese electric automaker byd keeps tsla but torment.

The company recorded a sales record in 2024, while Tesla sees its turnover sinking worldwide, the stock price and the company has to contend with the public opposition to the work of CEO Elon Musk for Doge.

Now that BYD and Tesla are fighting each other, these five graphs provide insight into how the two companies relate to each other.

Tesla and BYD are engaged in a neck-on-neck sales race of electric cars

As the graph shows, the total car sales of BYD surpassed that of Tesla last year.

The electric car giant supported by Warren Buffett sold 4,272,000 vehicles in 2024, while Tesla sold 'only' 1,789,200.

The snag is that BYD, unlike Tesla, sells both hybrids and electric cars. The Chinese company sold 1,764,992 electric cars in 2024, which means that the Tesla has not been pushing off the throne so far.

Tesla will have to fight this year to maintain his status as the world's largest manufacturer of electric cars, because the sale has plummeted worldwide in the first few months of this year.

Byd's profit surpassed that of Tesla in 2024

BYD reported a huge profit for 2024, whereby the income for the first time since 2018 caught up with Tesla.

The Chinese Automaker reported an annual turnover of $ 777 billion ($ 107 billion) in 2024, an increase of almost 30 percent compared to the previous year.

With that, BYD left the annual turnover of Tesla before 2024, which was 97.7 billion dollars.

Tesla surpasses BYD when it comes to a profit

The profit of BYD increased in 2024. The car maker shared the net profit of 2024 last Monday, which rose by 34 percent on an annual basis to just over 40 billion Yuan ($ 5.55 billion).

This way the company is still lagging behind Tesla, which in 2024 booked a net profit of $ 7.1 billion.

Both for Tesla and BYD, 80 percent of sales come from the sale of cars

One thing that distinguishes Tesla and BYD from traditional car manufacturers is that they both make much more than just cars.

The two companies have both extra earnings. For example, last year Tesla earned 21 percent of its turnover through the energy generation and service companies that own it.

In addition to the sale of battery systems, Tesla also sells loans to competitors who have failed to sell enough electric cars to meet the government quota.

In the meantime, BYD has also found a lucrative secondary activity: the assembly of parts for smartphones, including the Apple iPhone.

The Chinese company, which once started making telephone batteries, says that one fifth of the turnover in 2024 comes from ""parts for mobile phones, assemblage service and other products"".

BYD's share recently made up Tesla

The decrease in Tesla's share price Since the beginning of the year there is one for the history books.

Concerns for investors about the work of Musk at Doge and the falling sales figure have the share of the automaker this year plummeted by 30 percent.

The shares of BYD, on the other hand, rose in 2025 and reached a record high in March after BYD announced new fast chargers with which an electric car can be charged in five minutes.",businessinsider

The bid comes just before the sales theadline for Bytedance, the Chinese parent company of Tiktok of 5 April.

Bytedance does not sell the American branch of Tiktok, then a ban on the video app in the United States will follow.

Read also: At least 4 parties are interested in Tiktok's takeover, according to Donald Trump

Tech giant Amazon has made a bid on Tiktok. The New York Times reports this on the basis of initiates. According to the American newspaper, Amazon wants to take over the social media platform in its entirety. How much money is involved in the bid is not clear.

Amazon already has ties with tap. The Video app has become an important sales platform for Amazon, because influencers recommend and sell products from the e-commerce giant to viewers.

Although the app has its own e-commercial tool, known as Tiktok Shop, many influencers follow followers still to buy products via Amazon, for which they receive compensation per transaction.

The Amazon bid comes just before an important deadline for Bytedance, the Chinese parent company of Tiktok. The company has been given time until 5 April to sell the American activities, otherwise a ban on the video app in the United States will follow.

Last year, the American congress adopted a law to ban Tiktok in the US, with the support of both Democrats and Republicans. They fear that national security is at stake, because Tiktok is in Chinese hands and at the same time process data from around 170 million Americans.

Whether Tiktok actually comes into the hands of Amazon is waiting for The New York Times. Various parties involved in the discussions do not seem to take the offer of Amazon seriously, since initiates also told the newspaper.

Amazon's bid in question is said to have arrived by a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Minister of Trade Howard Lutnick. Amazon refused to comment against the newspaper and Tiktok was also not immediately available for a response.

US President Donald Trump recently said that he was expecting a deal around Tiktok this week. He also said that there were several potential buyers. ""There is enormous interest in Tiktok,"" he emphasized. Trump has also said to consider moving the deadline if an agreement is not forthcoming.

Tiktok and Bytedance themselves still indicate that the American branch of the company is not for sale, partly because the Chinese government, according to the company, would block a deal.

Hooftstraat was resigned, because clients complained to his employer that he smelled ""not fresh"".

The security company has addressed him several times.

The Court of Appeal ruled on appeal that the dismissal was justified, but the man will receive an extra reimbursement of 5,000 euros.

Also read: Employee who refused to pack ""dirty"" citrus skillers, wrongly fired: he gets more than € 7,500

A security guard of luxury stores, including branches in the P.C. Hooftstraat in Amsterdam, on appeal, received an additional 5,000 euros from the court. The man was fired because clients from the security company where he worked complained that he smelled ""not fresh"" and did not have the build to ""put drunken guests out"".

This is apparent from a decision by the Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal that was done at the beginning of March and published on 31 March. In the first instance, the case came for the subdistrict court judge of the Central Netherlands District Court in Amersfoort. The employment contract between the employee and the security company was dissolved and a transition payment of 9,458.83 euros was assigned to the man.

The security guard appealed, demanding the recovery of the employment contract and 55,000 euros in reimbursement. The Court of Appeal does not agree with that, but states that he is entitled to 5,000 euros on top of the transition payment, because the employer had not offered him a considerable improvement process.

Since 3 April 2016, the security guard was employed by Risk Security, which provides security staff for shops, catering establishments and events. He stood at Watcheboutique Tourbillon in the P.C. Hooftstraat in Amsterdam, until the management of that store changed in 2021 and the security guard was no longer welcome in the long run.

Then it went downhill. Risk used him at other locations, including the luxury jewelers Tiffany & Co. and Cartier in the P.C. Hooftstraat and Boutiquehotel The Hoxton and Heineken Experience, all in the capital. Eventually he ended up with the pharmaceutical company Kite Pharma in Hoofddorp.

'Not fresh, not clean and not impressive enough'

All these clients indicated Risk that they were not satisfied with the security guard. He would ""not smell fresh"", his clothing was ""not clean"" and he would ""not be friendly"". Moreover, he would make a ""uncertain impression"". According to Hotel The Hoxton, he ""had"" no impressive appearance, making him less suitable for putting drunken guests outside "".

Kite Pharma's complaint in Hoofddorp was of a completely different order. The pharmaceuticalist said he was dissatisfied in July 2023, partly because the security guard refused to provide his personal data, which led to an impasse in the workplace.

Since July 2023 the security guard was no longer working. On October 1, 2023, a non -legally valid cancellation of the employment contract from Risk followed and on 27 March 2024 the security guard reported sick. According to Risk, a relatively small security company that has to make it more often against larger competitors during tenders, there were no more clients who wanted to work with the security guard.

The security guard does not dispute the complaints of the clients, but states that he could still have been used at events. However, according to Risk, this work is not suitable for him, because for medical reasons he is not allowed to work until after midnight, while events often last until the small hours.

According to Risk, the complaints from clients were discussed with the security guard in 2021, 2022 and 2023. He was told that he had to take more care of his representativeness and personal hygiene, that he had to come on time and that he should have a friendlier appearance.

Warning is not yet an improvement process

Also Risk managers would have repeatedly pointed out that he could lose his job if the satisfaction of clients did not improve. According to the security guard, however, this is not yet an improvement process and the court agrees.

The Court believes that Risk could have been expected more than only to point out his inadequate functioning. During the session, various options were discussed, such as a coaching process, additional training sessions or a mentor that cooperates with the security guard and evaluates him.

The Court's conclusion is that although the security guard is unsuitable for the job, he was not offered a serious improvement process from Risk at the same time. For that reason, the security guard receives 5,000 euros in reimbursement.

In this judgment, the court has not taken into account that he already receives a transition payment of around 10,000 euros and that Risk has continued a year of wage, while the security guard was not working. ""That is simply the risk that Risk will bear as an employer,"" said the Court.

The security company, which built up a substantial tax liability during the coron chase and integrates on the reserves, because it has not made a profit in the past two years, is also aware of the costs of both the first instance at the subdistrict court and the appeal.",businessinsider

At the same time, the automotive industry is struggling with substantial overcapacity and imminent mass layoffs.

By converting car factories partly into military production centers, two problems can be tackled at the same time, according to analysts from Deutsche Bank.

Read also: German car manufacturers are missing € 3 billion from Trump import duties

Germany is on the eve of an unprecedented military redemiation. The reason is the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the growing tensions within NATO.

At the same time, the country is looking for ways to offer the struggling car industry a new perspective. It is struggling with declining production, closures of factories and tens of thousands of jobs that are at the trip.

By using knowledge, personnel and production lines from the car industry for military purposes, two birds can be made in one fell swoop, according to a report published this week by analysts from Deutsche Bank.

Germany is going to spend a lot more on Defense

Now that geopolitical pressure is increasing and the dependence on the United States is under fire, Germany has taken a historic step: the country is relaxing the so -called debt brake of the government to structurally increase military expenditure.

Extra defense spending now falls outside the strict budget rules. This allows a new cabinet in Germany to spend up to 3.5 percent of the national income in defense. That amounts to more than 170 billion euros extra in the next three years, according to the analysts of Deutsche Bank.

At the same time, the German car industry is deeply in trouble. Since peak production in 2017, the number of vehicles produced has fallen by almost a third. Factories of Ford, Volkswagen and other brands sometimes run at less than 30 percent of their capacity.

The new import duties of US President Trump on foreign cars also also help. In total there are around 100,000 jobs on the nevertheless in the German car industry, with an expected restructuring burden of 10 billion euros.

However, that pain also offers opportunities, the analysts of Deutsche Bank say. Staff and production lines from the automotive industry can be used relatively quickly for the production of defense equipment. Companies such as Continental, Schaeffler and even VW are already in conversation with defense companies such as Rheinmetall and Hensoldt about staff exchange or cooperation.

Make German tanks instead of SUVs?

The need for new weapon systems is huge. Since 2004, Germany has cut substantial cuts on the production of tanks, armored vehicles, Houwitsers and combat aircraft. The recovery of those stocks alone requires the construction of thousands of units - a process that, according to the Kiel Institute, will take ten to fifteen years.

By redesigning empty or under -occupied car factories, that pace can go up. Repurposing offers a faster road to scaling up and the car industry has an adult production culture: just-in-time logistics, tight process control and experience with series work.

Yet the proposed transition is not without bumps. Trading staff takes time and factories often have to be fully redesigned. Moreover, employees are not always willing to move to a defense location. The analysts of Deutsche Bank therefore argue for more flexible labor legislation, faster safety screening and temporary transition companies that guide employees to a new sector.

Although Germany is aiming for more autonomy, the American defense industry will continue to play a leading role on the world stage for years. There are no fully -fledged European alternatives for complex weapon systems such as stealth jets and rockets.

Nevertheless, American companies are trying to locate their production more and more often: Northrop Grumman works together with Rheinmetall on F-35 parts, while Lockheed Martin is preparing a German Himars project.",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,Why the insurance of an electric car is more expensive,https://www.businessinsider.nl/waarom-de-autoverzekering-duurder-is-voor-een-elektrisch-wagen-gewicht-speelt-een-rol/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:05:57 GMT","Insuring an electric car is in all cases more expensive than insuring a comparable petrol car.

This is according to figures from price comparator Pricewise that Business Insider Nederland requested.

It is remarkable that the higher prices are easy to justify, whereby weight also plays a role.

Also read: Are the costs of an electric car really higher compared to a petrol car? The difference in expected residual value can be absorbed

Insuring a car has become an increasingly expensive joke in recent years. Premies rise faster, in particular because damage is becoming more and more expensive to repair.

In part, all mandatory driving assistance systems are the culprit, which are not only more expensive to repair, they also ensure that cars are more expensive at all. That drives up the insurance amount.

With the transition to electric driving it is striking that there seems to be a co -reducing factor: the powertrain. Electric cars are always more expensive to insure than comparable gasoline cars. This is evident from data from PriceWise.nl that requested Business Insider Nederland.

The price comparator looked at a number of cars to be compared on request to see what the price differences actually are. This made an attempt to compare as many apples as possible with apples and not the rabbining in comparing the most popular cars in every segment.

In that case, for example, we would compare the Tesla Model Y, last year's most popular electric car, with the Kia Niro, the most popular petrol car of the same period. That would result in a crooked comparison, since they are two considerably different cars, regardless of them in the same segment.

Two models, one electric car and one petrol car, per segment was chosen to get the widest possible image. View information below of the cars that are compared for the insurance.

For the insurance of these cars, the cheapest provider that came up in the price comparator of PriceWise.nl was assumed. In addition, they were all requested by a fictional person born on January 1, 1980, has 10 claim -free years, runs 15,000 to 20,000 kilometers per year, lives in Amsterdam and accepts a maximum deductible of 500 euros.

That provides the following picture with the costs of car insurance, where three variants were taken: WA, WA+ and AllRisk. View premiums per car and the percentual difference between the gasoline car and the electric model below.

What is striking is that in all cases it is more expensive to insure the electric variant. The difference also becomes marginal as the coverage improves.

Price differences Car insurance for electric and gasoline can be explained

According to PriceWise, the price differences can easily be explained. As stated earlier, repairs of modern cars are becoming more and more expensive. This applies even more to electric cars because those more expensive parts contain, with the battery pack as the most important example. They also usually have more advanced electronics and specialist knowledge is needed for repairs.

Another logical cause of the higher premiums for electric cars is the higher purchase value. This is simply passed on in the premium, in particular that of all -risk coverage.

Then there are two more factors that make the premium of an electric car higher: performance and weight. In the first instance you would think that these factors are not necessarily connected to an electric cars, but in practice insurers see more risks with the performance and weight of electric cars.

The first performance factor is reasonably understood. Electric cars usually have more power and attract faster, which the insurer labeled as riskyer. A higher risk of an accident means a higher premium.

You probably didn't see that second, the weight. The extra weight of an EV naturally stems from the fact that he is taking a heavy battery pack. Now it is not so much that the battery pack will drive up the premium, but the fact that insurers state that heavier cars cause more damage in an accident. That must be paid, so a heavier car is more expensive to insure.

The weight of the electric car is therefore not only an adverse side issue with the road tax, but also with the insurance.

Given the reasons for insurers to charge higher premiums for electric cars, it does not seem likely that the insurance costs will be drawn in the future, let alone come closer together.",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,'Lawyers can increase rates by using AI',https://www.businessinsider.nl/advocaten-kunnen-tarieven-opschroeven-door-ai-in-te-zetten/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 07:35:27 GMT","While law firms investigate how to use AI, there are also concerns about what this means for invoicable hours.

CEO Sean Fitzpatrick of Legal Database Lexis Nexis thinks more people can start invoicing per hour.

Artificial Intelligence gives lawyers ""an extra pair of eyes"" so that they can provide better service, the top man thinks.

Also read: AI provides an explosion of new online content: the fight for the time of the consumer becomes more intense than ever.

Law firms are currently looking for how they can use artificial intelligence to save time, but at the same time, lawyers fear the effect that the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have on their invoicable hours.

CEO Sean Fitzpatrick of Legal Database LexisNexis in North America, the United Kingdom and Ireland, is thinking a lot about this question. He supervises the teams that provide data products and insights to legal professionals at law firms, companies and government agencies. Last week, during a panel discussion on Legalweek, he tried to take away their worries. Fitzpatrick states that the addition of AI can lead to higher billable hours.

Invoicing rates at large offices are currently rising, driven by the continuous consolidation of law firms and the increased demand for legal top talent.

Fitzpatrick is convinced that lawyers who use artificial intelligence, from virtual legal assistants to chatbots, will offer their customers an even higher quality of service. They can then charge more.

During his panel discussion, Fitzpatrick gave a hypothetical example. ""Let's say that a lawyer does 10 hours of work for $ 750 per hour, and let's say it's a very simple matter. She is the only person working on it,"" he said. She then invoices the customer $ 7,500.

""Let's say she has almost exactly the same thing tomorrow, but tomorrow she has access to this new technology that helps her with her work. It offers her some extra perspectives and things she hadn't thought of before. That extra set of eyes.""

""So she is able to create more value for her customer,"" he continued. ""Yesterday she charged them $ 7,500. Now she has a better service than before. Maybe she can invoice 8,000 dollars. The work now also takes her less time. She can now take on more things and invoicing more"".

Use of AI in the legal profession

Earlier this year, LexisNexis introduced protégé, a system that uses so -called AI agents - or software that can perform tasks without much human help - to write concepts, make timelines of documents and enable users to search their company data. It is built on a patchwork of large -scale and refined models from OpenAi, Anthropic, Mistral, AWS and Microsoft, according to the company.

The dependence on the legal sector of invoicable hours may be disturbed. Legal experts, including lawyers and founders of legal-technological startups, shared during the Legalweek with Business Insider that law firms switch to fixed reimbursements instead of invoicable hours.

The idea is that artificial intelligence can handle simpler legal tasks, so that lawyers can use more brain power to solve more complex problems. Those lawyers may lose some of the invoicable hours they pass on to clients. But the value of their time is likely to increase - a conviction that is shared by Max Junestrand, founder and chief executive of Legora, one of the much -discussed software companies that make legal copilots.

He told Business Insider that customers will put pressure on their offices on how they use artificial intelligence to ""do more with the hours they have"". Law firms will apply fixed rates for the most important cases if ""both the use of [AI] increases and continues to improve the advancing of the tools"".

""The customers of lawyers always want cheaper service and better quality,"" said Junestrand. ""So law firms get a greater chance of offering them.""

A well -known analyst from consultancy firm Wedbush calculated on a fall in sales by 7 percent on an annual basis.

The controversial activities of CEO Elon Musk as a government advisor of Donald Trump seem to play a role in this.

Also read: Americans massively put their Tesla's for sale - announced worldwide protests against the brand.

In recent weeks, Elon Musk has pruned hard in the government spending of the United States with a series of solid cuts. However, the political activities of Musk seem to display negatively on sales at Tesla.

On Wednesday, the manufacturer of electric cars announced what happened to Tesla sales in the first quarter of this year.

In the first three months of the year, 336,681 vehicles were delivered, the lowest number since the second quarter of 2022. Sales in the Netherlands have also been under considerable pressure for a few months. Earlier this week it was announced that more than 60 percent fewer Tesla's were sold in March. In the first quarter of this year, sales halved to fewer than 3500 cars.

The Tesla share fell by 1.2 percent on Wednesday. Since the start of this year, Tesla has dropped at the fair with 34 percent.

Musk had previously promised a return to growth, after Tesla's annual deliveries had fallen last year. But his role as an adviser to Trump for cutbacks at the US government has caused dissatisfaction with some customers. Musk has also expressed support for the radical-right German party Department.

""The role that Musk plays at Doge [the Department of Government Efficiency, ed.] Has started to live a life of its own, because this has unfortunately become a political symbol worldwide,"" wrote Analyst Dan Ives van Wedbush Securities in a report prior to the publication of the sales figures. He pointed to protests, demonstrations at Tesla dealers and cars that are damaged.

A 'huge crisis moment' for Tesla

Ives expected Tesla to sell between 355,000 and 360,000 cars in the first quarter, a decrease of around 7 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. The actual decrease is therefore a lot bigger.

Only a few months ago, analysts expected more than 400,000 Tesla's sold in the first quarter of this year at Wall Street. The Doge-Impact is therefore quite felt at the company, Ives expects.

The current data suggests that Tesla's sales figures in Europe are under ""great pressure"", while there is a ""weak question"" to the vehicles in the US and China, says analyst Ives. ""Musk faces the big challenges to guide the company through this difficult period. But in bad times, better times usually follow.""

How strong is the Musk effect at Tesla?

Ives attributed the lower sales figures in his prognosis to various things that are not all related to the political actions of Musk. For example, consumers wait for a new version of the model Y and a cheaper new Tesla that will be released later this year.

However, the analyst stated in his report that anti-mosk sentiments and ""brand problems"" are also an ""important factor"" in the weak sales in the first quarter. In the estimate of Ives, the Musk effect contributes to about 30 percent to the drop in sales at Tesla.",businessinsider

This is apparent from an analysis by Rabobank.

It is about the wholesale and retail trade, the chemical industry, the rubber and plastic industry, the metal and metal products industry and the transport sector.

Also read: German car manufacturers for probably more than € 3 billion euros hit by Trump import duties

Certain sectors in the Netherlands are hit hard by the import duties on cars and car parts announced by US President Donald Trump.

Especially Dutch suppliers of car parts for the American market and companies that ship parts and raw materials to Germany, among others. This provides economists with Raboresearch.

The suppliers are, according to economists, the grand and retail trade, the chemical industry, the rubber and plastic industry, the metal and metal products industry and the transport sector. In addition, the German automotive sector, including Volkswagen and BMW, exports a lot to the US. As a result, Dutch sectors are both direct and indirectly vulnerable to the rates, according to the economists in their research.

The table below from the Rabobank report shows that indirect effects can be greater through Dutch exports to Germany than the consequences for direct car exports to the US.

American import duties on foreign cars and car parts of 25%

At the end of last month, Trump signed a decree in which he indicates 25 percent of US import rates on 3 April to import both foreign cars and car parts. The US has a considerable trade deficit in this sector compared to Mexico, Germany, Canada, Japan and South Korea. In 2023, the Netherlands delivered 570 million dollars to cars to the US.

Due to the levies, the Netherlands would miss 700 million euros in economic value this year and even 1.4 billion euros next year. This amounts to a 0.08 percent lower growth in the economy in 2025 and 0.07 percent lower growth in 2026, the economists of Rabobank calculate.

According to them, the permanent economic damage is slightly lower, 600 million euros. This is mainly because economies gradually adapt to the new situation.

The Netherlands is particularly indirectly affected by the worse-performing car industry of other countries, such as Germany. The economic damage in the Netherlands is lower than in many other countries, since the Netherlands has extensive car industry.

The US itself can prepare for considerable inflation. For example, some analysts expect the price of cars to rise by $ 3,500 to 12,000.",businessinsider

The appliances that most consume

Thus, it is interesting to remember the appliances that you consume the most to see if it is in our hand to try to use it less or selecting the most economical hours. It will be necessary to provide special to the washing machine, which in addition to trying to use it in cheap hours you can look for short washing or that it will be launched with not very hot water in order to increase savings. The dishwasher is another of the appliances that consume the most from the home, next to the hob plaque.

Why the price of light rises in 2025

During this year the increase in the electrical invoice is due, in addition to the price of each day, that since January VAT has returned to 21% after the end of the extraordinary measures taken to stop the energy crisis. In figures, this has meant an increase in customer invoices in the free market of almost 56 euros per year for an average profile (about 4.6 euros per month). In the regulated market, the tax increase would increase the receipt by about 74 euros, according to data calculated by Kelisto.

How to save on the light bill

The comparator emphasizes that adopting some habits can help in the reduction of the electrical invoice. One of them has to do with identifying the cheapest hours of the day. It can be saved by concentrating the use of the most energy intensive appliances (dishwasher, washing machine, air conditioning ...) in the cheapest schedules. We must also monitor the power we have hired.

Regarding the use of the appliances that consume the most, specifically washing machine or dishwasher, they insist from Kelisto that ""it is saved by choosing the programs that work at low temperatures (when heating the water is when they consume more)."" Regarding the fridge, it must be taken into account that about 5 degrees for the refrigerator and about -18 degrees for the freezer ""are enough."" If we can choose where to place this appliance you have to try to flee from heat sources. An advice to save when using the oven is to use its residual heat.

Another advice is to monitor the standby. ""The electronic devices that remain plugged in and waiting to consume unnecessary electrifice, since we are not using it,"" they indicate. We can also adjust the contracted power. Finally, it is an obvious advice, but we don't always do it: turn off the light when you don't need it.

The actions of the electric car manufacturer shot at Wall Street on Wednesday 5.3% at the close of the session, up to $ 282.7, recovering from the initial declines they recorded after the disaster of their car sales figures until March. The global image crisis that the automobile brand is experiencing is due to Elon Musk's behaviors in Donald Trump's rallies or their role as an executor of thousands of layoffs and spending cuts in the federal government, but also because it personifies the war of tariffs is going to launch the US against all countries with which it maintains commercial relations.

The reason for the climb is another although it is intimately related to the above. The president of the US Government, Donald Trump, has confessed to his close environment and cabinet members that Elon Musk will abandon in the ""next weeks"" as a special advisor to the presidency, according to Politico, at the head of the Doge department to focus on his companies such as Tesla, Spacex and also XAI, the artificial intelligence startup that ends up absorbing X (old twitter) valued at more than 33,000 million dollars.

Tesla car sales began to resent at the beginning of the year but their fall has accelerated at the end of March in full image crisis by its founder. Bad commercial behavior in China and Europe occurs in the midst of generalized growth in the electric car sector, with sales increases in its competitors such as Byd or Xiami. Specifically, Tesla deliveries in the first quarter were 336,700 electric vehicles, below the 390,000 forecasts that analysts expected.

A roller mountain in the stock market

Tesla's price lives a Russian mountain since Musk personally got involved in Trump's candidacy. From the end of October to December, the actions of the automobile group rose from $ 210 to $ 490 per title, that is, the company went from worth less than $ 700,000 million to 1.6 billion dollars in a matter of a month and a half. From there they began to fall to return to the exit box with a minimum in 220 dollars in March.

However, Tesla has bounced again about 30% in two weeks to its current level. The reason for the very high volatility of their actions is due to the increase in short operations or bassists on their actions. According to Nasdaq data until March 15, 3% of Tesla's capital had positioned itself on the value with bass bets valued at more than 20,000 million dollars, more than double at the start of 2025.

The operation of this type of financial instruments causes large stock market fluctuations. The 'Hedge Funds' that operate down sell the actions when they create the bearish position causing short -term price drops, although with the expectation that they continue to lower since their profitability depends on it. Upside down, if they decide to undo the investment they have to repurchase the shares, which also causes strong movements in the opposite direction.

On the eve of the publication of Tesla deliveries figures, Wall Street had anticipated a discouraging result. Analysts waited 390,300 deliveries, according to Bloomberg.

The total was 13% lower than the same period of 2024, and Tesla attributed the descent to the changes in the production lines for the new Model Y.

The figures offer the most complete vision to date of how Elon Musk's largest company is going at a time when the brand is the object of attacks and is in the spotlight.

Some Wall Street analysts had reduced their sales expectations and trimmed their price objectives for Tesla shares in the midst of several signs of decreased demand, including decreases in global deliveries, ongoing protests against the brand and an increase in second -hand teslas lists.

Tesla's shares, which closed with a rise greater than 3.5% on Tuesday, fell around 4% in operations prior to the day after the publication. The value has lost more than a third of its value this year, erasing the profits after the elections that led him to achieve a historical maximum in December.

Elon Musk is again the richest in the world: this is the historical figure that reaches its fortune

In recent weeks, there have been worrying signs for Tesla sales, since several countries have published a monthly figures separately that show a decrease in deliveries.

Tesla sales in Australia and Germany fell more than 70% in February. Other European countries, such as Norway, Denmark, Sweden and France, also registered an interannual decrease in sales in February.

Tesla's sales also recently decreased in China and the United States, two key markets for electric cars giant. In March, the car manufacturer sold about 79,000 electric vehicles in China, according to data from the sector published on Wednesday, 11.5% less than last year.

The sales figures of the first trimester of Tesla arrive in the midst of a growing boycott movement against Tesla, which asks the owners to get rid of their teslas and sell their shares. The movement is an answer to the political involvement of the CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, with the Government Efficiency Department (Doge) and its efforts to reduce the federal staff, cut costs and improve the general efficiency of the government.

As the protests have intensified, Tesla dealers and brand owners have become vandalism objectives, with some incidents related to caused fires and shots directed against buildings and vehicles of Tesla. President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi have promised to treat attacks on Tesla as domestic terrorism.

While some Tesla owners who have suffered negative reactions or harassment have declared Business Insider that their experiences have reinforced their support for the company and its leader, other owners have shared their plans to sell their electric vehicles for fear of reprisals and for the shame that they are associated with the controversial brand.

The Used Cars Market has also grown, with a 33% increase in Tesla lists used this year, according to Cox Automotive data. Tesla is not the only one: the ads of other electric cars have also increased by 27% so far this year. However, while some attribute this increase in aging of the range of cars, others believe that Musk's influence can be a factor.

Tesla bets on a ""return to growth""

Tesla, like other electric car manufacturers, faces growth slowing down throughout the sector.

The automobile giant registered its first interannual sales decrease in 2024, located just below the deliveries of the previous year.

Tesla is now trying to change the trend, affirming investors that he expects his vehicle business to ""grow again in 2025"".

Deliverial figures offer a snapshot of how Tesla advances towards their goal of overcoming deliveries of 1.79 million cars throughout the year 2024.

Tesla is preparing new products to help boost demand and quickly approaches a June self -imposed period for two important developments.

The electric cars giant has already said that he is on his way to start the production of a ""more affordable"" tesla in the first half of 2025. Tom Narayan, an RBC Market Capital analyst, told Business Insider that consumers can be waiting for a cheaper model before making a new purchase of Tesla.

The company also plans to launch its Robotaxi service in Texas in June, which would lay the foundations for the eventual launch of its totally autonomous cybercab that, according to the company, could begin to occur next year.

On the other hand, the Rivian company announced on Wednesday that it had delivered 8,640 vehicles in the first quarter, 36% less than the previous year.

The director of Technology of Rivian attributed the fall to a ""complicated demand environment"", partly due to the impact of the devastating forest fires in Los Angeles.

https://businessinsider.com,Amazon would have presented a last minute offer to buy Tiktok in the US,https://www.businessinsider.es/tecnologia/amazon-habria-presentado-oferta-ultima-hora-comprar-tiktok-eeuu-1452562,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 18:51:15 GMT","The case of the possible veto to Tiktok in the United States has not stopped turning in recent months.

After being approved by both the US Senate and Congress and having been signed by its previous president, Joe Biden, the prohibition of the Chinese social network in the North American territory was going to enter into force last January. In fact, there were a few hours when Tiktok was forced to cease his activity. However, Donald Trump reached the rescue.

The new US president managed to apply an extension to the veto of the platform with the intention that some company in his country bought the subsidiary from the Tiktok matrix, bytedance, but for now it has not been so. Meanwhile, Trump would have been using the threat of tariffs to China to unblock the sale of Tiktok.

The latest novelty in this regard would have arrived from Amazon. As reported by the New York Times, the company that was founded by Jeff Bezos would have made a last minute offer to try to control this popular application. At least, three people familiar with this situation would have corroborated.

As indicated by the American media, Tiktok faces a deadline, it would have until Saturday to modify its corporate structure in the United States.

According to the New York Times sources, several of the parties that have been involved in these conversations do not seem to be taking the Amazon offer, which would have arrived through a letter addressed to JD Vance, the US vice president, and Howard Lutnick, the Secretary of Commerce.

The proposal of the electronic commerce giant would highlight the last -minute maneuvers that would be carried out in Washington in relation to the ownership of Tiktok. And Trump himself would have planned to meet on Wednesday with senior White House officials to discuss the fate of the Chinese social network in his country.

Even so, it should be remembered that Amazon is not the only one who has postulated to buy Tiktok. Profiles such as the Co -founder of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, have shown their intention to take control of the platform, with the supposed objective of setting a ""new standard"" in the social networks business.

March closes with 21.35 million people affiliated with Social Security, according to the latest data published by the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration.

It is 161,491 affiliates more than in February, a figure higher than that experienced in the Maras prior to the pandemic. In total, 455,679 occupied more than a year ago, with an increase of 2.2%.

""The affiliation grows in all age groups, especially in those who had more difficulties: the oldest and the youngest. We are solving structural problems that distanced us from Europe,"" says the Minister of Inclusion, Social Security and Migrations, Elma Saiz.

Also unemployment falls in March. The number of unemployed persons registered in the offices of the State Public Employment Service (SEPE) descends in 13,311 people in relation to the previous month (-0.51%).

From the Ministry of Labor they clarify that in 2025, unlike the previous year, ""March still does not benefit from the effects of hiring in Holy Week and, on the contrary, it is weighed by adverse weather phenomena.""

With this data, the registered strike is located at 2.58 million people, below the level of 2.6 million people in unemployment.

""The number of unemployed and stops is at its lowest level in a month of March since 2008, 17 years ago,"" they explain from the Ministry of Labor and Social Economy.

Specifically, unemployment has been reduced by 146,865 people in the last 12 months, of which almost 79,000 are women, while the number of unemployed youth this month is in 197,524 people, the lowest in the series in a month of March.

Regarding March 2024, interannual strike descends in 146,865 people, which represents a reduction of 5.39%.

By sectors, unemployment falls into services in 14,461 people, with a reduction of 0.77%, in industry in 1,498 people, with a decrease of 0.75%, under construction in 909 (fall of 0.48%) and in agriculture in 93 people (drop of 0.11%).

Regarding the creation of employment, from the Ministry of Social Security they find that ""this month the historical maximum of women affiliated with Social Security is reached, with 10,117,058 average affiliates, which represents 47.4% of the total."" In the case of the general regime, women already represent 48.8% of the affiliates.

The rhythm of employment creation of Spain contrasts with the weakness of the labor market of the main European economies, such as Germany or France. In Spain, employment has grown 8.7% since the end of 2021 (before the entry into force of labor reform), compared to 1.6% of Germany and 1.9% of France. Only Italy is approaching, with an employment growth of 5.4%.

https://businessinsider.com,Insider Teach: What do you have to know before leaving your job?,https://www.businessinsider.es/insider-teach/insider-teach-tienes-saber-antes-dejar-trabajo-1451487,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 07:15:03 GMT","In Insider Teach, we offer you useful video content to progress in your professional and personal life.

It is likely that at some point you have considered leaving your job. However, there are a number of important issues that you should take into account before presenting voluntary decline.

Tania Delgado is a content creator. Share simplified notions of labor law with your followers and offer advice and training. He has founded the labor resources project and, through @recursos_Laborrales, contributes the best possible content every day putting all his love.

Throughout your professional career, it is possible that, at some point, you consider resigning.

Whether you are not at ease in your current job, because you look for an improvement of your working conditions or because you want to give your life a change, most likely you have to face this circumstance sooner or later.

However, a series of issues must be taken into consideration so that, when making this decision, the situation does not end up becoming against you.

Among the most used methods when leaving a job is the presentation of voluntary decline, but you have to know the consequences in advance:

If you decide to resign, you will not be entitled to compensation. Yes, you will have the right to liquidate the days worked on the current month, the proportional part of extraordinary payments and vacations pending to enjoy. You will not find yourself in legal unemployment. This means that, even if you meet the price requirements, the Public State Employment Service (SEPE) will repeal the application. In that sense, you will need to work again in another position for a few months and that the reason for the decline is the end of your contract to reach its maximum duration or a dismissal.

How should you communicate voluntary leave in your job?

To prevent them from being penalized, you must notify the aforementioned in your collective agreement or as reflected in your employment contract.

If in neither case nothing is specified, you must do it at least 15 days in advance. In addition, it is especially recommended to do it in writing.

You have to be aware that, if you do not fulfill the period of notice, they can discount you one day from your salary for each day of notice that you have not fulfilled. Even so, the penalty could be even greater, but in that case you will have to review what is specified in your contract or in your collective agreement.

Something that not so many people know is that you can retract once you have presented the voluntary leave. During the notice period, you can cancel your request for loss as long as this does not imply substantial damage to your employer, such as in the event that you have already hired another person to cover your position.

An alternative: voluntary leave

The only requirement that you must meet to be able to ask for an leave is to have an antiquity greater than the year.

With voluntary leaves your employment relationship does not extinguish, but is suspended. In addition, you will have preferential right to re -enter your job.

The consequences are the same as those of a voluntary decline: you will not be entitled to unemployment or compensation. On the other hand, if your collective agreement does not say otherwise, you will not have an obligation to give an notice (as it happens when resigning).

Analyst Jimmy Bhullar upgraded the reinsurance stock to overweight from neutral and lifted his price target by $5 to $237. Bhullar's refreshed target suggests shares can rally 19.5% above Tuesday's closing level. ""Our fundamental outlook for RGA has been upbeat, but we have been reluctant to recommend RGA shares due to concerns about optimistic EPS forecasts, bullish investor sentiment, and a full valuation,"" Bhullar wrote to clients. ""However, we feel that EPS projections are more reasonable."" Bhullar cited an individual life reinsurance transaction with primary insurer Equitable Holdings as a key driver of earnings per share projections becoming more rational. That transaction led Bhullar to increase estimates for earnings per share. He also noted that sentiment is less bullish and valuation is more attractive following a recent rough patch. Shares have struggled since early February, when the company gave what Bhullar described as a ""weak"" earnings report for the fourth quarter. Elsewhere, Bhullar said the Missouri-based company's business mix makes it more defensive than most life insurers in uncertain macro environments. Looking under the hood, the analyst said the company's work gives it minimal exposure to equity-sensitive businesses and a weaker tie to interest rates. Bhullar's call is an idiosyncratic move. JPMorgan downgraded life insurance stocks as a whole to neutral from positive, citing a more balanced risk-reward ratio as valuations recover and the macro environment weakens.

The U.S. on Wednesday reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Taiwan as China extended to a second day its large-scale military exercises off the coast of the democratically governed island.

""In the face of China's intimidation tactics and destabilizing behavior, the United States' enduring commitment to our allies and partner, including Taiwan, continues,"" Tammy Bruce, U.S. Department of State spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening stateside.

China's army, navy and rocket forces on Tuesday launched a joint exercise, with the military describing it as a ""stern warning"" against forces looking to undermine peace in the Taiwan Strait.

""China's aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region's security and the world's prosperity at risk,"" the State Department said, adding that the U.S. ""opposes unilateral changes to the status quo, including through force or coercion.""

Chinese military said it has been practicing assaults on maritime and ground targets and blockade exercises to test the joint operation capabilities of its troops.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on auto imports is expected to hit hard for car brands and countries around the world, with economists warning a small landlocked nation in Europe could feel the worst of the impact.

Trump is poised to unveil the details of his latest round of sweeping tariffs at around 9 p.m. London time (4 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. The measures, which are separate from Washington's levies on the global automotive sector, appear designed to rebalance the economic order in America's favor.

Trump has already announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, with charges on businesses importing vehicles coming into effect as of Thursday. The White House has said a tax for automobile parts is set to start in May.

The president's back-and-forth announcements on tariffs have alarmed global investors, corporate executives and U.S. trading partners in recent months. Germany slammed Trump's 25% auto tariffs as bad news for the U.S., the European Union and global trade.

Inga Fechner and Rico Luman, economists at Dutch bank ING, have said that, while Germany is most exposed to Trump's 25% auto tariffs in terms of value, it is Slovakia that may feel the biggest impact.

""Germany's car industry is in the eye of the storm and by far most exposed in terms of value, with major players like Volkswagen , BMW , Mercedes , and Porsche likely getting hit by tariffs,"" ING said in a research note published March 28.

https://cnbc.com,Judge dismisses criminal case against New York Mayor Eric Adams,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/eric-adams-case-dismissed-new-york-trump-doj.html,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","New York City Mayor Eric Adams leaves the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, U.S., February 19, 2025.

A judge on Wednesday dismissed the federal criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, nearly two months after the Trump administration controversially sought to drop corruption charges against the Democrat.

District Court Judge Dale Ho tossed out the case ""with prejudice,"" which permanently bars the Department of Justice from resurrecting the five-count indictment against Adams in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

In his order, Ho rejected DOJ's request to toss the case ""without prejudice,"" which would have allowed charges to be refiled against the mayor in the future.

""It is important to clarify that the Court's decision today is not about whether Mayor Adams is innocent or guilty,"" Ho wrote.

The DOJ argued the case should be dismissed without prejudice because prosecuting Adams would have interfered with his ability to govern the city and to his ability to cooperate with President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement policies.

Seven federal prosecutors — among them the acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney — quit in protest over the DOJ's demand that they file the dismissal request.

In a stunning rebuke to the DOJ's argument, Ho in his order wrote, ""Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions"" by Adams.

""Taking a step back from the particulars of this case, DOJ's immigration enforcement rationale is both unprecedented and breathtaking in its sweep,"" the judge wrote.

""DOJ cites no examples, and the Court is unable to find any, of the government dismissing charges against an elected official because doing so would enable the official to facilitate federal policy goals.""

Ho also wrote that the ""DOJ's assertion that it has 'virtually unreviewable' license to dismiss charges on this basis is disturbing in its breadth, implying that public officials may receive special dispensation if they are compliant with the incumbent administration's policy priorities.""

""That suggestion is fundamentally incompatible with the basic promise of equal justice under law,"" the judge wrote.

Ho said that dismissing the case without prejudice ""would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor's freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration.

He also said it would create the perception that Adams, who is seeking re-election this year, ""might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents.""

""That appearance is inevitable, and it counsels in favor of dismissal with prejudice,"" Ho wrote.

The DOJ's ""request, if granted, would leave Mayor Adams under the specter of reindictment at essentially any time, and for essentially any reason,"" Ho noted.

The judge noted that Adams requested a dismissal with prejudice, and that the DOJ had not opposed that motion, ""effectively waiving any objection to permanent dismissal of this case.""

Ho flatly rejected claims by the DOJ that the prosecution of Adams was tainted by ""appearances of impropriety,"" saying that was ""unsupported by any objective evidence.""

""Rather, the record before the Court indicates that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York prosecutors who worked on this case followed all appropriate Justice Department guidelines,"" Ho wrote.

""There is no evidence — zero — that they had any improper motives.""

But the judge said there were two reasons to dismiss the case: protecting the rights of a criminal defendant, and Ho's lack of power to compel the DOJ to prosecute Adams.

""This case should have never been brought and I did nothing wrong,"" Adams said at a news conference.

""I'm now happy that our city can finally close the book on this to focus,"" he said. ""I want to thank New Yorkers who stood by my side, who prayed for me, who supported me from day one, that stuck with me while we focused on the work at hand.""

The DOJ, in a statement to NBC News, said, ""This case was an example of political weaponization and a waste of resources.""

""We are focused on arresting and prosecuting terrorists while returning the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe,"" the DOJ said.

Adams, who is a former New York City police officer, was indicted in September on charges accusing him of a decade-long campaign contribution scheme, bribery and other allegations.

The indictment accused Adams of accepting illegal donations to his 2021 mayoral campaign and of accepting free luxury travel as far back as 2016, when he was the Brooklyn borough president.

Prosecutors said that a senior official in Turkey's diplomatic establishment facilitated campaign donations to Adams, and also arranged for his and companies to receive free or discounted travel on Turkey's national airline to destinations including France, China, Sri Lanka, India, Hungary and Turkey.

Adams in exchange, later pressured the New York City Fire Department to facilitate the opening of Turkey's new consulate building without a fire inspection in time for a visit by Turkey's president, the indictment alleges.

The case was filed by the DOJ when then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was still in the White House.

After being charged, Adams had curried favor with Trump in what was seen as a bid to have the case dismissed, or to receive a pardon from the Republican.

Former acting U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, who resigned in February rather than follow through with an order to dismiss the case, told Attorney General Pam Bondi in a letter that at Adams' lawyers at a meeting with her and top DOJ official Emil Bove ""urged what amounted to a quid pro quo"" in which the mayor would support Trump immigration enforcement efforts in exchange for dismissal of the case.

Adams' lawyer Spiro has denied Sassoon's allegation.",cnbc

https://cnbc.com,WATCH: Trump announces reciprocal tariff plans,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/trump-tariffs-live-updates.html,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Trump has said tariffs on pharmaceutical products imported into the U.S. were coming soon, but it is not clear if they will be announced at the White House event.

Those potential tariffs would likely drive up U.S. drug prices for patients because even if companies moved to produce those medications domestically, it would take years and cost more than producing medicines abroad, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note last week.

Predicting the potential impact of tariffs on pharmaceutical companies is difficult since they have vast and complex manufacturing networks with multiple steps, sometimes in different geographies, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a note.

But Scala said Eli Lilly , Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie appear better positioned than others to weather tariffs because they have more major manufacturing plants in the U.S. than internationally.

The majority of their sites responsible for producing the active ingredients in drugs are also in the U.S., he added.

Meanwhile, Novartis and Roche ""look more at risk"" because they have few U.S. plants and a higher share of active ingredient sites that are international, Scala said.

While the full policy is not yet known, Trump said it is intended to be ""reciprocal,"" and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said any levies should be going into effect immediately. Uncertainty around these taxes on trade partners has hampered the stock market. The S & P 500 has fallen more than 4% in 2025 and at points fell into a correction, which refers to a drop of at least 10% from a recent high.

""There is some idea that maybe we've priced in the peak of the uncertainty, although we don't know the long-term impacts the tariffs will have,"" cautioned Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. As we await more details on the tariffs, Jim Cramer said there is ""nothing wrong"" with investors simply sitting on their hands and avoiding what he called the ""bias to action."" 2. Jeffries analysts released a positive note on Club name TJX Companies . Analysts said the off-price retailer behind the TJ Maxx chain is well positioned for growth in an environment filled with surplus inventory. Analysts said during a recent store visit, they observed lots of luxury goods up for grabs in both the men's and women's sections. Consumers are always looking for great prices, according to analysts, hence why TJX Companies shares can work. ""When you're looking at Macy's closing so many stores, there's really only one place that it goes, and it's these guys,"" Jim said of TJX, which also operates the Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra chains. The ongoing struggles of department stores such as Kohl's has helped boost TJX's market share. On March 11, we added to our position in the company, scooping up 50 shares around $116 apiece. 3. Costco , another Club retailer, also was the subject of encouraging analyst commentary over at TD Cowen. Analysts at the firm met with CFO Gary Millerchip. While still elevated, analysts argued Costco's valuation makes for an attractive entry point for a top recession hedge idea. According to Cowen, some themes from the meeting include seeing more strength in the fresh category as consumers opt to cook at home. Another highlight was consistency in member behavior over the last six months despite consumer confidence being its lowest since 2022. 4 . Stocks covered in Wednesday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Tesla and Charles Schwab . (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long TJX, COST . See here for a full list of the stocks.)

When President Donald Trump made it clear that he was serious about implementing dramatic tariffs on top U.S. trading partners, Robin Liss knew her Suvie machines were in trouble. Suvie's products — kitchen gadgets that can whip up dinner in a matter of minutes — are built in a facility in one of China's largest manufacturing hubs and are comprised of more than 500 components sourced throughout the country. After running the financial models and tallying the costs associated with the new levies, Liss set off to Asia in March to search for an alternative business plan. ""I'm going to run out of appliances,"" Liss said, ahead of her two-week trip to Taiwan and Vietnam. ""I've got to figure this out."" Suvie is among the scores of gadget makers scrambling to stay afloat while managing through President Trump's tariff plans and the uncertainty that they bring. The day-to-day changes in rhetoric from the White House has created volatility on Wall Street, where tech stocks just wrapped up their worst quarter since 2022, and a sense of panic for smaller businesses that have less of a cushion to deal with the added costs of operations and potential supply chain bottlenecks. Trump slapped additional tariffs on China earlier this year and is now going much bigger, threatening to strain America's relationships with other longtime trading partners. On Wednesday afternoon, President Trump is expected to deliver remarks at a ""Make America Wealthy Again Event"" in the Rose Garden, and to announce reciprocal tariffs that follow a bevy of other import duties on goods from China, Canada and Mexico. Those three countries accounted for over $1.3 trillion, or about 40%, of total imports last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ""Folks who thought they had safely moved their supply chain out of China suddenly find themselves wondering if that was a great decision,"" said Peter Hanbury, a partner at consulting firm Bain. ""There's a lot of different options about where you could move things, but you don't want to make that decision if you don't know exactly where the tariff structure is going to land.""

Suvie's cooking appliance Suvie

Liss said her company, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is eating the costs — for now — rather than passing them on to customers. For Suvie, those costs aren't just tied to its appliances, which are about the size of a microwave but offer more than 10 different cooking modes. She also has to deal with higher food prices, as part of Suvie's business is selling meal kits starting at $11.49. Suvie delivers meals to customers weekly, but also has plans for users who prefer deliveries every two to four weeks.

Consumer losing buyer power

The problem for Suvie and other consumer-focused businesses is that just as their costs are skyrocketing due to tariffs and other inflationary pressures, Americans are losing their buying power. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged a ""moderation in consumer spending"" during the central bank's March policy meeting and said tariffs could put upward pressure on prices. Financial markets have also sold off in recent weeks in response to the uncertainty. A recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab estimates that tariffs could cost the average American household an additional $1,600 to $2,000 a year. Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in March that consumers could see imminent price increases on produce items such as strawberries and avocados. Liss launched Suvie in 2015 and began shipping products in 2019, a year after a Kickstarter campaign for a ""kitchen robot with multi-zone cooking and refrigeration."" The company has 20 U.S. employees and has avoided layoffs thus far, thanks to 80% growth last year that Liss said brought annual revenue to between $20 million and $30 million. If not for recent China tariffs, which hiked the levies she pays on goods to 23% from 3%, Liss said Suvie would be operating at a profit. Liss said that no matter what Trump announces on Wednesday, in what he's calling ""Liberation Day,"" the existing tariffs on goods from China have made it imperative that she find a new country for production. But where the company lands depends on what gets thrown into the mix. Wherever Suvie goes, the company estimates it can scale up within six months. ""That is incredibly fast and almost unheard of,"" Liss said. ""But if we don't pull it off, we might not have products for the holidays, which is our main sales season.""

For Austere founder Deena Ghazarian, tariffs on products from China as well as Mexico have put her business in peril. Austere, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, south of Portland, makes cable, cleaning, and surge-protected power products. The 12-person company, founded in 2018, previously moved about half of its operations to Taiwan and Vietnam from China and was in talks to shift production to Mexico. Those discussions stalled in November. Depending on the item, up to 50% of Ghazarian's components come from China. Half of her products are still made there, while the rest are manufactured in Taiwan and Vietnam. For her cleaning product solution, which is the most reliant on China, she estimates it would take over a year to move production to Thailand. Ghazarian began stockpiling products last year for the company to get ahead of potential tariffs. She says others have done the same. The inventory investment has diverted many resources she'd otherwise use for hiring, marketing and scaling. ""I'm buying time to figure out my next move,"" she said. ""If I keep having to spend this money to shift to get around it – at some point it's not going to have a return that's worth it financially."" The final step would be hiking prices for consumers, which Ghazarian said many partners she works with are already planning to implement later this week.

The whole electronic devices market is feeling the pain. The Consumer Technology Association estimated in January that new tariffs could hike laptop and tablet prices by as much as 68%, and boost smartphone prices by as much as 37%. Video game consoles could rise as much as 58%. Tariffs would reduce consumer spending power by $90 billion to $143 billion annually, it estimates. ""This is just devastating to the U.S. economy,"" said CTA CEO Gary Shapiro. ""It's tremendously inflationary."" Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary general and global head of policy at the International Chamber of Commerce, said that the cost implications from a 20% to 25% tariff could be severe enough to wipe out a company's entire operating margin, while also complicating it ability to operate abroad. ""There is a risk if retaliation takes hold in the global economy, that we see a severe worsening of the business environment for the tech sector, and for American firms,"" he said. The logistics of moving are unrealistic for many companies. Over the years, Chinese cities such Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Dongguan have established themselves as key manufacturing meccas for technology and electronics production.

Those markets have steadily accrued the best component supply base, labor expertise and cost structures, which are difficult to replicate elsewhere, said Terry Arbaugh, chief commercial officer at SEACOMP, which designs and manufactures electronics such as thermostats and video game devices for customers. The company operates facilities in China and Mexico. ""Talk of tariffs is sending more business outside of China, but in a lot of cases, it's also not coming into the U.S.,"" Arbaugh said. Many larger corporations have managed to pivot production to areas like Taiwan, Thailand and India over the years, but have also exhausted much of the existing supply in those smaller markets, Arbaugh said. And making lower cost consumer and medical electronics in volume in the U.S. is not a viable option for many businesses, he added. Suvie isn't considering onshoring its production at the moment, and is currently focused on finding an alternative spot in Asia. Liss has already booked a flight back to Taiwan in a couple weeks. From there, she'll hop around to other countries in the region for more answers. ""Maybe I'll book the next flight in the air,"" she said from the Detroit airport on the way home from her initial Asia trek. WATCH: Economists estimate how much revenue tariffs could bring in",cnbc

The S & P 500 has lost about 3.7% so far in 2025 as investors have been rattled over fickle and potentially draconian trade policy and the effect it could have on consumers and companies. Though Trump during his first term had used market performance as a yardstick for progress, he has seemed less preoccupied with Wall Street this time around. That could change with the president making his ""liberation day"" announcement on tariffs , said Lee, who is the firm's head of research. In his assessment, Lee set out six reasons why Trump will pay greater attention to stocks and push for a rally after the tariff announcement: To serve as a ""public validation"" of the tariff position To reverse downbeat approval rating, consumer and manufacturer surveys To avoid the inevitable recession that a market crash would trigger To create an environment ""to support the reshoring of manufacturing, underscoring the necessity for stable capital markets"" To attract more money to property, plants and equipment investment To get the U.S. credit rating back to top-tier ""The central question for investors is how does President Trump want the market to react"" to the tariff announcement, Lee wrote. ""Despite claims to the contrary, evidence strongly indicates Trump does care about stock market performance."" .SPX YTD line S & P 500 performance Stocks were trading higher and bond yields advanced ahead of the 4 p.m. tariff announcement in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. While moves have been volatile in both directions, the year has seen a tough slog for stocks but a rush to bonds. Treasury yields have tumbled since Trump's inauguration, meeting one benchmark the administration had staked out early, namely to lower borrowing costs. ""Investor perceptions of Trump differ significantly between bond and stock markets, possibly due to political affiliations within these groups. Notably, bond markets lean Republican, whereas stock markets — and even more intensely hedge funds — lean Democratic,"" Lee said. ""This division could explain the differential reactions to tariff-related news between these markets."" As stocks have slumped, the 10-year Treasury is around its lowest level since early December 2024.",cnbc

That was then.

With his dad, President Donald Trump, back in the White House, he sees a new money-making opportunity.

""It actually is what drove us toward cryptocurrency,"" the president's middle son told CNBC, referring to the Trump family's latest business endeavors. ""You realize that cryptocurrency was a lot faster, it was a lot more pragmatic, it was a lot more transparent, it was exponentially cheaper.""

In 2022, about two years after the end of President Trump's first term, two subsidiaries of the Trump Organization were convicted by a jury in New York of multiple crimes, including tax fraud, falsifying business records and conspiracy. The guilty verdicts on all 17 charged counts came three weeks after Trump declared his 2024 candidacy.

Last month, the Trump Organization sued Capital One in Florida over allegedly ""unjustifiably"" closing more than 300 of the company's bank accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. The lawsuit claimed Capitol One was acting on ""unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views.""

The news TKO Group's UFC has entered into a strategic partnership with Meta Platforms to enhance fan engagement through the tech giant's platforms, the mixed martial arts organization said Wednesday. A key part of the announcement: Meta will work with UFC to ""creatively use their groundbreaking [Meta Ray-Ban] AI glasses in compelling ways at UFC events,"" according to a press release. Additionally, Meta's text-based platform Threads will become UFC's official social media partner and feature exclusive original content — just a few months after Meta started testing ads on the site . UFC, which holds its fights in an octagon-shaped cage, says it has more than 700 million fans worldwide and more than 300 million social media followers. Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training during the Covid lockdown, is a longtime MMA fan. This announcement comes as Meta is readying what a Bloomberg News report described as a higher tier of Ray-Ban smart glasses with a built-in screen, which could launch by the end of this year. The price tag on these souped-up frames will be more than $1,000 and could sell for up to $1,400, the Bloomberg report said. Shares of Meta were lower by nearly 1% Wednesday. Big picture Zuckerberg has a long-term vision that smart glasses could be the next computing platform , much like the smartphone ushered in the mobile computing era. Both pieces of news — bringing the glasses to UFC and a premium version with a screen — reflect Zuckerberg's priorities. It also deepens Zuckerberg's ties to Dana White, the president and CEO of UFC who also is on Meta's board of directors. White, a friend of President Donald Trump , joined the Meta board a few weeks before Trump took office in January. Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses have gained consumer traction, but they're far from achieving mass adoption and being a driver of the company's overall growth. Meta has sold more than 2 million of their smart glasses — a collaboration with Ray-Ban's parent company EssilorLuxottica — since hitting the market in late 2023. The company doesn't report the profit or loss of the glasses, but the impact on revenue is likely minimal at this point. The Facebook and Instagram parent's strength remains in its core advertising business, where it generated 98% of its revenue in 2024. Still, the glasses already have a strategic benefit to the company's major bet on artificial intelligence. Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses integrate Meta AI, its AI chatbot, to respond to users in a natural way. The company has been spending billions of dollars on its AI ambitions, both to boost engagement on its apps and make them more appealing to advertisers through improved targeting capabilities. The smart glasses and the Meta AI chatbot, powered by its open-source Llama large language models, are also part of that strategy. Later this year, Meta is expected to release a new version of its Llama LLM that can power so-called AI agents, widely seen as the next phase of the technology. Fellow Club name Salesforce has bet big on AI agents, which can execute various tasks without human intervention. Meta has ""all the building blocks to emerge as a leading player in the AI agent era,"" analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note to clients Tuesday. As this shift continues in the years ahead, analysts are bullish on Meta emerging as a leading player in the space despite the competitive landscape. The firm has a buy-equivalent outperform rating on the stock and a price target of $790 a share. Bottom line Meta's efforts to push its smart glasses to wider audiences such as the UFC play a significant role in the company's broader ambitions to dominate the wearable tech market, particularly around virtual and augmented reality. Meta's smart glasses are a notable win for Meta's Reality Labs division, which is home to its VR and AR hardware and software pursuits, along with its metaverse initiatives more broadly. The UFC collaboration, given the popularity of that sport, could further help the adoption of an already popular consumer product. At the same time, the glasses are not yet meaningful revenue contributors, compared with its massive social media advertising business. They remain just a small part of our Meta investment case, which centers on the company's dominant ad business along with the successful monetization of its AI initiatives. That's what makes it the tech titan it is today, and it is why we're long-time holders of the stock. Of course, we would be thrilled if smart glasses were to become a needle-mover sooner than we expect and to see losses in its Reality Labs metaverse division narrow. We maintain our 2 rating on Meta stock, meaning we would wait to buy on a pullback, and reiterate our price target of $750 per share. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long META.

The stock tumbled a whopping 77.5%, following a 2,230% surge in Newsmax's first two days of trading after debuting on the New York Stock Exchange. At one point, the rally gave the company a market capitalization of nearly $30 billion, surpassing the market cap of legacy media companies such as Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox Corp .

Shares of conservative news channel Newsmax plunged more than 70% on Wednesday as its meteoric rise as a new public company proved to be short-lived.

Newsmax was listed on the New York Stock Exchange via a so-called Regulation A offering, instead of a traditional initial public offering. Such an offering allows small companies to raise capital without undergoing the full U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission registration process. The primary focus is to sell to retail investors. In this case, it was sold to approximately 30,000 retail investors.

The public offering indeed garnered the attention from retail traders, some of whom touted the stock as the ""New GME"" in online chatrooms. GME refers to the meme stock GameStop, which made Wall Street history in 2021 by its speculative trading boom.

Newsmax has a small ""float,"" or shares available for trading. Less than 6% of Newsmax shares, or 7.5 million shares out of a total of 128 million fully diluted shares, are available for public trading.

The conservative TV news outlet has seen its ratings rise with the election of President Donald Trump and other prominent Republicans, although it still falls behind the dominant Fox News. Overall, Newsmax ranks in the top 20 among cable network average viewership in both prime time and daytime, Nielsen said.",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,Advertisers look for flexibility as uncertainty around tariffs swirls,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/trump-tariffs-news-advertisers-look-for-flexibility.html,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Big brands that have in some cases sat out for years the TV advertising frenzy around the biggest US sporting event -- the Super Bowl -- are returning Sunday and spending big amid record ad prices. It's been a bumpy couple years marked by pandemic-era restraint and political polarization, but the American football championship offers an increasingly unequalled viewership too big to pass up.

Brands and advertisers are seeking flexible terms as they face uncertainty about how impending U.S. tariffs will affect their businesses.

The push for more lenient agreements, in which companies could pivot budgets quickly or shift their focus to different types of marketing depending on how the tariffs shake out, has been the focus of conversations between media companies and advertisers in recent weeks, according to people close to the discussions.

President Donald Trump will announce the details of the new tariffs on imported goods to the U.S. later on Wednesday. The scarcity of specifics in recent weeks, and sometimes contrasting messages coming from the White House, have fueled conversations about flexibility between chief marketing officers and media executives, the people said.

""In this period of uncertainty, we're seeing a significant shift toward more flexible, performance-based advertising models that allow brands to adjust spending quickly if conditions change,"" said Jonathan Gudai, CEO of Adomni, an artificial intelligence-powered programmatic video-everywhere advertising platform. Buying ads programmatically, or through digital platforms, has taken up an increasingly large part of ad spending, and using AI tools are now often part of the process.

Unsteadiness in the economy often mean companies pull back on spending for advertising and marketing. The potential hit to the ad market underscores the ripple effect of tariffs on companies that won't directly contend with heightened costs on products.

Tariffs aren't the only factor causing advertisers to rethink their budgets, said Kate Scott-Dawkins, global president of business intelligence of GroupM, WPP's media investment group.

""We were pretty bullish in our December forecast on [ad spending] growth for the U.S. I think we'll probably end up curbing that in the June forecast, based on the confluence of impacts,"" said Scott-Dawkins. ""From the rising inflation plus layoffs and unemployment plus the impact of tariffs. I think it'll be all those things together that lead to a reduction in our expectations for the year.""

GroupM forecast spending in the U.S. ad market to grow 7% in 2025, after totaling $379 billion in ad revenue in 2024, excluding political advertising, according to a recent report.

For media companies, the uncertainty also comes soon after they contended with tightened ad budgets during the height of the pandemic.

In some regards, advertising has stabilized for many media companies since the pandemic — especially for streaming platforms and those with live sports rights. But traditional TV networks still face lower advertising revenue as consumers shift away from the standard bundle of cable channels, and digital platforms and streaming gobble up a larger share of ad budgets.

Some advertising categories such as autos haven't rebounded, however, and companies are unsure what tariffs will mean for spending, the people said. Conversations with chief marketing officers at automakers have been frequent, they added. Trump has announced 25% tariffs on cars and some auto parts not made in the U.S.

The tariffs also come weeks before Upfront presentations, when media companies make their annual pitch to advertisers.

""Everything I hear about Upfronts and the state of overall trading in the ad world is that it's cautious,"" said Jonathan Miller, CEO of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investments. ""There's much more demands for flexibility, and while it's not recessionary, there's a slight holding back...meaning a couple of percentage points of overall growth. Enough that is felt.""

Gudai of Adomni added that traditional TV will be one of the areas most vulnerable to ad budget cuts, but brands will also have to broaden their focus when it comes to competing for customers who could face higher prices on goods.

""Tariffs potentially create a dual impact — increased costs that may squeeze advertising budgets, but also greater need for targeted advertising as brands compete on factors beyond price,"" Gudai said.

While media executives are open to offering flexibility, they've also been reminding brands that advertising during tough economic times can build brand awareness and help businesses long term, the people said.

Some brands are better served not cutting back on ad spending, too, especially if they don't have brick-and-mortar stores or ways outside of marketing to get in front of potential customers. Scott-Dawkins said for some companies it's still worth spending on TV ad spots since it's still considered the most effective way to reach consumers.

""When every dollar is under scrutiny, brands have to do more than just sell—they have to connect. Purpose-driven marketing isn't a 'nice to have' anymore; it's how brands earn trust and build lasting relationships,"" said Andre Banks, founder and CEO of NewWorld, a marketing and strategy consultancy. ""In uncertain times, consumers gravitate toward companies that stand for something real. Advertisers who recognize this will be the ones who don't just survive the downturn but come out stronger on the other side.""",cnbc

On Wednesday ahead of the announcement, stocks ticked higher, with all three major averages in positive territory in what has already been a volatile week. Those moves come as the market has seen recent declines. In fact, the S & P 500 has closed out five of the past six weeks in the red, as investor uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs and anxiety about the U.S. economy facing a recession plagued stocks. Against this market backdrop, CNBC Pro screened for S & P 500 companies that have significant revenue exposure to Canada. These names have the most to lose if a trade war forces them to raise prices in Canada. These stocks could also be in for pain if demand is reduced in Ottawa due to boycotts against the U.S. — or if an ensuing trade war tips the U.S.' northern neighbor into a recession. Here are the stocks that came up. Retail giant Costco is one of the top three names on the list, having almost 14% of revenue exposure to Canada. Shares have slid more than 8% over the past month, but they are up nearly 5% in 2025. In a recent earnings call with analysts, Costco CEO Ron Vachris said ""it is difficult to predict the impact of tariffs, but our team remains agile and our goal will be to minimize the impact of related cost increases to our members."" He also noted that around one-third of the company's U.S. sales are imported from other countries, with less than half of those being items that come from China, Mexico and Canada. Most analysts are optimistic on Costco over the next several months. Among the 40 analysts covering the stock, 25 have a strong buy or buy rating, according to LSEG, and the consensus price target implies about 11% upside. Analysts are also mostly bullish on Dayforce , which has the highest Canada revenue exposure on the list at more than 21%. Notably, 12 out of the 20 analysts covering the human resources software stock have a strong buy or buy rating, per LSEG. Consensus price targets call for nearly 34% upside. ""We … believe that product innovations like Managed Services, Dayforce Wallet, and Flex work are levers that should drive incremental long-term growth,"" said Siti Panigrahi, a Mizuho analyst, in February. The analyst, who rates the stock as outperform, added that management is focused on boosting the company's free cash flow margin. However, shares have considerably lagged the broader market this year. Compared to the S & P 500's year-to-date loss of almost 4%, shares of Dayforce have plummeted more than 18%.

Equities are off to a rocky start so far this year thanks to uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariffs and the economy. On Wednesday, the market fell ahead of the tariff rollout, expected in the afternoon, and then recovered. Trump has said the levies will be reciprocal and will ""start with all countries."" Stocks with consistent dividends are often thought of as ballast in market storms, since the income generated can help offset any declines in the share price. ""Dividends can help reduce volatility in a time of greater uncertainty and geopolitical risks,"" Morgan Stanley strategist Todd Castagno wrote in a note early last month. ""In periods of slow growth, dividends become more important and make up a larger percentage of investors' total returns."" Moreover, many of the stocks are underappreciated and ended the first quarter on Monday offering significant upside to analysts' price targets. To find the dividend-paying stocks that Wall Street believes will move higher, CNBC screened for those that both yield more than the S & P 500 's yield of 1.37%, and have at least 30% upside to the average price target, according to FactSet. They also are rated a buy from 60% or more of the analysts covering them. Broadcom is most loved by analysts, with nearly 70% rating it a buy, FactSet data shows. The semiconductor company has a 1.4% dividend yield, which it first began paying a year ago, and about 54% upside to the analysts' average price target. Last month, Broadcom handily beat earnings and revenue expectations in its fiscal first quarter. It also gave strong guidance for its second quarter ending April 30, with CEO Hock Tan saying Broadcom expects continued strength in artificial intelligence revenue. The stock is JPMorgan's top pick in semiconductors. ""Overall, the team continues to drive a stable revenue growth profile even in a period of macro volatility given its portfolio breadth/diversification/product cycles,"" analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note after Broadcom's earnings report. The stock is down almost 27% year to date. The highest current dividend yield in the cohort belongs to Host Hotels & Resorts , which pays 5.6%. Some 60% of analysts covering the stock rate it a buy and it has 38% upside to the average price target. The real estate investment trust's fourth-quarter results topped expectations in February. CEO Jim Risoleo told CNBC at the time that the Host Hotels & Resorts' consumer, who is affluent, is ""very healthy."" Host Hotels continues to see growth in what it calls ""out of room spend, ancillary revenues,"" which includes golf and spa services, the CEO said. ""Consumers are showing up at properties and they are spending money."" Shares have slipped more than 17% so far in 2025. Investors get a 3.2% dividend yield with Citigroup , which has 31% upside to the average price target. Some 65% of the analysts covering the money center rate it a buy. In January, Citi reported earnings and revenue in its fourth quarter that topped estimates. Citi also authorized a $20 billion stock buyback at the time, with $1.5 billion occurring coming in the first quarter. Led by CEO Jane Fraser, Citi is in the middle of a turnaround to reshape its business. ""We all want transformation to get done quickly, and we want it to get done right. That is why our expenses are temporarily elevated — to make the investments to get there,"" Fraser said during the earnings conference call. The stock is little changed so far this year, up about 1%, excluding the dividend. Lastly, Delta Air Lines, which yields 1.4%, has the most upside to the average price target, at about 84%. The stock has been hit, along with the rest of the airline industry, by concerns about weaker-than-expected travel demand . On Tuesday, Delta was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies, which cited a likely reduction in Delta's 2025 sales and earnings forecast. The airline is expected to report earnings next week.

The Trump administration, which has been trying to shepherd a deal to shift control of the Chinese-owned app to an American company, is ""fully aware"" of AppLovin's interest in TikTok, the sources said.

Faber said, based on his reporting, that it is unclear whether any of the U.S. parties interested in TikTok will be able to take control of the non-Chinese part of the company's business.

AppLovin shares briefly popped around 5% following the news, but have since given up most of those gains. AppLovin did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

TikTok could be effectively banned in the U.S. on April 5 because of a national security law originally signed by former President Joe Biden that requires Chinese parent ByteDance to divest the app's American operations. ByteDance originally faced a Jan. 19 deadline to sell TikTok, but Trump signed an executive order instructing the attorney general to not enforce the law, granting the company 75 more days to unload the U.S. portion of its business.",cnbc

Market update: The S & P 500 is trying to make it three straight days of initially opening lower only to finish the session in positive territory. This comes as the market debates if today's tariff announcements are already priced into stocks, even as we won't fully understand their impact for months. The market will gain some clarity later this afternoon when President Trump unveils his trade plan at a Rose Garden event at 4 p.m. ET. But the size and scope of the tariffs are still unclear, with recent reporting suggesting they could be anywhere from a 20% universal tariff on all imports, to reciprocal charges across different countries, to a more targeted plan. And will the announced tariffs be the maximum level, with room to go down? Or will the tariff aggression escalate from here? We'll get a better idea later, which is why at this point we've elected to sit on our hands and do nothing until more information is known. Amazon and TikTok? The New York Times reported that Amazon made a late bid to buy TikTok's U.S. operations. It's unclear how serious Amazon's chances are at winning this bid and there's still a possibility of ByteDance retaining control of TikTok. There are also other potential suitors involved. An Oracle -led group is trying to buy the platform, and CNBC's David Faber reported AppLovin is another bidder. TikTok's fate is anyone's best guess, but this would be a huge get for Amazon if it comes out on top. There are clear synergies for its e-commerce platform, which it could integrate with the social media platform and partner with content creators to sell more goods. TikTok would also provide a huge boost to Amazon's growing advertising business. Nice to have for Amazon, but we wouldn't buy the stock in anticipation of this deal working out. We have a 1 rating on Amazon because it is improving margins by driving efficiencies and reducing its cost to serve retail customers, plus the stock is on sale trading nearly 20% from its February highs. In other news, Amazon said it will send 27 Kuiper Satellites into space later this month. The goal of Project Kuiper is to increase access to high-speed internet around the world. Up next: We will keep a close eye on all the trade and tariff headlines expected to come out later. In addition to the news from the White House, we must be mindful of how other countries respond — and possibly retaliate. We should know more on that by Thursday morning. From an earnings perspective, the luxury home furnishing company RH reports after the closing bell, and food stocks Conagra and Lamb Weston report before the open on Thursday. On the data side, we'll see initial jobless claims, the final read on S & P Global US Services, and ISM services index. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

https://cnbc.com,Trump administration's appeal of a temporary restraining order preventing DOGE access to Social Security data is denied,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/trump-administration-loses-appeal-of-doge-social-security-restraining-order.html,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A person holds a sign during a protest against cuts made by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to the Social Security Administration, in White Plains, New York, U.S., March 22, 2025.

The Trump administration's appeal of a temporary restraining order blocking the so-called Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive personal Social Security Administration data has been dismissed.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit on Tuesday dismissed the government's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The case will proceed in the district court. A motion for a preliminary injunction will be filed later this week, according to national legal organization Democracy Forward.

The temporary restraining order was issued on March 20 by federal Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander and blocks DOGE and related agents and employees from accessing agency systems that contain personally identifiable information.

That includes information such as Social Security numbers, medical provider information and treatment records, employer and employee payment records, employee earnings, addresses, bank records, and tax information.

DOGE team members were also ordered to delete all nonanonymized personally identifiable information in their possession.

The plaintiffs include unions and retiree advocacy groups, namely the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Alliance for Retired Americans and the American Federation of Teachers.

""We are pleased the 4th Circuit agreed to let this important case continue in district court,"" Richard Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, said in a written statement. ""Every American retiree must be able to trust that the Social Security Administration will protect their most sensitive and personal data from unwarranted disclosure.""

The Trump administration's appeal ignored standard legal procedure, according to Democracy Forward. The administration's efforts to halt the enforcement of the temporary restraining order have also been denied.

""The president will continue to seek all legal remedies available to ensure the will of the American people is executed,"" Liz Huston, a White House spokesperson, said via email.",cnbc
